			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Travel: A sharp eye on the clouds - Kate Bevan visits Santa Barbara and its wine-producing hinterland Rain is usually welcome in the California desert. But not today. The clouds hanging over the Santa Ynez mountains north of Los Angeles posed a threat. For this was the day the Chardonnay grapes were to be picked at the Firestone winery. This offshoot of the tyre and rubber empire sits in stark countryside. The Santa Ynez Valley is home to more than 30 wineries, and the winemakers there claim that their grapes are so good that established wineries from the Napa Valley, north of San Francisco, buy their grapes from Santa Ynez. Once a thriving wine region, it was virtually killed off by prohibition. It did not pick up again until the 1970s when growers such as the Firestones moved into the valley. The hills and valley are graced by nothing more than scrubby dull green vegetation. But in spite of the harshness of the landscape the region is well suited to viticulture. At the Firestone winery, Hayley Firestone Jessup was keeping a sharp eye on the clouds. There had been a 'storm' - more like a shower to anyone used to regular rain - the night before and any more rain would seriously damage the crop. Earlier she had guided us through a tasting of some of the vineyard's produce: we sniffed as we swirled, pulled faces as the wine swilled over our palates and then religiously spat out the liquid before moving on to the next one. With our newly acquired knowledge we all looked sagely at the sky as we left and were relieved that the rain held off. The valley is less than an hour by road from Santa Barbara, an upmarket resort town 90 miles north of Los Angeles. Reaching Santa Barbara after the hot dusty drive up the coast from LA is like finding an oasis. The lush palm trees and intensely green grass running down to the Pacific are a sudden contrast after the uniform ochre and tan colours of the dull industrial towns such as Oxnard which sprawl alongside the coastal highway. Money has created the oasis here - Santa Barbara is a popular weekend getaway for city dwellers and the scent of money around the pools of the pricey hotels competes only with the scent of sun-tan oil and expensive perfume. The town has come a long way from its beginnings. Initially named by a monk aboard the ship of Sebastian Vizcaino, a Spanish explorer, when the coast was sighted on the feast of Santa Barbara on December 4 1602, it was founded  -like so many of California's towns - as a mission. The town now boasts attractive pseudo-Spanish architecture that is quite engaging until you realise that most of it is post-1925, when an earthquake devastated the town. One of the few buildings to survive the earthquake is the attractive mission, further up the hill, dedicated in 1820 and known as the 'Queen of the Missions', where visitors can take a tour of the restored church and outbuildings. Building since the earthquake has been strictly regulated and anything taller than a couple of storeys is likely to be pre-1920s. But at least there is uniformity in the ersatz style: red-tiled roofs and sunwashed buildings are always attractive, even if they do contain expensive boutiques and restaurants. Santa Barbara is also blessed with a wonderful beach, one of the few to run east-west in California as it is tucked into a corner of coastline. It would be easy to get hooked and spend the rest of your days loafing on the beach and drinking the local wines. But just as I was getting carried away with the fantasy, I noted the kind of people who could afford to live there - ex-president Ronald Reagan and pop star Michael Jackson have houses in Santa Barbara. Then I looked at my wallet - and headed back to reality. Kate Bevan travelled to California as a guest of Continental Airlines and Four Seasons/ Regent Hotels.

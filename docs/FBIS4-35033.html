			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Claudia Saavedra] </F>   [Excerpt] Ernesto Correa, president of the National Society  of Agriculture (SNA), considers that there will be no  appreciable benefits for the Chilean agricultural sector from a  potential trade agreement with the United States. On the  contrary, potentially negative effects will be felt in some  areas, such as wheat, corn, sugar beets, oil seeds, and dairy  products.    Concern has been caused by the rapid progress made in  drafting a possible trade agreement with the United States.  Correa considers that a complete and basic study has not yet  been made of the implications of such an agreement for the  national economy. At the same time he considered it unacceptable  to sign an agreement providing for trade integration with the  United States which could affect the implementation of Chilean  agricultural policies.    The SNA leader recalled that the only effort made to study  the possible effects of such an agreement was undertaken by the  Confederation of Production and Trade (CPC). He considered this  study only an "approach" to the subject.    Among the possible problems of a TLC [Free Trade Agreement]  Correa gave one example. He mentioned that in the case of Mexico  (which presently is a signatory of NAFTA [North American Free  Trade Agreement]), the importation of North American sorghum is  permitted, without the payment of customs duties, for subsequent  reexport to the United States.    Some statements which have been made have caused greater  concern in the SNA. It is still not clear whether Chile will  adhere to NAFTA or will sign a bilateral agreement.  <H5>  Subsidies </H5>   In addition to the previously mentioned concern, Chilean  farmers feel uncertainty about the possibility that an  initiative like NAFTA could have an impact on agricultural  policies now in effect in Chile. Correa said that these policies  provide "minimum protection against sudden and artificial  fluctuations in international prices caused to a large extent by  the subsidies which the developed countries provide for their  agricultural production and exports." He estimated that the  United States Government pays $35 billion annually in subsidies  to protect its farmers.    He repeated the concern of the SNA regarding the  advisability  of a policy of bilateral agreements as an alternative to the  strategy of unilateral openness to the rest of the world, which  has been the policy adopted in the past. He expressed the view  that the number of bilateral agreements which have been entered  into have ended up by "undermining the uniform structure of our  customs tariffs." He said that "several of the preference  agreements have seriously compromised domestic production."  <H5>  Dollars </H5>   What is happening to foreign exchange rates is a matter of  concern to the SNA. During the first quarter of 1994 the U. S.  dollar has declined by 3.3 percent. Over the past 12 months,  according to SNA statistics, the decline has amounted to 6.2  percent in real terms.    Correa said that this does not agree with what Eduardo  Aninat, the minister of finance, said when he spoke at a meeting  with businessmen on the first day in office of the new  government. At the meeting Aninat emphasized the importance  which stability in the rate of exchange of the U. S. dollar had  for the Chilean export sector. Correa refuted this remark with  the fact that the dollar has fallen in value, which, he  considered, "could lead to a situation of extreme difficulty."    He said that the lesser value of the dollar, "has  contributed  to reducing inflationary pressures. However, among other  aspects, it is harmful for the Chilean export sector," he  emphasized.    Correa defended the Chilean agricultural sector, stating  that  it is not always the cause of an increase in the index of  consumer prices. He said that there are some months, like April  1994, when the index of consumer prices has recorded a decline.  [passage omitted]</p>

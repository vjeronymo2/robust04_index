			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Road map to the Rover's return: Co-operation with Honda and upmarket models are the route to profits for the UK car maker Honda and Rover may have stopped short of marriage - for the time being at least - but they are happily cohabiting in the strongest relationship yet formed between a Japanese and European carmaker. Their latest jointly developed vehicles, the new generation Honda Accord and the Rover 600, are being readied for launch. The large family saloons, which look different but have the same engines and gearboxes and mostly shared components, are set to become crucial milestones in the development of both companies' fortunes in Europe. For Rover, the relationship is particularly vital. The 600 series, unveiled today, is the latest in the line of new vehicles launched since 1989 aimed at transforming Rover from its British Leyland past as a failed maker of poor quality volume cars into its hoped-for future as a producer of premium upmarket models capable of competing with the likes of BMW and Audi. The process, dubbed 'Roverisation', is key to its strategy for survival in Europe as a medium-sized producer of around 500,000 vehicles a year (including Land Rover) which is competitive with the world's largest manufacturers. Rover, which was sold by the government to British Aerospace in 1988, has weathered the worst of the UK recession. It has contained its losses in the past two years while pressing ahead with its new model programme. By the end of 1992 about 90 per cent of its sales were of models launched in the preceding three years. In August, five years after the takeover, BAe will be freed of government constraints on disposing of the Rover operations. Mr John Cahill, BAe chairman, says the date is 'increasingly a red herring'. As speculation rises over a possible Rover sale, he insists, 'we have no plans to sell Rover. Rover remains part of our core business strategy.' The assertion is only credible in the context of the link with Honda, which holds a 20 per cent stake in the Rover vehicle operations, and has shown little inclination to raise the holding. 'If BAe wished to sell Rover Group in the future, then we would have to review the situation,' says a Honda spokesman. 'It would be difficult to continue the sharing of technology and designs if it was sold to another manufacturer.' For Rover the relationship with Honda, now in its 14th year, has spelled survival. Rover's existing 200/400 small family car and 800 executive ranges were the result of collaborative projects with Honda. The two companies are currently at an advanced stage in negotiating their next important co-operative venture, the development of a new small car that would replace Rover's Metro in the mid-1990s. With the launch of the 600, Rover is dependent on Honda technology for three of its four main car ranges, and it is doubtful whether it has the resources to develop an all-new mainstream car programme on its own. According to Mr John Towers, Rover Group managing director, the UK company accounted for about 15 per cent of the engineering hours in the series 600 project, in which it has invested around Pounds 200m. He claims the joint programme has saved Rover about Pounds 150m in development costs. 'If we were going alone we would have had higher variable costs. We would have had to push up volumes, which would have meant higher marketing costs. Everybody is getting into joint ventures, not because it's fashionable but because it makes economic sense.' Crucially, however, the Honda link has left Rover with the independence to pursue its own strategies based on Honda chassis platforms. In particular, the Rover 200/400 - the sister car of the Honda Concerto - has spawned a host of derivatives developed exclusively by Rover. These include coupe, cabriolet and diesel models. The benefits of the relationship with Honda go beyond technology and resources. 'We have acquired an insight into Japanese best practice and processes,' says Mr George Simpson, chairman of Rover and deputy chief executive of BAe. 'The Honda relationship has been invaluable as a learning opportunity.' Mr Simpson claims that the 'learning process' has given Rover big opportunities to reduce costs in every aspect of its business, from moving to just-in-time production, to lean distribution, to the creation of a flexible workforce. Rover's 'new deal' package of labour reforms, achieved in the past two years without confrontation, is aimed at allowing it to compete with the UK plants of Nissan, Honda and Toyota. 'With a single-status employee base represented by a single negotiating body, we have together achieved mutual benefits. We have full flexibility, genuine team working, and employees who are comprehensively involved in process improvement and waste elimination,' says Mr Simpson. Despite such improvements, the severity of the UK recession has taken its toll on the car company. The Rover vehicle operations have fallen into deficit in the past two years with an operating loss of Pounds 49m in 1992 compared with a loss of Pounds 52m in 1991 and an operating profit of Pounds 65m in 1990. But BAe expects Rover to move back into profit this year. It believes recovery will be based on: stronger new car demand with UK new car sales forecast to rise to 1.65m from 1.59m in 1992; a further reduction in costs following a 7.5 per cent improvement in productivity in 1992; the launch this month of the Rover 600 range; and improved competitiveness gained by depreciation of sterling. As consumer demand in the UK shows signs of revival, Rover is pushing ahead with its ambitious cost-cutting plan. In the first quarter of this year the workforce was reduced, through voluntary redundancies, by about 2,000 to just over 31,000. This compares with 35,000 at the end of 1991 and 40,500 at the end of 1990. At the same time, productivity gains have reduced Rover's break-even point to an annual production of around 440,000 vehicles last year. The target is to reach a break-even level of 400,000. Improved productivity is partly a result of investment in new plant and equipment. Rover's assembly plant at Cowley, Oxford, has been transformed from one of the UK motor industry's oldest manufacturing complexes into a compact plant for the production of Rover's large cars, the 800 series executive car and now the 600 series. Rover has invested around Pounds 215m in the new Cowley facility, which has a capacity to produce 110,000 cars a year including more than 50,000 of the 600 series cars. Mr Towers claims that Cowley is now 'an advanced and flexible production plant within existing buildings - but with many of the advantages of a greenfield site'. Rover's ambition to return to profit this year does, however, face obstacles. In particular, a sharp fall in new car demand in continental Europe threatens to offset the benefits of increased competitiveness resulting from the depreciation of sterling after Britain's withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism last September. Despite the weakness of the continental market, Rover executives are determined to increase their presence there. Dependence on the UK market, which accounts for around 57 per cent of its vehicle sales, is Rover's Achilles' heel, say industry observers. In an attempt to bolster its presence in continental Europe, it has expanded its dealer network in Germany from 120 to 150 last year. It is aiming to add another 100 by 1995. The company hopes that the Rover 600 will help it to build a bridgehead to the Continent, and more than half of production is earmarked for export. In continental Europe, as elsewhere, the 600 is being pitched against the BMW 3-series, the Audi 80 and the Mercedes-Benz 190, as Rover seeks to set itself apart from the dogfight among the volume car makers such as VW, Fiat, Ford and General Motors (Opel-Vauxhall). The tired Montego, Rover's old product in the segment for large family cars and a legacy from BL, may have had to fight a losing battle against the likes of the Ford Sierra - now replaced by the Mondeo - and the Vauxhall Cavalier. But with the 600 Rover has set its sights upmarket. Roverisation is about to face its critical road test.</p>

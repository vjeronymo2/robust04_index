			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / EC seeks common rules on extradition EC justice ministers are to try to thwart tax evaders and terrorists by agreeing common rules on extradition. At a meeting near Brussels they launched a year-long review of national extradition procedures. Officials at the meeting said the review would examine whether to abolish the category of a politically motivated offence inside the EC, and whether EC nationals can be extradited for tax evasion. Mr Melchior Wathelet, justice minister of Belgium, the current EC presidency, pointed out that extradition procedures inside Europe have hardly changed for 50 years. It was 'time to take a big step forward,' he said, to prevent criminals from taking advantage of the EC's border-free single market. He cited as examples that France and Belgium did not allow extradition of their own nationals. Mr Wathelet added that 'the notion of political offences needs to be reconsidered, and possibly abolished,' inside a Community whose members were democracies governed by the rule of law.</p>

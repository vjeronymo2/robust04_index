			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>   [Text] The Novosibirsk Applied Physics Institute  demonstrated its military products for the first time at the  Moscow Air Show-92 international exhibition. These are the S-8  and S-13 free-flight rocket weapon systems with rockets with  solid-propellant engines and various types of warheads. They are  mounted on combat aircraft (helicopters) and intended for  engaging enemy armored equipment, engineer works and personnel.    Platforms for the S-8 80-mm free-flight air-launched weapons  are Su-17M, Su-24, Su-25, Su-27, MiG-23 and MiG-27 aircraft and  also Mi-8, Mi-24, Mi-28 and K-252 helicopters. Its 20 rockets  are accommodated in the special B-8M1 rocket pod (length 3,550  mm, diameter 410 mm, empty weight 160 kg, loaded weight 400 kg).  It has a conical nose section and good aerodynamic properties.  The very same number of rockets is accommodated on helicopters  in the B-8V20 rocket pod (length 1,790 mm, diameter 521 mm,  empty weight 100 kg, loaded weight 342 kg).    The more powerful S-13 122-mm free-flight air-launched  rocket  weapon system is used on Su-27 and MiG-29 fighters and Su-25  attack aircraft. Its five rockets are located in the B-13L  rocket pod (length 3,558 mm, diameter 410 mm, empty weight 160  kg, loaded weight 510 kg).

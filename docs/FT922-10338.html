			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / LA hit by further violent outbreaks SPORADIC shootings, looting and arson continued in Los Angeles last night, as armoured cars and National Guard troops were out in force after overnight violence had left at least 10 dead and 400 injured. Blacks continued to react in disbelief to the acquittal of four white police officers charged with assaulting a black motorist, Mr Rodney King. The acquittal had come in spite of the evidence of widely-screened amateur videotape of the beating. Mayor Tom Bradley announced a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the city, and curbed the sale of guns, ammunition and petrol, in an effort to stem rioting. The Insurance Information Institute said at least Dollars 100m (Pounds 56.4m) of damage had already been caused. It was the worst spate of violence to hit Los Angeles since the Watts riots of 1965. Yesterday police reported they had made more than 250 arrests as rioters continued to ransack stores and set dozens of new fires. 'It is not under control. There are looters, sporadic incidents of violence and a lot of pushing and shoving going on,' said Mr Bill Frio, a police department spokesman. Captain Steve Ruda of the fire department said he did not have the manpower to put out all the fires across the 30-square-mile area hit by rioting. Anger over the verdict spread to black communities across the country yesterday, sparking fears that the Los Angeles riots might be copied in other cities. 'There is a danger that the crisis in Los Angeles will spread across the country,' said Mr Jesse Jackson, the black political leader. Demonstrations in cities such as Cleveland, Dallas and New York were peaceful, for the most part. But in Atlanta, police made numerous arrests when a rally got out of control. Looting was also reported in San Jose, near San Francisco. In Los Angeles, Mr Jeff Cramer, a freelance reporter for the Boston Globe, was shot five times, but was in a stable condition last night. He said a crowd had tried to take him out of his car but had failed to undo his seat belt. Gunshot victims were wheeled into a hospital about a mile south of the city centre regularly through the night. Seeing flames a block away, a black security guard said: 'Burn baby burn]' President George Bush said the Justice Department would accelerate its investigation of the King case. They would examine whether to bring federal charges of violating Mr King's civil rights against the police officers after their acquittal on assault charges under California state law. Appealing for calm, he said the verdict had 'left us all with a deep sense of personal frustration and anguish', but condemned the 'murder and violence in the streets of Los Angeles'. Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Mr Bush's likely Democratic opponent in this year's presidential election, said he was astonished by the verdict, and hoped for a stronger statement from the president. In the 1960s, federal prosecutors began to use charges of civil rights violations because of the difficulty of persuading many all-white state juries in the segregated Deep South to convict whites of crimes whose victims were black. In spite of improvements since then, many blacks still feel that the legal system is heavily biased against them, a feeling reinforced by Wednesday's verdict. 'It may be that 12 white jurors aren't going to convict four white cops for beating a black man, and maybe that's as basic as it is,' said Mr Steve Lerman, Mr King's lawyer. Some black leaders criticised judges for transferring the trial to a courtroom in predominantly white Ventura County, next to Los Angeles. The videotape of the beating was thought to have prejudiced the chances of a fair trial in the city itself. Attorney-general William Barr said yesterday that 123 police officers had been charged by the Justice Department in the last 3 1/2 years with civil rights violations for brutality. Although these federal cases are also tried by juries, the conviction rate was around 75 per cent. A resident of the neighbourhood reacted in bitterness to the assault. 'It's destroying the family. The neighbourhood family has been wiped out. It breaks your heart,' said Mrs Delores Hill, a local resident.

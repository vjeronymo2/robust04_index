			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Leading Article: HDTV blues The only country to come out reasonably well from the long-running high-definition television wars is the US. Japan's telecommunications ministry yesterday effectively pulled the rug from under the country's 30-year attempt to promote its Hi-Vision system. The European Union abandoned its campaign to promote its rival HD-Mac standard last year. The cause of Japan's and Europe's expensive about-turns were realisations that the technologies they were pushing were out of date. Both standards are based on old-fashioned analogue transmission methods. By contrast, the US standard, unveiled only last week by a 'grand alliance' of high-tech companies, is based on digital technology. This has two main advantages: digital signals can be compressed, allowing many more TV channels to be transmitted over a given 'bandwidth'; and images can be more easily manipulated and edited, making the technology more suited for the emerging world of multimedia communications. Both Japan and Europe are now likely to go down the digital route. Japan and Europe failed in this field largely because they wanted to lead the race in developing a new technology and lost sight of what consumers wanted. They were therefore eager to fix their standards too soon, so stifling innovation. The US government, by contrast, allowed time for ideas to bubble before attempting to impose order. The grand alliance was formed only last year. US industry may now reap the rewards of its more market-led approach. A shift towards digital television may offer US companies a route back into the consumer electronics industry from which tough Japanese competition in the 1970s and 1980s virtually excluded them. Computer companies, which already have an expertise in digital technologies, may be among the biggest beneficiaries. But US industry will not find everything going its way. For a start, it is still possible that Japan and Europe will seek to develop their own digital HDTV standards. Even if they do not, it will be hard to deny Japanese and European manufacturers access to US technology. The two biggest European TV makers, Thomson and Philips, are in fact members of the grand alliance. The bigger question is whether a market can be developed for the US standard. Europe's HD-Mac collapsed because broadcasters were reluctant to make programmes to its standard. Japan crossed that hurdle but fell at the second: consumers baulked at spending hundreds of thousands of yen on a new set when the only advantages were a wider screen and a somewhat sharper image. The US digital HDTV standard has advantages which neither of the analogue standards enjoyed. But manufacturers will still face the same uphill task of persuading consumers to scrap their current TV sets.</p>

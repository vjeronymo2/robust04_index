			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Morland shares leap on bid talks Morland, the Thames Valley brewer, said yesterday that it was in discussions 'which may or may not lead to an offer for the whole of the issued share capital' of the company, writes Philip Rawstorne. The statement followed a 26 per cent rise in the brewer's share price from 373p to 470p. Morland is believed to be trying to resolve the problems created by the 43.6 per cent stake in the company held by the Whitbread Investment Company. Unless WIC disposes of the shareholding or substantially reduces it by November 1, Whitbread will have to add Morland's 300 pubs to its 6,150 in calculating the number it has to free from tied beer supplies to comply with government orders.</p>

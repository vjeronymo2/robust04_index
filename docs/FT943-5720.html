			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Lots of life at the English seaside Sir, Michael Thompson-Noel is, as a travel writer, entitled to his subjective views about Great Yarmouth ('The English coast and its holidays from hell', August 27/28). However, I am surprised that you have allowed him to muddle these with what purports to be a business assessment of the state of England's tourism and its resorts. He tells us that we have lost our soul to 'naffness'. The bits in between (the resorts) are 'often occupied by drab caravan parks'. If he had bothered to go and look at these caravan parks and holiday centres he would have found a number of thriving businesses and would have seen the result of many years of steady investment by both national operators such as Pontins, Haven and Warner and by private operators such as, in the Great Yarmouth area, Potters, Blue Sky (the Timewell family), Cherry Tree (the Marsh family), or Vauxhall. In any of these caravan holiday parks he would have found a wide range of sporting facilities, indoor and outdoor swimming pools and, most importantly, a variety of evening entertainment that he would not have found at twice the price in France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Morocco, Tunisia, Bermuda, the Caribbean, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Mexico, California, Canada or even Scotland] Adele Biss, chairman of the British Tourist Authority and of the English Tourist Board, was right to highlight some of the problems that our holiday industry faces in her introduction to the ETB's annual report. I prefer this honesty to the over-optimistic messages put out by some of her predecessors. There still could be a further contraction in hotel accommodation in resorts. But standards are improving. There is a need for more imaginative use of parasols, wind-breaks and deckchairs to make our beaches attractive in the way that the Belgians and the Dutch achieve with the same climate as we have. But there is life yet in England's seaside resorts and Financial Times readers should be aware that there is still money to be made there too] Mr Thompson-Noel would do well to reflect on what would be the effect on the national parks of the resorts closing down and all those who holiday there following him to the countryside.

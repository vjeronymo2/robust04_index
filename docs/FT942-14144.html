			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: Likely Pounds 70m tag for Healthcall Healthcall, the UK's largest provider of out-of-hours doctors, is planning a flotation next month via a placing and intermediaries offer which should value the company at about Pounds 70m. The Pounds 30m proceeds will pay off borrowings related to its Pounds 41.4m management buy-out from Air Call in 1990. The duty doctor service, started almost 30 years ago, provides general practition-ers with the out-of-hours cover they are obliged to supply. Four times the size of its nearest competitor - Nestor-BNA's doctor deputising division - Healthcall has 8,300 subscribers out of the 20,000 GPs who practice in urban areas. It uses 64 full-time doctors and a pool of 1,400 part-timers, most of whom are subscribers. In the two years to 1993 the number of annual visits increased by 16 per cent to 1.29m, helped by last year's flu epidemics, and the duty doctor service generated 80 per cent of the group's turnover of Pounds 36m (Pounds 31.2m). Group operating profit was Pounds 6.05m, up from Pounds 4.06m in 1991. The management team, headed by Mr Maurice Henchey, chief executive, believes the group stands to benefit from many of the changes taking place in the National Health Service. 'Healthcall is very well-placed to take advantage of the ageing population, the focus on cost control and efficiency and the increasing emphasis on providing healthcare through community-based services.' In addition to the duty doctor operation and its long-established medical telephone answering service, Healthcall has moved into the provision of eye care for the elderly and disabled in residential homes. Last month it bought a small homecare operation in Leicestershire. The offer is being sponsored by Morgan Grenfell with James Capel as stockbrokers. Pricing is expected to be announced on May 5.</p>

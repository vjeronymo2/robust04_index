			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 18 (KNS-KCNA) [dateline as received] --  The Osaka prefectural headquarters of the General Association of  Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) held a roundtable  conversation with Japanese media on May 16.    Present on the occasion were the head of the local branch  office of the Japanese JIJI press, chief editors of the Osaka  head offices of ASAHI SHIMBUN, MAINICHI SHIMBUN, NIHON KEIZAI  SHIMBUN and SANKEI SHIMBUN and representatives of the NHK, the  KYODO News Service and YOMIURI SHIMBUN.    Speaking at the roundtable, O Hyong-chin, vice-chairman of  the Chongnyon Central Standing Committee and chairman of the  Osaka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon, said the question  of "suspected nuclear development" of the DPRK has been reported  by Japanese media in a way contrary to facts, thereby hampering  the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and,  furthermore, the denuclearization of Northeast Asia. "The DPRK  has neither intention nor capacity to develop nuclear weapons,"  he stressed.    Calling attention to the unreasonable search of the Osaka  organization of Chongnyon by the Japanese police, assaults on  Korean students in Japan and rampant reports and tones inciting  the consciousness of national chauvinism, he demanded an  immediate halt to such acts.</p>

These SIP revisions were submitted by the State of Minnesota as a means of demonstrating attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> . The USEPA proposed to disapprove the originally submitted SIP revisions on September 13, 1993. However, that notice of proposed rulemaking stated that if the issues identified within were satisfactorily addressed by the State by the end of the 30-day comment period, and if no other significant adverse comments were received, USEPA would proceed with a final approval. The issues were adequately addressed by the State and submitted to the USEPA on July 12, 1993. No comments were received on the September 13, 1993, proposed action.

Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On May 29, 1992, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for sulfur dioxide (SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) in Air Quality Control Region (AQCR) 131. The seven-county metropolitan area (AQCR 131) has been designated, by the USEPA, as nonattainment for SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This submittal was intended to demonstrate attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in AQCR 131, excluding an area surrounding the SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission sources at Ashland Petroleum Company, and an area surrounding the SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission sources at and near Koch Refining Company, located in Dakota County. These two sources and the surrounding areas were subject to separate submittals and are addressed in separate rulemakings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 13, 1993, a document was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 47840) which proposed disapproval of the SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP revision for AQCR 131. The proposed notice discussed the State submittal, including background information, attainment demonstration, specific aspects of each administrative order, USEPA comments regarding the administrative orders, comparison of submittal with sections 110 and 172 requirements, and proposed rulemaking action. The disapproval was based on the issues which had been identified in the notice by the USEPA. However, the action also stated that if the issues were satisfactorily addressed by the end of the 30-day comment period, and if no adverse comments were received, the USEPA would proceed with a final approval. This final rule will present a brief summary of the State submittal, detail how the USEPA identified issues were addressed, and present our recommendation for final approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Submittal Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP revisions submitted by the MPCA for the AQCR 131 area consisted primarily of administrative orders issued to five facilities: (1) Minneapolis Energy Center, Inc.; (2) Northern States Power Company; (3) FMC and U.S. Navy (FMC has since changed its name to Armament Systems Division of United Defense, L.P.); (4) GAF Corporation; and (5) Federal-Hoffman, Incorporated. The administrative orders contained emission limits, operating restrictions, compliance methodologies, and reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Technical support was also submitted which justified the limits and restrictions in the administrative orders as well as explained the methodology used to demonstrate attainment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Attainment Demonstration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 172(c)(6) requires that revisions include enforceable emission limitations and other control measures, means or techniques, necessary to provide for attainment of the applicable NAAQS. The State submittal demonstrated attainment through the use of air dispersion modeling. The primary guidance for such demonstrations is the Guideline on Air Quality Models, which specifies the criteria for selection of dispersion models and for estimation of emissions and other model inputs. In accordance with that guidance, the dispersion modeling conducted for the five administrative orders in this submittal was performed using the Industrial Source Complex Short-term (ISCST) model (version 90346) for calculation of the 24-hour and 3-hour concentrations. The analysis used urban dispersion coefficients, five years of National Weather Service meteorological data (surface data from the Minneapolis/St. Paul airport and upper air data from St. Cloud), regulatory default parameters, and receptors spaced at 100 meter intervals at areas of maximum impact. The emissions used in the modeling demonstration were based on the maximum emissions allowed at each facility. The annual impacts were calculated in the original 1987 submittal using the Climatological Dispersion Model (CDM 2.0). The modeled concentrations, plus background concentrations and growth margins, showed attainment with the 3-hour, 24-hour, and annual NAAQS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The administrative orders for the five facilities each contain sections detailing how compliance is to be determined. The methods used include continuous emissions monitors (CEMS), stack testing conducted in accordance with Reference Methods 1 through 4, 6, 6a, or 6b, and regular fuel sampling and fuel supplier certification. The USEPA has determined, based on guidance in the ``General Preamble for Future Proposed Rulemakings,'' published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on April 16, 1992 (57 FR 13498), that these compliance methods are adequate to provide for SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  compliance monitoring at the affected facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. State Responses to USEPA Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following are the administrative order revisions made by the State and submitted to USEPA on July 12, 1993, in response to USEPA comments detailed in the notice of proposed rulemaking. In addition, the administrative order for FMC Corporation and U.S. Navy was again revised on March 26, 1993 and an official SIP revision package was sent to the USEPA at that time. Those revisions will also be discussed in this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Hoffman, Inc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) A formula was added to the administrative order which calculates an emission rate in pounds of sulfur dioxide per million British Thermal Units (lbs/mmBtu) from information on percent sulfur, density of the fuel oil, theoretical sulfur to sulfur dioxide availability, and the heating value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) It was made clear in the administrative order that the emission limits on emission points 82, 83, and 84, apply to each point and not the group. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The method used to determine the sulfur content of fuel oil is now clearly identified as an approved American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) method. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> FMC and U.S. Navy <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) In response to a concern about monthly analysis of fuel oil for waste oil or waste solvents, the administrative order was changed so that every time the Company adds waste oil or waste solvents to the fuel oil, the resulting fuel oil will be sampled and analyzed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The method used to determine sulfur content of the fuel oil is now clearly identified as an approved ASTM method.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A formula was added to the administrative order which calculates an emission rate in lbs/mmBtu from information on percent sulfur, fuel oil coefficients for the type of fuel being burned, and the heating value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional changes to the FMC and U.S. Navy order were requested in a March 26, 1993, SIP revision package submitted by the State. The changes included the addition, in Exhibit 1 of the administrative order, of distillate oil as a fuel type for boilers 1 through 13 (these boilers are also allowed to burn residual oil), three diesel generators were added as emission points to Exhibit 1 (these diesel generators were included in the modeled attainment demonstration), name changes for boilers 1A, 1B, and 2A, and associated changes to Part I.C.E of the administrative order which specifies operating restrictions during the decommission of boilers 1 through 17 and their replacement with three new boilers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> GAF Building Materials Corporation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The administrative order increases the sampling and analyzing frequency of the mixture of No. 6 fuel oil and knockout oil (a petroleum based by-product) from a monthly to a weekly basis. If, after six months, the sulfur content of the mixture is less than 1.3 percent, monthly sampling will be considered sufficient. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The administrative order now contains a formula for use in calculating an emission rate in lbs/mmBtu from the recorded sulfur content and heating value information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The method used to determine sulfur content of the fuel oil and asphalt are specifically identified as approved ASTM methods. A revision was also made to the recordkeeping section of the administrative order requiring the Company to keep records on the mixture of fuel oil and knockout oil.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Northern States Power <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The annual emission limit on emission point #3 has been revised and is now based on a daily, 365-day rolling average. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Minor language changes were made to clarify that testing conditions and operating capacities may be specified by the MPCA and/or the USEPA, and that the company shall obtain a permit amendment if required by State or Federal regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A comment regarding the need for a formula in the order was addressed by the use of continuous emission monitors (CEMS) at the facility. The CEMS provide emissions data in lbs/mmBtu and lbs/hour. The section in the administrative order discussing the operation and maintenance of the CEMS was revised to reflect a new date for beginning stack flow monitoring. This was requested by the Company due to equipment installation problems and subsequent delays.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) An additional revision was made to the administrative order limiting the types of fuel the Company is authorized to burn.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Minneapolis Energy Center, Inc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) In response to an USEPA comment regarding emission limits on operating scenarios not included in the original administrative order, the State has revised the order to include limits on all possible operating scenarios at the facility. Dispersion modeling was submitted to support the additional limits. Also, information was included in the administrative order for determining compliance when an operating scenario changes in the middle of an averaging period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A formula was added to the administrative order to be used for calculating sulfur dioxide emissions in lbs/hr based on data regarding fuel flow, fuel density and percent sulfur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The administrative order was revised to require recordkeeping during periods of time when natural gas supplies are interrupted and the Facility is burning distillate oil. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The emission units for emission point number 1 were changed to correctly reflect Boilers 1, 2, and 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) An emergency diesel generator was added to the emission units included in the administrative order. The generator is limited to 0.5 lbs of sulfur dioxide/mmBtu. The generator was included in the supplementary dispersion modeling attainment demonstration noted in 1) above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Public Comment/USEPA Response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There were no comments received on the notice of proposed rulemaking published on September 13, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Rulemaking Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP revisions submitted to USEPA for AQCR 131 (except the Pine Bend area of Dakota County and the St. Paul Park/Ashland area) dated May 29, 1992, and the supplemental amendments dated, March 26, 1993, and July 12, 1993, satisfy the general requirements for implementation plans as detailed in section 110(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act and also the nonattainment area plan requirements listed in subpart 1 of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act. The July 12, 1993, submittal satisfactorily addressed the issues identified in the September 13, 1993, notice of proposed rulemaking. Consequently, given that no other comments on the proposed rulemaking were received, USEPA is taking final action to approve Minnesota's SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP revision submittals for the above specified area of AQCR 131. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The enforceable element of the State's submittals are the administrative orders for five facilities in AQCR 131. The codification portion of this document identifies the effective dates of the administrative orders and the names and locations of the facilities covered. This final action incorporates into the SIP and makes federally enforceable the administrative orders for: (1) FMC Corporation and U.S. Navy; (2) Federal Hoffman, Incorporated; (3) Northern States Power&hyph;Riverside Plant; (4) GAF Corporation; and (5) Minneapolis Energy Center, Incorporated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Clean Air Act forbids USEPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> USEPA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action makes final the action proposed at 58 FR 47840. As noted elsewhere in this action, USEPA received no adverse public comment on the proposed action. Consequently, this action has been reclassified from Table 2 to Table 3 by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989, (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional Administrators). A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years. USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continued in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superceded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by June 13, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements.

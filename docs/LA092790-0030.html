			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLOCK CALLS BRUTALITY SUIT A PLOY BY GANGS  </P> <P> Sheriff Sherman Block -- stung by what he called "horror stories" in a federal  lawsuit -- vehemently denied Wednesday that deputies in Lynwood engaged in  excessive force, and he called the complaint a ploy by gang members to  discredit his department.  </P> <P> Civil rights attorneys representing 81 plaintiffs leveled the allegations in a  massive lawsuit lodged Tuesday with the U.S. District Court. The class-action  suit names Block and 22 of his Lynwood station deputies as defendants and seeks  an injunction placing the station under court control.  </P> <P> Block, speaking at his monthly news conference, called the complaint  "ludicrous" and said many of the plaintiffs are gang members facing criminal  trials.  </P> <P> "I would say that much of this has the smell, if you will, of a group of gang  members in the community who, perhaps, are banding together and trying to  discredit the deputies who work in this area," the sheriff said.  </P> <P> The lawsuit contends that Block and other top law enforcement officials have  failed to control deputies in the Lynwood station -- which has 154 sworn  deputies covering 7.6 square miles in Lynwood, Compton, Willowbrook and an  unincorporated Los Angeles County area. It cited more than 40 alleged incidents  this year of "shooting, killing, brutality, terrorism, house-trashing and other  acts of lawlessness" by deputies, including two deaths and dozens of beatings.  </P> <P> Block angrily disputed the allegations and denied that the department has  failed to discipline deputies. Block said some Lynwood deputies have been  punished for excessive force over the years, along with those from other  stations, but he provided no specifics.  </P> <P> "We will stand by our record, and I take personal offense to some of the  content of these allegations as to the fact that I condone and encourage and  fail to act upon these actions when they are brought to my attention," he said.  </P> <P> Block refused to talk about any specific cases but said that nearly half of the  plaintiffs in the suit are suspected gang members rousted during house searches  last March after an apparent gang shooting.  </P> <P> George V. Denny III, the lead attorney in the case, acknowledged Wednesday that  some plaintiffs in the lawsuit are former or present gang members. But he said  the majority of the plaintiffs have no gang ties -- and those arrested were  improperly charged with assault on officers and other crimes.  </P> <P> "It may be that the biggest gang in Los Angeles County is the sheriff's  olive-green gang," Denny said. "They have colors. They have signs they flash to  one another. They are very territorial, and they are trying to make Lynwood  their turf."  </P> <P> Denny, along with attorneys from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund  and the Police Misconduct Lawyer Referral Service, Tuesday accused Block of  ignoring brutality complaints against Lynwood deputies. Denny gave reporters  copies of an April 30 letter to Block asking for an investigation of five of  the cases outlined in the lawsuit. A letter from Block on May 23 promised a  "thorough investigation. . . ."  </P> <P> Block said he could not recall the specifics of Denny's letter. However, he  said that his department's Internal Investigations Bureau had only one  complaint from a plaintiff in the suit, and that case -- which he would not  identify -- was still under investigation.  </P> <P> "So the allegation that we failed to investigate (and) to properly discipline  where appropriate . . . is somewhat hypocritical in the fact that these  incidents have not been the subject of complaints to our department," said  Block. Meanwhile, he blamed rising street violence for the "commensurate  increase in violent confrontations between law enforcement and these  violence-prone individuals."  </P> <P> In a Times story last May, Block had acknowledged that excessive force has been  a concern of his department since a 1985 internal study cited it as one of  several ethical problems that needed attention. The study led to a $300,000  program requiring every deputy to attend a daylong seminar on ethics, including  techniques to avoid violent confrontations. Block said all 8,000 sworn officers  have participated.  </P> <P> The Times also reported that excessive force lawsuits had nearly doubled over  the last five years, and such cases cost the county $8.5 million in settlements  and jury awards during a three-year period ending last September.  </P> <P> In lamenting the "list of horror stories" in the Lynwood suit, Block said the  sheer number of complaints will ensure that his department will investigate the  allegations. But he added that the document "is full of defamatory statements"  and emphasized that there is no evidence that Lynwood deputies consistently use  excessive force.  </P> <P> Other defendants include the county, the city of Lynwood, the Sheriff's  Department, the commander of the Lynwood station, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de and  Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner.  </P> <P> The suit seeks no specific monetary damages. Plaintiffs, however, asked for an  injunction placing the Lynwood station under a "law enforcement master." Block  labeled the request a "grandstand play."  </P> <P> Some law enforcement officials and legal scholars said the move was highly  unusual.  </P> <P> "To my knowledge, I have never heard of that civil remedy," said James Ginger,  deputy director of the Police Foundation, a nonprofit research and technical  assistance organization in Washington. "It would create a situation where you  would have some people who remain under the sheriff but not under his direct  control. . . . That could create problems."  </P> <P> Robert D. Goldstein, a UCLA law professor who has taught courses in civil  rights legislation, also said the plaintiffs' request for a receiver will face  legal hurdles.  </P> <P> "It is very difficult to persuade a federal court to intervene at all in  regulating a police force through an injunction," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Peshawar -- A group of 46 Afghan commanders have  initiated a campaign to bring an end to the 16-day battle for  Kabul.    The group, which includes well-known commanders like Manlvi  Siddiqullah, Sher Alam, Anwar Khan and Karim Qarabagh, met  leaders of the Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan]-led  Supreme Coordination Council of the Islamic Revolution of  Afghanistan at Charasyab Sunday [16 Jan] to discuss peace  proposals. The group, which includes several pro-Rabbani  commanders, was reportedly also in touch with Rabbani and his  former defence minister, Ahmad Shah Mas'ud.    The moves came amidst reports of bombing of Kabul by General  Dostam's jet-fighters. Qarcebar Rahman Saeed, a Supreme Council  spokesman, said Rabbani positions at Dashit-e Chamiala and in  the capital were bombed. Radio Kabul, monitored in Peshawar,  however, reported that Dostam's aircraft bombed civilian areas  with cluster bombs. Both sides reported that there were almost  no ground battles on Sunday.    According to Saeed, the delegation brought a letter from  Mas'ud expressing his readiness to accept the verdict of a  15-member commission comprising three representatives each of  Rabbani's Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic Society], Hezb-e Eslami  (Hekmatyar), Hezb-e Eslami (Khalis), Sayyaf's Ettehad-e Eslami-e  [Islamic Union of Afghanistan] and Manlvi Mohammadi's Harekat-e  Enqelab-e Eslami [Islamic Revolution Movement].    Saeed said the Council made it clear to the commanders that  they would not agree to a ceasefire, but were ready to discuss  Rabbani's resignation. He said a four-member delegation,  including one nominee each from Hezb-e Eslami, Hezb-e Wahdat  [Islamic Unity Party], Mojadeddi's ANLF [National Liberation  Front of Afghanistan] and Dostam's Junbush-e Melli Eslami, was  being formed. Jami'at-e Eslami sources in Peshawar said they  were unaware of Mas'ud's letter or proposal.    Saeed added that the Supreme Council welcomed Pakistan's  proposal for a regional conference, though it insisted on  Rabbani's resignation as a pre-condition.    Radio Kabul quoted Dr Najibollah Lafra'i as saying that  Rabbani would not accept a temporary ceasefire and would not  talk to Dostam's militia. He said peace talks with Hezb-e  Eslami were possible provided it gave up its heavy arms,  guaranteed not to fight against the government and broke its  ties with Dostam.    Amir Usman, Pakistan's ambassador in Afghanistan, Sunday  travelled to Jalalabad to meet the Nangarhar Shura. A Shura  spokesman informed The News that the delegation told the  ambassador about the difficulties faced by Afghans following  Pakistan's decision to seal its border with Afghanistan.    Meanwhile, another 32 UN trucks carrying relief supplies  left  Peshawar for Jalalabad Sunday. The trucks carried tents, flour  and UNICEF-donated medicines for the two new camps near  Jalalabad.    More than 100 Pakistani lawyers in Peshawar have signed a  memorandum calling on the United Nations to provide a safe  passage to former Afghan president, Dr Najibollah, from  war-battered Kabul. It pointed out that Dr Najibollah had  stepped down as part of a UN-brokered peace plan, but was still  being held at UN premises in Kabul. The memorandum said Dr  Najibollah should be freed, not only to fulfill a UN obligation  but also because of security problems.</p>

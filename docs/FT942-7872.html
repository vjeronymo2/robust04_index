			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / UN to monitor Haiti sanctions efforts by Dominican Republic A team of United Nations observers has arrived in the Dominican Republic to monitor the country's adherence to tighter economic sanctions against neighbouring Haiti which went into force at the weekend. Their arrival coincides with reports that the US will consider imposing trade penalties on the Dominican Republic if the government fails to curb smuggling across the border in violation of the sanctions. Increasing numbers of small boats have been moving a range of goods, especially fuel, along the coast from the Dominican Republic to Haiti, evading detection by ships policing the embargo. The US is the Dominican Republic's main trading partner, and the Caribbean nation benefits from duty-free access to the US market for a wide range of products. The willingness and ability of the Dominican government to tighten sanctions has been affected by political confusion. A recount will begin tomorrow of votes cast in last week's presidential elections, amid repeated claims that extensive fraud had favoured Mr Joaquin Balaguer, the incumbent. 'With the confused political situation here, and the political tension generated by the presidential election, not many people expect the government to be able to pay much attention to the border,' said a diplomat in Santo Domingo. President Balaguer has publicly questioned the usefulness of the sanctions against Haiti, and is known to be far from enthusiastic about the return of Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's exiled president, whose reinstatement is being demanded by the United Nations. Mr Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, Mr Balaguer's main challenger in the race for the presidency, has sent officials from his social democrat Dominican Revolutionary party to seek support for his claims that he was denied victory through irregularities perpetrated by Mr Balaguer's conservative Social Christian Reform party. With 97 per cent of the votes declared by the Elections Board, Mr Balaguer led by about 30,000. Mr Pena Gomez, backed by foreign observers, claims that most of the estimated 200,000 people who could not vote last week were Revolutionary party supporters.</p>

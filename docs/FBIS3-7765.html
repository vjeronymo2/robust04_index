			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Sarajevo, Feb 26 (AFP) -- Residents of the  besieged Moslem-held town of Maglaj pleaded Saturday for UN  forces to protect the 35,000 civilians there, in reports  received from ham radio operators inside the town.    The operators, speaking on Radio Sarajevo, said "defense  lines are burning. It's the the final hell." They said two  ground-to-ground missiles had hit Maglaj Saturday. Serbs and  Croats are attacking the northern Bosnia town.    The appeals of the isolated Moslem pocket against an  offensive by better-armed Serbs recalled those of ham radio  operators last year from the eastern pockets of Gorazde and  Srebrenica. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, 10 mortar rounds hit the southern city of Mostar  Saturday but UN officials said the Moslem-Croat ceasefire was  generally holding. Ham radio operators speaking on Radio  Sarajevo said Croats were also firing anti-aircraft weapons.  The operators said UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi would be  visiting Mostar over the next few days.    Akashi's office in Sarajevo said the UN envoy was planning  to  visit the war-ravaged southern city of Mostar on Monday, but  that the trip had not received final confirmation. [passage  omitted]    The radio Saturday reported tank and mortar fire on the  northern and southern parts of the city.    UN humanitarian aid to Maglaj has been restricted by the  fighting. UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman  Kris Janowski said this week that Maglaj was "the most desperate  place in Bosnia food-wise and in every other way." [passage  omitted]    The ham radio operators said Serb helicopters were flying  over the town in defiance of the NATO-enforced no-fly zone over  Bosnia. They said no NATO planes were in the skies.    A UN spokesman meanwhile reported heavy shelling Monday in  the northern Bosnian town of Maglaj, in the first western  confirmation of intense fighting there.    UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Canadian  Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman said he could not provide more  details since the closest UN observers were three kilometres  (two miles) from the town.

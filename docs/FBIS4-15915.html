			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- UNIAN has learned that the 12 April  Russian-Ukrainian negotiations on the future of the Black Sea  Fleet ended in failure. The Russian side took a firm stand  refusing to agree to an inventory of the Black Sea Fleet against  its state in December 1991, which was insisted on by the  Ukrainian delegation led by First Deputy Minister of Foreign  Affairs Borys Tarasyuk. The sides failed to reach agreement on  the issues discussed.    The other issue was an inquiry into the causes of the  incident involving the Black Sea Fleet ship Cheleken on the  night of 8 April in the Odessa port. A high-ranking official of  Ukraine's Ministry of Defense who asked not to be identified  said it was very likely that the hydrographic ship Cheleken  carried a commercial cargo, which, had it been discovered, could  have led to an undesirable argument. According to the same  source, Black Sea Fleet ships have recently been performing  unsupervised commercial trips to foreign countries in the Black  and the Mediterranean seas.    After the end of the interstate negotiations,  Ambassador-at-Large Yuriy Dubinin, who led the Russian  delegation, and Russian Navy Commander Felix Gromov met the  president of Ukraine. Asked by UNIAN to comment on the talks  and the meeting with Leonid Kravchuk, Yuriy Dubinin said he and  the president of Ukraine had agreed not to disclose their  content in the media.</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Assurance over Pakistan credit The Pakistani government yesterday acknowledged that government borrowings from the central bank had increased rapidly this year, but said it hoped the trend would change by next month, with new credit raised from non-bank borrowing and an increased flow of external commercial bank credits. The former government of Mr Moeen Qureshi, the caretaker prime minister, had set a target of Rs20bn (Dollars 660m) for official borrowings for the whole year, down from last year's Rs65bn. However, during its three months in office his government borrowed Rs28bn, while the new government of Ms Benazir Bhutto has borrowed another Rs5bn, with almost seven months before the current fiscal year ends in June. The borrowings have raised fresh concern that the government may not meet its crucial economic targets, notably reducing the federal budgetary deficit. Pakistan hopes to negotiate IMF and World Bank loans worth almost Dollars 1.5bn within the next three months, and reducing the deficit would be one of the most critical conditions. Last year's deficit reached 7.5 per cent of gross domestic product, against a target of 5.5 per cent. Islamabad is trying to bring this year's deficit down to 5.4 per cent. Mr V A Jafarey, the prime minister's adviser on finance and the de facto finance minister, said in an interview yesterday: 'It is true that we have inherited a large increase in borrowings from the State Bank', the central bank. However, he hoped that the borrowings would start coming down within the next three weeks, once the government was able to raise fresh funds through officially backed savings schemes, bonds and external finances in the form of commercial bank loans. Some officials expect further improvements in the country's economic performance in coming months, with a recent recovery in the foreign exchange reserves to some Dollars 800m, up from around Dollars 180m in July.</p>

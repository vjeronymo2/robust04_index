			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> UPPER MIDWEST DIGS OUT AFTER STORM CUTS OFF POWER, CLOSES 3 AIRPORTS  </P> <P> The upper Midwest was digging out Friday from a fierce storm with high winds  that dumped as much as 15 inches of snow, blacked out at least 138,000 power  customers, blew roofs off buildings and closed three major airports.  </P> <P> Four people died of heart attacks while shoveling snow from the storm,  authorities said, three in Wisconsin and one in Illinois.  </P> <P> Lightning injured 12 people in Illinois, and snow made driving treacherous from  Iowa to Ohio.  </P> <P> "This is the rural mailman's worst nightmare," said Tanis Lehmann, postmaster  in Cedar, Mich. "I worry like a mother hen until my carriers come back."  </P> <P> More than a foot of snow fell in Michigan's Lower Peninsula.  </P> <P> Utilities reported at least 84,000 customers lost power in Michigan, 44,000 in  Wisconsin and 10,000 in Illinois. In most cases, power was back on Friday.  </P> <P> Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, which got nearly 10 inches of  snow, was closed for 13 hours Thursday because of drifting snow and poor  visibility.  </P> <P> Airports in St. Louis and Detroit closed for shorter periods of time, while  O'Hare and Midway airports in Chicago remained open but had at least half their  flights canceled.  </P> <P> Eleven people were struck by lightning in a factory parking lot in Crystal  Lake, Ill., 35 miles northwest of Chicago, and a 12th person was struck in  nearby Palatine. None were seriously injured.  </P> <P> "I feel lucky to be alive," said Apolonio Pena, 37, one of the Precision Twist  Drill Co. workers struck by lightning as they were trying to help push cars out  of 6 inches of new snow. The bolt hit a telephone pole next to the plant and  traveled through the snow.  </P> <P> "There was a big, loud boom and then a flash," Pena said. "I felt like I had  been knocked down, but I was really standing up. It was really strange. Sparks  came out of my fingers."  </P></p>

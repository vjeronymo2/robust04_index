			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] When the Legislative Assembly approved the decree  whereby compensation for demobilized Army troops was  established, it only included field personnel or, in other  words, former soldiers. The Association of Demobilized Armed  Forces Members [Adefaes], however, requested and succeeded in  having the decree reformed to include military hospital  personnel.    Now, for the third time, they are requesting another reform  to include administrative personnel who were dismissed due to  the peace agreements. An unidentified Adefaes spokesman  addressed the issue.    [Begin unidentified Adefaes spokesman recording] We were not  consulted on the decree that was passed, and it is incomplete  because it deprives a great many people of compensation  benefits. Our concern is that all the people who have been left  out are entitled to benefits. [end recording]    Adefaes expects a positive response to its petition from the  Legislative Assembly. Otherwise, its unidentified spokesman  said, it will exert pressure.    [Begin unidentified spokesman recording] There may be some  violence. If they do not meet our demands we will have no other  alternative. We will gradually intensify our efforts and, I  repeat, the time bomb may explode. [end recording]    On this occasion everything seems to indicate that Adefaes'  request will be resolved in its favor because the two largest  factions in the Assembly support the petition.    [Begin recording] [First unidentified deputy] Directly or  indirectly, whether they were on the battlefield or they held  administrative positions at garrisons, these people were  involved in the conflict and they served the Armed Forces. I  believe their request is fair.    [Second unidentified deputy] They requested a reform to  include military hospital nurses. I do not believe that  administrative personnel should be left out either. [end  recording]    Another group requiring immediate attention are soldiers  maimed in the war. According to Deputy Carranza, efforts are  being made to establish a fund for the war maimed, which would  be included in next year's extraordinary budget.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Low turnout characterized early morning voting in  almost all the polling stations in Kakamega's [western Kenya]  three constituencies, where by-elections are taking place today.    An early morning survey by KTN in Lurambi, Ikolomani, and  Shinyalu constituencies revealed that all the polling stations  opened at 0600. By 1000 very few stations had registered more  than 20 voters. The three constituencies have between 20,000 to  30,000 registered voters. Throughout the constituencies, people  went about their normal activities as if they were not aware of  the by-elections taking place. However, KTN noted some  encouraging turnouts in a few polling stations, particularly in  Ikolomani constituency followed by a few polling stations in  Kakamega town which is largely in Lurambi constituency. Most of  the voters seen were women and youth who came trickling in small  groups or singly.    KANU [Kenyan African National Union] and FORD [Forum for the  Restoration of Democracy]-Kenya officials who had been on an  early morning roundup of the polling stations in the three  constituencies told KTN that they were satisfied with the  polling arrangements except for a few anomalies which they had  detected in some polling stations. In Kakamega town's  industrial area, the town's mayor, (Morgan Magaga), alleged that  FORD-Kenya youth were intimidating voters, asking them to vote  for their party.</p>

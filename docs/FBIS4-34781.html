			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marcela Gutierrez from the "ACIR Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari announced today  that the president of the National Human Rights Commission,  Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, will be the new peace and reconciliation  commissioner for Chiapas starting today.    Following a series of speculations as to who would replace  Manuel Camacho Solis as peace commissioner, Mexican President  Carlos Salinas de Gortari appointed the president of the  National Human Rights Commission, Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, the new  peace and reconciliation commissioner for Chiapas. Shortly  after 1500, the Mexican president issued a message in which he  reiterated the Mexican Government's commitment to resolve the  Chiapas conflict through peaceful means. He added that  democratic progresses and welfare with justice is not achieved  through violence. Let us listen to what he said:    [Begin Salinas recording] I reaffirm my commitment to  dialogue and negotiation as a means of attaining peace in  Chiapas. This is a commitment to the political solution of the  conflict. We rule out violence and the use of force as methods  to promote and make social demands. As a demonstration of this  determination to seek peaceful solutions to the conflict, I have  invited Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, who has accepted, to resume the  dialogue and attain the worthy peace demanded by Chiapas. [end  recording]    President Salinas said in the Vicente Guerrero Room of the  Los Pinos Presidential Palace that his government will make  additional efforts to find political solutions to the Chiapas  problem. He also agreed to make progress toward democracy  together with the political parties and the nongovernmental  organizations. In a five-point message, the president stated  his determination to resume the talks and attain peace in  Chiapas. In Point No. 3, President Salinas said the Mexican  Army will maintain a unilateral cease-fire declared on 12  January as long as it is not attacked. He added that patrols at  the southern border, as well as the operations to prevent  gunrunning activities in the area, will continue. In Point No.  4, the president reiterated his commitment to strengthen social  and economic actions in Chiapas in the areas of agriculture,  health, and nutrition. Finally President Salinas said he will  keep the public informed about the progress made in the peace  process.    As the president read the message, Madrazo Cuellar stood to  the right of the president. Salinas gave him his full support  so that his mission as peace commissioner may be successful. It  is expected that the president will immediately ask the Senate  to approve the Mexican ombudsman's leave and allow him to fully  dedicate himself to his duties as peace commissioner.    We have in our hands Jorge Madrazo Cuellar's resume. I am  going to be brief. Among his many academic duties and jobs, he  was secretary of the Technical Council of Humanities of the  National Autonomous University of Mexico [UNAM] between January  and September of 1977, academic secretary of the Legal Research  Institute of the UNAM, member of the Editorial Commission of the  Legal Research Institute, and member of the Scientific and  Humanities Information Center of the UNAM between 1981 and 1987.

This is quite long. He has been  constitutional law professor at the UNAM's School of Law.    On 6 December 1982, Jorge Madrazo Cuellar was promoted to  the  rank of researcher in charge of the Legal Research Institute of  the UNAM.

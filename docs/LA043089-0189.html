			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TISCH GETTING REPUTATION AS MEDIA'S 'WRONG WAY CORRIGAN'  </P> <P> No matter how lustily they cheer you one moment, an audience can turn sullen  and sour the next. That's a fact well known to show business pros, and one that  a relative newcomer to the business, CBS Inc. Chief Executive Laurence A.  Tisch, may be learning.  </P> <P> Tisch was applauded mightily for the prices he got when he sold off CBS'  magazine, record and music publishing businesses in 1986 and 1987. But at least  some in his audience now say this acknowledged master of corporate husbandry  might have missed a run-up in media prices and sold too cheaply.  </P> <P> The critics point out that the magazine division was sold for $650 million in  June, 1987, to a buyer who in 10 months had resold it in pieces for a total of  $1 billion. The music publishing unit, unloaded by CBS in December, 1986, for  $125 million, was resold last January for $337 million.  </P> <P> What's more, executives such as David Geffen, chairman of Geffen Records, and  Bob Buziak, president of RCA Records, believe that CBS could have gotten  another $1 billion when it sold CBS Records to Sony for $2 billion in early  1988.  </P> <P> "I just wish Larry Tisch would sell me something," said Geffen, whose record  company is an affiliate of Warner Communications.  </P> <P> Indeed, some industry executives have come to view Tisch as the Wrong Way  Corrigan of the media business as they have watched him sell properties when  others were snatching them up to build communications conglomerates.  </P> <P> The contrast between CBS and the pack has been striking recently as Time Inc.  has agreed to merge with Warner Communications, Sony has prowled for a movie  studio, and foreign conglomerates Bertelsmann A. G., Hachette S. A. and Rupert  Murdoch's News Corp. have sought to expand their empires.  </P> <P> "Everybody else has been scrambling to prepare for the competition of global  media companies, and CBS has been bailing out," says RCA's Buziak.  </P> <P> Tisch staunchly defends the prices CBS got as the best available at the time,  or now. He notes that when CBS unloaded the properties, the conventional wisdom  was that buyers had overpaid.  </P> <P> "We sold at peak prices," he says, defining the top price as "what you can get  in cash -- not in conversation."  </P> <P> CBS' asset sales have been a sensitive subject virtually since the board room  coup in September, 1986, that gave the chief executive's title to Tisch. While  Tisch had wide support for his plan to restore stability after two years of  takeover threats and low morale, some employees, investors -- reportedly even  directors -- opposed a divestiture strategy that they felt ran counter to the  original vision of CBS founder William S. Paley.  </P> <P> But Tisch persevered, believing that the non-broadcast divisions weren't worth  the distraction to management. The other businesses hadn't been as profitable  as broadcasting or, like the record business, were dangerously volatile, he  felt.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Peeling Away Layers  </P> <P> In peeling away CBS' layers, Tisch was applying the strategy that earned him  profit and praise when Loews Corp., of which he is chairman, took over CNA  Financial Services in 1974.  </P> <P> Loews won the insurance company in a bitterly contested takeover battle, then  sold off such extraneous properties as CNA's nursing home, dental supply and  second-mortgage businesses. With a tighter focus, CNA boomed.  </P> <P> Apparently with that success in mind, Tisch sold CBS' 21 consumer magazines in  June, 1987, to an investor group that included CBS Magazines Chief Executive  Peter Diamandis, other managers and the Prudential Insurance Co. The magazine  group was one of the biggest around and included such titles as Woman's Day,  Stereo Review and Car &amp; Driver.  </P> <P> The price of $650 million was dizzying when considered as a multiple of the  company's cash flow, the standard often used to measure such deals. (Cash flow  is net income plus depreciation and other non-cash charges.) The price  represented 14 times CBS Magazines' cash flow at a time when other magazine  companies were going for between eight and 10 times cash flow.  </P> <P> Some in the industry wondered whether Diamandis would be able to pay off his  prodigious debts.  </P> <P> A disappointed bidder was Hachette S.A., the French publishing conglomerate  that was searching the world media market with hungry eyes. Hachette officials  had opened talks at a price under $500 million, moved up to $570 million and  then "wouldn't go a penny higher," says Tisch.  </P> <P> Within a few months of the sale, the newly formed Diamandis Communications Inc.  sold off seven of its new titles in several deals. Then, to everyone's  astonishment, Diamandis announced that Hachette had bought the remaining 14  titles for $712 million. It was $142 million more than Hachette had previously  bid for the whole 21-magazine group, and it brought the Diamandis group's gross  profit from the magazines' resale to $350 million.  </P> <P> Hachette topped its earlier bid partially because Diamandis had cut overhead to  streamline the company. But the higher bid was also a sign of a growing  interest in magazine concerns and the steady stream of cash they provide to  companies that own them.  </P> <P> That new interest has helped lift prices for top magazine properties to between  12 and 14 times cash flow, investment bankers say.  </P> <P> The most striking example of the new demand for top-tier magazines came last  August, when Rupert Murdoch paid a dizzying $3 billion, or 15 times cash flow,  to buy Triangle Publications, owner of TV Guide.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Defends Prices  </P> <P> Diamandis defends the price he paid and the one he got. "When I bought, I made  CBS look smart; when Hachette bought they made me look smart," he said. "In a  couple of years, the French will look smart, too."  </P> <P> Tisch seems less sure of that. He considers Hachette's purchase a "fluke."  </P> <P> "By any standard of business, they overpaid," he said. "But if they're happy,  fine. I can't be responsible for what people do."  </P> <P> Some people wondered whether a partnership called SBK Entertainment World  overpaid when they bought CBS' music publishing business, called CBS Songs, in  December, 1986. The $125-million price set a new record for music publishing  companies, which own the rights to songs and profit by collecting royalties  when anyone plays them.  </P> <P> CBS Songs had an inventory of 250,000 titles, including such timeless tunes as  "Singing in the Rain," and "Over the Rainbow." But the unit had never been of  much interest to CBS' top brass; some insiders said flatly that it was poorly  managed.  </P> <P> So Tisch was happy to agree when CBS Records boss Walter Yetnikoff suggested  that the company open negotiations to sell the property.  </P> <P> When SBK outbid a management-led investor group to win, it began streamlining  the company and got more aggressive in making anybody who used its songs pay up  for the privilege.  </P> <P> As a result, the partnership quickly drove up a key measure of its  profitability, the so-called net publisher's share, or revenues minus artists'  royalties. Within two years, net publisher's share rose 70% to $37 million.  </P> <P> But those improvements were part only part of the reason that Thorn/EMI, a  London conglomerate, was willing to buy the company last January for three  times what SBK paid for it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Heating Up  </P> <P> The other key factor was the market for music publishing businesses, which was  heating up rapidly. Music publishers' profitability had begun to rise because  of an increase in the standard royalty that publishers receive and an explosion  of foreign demand for Anglo-American songs with the wider international  penetration of television.  </P> <P> While these publishing units formerly sold for four to eight times their annual  net publisher's share, now some were going for 11 times that figure, or more.  Among other pace-setting deals was Warner Bros. Music's 1987 purchase of the  400,000-song Chappell &amp; Co. for about $250 million.  </P> <P> Tisch says he can't take responsibility for the CBS Songs deal, since the price  was negotiated by Yetnikoff and the divestiture had been approved by his  predecessor, former CEO Thomas Wyman, when Tisch joined the company.  </P> <P> Still, he defends the price. "It looked like a hell of a sale at the time,"  Tisch says.  </P> <P> CBS Records' sale price of $2 billion looked equally impressive when CBS  negotiated the deal with Sony Corp. in December, 1987.  </P> <P> Indeed, it seemed startlingly high compared to the $1.25 billion that Tisch  initially asked. Some wondered whether the Japanese company hadn't gone too far  in its desire to buy up the "software" needed to complement its audio hardware.  </P> <P> But some evaluations changed as the surging profits in the record business  helped drive up prices and sparked buyers' interests. Last year turned out to  be a red-letter year for the industry, partly due to continued strong domestic  sales of CDs and partly to the growth of demand for American music overseas.  Many executives in the business expect the gravy train to keep rolling.  </P> <P> "CD players are in 12% of homes, but by 1995 that will be 60%," says record and  movie magnate Geffen. "A lot more players means a lot more CDs."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shared in Prosperity  </P> <P> CBS Records has shared in the prosperity. Its pretax earnings surged to $340  million in 1988 from $187 million in 1987. Chief Executive Yetnikoff has told  associates that, so far this year, the company's sales have topped those of  1988 on a month-to-month basis.  </P> <P> Tisch, like some other analysts, is not nearly so bullish. CBS had a management  consultant study the future of the music business, he says, and decided that  the profitability of CDs would fall off sharply.  </P> <P> "We were making $4 a disc, but new capacity comes on, competition comes in --  these things never last forever," he says.  </P> <P> Tisch says CBS Records' recent profits are misleading. While 1988 pretax  earnings reached $340 million, over the past five years earnings averaged about  $125 million, he says. And before the sale, CBS executives were concerned that  the labels of competitor Warner Communications were eating into its U.S. market  share.  </P> <P> Tisch maintains the CBS Records deal is better than most outsiders have  recognized because the contract provided that more than $200 million in CBS  Records assets would revert to CBS. By that measure, CBS actually got $2.2  billion for the property, Tisch says.  </P> <P> Many analysts and industry officials sympathize with Tisch's view that CBS sold  near the top, got good prices and shouldn't be faulted for later changes in the  market.  </P> <P> "J. P. Morgan made a fortune selling too early," said Ernest Levenstein,  analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton.  </P> <P> Tisch is certainly making no apologies for selling off CBS' non-broadcast  properties, though most of the media herd is thundering in the opposite  direction. In his view, arguments about building worldwide media powers are  "nonsense."  </P> <P> "How do our magazines help anybody compete worldwide?" he asks. "Knowing in  hindsight what I do today, I'd do it all over again."  </P></p>

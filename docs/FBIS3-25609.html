			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In Gabon, the Free Trade Unions' Confederation is  maintaining a firm stand. The indefinite strike it embarked  upon is in its third day. Jean-Claude Franck Medome toured the  streets of Libreville this afternoon and has this report.    [Medome] This afternoon, Libreville looked like a ghost  town.  The reason for this is that cabs were hard to find. Cab  drivers, who are usually victims of stone-throwing and attacks,  preferred to be cautious. This caution is all the more  justified because the atmosphere in Libreville varied from  suburb to suburb. There was precarious calm in certain areas  and persistent tension in others. This is abundant proof that  the security forces still have their hands full. The security  forces have not only reinforced their positions in areas prone  to violence but have also removed the stone, wood, and tire  barricades. Furthermore, the Gabonese are worried and surprised  by the disturbances and excesses, which started out as a  legitimate general strike to call for salary increase [words  indistinct] what the future holds.    There are other concerns and questions surrounding the  number  of victims of the disturbances. It has been officially  announced that at least four people have died. Two of them were  burned alive. It is, however, possible that more people died in  the maze of the streets of certain suburbs. It should be  pointed out that during the destruction of the National  Lumberjacks' Rally [RNB] radio station by security forces, six  persons including (Mba Ndakele), political adviser to the RNB  leader, and (Andre Heyegei), who is in charge of security, were  arrested and are still in police custody.    [Paris AFP in French in a Libreville-datelined item at 2010  GMT on 23 February adds the following: "State television,  quoting leaders of the security forces' crisis committee, has  announced that a senior corporal paratrooper in the Gabonese  Army was shot dead this afternoon in Libreville during  disturbances which have been going on in several popular suburbs  in Libreville over the past three days.    ["State television, quoting leaders of the crisis committee  also announced that the residence of the leading opposition  leader, Father Paul Mba Abessole, RNB chairman, was occupied in  the early evening by security forces who were chasing several  `armed Lumberjack activists.' An opposition spokesman told AFP  that Father Abessole was not at home at the time of the  operation and was not arrested.    ["It was announced on state television that Father Abessole  `is in good health.' It was also announced that `some people  were wounded but no one died' during this operation."]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Severely Punish Crimes of Theft </F> and Destruction"]    [Text] The Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic  of China pronounced severe punishments according to the law on  criminals involved in four major cases of stealing and  destroying railway, oil field and electric power equipment, and  telecommunications facilities in Heilongjiang, Guangxi, Henan,  and Hubei. The main culprits were given the death sentence.  These criminals caused serious harm to the country and the  people, and committed heinous crimes not to be tolerated by the  law.    Railways, oil fields, electric power supply, and  telecommunications are important, basic undertakings of the  country, and are also the lifeblood and support of the national  economy. The development and safety of these undertakings have  an important bearing on the national economy, the people's  lives, reform, and opening up. In the last few years, however,  the crimes of stealing and destroying railway, oil field, and  electric power equipment, and telecommunications facilities have  been quite rampant. Apart from this, stealing and destroying  farmland irrigation facilities and urban public facilities also  are apparent, and these crimes are committed in larger groups,  more openly, and with violence. Some lawbreakers have developed  from small-scale theft and trouble to daylight armed robbery,  defying laws both human and divine. We must pay close attention  to, and curb these criminal offenses, which seriously trample on  state property, damage economic construction, and endanger  social stability; we must not tolerate them. Violations of  criminal law must be subject to imprisonment, and no fines can  replace imprisonments. When severe sentencing is necessary, it  must be carried out; no softheartedness is allowed.    On the one hand, the people are carrying out construction  enthusiastically, but on the other, a small number of criminals  are wantonly engaged in theft and destruction. This situation  must be changed as soon as possible. This year is an important  one for establishing the socialist market economy structure and  for maintaining the sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu, kuai  su, jian kang, 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] development of the  national economy. Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform,  expanding the scope of opening up, promoting development, and  maintaining stability are the main aspects of the work of the  entire party and country. Party and government leading comrades  in all localities and departments must have a good idea of the  relations between reform, development, and stability; must  "carry out two types of work simultaneously and attach equal  importance to both"; and must take effective measures to curb  all crimes in the course of concentrating on economic  construction, reform, and opening up; so as to ensure smooth  economic construction, reform, and opening up.    From now on, we must never relax our efforts to severely  punish the crimes of theft and destruction. Special combat must  be conducted in regions where such crimes are rampant, so as to  concentrate our crackdowns on them. In this combat, we must  rely on the government; on public security departments,  procuratorates, and courts; as well as on the people. The  masses must be mobilized and organized in such a manner that  they regard themselves as masters of their own affairs in  cherishing and protecting state property. Every civilian must be  made to understand that state property is inviolable and that  state property is the property of all the people and is also  their own property. There is a need to conduct education on the  legal system so that everyone understands what violations of law  are and what criminal offenses are, so as to reduce and halt the  occurrence of criminal offenses and to make everyone fight  bravely against lawbreakers. The masses serve as a deterrent  force against criminals. When the masses are mobilized, they  will constitute a dragnet so that criminals have nowhere to hide.</p>

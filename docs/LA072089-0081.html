			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNUSUAL L.A. LANDMARKS  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission rejected a request  to designate a Studio City carwash-gas station-restaurant a cultural monument,  saying it has no architectural significance.  </P> <P>  Although this application for monument status did not succeed, Los Angeles  does have a number of seemingly offbeat official landmarks. In the last 27  years, officials have declared 440 houses, structures, oddities and other  locations as historic-cultural monuments. Of those, 90% are the usual buildings  or residences that come to mind when we think of landmarks. The remaining 10%  include more unusual items. Here is a sampler:  </P> <P> </P> <P> ROCKS  </P> <P> Eagle Rock, at northern terminus of Figueroa Street, Eagle Rock: Noted by  Spanish explorers and resembling the figure of an eagle in flight.  </P> <P> Stoney Point Outcroppings, North Chatsworth: East of Topanga Canyon Boulevard;  considered one of the most picturesque areas in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TREES  </P> <P> Avocado Trees, 4400 block of Avocado Street, Los Feliz: Eight 100-year-old  trees that were part of a vast grove.  </P> <P> Coral Trees, San Vicente Boulevard, Brentwood: Examples of the official tree of  the city of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Deodar Trees, Granada Hills: A total of 144 trees planted in 1932 and native to  the Himalayas; valued for their size and beauty.  </P> <P> Moreton Bay Fig Tree, National Boulevard at Military Avenue, West L.A.: Planted  in 1875 and described as "the greatest of Australian avenue trees."  </P> <P> Oak Tree, Louise Avenue south of Ventura Boulevard, Encino: Judged to be more  than 1,000 years old.  </P> <P> Palm Trees and Median Strip, Highland Avenue: Strip built and trees planted in  1928 by residents at their own expense.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MAN-MADE WONDERS  </P> <P> Chatsworth Reservoir Kiln Site: One of the locations where bricks and tiles  were made for the San Fernando Mission.  </P> <P> Gabrielino Indian Site, Fern Dell area of Griffith Park: At mouth of Fern Dell  Canyon, the location of a village of the Gabrielinos, who were native to the  area.  </P> <P> Gas Station, Sunset Boulevard near Barrington Avenue: Mission-style station  built in 1938, designated as being important culturally as well as  architecturally because, according to the application by residents, "it is  customary to see your neighbors at the gas station."  </P> <P> Granite-Block Paving, Bruno Street, downtown: A short, industrial street built  in 1902 and the last surviving one in Los Angeles with the original paving of  hand-hewn granite block.  </P> <P> Mission Wells and Settling Basin, Sylmar: Natural wells in swamplands that were  one of the vital factors in the decision by Franciscan padres to locate the  mission two to three miles west of the wells in 1797.  </P> <P> Tower of Wooden Pallets, 15357 Magnolia Blvd., Van Nuys: A tower of  approximately 2,000 wooden pallets, discarded by a brewery and constructed by  Daniel Van Meter in 1951 in his back yard.  </P> <P> Two Stone Gates, Beachwood, Westshire and Belden drives, Hollywood: Built by  European stonemasons in the early 1920s as the entrance to Hollywoodland  subdivision.  </P> <P> Venice Canal System: Created by Abbot Kinney and opened in 1905, with arched  bridges and imported gondolas from Italy.  </P> <P> Towers of Simon Rodia (Watts Towers), 1765 E. 107th St.: Internationally  acclaimed; built by Italian immigrant Rodia between 1921 and 1954.  </P> <P> William Stromberg Clock, 6439 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood: Street clock from  1927, associated with one of the boulevard's oldest retailers.  </P> <P> Source: Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POOL-TRAGEDY FIGURE LOSES CUSTODY;  </P> <P> HER 2 SONS TEMPORARILY MOVED TO GRANDPARENT'S HOME  </P> <P> Carol Brooks, the North Tustin baby-sitter at whose home one toddler drowned  and two others suffered brain damage after falling into a swimming pool, has  temporarily lost custody of her own two children.  </P> <P> Orange County Superior Court Commissioner Frank Fasel placed the children in  the Yorba Linda home of their paternal grandmother, Connie Duplex, at the  request of Brooks' ex-husband, Ken Duplex, who also lives in the home.  Permanent custody will be determined at a court hearing set for May 15.  </P> <P> Duplex, a 22-year-old plumber, alleged in court papers filed Wednesday that  Brooks, from whom he has been separated for about a year and a half, "has a  history of child abuse" and has kept the children in a "totally filthy"  environment.  </P> <P> "He knows what kind of a mother I am, and he knows I would never hurt my  children," Brooks said in an interview Thursday. "So, he's trying to use the  pool accident."  </P> <P> The two children, Alex, 2, and Daniel, 1, were inside the gated and fenced pool  area when Brooks found the three other toddlers at the bottom of the murky pool  on March 30.  </P> <P> The Orange County district attorney's office has not yet decided whether to  file charges against Brooks because of the swimming pool incident, in which  14-month-old Arthur Matthew Griese died. Melissa Polsfoot, 19 months, of Tustin  is in a coma in stable condition; Jonathan Weston, 22 months, of North Tustin  is reported in stable condition but not in a coma. Doctors have said that both  children suffered severe brain damage.  </P> <P> "This emergency situation occurring at my ex-wife's residence has made me  deathly afraid regarding my boys' living situation," Duplex said in his  declaration.  </P> <P> Brooks, 24, helped her parents run the unlicensed day-care home, which county  social services workers had twice ordered closed.  </P> <P> Brooks' alleged abuse of her own children stems from an incident that occurred  at a gas station in Newport Beach last July. Duplex claims that Brooks, angry  that her former husband was unwilling to try to reconcile their differences,  grabbed Alex by the arm, whipped him over her shoulder and slammed him to the  sidewalk.  </P> <P> Brooks disputed that account of the incident in an interview Thursday.  </P> <P> "I mean, think about it," she said. "If I had done that on a busy street in  Newport Beach, don't you think we would have had a circle of people around us?"  </P> <P> Brooks' version of the incident is that Duplex wanted to take Alex away from  her and that, in the struggle, she ripped Duplex's shirt. Alex was never taken  out of her car, she contended.  </P> <P> Duplex's attorney, John Balent, said the incident was included in Duplex's  declaration Wednesday to persuade Fasel to take the children away from Brooks.  </P> <P> "I know the judge well enough that he's not going to move them just because she  was watching children when they fell into a pool," Balent said.  </P> <P> Brooks said she could not understand why Fasel placed the children in Duplex's  house, given his current legal problems.  </P> <P> Duplex was arrested April 2 on a warrant charging him with assault and battery  and threatening a witness. He was held overnight in Orange County Jail and is  now awaiting trial on the charge.  </P> <P> Balent said the charges were based on false complaints filed by Brooks.  However, Orange County Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Richard J. Olson said  details of the case were not immediately available.  </P> <P> Brooks further alleged that Duplex owes her $855 for about 3 months' child  support.  </P> <P> Duplex Thursday acknowledged that he is in arrears on child-support payments.  "Right after I got the divorce, I lost my job," he said. He earns less than he  used to at his new job in Riverside County and so far has been unable to catch  up on the $300 monthly payments, he said.  </P> <P> Duplex and Brooks met at a fast-food restaurant where both worked a few years  ago, Brooks said. They married in September, 1986, and were separated about a  year later.  </P> <P> "We were both unstable with the marriage. He was not grown up enough," she  said. "I was young and stupid."  </P> <P> Brooks was granted visitation privileges three times a week, pending the May  hearing.  </P> <P> "They're too young to be involved in this stuff," Brooks said about her two  boys. "They don't understand why there is all this upheaval and why they are .  . . living somewhere else."  </P></p>

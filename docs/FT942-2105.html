			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Bretton Woods - 50 Years: Recapturing a lost spirit - Ronald McKinnon in the first of a series marking the anniversary of Bretton Woods Half a century after its signing in New Hampshire in 1944, the Bretton Woods Agreement on currency convertibility and exchange rate stability holds its mystical allure. In the industrial countries today - with resurgent protectionism, recurrent over- or under-valued exchange rates, high unemployment, and slow growth - people talk wistfully of recapturing the spirit of Bretton Woods. It seems a noble quest. But is the 1944 agreement the right starting point for international monetary reform today? After 1945, currencies in western Europe and Japan remained inconvertible and in inflationary disarray. Trade remained bartered, narrowly bilateral, and so limited that output in Europe and Japan stayed unnaturally depressed well into 1948. Furthermore, either because its mandate was incorrectly drawn or its financial resources were too slender, the International Monetary Fund did nothing to relieve this currency impasse and the post-war economic crisis. The great rescue operation was engineered not by the IMF but by the Marshall Plan, from mid-1948 through early 1952, in Europe, and by the 1949 Dodge Plan in Japan. By 1951, the virtual elimination of inflation in western Europe and Japan was followed by 20 years of stable (some would say unduly rigid) exchange rates based on the US dollar - whose purchasing power over tradeable goods also remained constant until about 1968. What can be called the 'Marshall-Dodge fixed-rate dollar standard' led a healthy life until 1971, when President Nixon insisted that the dollar be devalued, to avoid disinflating the American economy. Both the Marshall and Dodge plans depended on direct dollar assistance from the US. But surprisingly strong conditions - the elimination of fiscal deficits and inflation, and the step-by-step elimination of currency restrictions on current trade - were attached. In Europe, the capstone was the European Payments Union (EPU), established in September 1950 for securing full multilateral clearing among central banks of 16 western European countries. To ensure credibility, the US dollar was enthroned both as the unit of account and means of settlement within the EPU. European governments declared exact dollar parities, to facilitate clearing international payments and secure a 'nominal anchor' for their war-ravaged financial systems. Similarly, Japan fixed the yen at 360 per dollar, as an anchor for its successful disinflation in 1949-50. To maintain their dollar parities, European countries and Japan subordinated their domestic monetary policy to their fixed exchange rates. In what ways did the 1950-1970 Marshall-Dodge standard differ from the spirit of Bretton Woods? Marshall-Dodge imposed a common monetary standard on the industrial countries at the outset of the policy of fixing exchange rates. Participating industrial countries experienced roughly the same low rate of price inflation in tradeable goods - about 1 per cent per year - as the US. Why deny that the negotiators at Bretton Woods in 1944 wanted a stable common monetary standard, or at least wished for something similar to Marshall-Dodge? Keynes, who dominated the thinking of the conferees, drew up the Bretton Woods articles to give each national government flexibility in choosing its own macroeconomic policy, to secure full employment. Remembering the failure of the international gold standard in the inter-war period, Keynes did not want to establish any common monetary standard. Nor, because of his concern with 'hot' money flows in the 1920s and 1930s, did he want an unrestricted world capital market. He and his intellectual heirs subscribe to the principle of national macroeconomic autonomy. After the war, both Keynesians and monetarists rejected the idea that monetary autonomy be limited by international obligations. However, the Bretton Woods negotiators did want to restore normalcy in foreign trade on current account. Continual exchange rate fluctuations, and prolonged misalignments that upset a country's macroeconomic equilibrium, were to be avoided. A new par-value system restricted short-run exchange rate fluctuations within 1 per cent on either side of 'parity'. Exchange parities would be easy to enforce as long as capital controls remained in place. With economies insulated from each other on capital account, the main criterion for the IMF to agree exchange depreciation would be whether a country had an ongoing net trade deficit. Thus did the negotiators of 1944 imagine they had reconciled the principle of national macroeconomic autonomy with limitations upon exchange risk in international trade. With hindsight (and Milton Friedman), we now know inflationary national monetary policies cannot sustain higher levels of employment. But that was not the prevailing view at Bretton Woods in 1944. Despite its great success in practice, the 'accidental' advent of the Marshall-Dodge standard was a conceptual anathema to most professional economists in the 1950s and 1960s - with echoes to the present day. How does this potted history matter for reforming today's international monetary system? First, because international capital markets are now fully open, a trade deficit no longer warrants an exchange depreciation - which the old spirit of Bretton Woods encouraged. For example, the ongoing US current-account deficit has encouraged the American government to cajole the Japanese into two serious episodes of yen overvaluation - in 1986-87 and again in 1993-94. In both cases, a slump in private investment, because of the exchange overvaluation, caused a sharp downturn in the Japanese economy with no reduction in its current account surplus. Second, as with the Marshall-Dodge standard, securing more stable exchange and interest rates must proceed simultaneously with the international harmonisation of national monetary policies. The keystone must be a low or zero rate of inflation in a broad basket of tradeable goods. A second-best technique for providing a common nominal anchor is to turn the job over to a single dominant country whose own internal price level has been relatively stable. In some unusual historical circumstances, this may work well for a while. Yet any such asymmetrical standard remains vulnerable to upheavals in the centre country. Far better to negotiate a fully symmetrical agreement among hard-currency countries - like Japan and the US in the 1990s - for anchoring the price level of the group in a manner consistent with keeping nominal exchange rates stable into the indefinite future.

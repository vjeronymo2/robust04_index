			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / EBRD chairman to question Attali on spending GERMAN Finance Minister Theo Waigel, who is chairman of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, will question Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's president, within the next few days over allegations of excessive spending at the bank. Mr Waigel will raise the concerns over the bank's expenditure during a meeting with Mr Attali in Bonn before next week's annual meeting of the bank's governors. The controversy over the bank follows the disclosure that it has spent more than Pounds 200m in the past two years on fitting out its London offices, travel for executives, entertainment, and other running costs. During that period the bank has disbursed loans worth about Pounds 125m. Mr Waigel, in Tokyo for the emergency meeting of the Group of Seven foreign and finance ministers, referring to questions about the bank's spending, said: 'These may be points we will discuss at next week's meeting. I will do my duty as chairman of the bank to test the validity of these allegations.' Mr Waigel said he had already asked the bank for a report on allegations of excessive spending on private jets to take Mr Attali around Europe, the fitting out of the bank's London headquarters and its Christmas party in the ballroom of a London hotel. Mr Waigel said: 'If we find any unjustified expenditures we will draw the appropriate consequences.' The EBRD last night gave a breakdown of the money it spent on its previous headquarters in Leadenhall Street, London, which it occupied for 20 months until last December. Of Pounds 18m, Pounds 11.4m was paid in rent and Pounds 6.6m on fitting out the offices. It said half the Pounds 6.6m was spent on furniture and equipment, which it is now using at its new headquarters in Broadgate in the City of London. It added that 1,200 people attended its Christmas party, which cost Pounds 52,000, so the cost per head was Pounds 40. It is understood that Britain, the US and Canada have led criticism of Mr Attali's management of the bank. The US has been particularly critical of the slow rate at which the bank has extended loans. The US was at the centre of recent changes in the bank's management designed to speed up disbursement of loans, according to senior European officials.</p>

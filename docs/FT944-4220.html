			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Management: Time is up for 35-hour week - The European trend towards flexible working Reducing the hours people work is seen by many in the European Commission and inside European trade unions as an important means of alleviating mass unemployment. But as a conference in Dusseldorf organised by the European Trade Union Institute (ETUI) has painfully revealed this week, devising a credible Europe-wide strategy applicable to a diverse range of labour markets is going to be difficult. Many European trade unions appear to be shifting their position over working time, becoming increasingly flexible as they adapt to the more complex world of work. 'They have come to realise that a rigid working time policy, geared exclusively to a 35-hour working week, is no longer appropriate in the current state of society,' says Reiner Hoffman, the institute's research director. 'What is needed is a broad-based discussion of a variety of innovative working time policies.' For the past 18 years the European Trade Union Confederation - the organisation that represents most of the trade unions inside the European Union - has been committed to the goal of a 35-hour working week without loss of pay achieved through collective bargaining. This has mainly reflected a German male manufacturing manual worker point of view. But this no longer seems to be a relevant goal in an increasingly fragmented and divided labour market where a substantially large number of workers are now in part-time jobs or working in shifts around the clock. They recognise that new systems of production and new human resource management techniques have been accompanied by an increasing trend inside industries and services across the EU towards specific forms of working time flexibility. 'The major concern of the European employers is to reduce unit labour costs to a minimum in the interests of competitiveness,' explains Hoffman. Global market pressures have added to the need of many companies to change the ways working time is organised. More often than not this is being done without bargaining. Trade union responses to these developments have been defensive, piecemeal and grudging. However, there are growing signs of change. Dieter Schulte, president of the DGB, the German Trade Union Confederation, argues that the unions must establish a co-operative strategy with employers over working time. He also acknowledges that economic growth alone is unlikely to create enough jobs to resolve Europe's unemployment crisis. But the often confusing discussion revealed an enormous variety of contrasting union attitudes from the different EU countries. Some are coming to terms with the vast increase in part-time employment, most significantly the Dutch FNV union confederation which wants to encourage the spread of part-time employment among workers. 'It is an instrument for social change to achieve a better distribution of work for all, an improvement in women's employment participation and a fairer distribution of unpaid work outside the workplace,' argues Ieke Van den Berg, an FNV board member. Trade union officials from elsewhere in Europe, though, emphasised the need to annualise the number of hours people work as a means of reducing excessive overtime work and ensuring more stability in shift working. What was missing from the conference, however, was any real awareness of the conflicting views of European employers. Many union officials remain frozen in the views of nearly 20 years ago when trade unions in western Europe were stronger and more self-confident. Notwithstanding the ETUI's research papers which emphasised the need for productivity gains in return for cuts in working time, there seemed little awareness of the global pressures being imposed on employers to keep their unit labour costs under control.</p>

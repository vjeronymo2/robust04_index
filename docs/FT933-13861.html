			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A DEARTH of economic indicators left dealers in stock index futures suffering from a lack of direction and hampered movement in the September FT-SE 100 contract, Christine Buckley writes. While there had been some hopes circulating the previous day of a cut in German interest rates, they had all but faded by yesterday morning, and the announcement of no change had little effect on trading. The flagging performance of futures was also blamed by one trader on a continued switching of investor interest from the UK to Germany and France. Trading was restricted to a very tight range. The contract opened at 2,841, and a reasonable early morning take-up pushed it to the day's high of 2,849. It then eased gradually, touching a low for the session of 2,837 after lunchtime. But that nadir was brief and supportive buying kept the future bobbing around the 2,840 mark, at which it closed with volume of 7,287 contracts recorded. The September contract finished on a par with its fair value premium to cash, which is taken as 7 points. Turnover in traded options notched ahead of the previous day with a total of 28,814 lots traded, against 26,932. Volume in the FT-SE 100 option was 5,375, while the Euro FT-SE 100 option continued to see lively trading ahead of today's expiry of its July contract.</p>

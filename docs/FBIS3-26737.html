			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Jiao Ran (3542 3544)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 7 Feb (XINHUA) -- Taking the floor at the  recent "International Symposium on Rural Reform and Development  in China in the 1990's," Li Qitie, chief of China's first  "Peasant-Built City" -- Longgang Town in Wenzhou, Zhejiang --  proudly reported that his town, built by 6,000 peasants 10 years  ago, now has a population of 135,000 people, its industrial  output is approaching 2 billion yuan, and its secondary and  tertiary industries employ over 10,000 peasants each year on  average.    The 140 or so Chinese and foreign scholars at the meeting  spoke highly of the town's great achievements, saying it is a  path China can follow in urbanizing its rural areas, and that it  is also a great way in which the hundreds of millions of  peasants contribute to China's economic and social modernization  during the course of reform and opening up.    According to the Ministry of Construction, ever since the  adoption of the reform and opening up policy 15 years ago,  14,458 small towns (including county seats and towns with  established administrative organizations) with the necessary  infrastructure -- such as water and power supply systems, roads,  economic facilities, cultural and educational facilities, and  health services -- have emerged in both the north and south of  China, and in areas inside and outside the Great Wall, whereas  there were only 2,894 such cities in 1979. According to the  information, the total population of small towns in the country  (not including county seats) has reached 150 million, including  100 million people whose domiciles are not registered in these  towns. Moreover, close to 40,000 new market towns (townships  and villages where village enterprises are developed), which  have services comparable to those in cities, have emerged in  rural China.    Township and town enterprises have served as the powerful  "afterburners" of this urbanization. As result of the tides of  industrialization, which have gone on in coastal areas and in  the suburbs of large and medium cities for more than a decade,  factories, highways, telephones, banks, insurance service,  modern commercial business, hospitals, schools, and various  other things representing industrialization and urban  civilization have appeared in these thriving small towns. This  development is particularly conspicuous in the Zhu Jiang and  Chang Jiang deltas, the Jiaodong peninsula, and the Liaodong  peninsula. The historical opportunities created by reform and  opening up have changed Zhongshan, Shunde, Nanhai, and Dongguan  in Guangdong from ordinary small county seats in the past into  medium size cities with modern industries, commerce, banking  services, communications, telecommunications, medical health  services, and cultural and educational facilities. Because their  economic growth is higher than in the "four little dragons" of  Asia, the development in these cities has been described as an  economic miracle in China. Some townships and towns have also  developed into new cities around these cities. Although  administratively they are still called towns, these towns have  long- distance telephone and express postal services, bus  services, commercial centers, and other services peculiar to  modern cities. Their urbanization has far exceeded the level of  county seats in the past.    The urbanization in the Chang Jiang delta is comparable with  that in the Zhu Jiang delta. Because modern industries and  commercial businesses have put down roots, blossomed, and borne  fruit in thousands of famous and ancient towns in areas south of  the lower reaches of the Chang Jiang, the peasants there can now  enjoy modern living without having to leave their hometowns.  Moreover, these small towns' economic activities have reached  beyond provincial boundaries. The industrial output yielded by  Shengze Town in Jiangsu's Wujiang City has exceeded 5 billion  yuan, and the town has become one of the four major silk  capitals in China. The many highways criss-crossing the rural  areas have linked these small but industrially and  agriculturally developed towns with Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou,  Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Yangzhou, Shaoxing, and other large and  medium cities, forming new urban belts in which rural and urban  areas supporting each other in their quest for development.    What surprises people is that, because of the  industrialization in rural areas, many sparsely populated  hamlets in the past have now become new towns on the map of the  republic. For example, Bashan in Shandong's Zibo City used to  be a small village with only 1,000 or so villagers prior to  reform. Its per capita income was only a little more than 100  yuan. Now the village has a new name -- Wantongde Corporation,  Ltd. -- and the industrial output yielded by its 27 factories  and 12 foreign-funded enterprises has exceeded 500 million yuan.  In this village, there is the Wanjie Hospital, a world-class  hospital built with Chinese and U.S. funds, secondary vocational  schools, shopping malls, and guesthouses. Some scholars call  these places -- which are villages in name but small towns in  fact -- "village-class towns," and there are tens of thousands  of such "village-class towns" in China.    The economic development in ancient towns with relatively  developed communications services in Northwest and Southwest  China has also been revitalized as result of reform and opening  up. Fenglingdu by the Huang He and Linxia on the loess plateau  have again distinguished themselves as ancient towns. Thanks to  thriving border trade, small towns located along the China's  long borders have also found their opportunities for development.    Economic experts say that, as peasants have created for  themselves the opportunities and space for development, they  have blazed a practical way for China to create jobs for surplus  laborers in rural areas, to modernize agricultural production,  and to develop the rural market.    The transfer of surplus manpower is a formidable issue which  rural areas in China have to confront in their economic  development. According to estimates, by the end of this century,  over 100 million surplus laborers will be transferred from the  agricultural sector. The development of small towns not only can  help improve the environment for the development of town and  township enterprises and accelerate the modernization process of  the rural economy, but also can alleviate the pressure created  by the flow of peasants into large and medium cities. If each  small town can absorb 2,000 peasants over the next five years,  50,000 towns can absorb 100 million people. Thus, the state is  attaching great importance to the development of small towns and  has started planning to reform the system governing domicile  registration in small towns to facilitate the hundreds of  millions of peasants to work and do business in cities.</p>

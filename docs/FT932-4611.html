			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (13): Cost rules out competition - Michael Donne on plans for a second generation supersonic airliner THE outlook for any second-generation supersonic transport aircraft to replace the Concorde in the first decade of the next century - say, around 2005, by which time Concorde will have been in service for close to 30 years  -is still one of the great uncertainties in the world aerospace industry. Many people in the manufacturing industry are convinced that such a venture is technologically feasible, and that a market will emerge for it. Governments for the most part remain cautious, and the airlines, ravaged by the recession of the past 2 1/2 years, which has cost them billions of dollars, are at present in no mood to offer enthusiastic encouragement to such a venture. Even those that are broadly in favour, such as British Airways and Air France (the only two airlines now offering supersonic services with Concorde), say that any successor must not only be profitable to buy and fly from the start, but also environ- mentally acceptable in terms of noise and emissions in the upper atmosphere. To achieve these objectives, wide-ranging studies are being undertaken by the world's main aerospace manufacturers, including Aerospatiale of France, Alenia of Italy, British Aerospace and Deutsche Aerospace of western Europe, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas of the US, Tupolev of Russia and the Japanese aircraft industry, together with leading engine builders General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US and Rolls-Royce of the UK. These companies work together in a loosely-knit group, exchanging ideas, with each still possessing a significant level of independence. There is as yet no commitment by anyone to build anything. The notion of an eventual second-generation SST, however, is expected to gain something of a boost by President Clinton's insistence that the US government-owned National Aeronautics and Space Administration must focus more attention and money on aeronautics than on space affairs. Such a major policy change by Nasa seems likely not only to stimulate interest in second-generation SSTs, but also in such other new aircraft types as a subsonic 600-plus seater. The US president's plans for a commission to study ways of boosting the ailing US airline industry may also give some impetus to a second-generation SST programme. But all that appears to be emerging from the research so far is that an aircraft seating about 300 passengers, with a range of 5,600 to 6,000 nautical miles and a speed of a little more than twice that of sound, or 1,500 mph, but with considerably quieter and cleaner engines, might well be a feasible proposition for service from about 2005 onwards. This is a still a long way from any kind of coherent and practicable design, development, production and marketing plan. In the technological field, much more work has to be done in refining overall aerodynamic and structural design, in determining what new lightweight materials could and should be used - and in such areas as improved fuel consumption, reduced engine noise and less pollutant emissions. Of all these aspects, the latter two are among the most important. Even if all the other technological difficulties are solved, no second-generation SST will get off the ground if its engine noise and overall emissions levels, especially of nitrogen oxide (NOx), in the upper atmosphere are unacceptable. This will be especially so since environmental pressures seem likely to become even more severe, perhaps leading to a toughening of regulations on noise and emissions in commercial aviation by the early years of the next century. Other areas which have to be addressed are those of cost, and the detailed design, development and production arrangements. Concorde's development and production cost of around Pounds 1.9bn in 1975 monetary terms is roughly equivalent to more than Pounds 7bn in today's prices. Even allowing for improvements in production techniques, such as computer-aided design and manufacturing technology, and the extensive use of cost and weight-saving materials, a big second-generation SST is unlikely to cost less than Pounds 10bn for design, development and initial production. At that price, there is unlikely to be a market for two competing designs, if the currently loose consortium were to divide into two competing camps (perhaps with the US pitted against the rest), even if market forecasts of upwards of 300-plus such aircraft are considered realistic. Competing designs would inevitably result in a bitter SST war, with all that means for soaring costs, market fragmentation, and uncertain and even unprofitable returns. A more sensible scenario - already finding support in some of the companies involved - would be for the consortium to become much tighter, with an eventual agreement on a global co-operative venture, involving one common concept acceptable to all and with each sharing in the design, development and production programme, and in the costs. Provided the industrial partners could put together a convincing case for such a venture, supported by detailed market studies as to sales prospects, it is probable that any funds the partners themselves could subscribe would be supplemented by cash from the external financial community. Two other factors must also be taken into account. The first is how rapidly and how strongly the airline industry can recover from the current recession, recoup its losses and return to profits in the era of renewed traffic growth which lies ahead, thereby enabling it to embark upon procurement of ambitious new types of aircraft. The second is how well the external financial community can recover its own shaken confidence in commercial aviation as a long-term money-spinner, sufficiently not only to meet the airlines' needs for cash to finance their recovery and renewed growth, but also to help the development of such a speculative high-technology venture as a second-generation SST. Alternatively, governments could become directly involved financially, but past experience indicates there are many pitfalls in such an approach. The best solution would be for everyone - aerospace industry, airlines, governments and financial institutions worldwide - to become involved in a partnership to develop and market one design that all could use. Such a solution would be unprecedented in world commercial aviation, and would perhaps be difficult to achieve. But it may yet prove to be the only sensible and commercially viable way of ensuring that any second generation SST emerges early in the next century. Solving the technological and environmental problems may indeed be easier than the problems of sorting out the ultimate industrial and financial arrangements for such a major venture.</p>

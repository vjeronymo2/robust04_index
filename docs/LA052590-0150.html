			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NCAA CENTRAL REGIONAL AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> A capsule look at the six teams competing in the Central Regional of the NCAA  baseball championships, at Austin, Texas:  </P> <P> Texas  </P> <P> Record: 48-15  </P> <P> Coach: Cliff Gustafson, 23rd year  </P> <P> Conference finish: Second in the Southwest  </P> <P> How got here: Automatic berth for winning the conference tournament  </P> <P> Ranking: Fifth in the Collegiate Baseball-ESPN poll, seventh in Baseball  America poll  </P> <P> Comments: The Longhorns, who play Texas Arlington today at 5 p.m. PDT, have an  outstanding pitching staff that has a team earned-run average of 2.95. Their  ace is junior right-hander Kirk Dressendorfer, who is 12-3 with 148 strikeouts  and just 31 walks in 120 innings, despite suffering tendinitis in his shoulder.  Their No. 2 pitcher is junior left-hander Brian Dare, who is 7-2 with a 2.85  ERA and 78 strikeouts. Texas, which won 16 consecutive games from March 19 to  April 13, is led offensively by sophomore third baseman Clay King (.357, 17  doubles, 43 RBIs), junior second baseman David Tollison (.355, 12 home runs, 20  doubles, 66 RBIs), senior center fielder Lance Jones (.352, 13 doubles, seven  triples, 49 RBIs) and freshman first baseman Scott Pugh (.342, six home runs,  15 doubles, 30 RBIs). The Longhorns will make their 36th playoff appearance, an  NCAA record. They have played in the College World Series a record 25 times,  winning four national championships.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clemson  </P> <P> Record: 42-21  </P> <P> Coach: Bill Wilhelm, 33rd year  </P> <P> Conference finish: Second in the Atlantic Coast  </P> <P> How got here: At-large berth  </P> <P> Ranking: 23rd by Collegiate Baseball-ESPN  </P> <P> Comments: The Tigers, who play Creighton today at 11 a.m., have been a streaky  team. They opened with a 19-2 record but have gone 23-19 since March 22 and  have lost five of their last six games. They have a .305 team batting average  but have hit .266 in the last 12 games. Clemson's best player is junior  outfielder Brian Kowitz, who is batting .402 with 21 doubles, five triples and  59 RBIs. Kowitz, the leadoff batter who had a 37-game hitting streak at one  point this season, doesn't have blazing speed but has stolen 32 bases in 40  attempts. He has made one error in three seasons. Sophomore designated hitter  Joe DeBerry, the son of Air Force Academy football Coach Fisher DeBerry, is  batting .378 with 15 home runs and 68 RBIs, and junior first baseman Eric  Macrina is hitting .339 with 16 homers and 62 RBIs. Clemson doesn't have much  pitching depth, but the Tigers do have one solid starter in junior right-hander  Tim Parker, who is 7-4 with a 2.54 ERA and 89 strikeouts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton  </P> <P> Record: 32-21  </P> <P> Coach: Larry Cochell, third year  </P> <P> Conference finish: First in the Big West  </P> <P> How got here: Automatic berth for winning the conference  </P> <P> Ranking: 17th by Collegiate Baseball-ESPN, 21st by Baseball America  </P> <P> Comments: The Titans' 6 p.m. game against Old Dominion tonight will mark their  13th playoff appearance in 16 years. But for the first two months of the  season, it didn't appear Fullerton would challenge for a playoff berth. The  Titans struggled offensively, received sporadic pitching performances and  played .500 ball throughout February and March. But they got hot as conference  play started and have been on a roll ever since, winning 14 of their last 19  games. Fullerton has three solid starting pitchers in right-handers James  Popoff (10-4, 3.66 ERA) and Sam Colarusso (6-3, 3.30 ERA) and lefty Huck Flener  (7-1, 3.78 ERA), but much of their success could depend on reliever Chris  Robinson. Third baseman Phil Nevin, the leadoff hitter who is batting .353 with  14 home runs and 48 RBIs, has keyed the offensive surge, and the Titans have  two consistent hitters behind him in second baseman Mate Borgogno (.379, 15  doubles, 53 RBIs) and left fielder Rich Gonzales (.382, 37 RBIs).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Old Dominion  </P> <P> Record: 40-17  </P> <P> Coach: Pat McMahon, first year  </P> <P> Conference finish: Second in the Sun Belt  </P> <P> How got here: At-large berth  </P> <P> Ranking: Unranked  </P> <P> Comments: McMahon, a former Mississippi State assistant who replaced Mark  Newman as coach last August, has had success using many of the players from  last season's 26-26 team. But part of the Monarchs' resurgence can be  attributed to a newcomer, freshman pitcher Steve Lyons from West Springfield,  Va. The right-hander went 10-2 with a 3.18 ERA during the regular season,  striking out 54 and walking 35 in 99 innings. Old Dominion's two other top  starters are sophomore right-hander Jeff Ware (9-2, 3.52 ERA, 72 strikeouts)  and junior lefty George Sells (4-3, 3.74 ERA.) Sells plays the outfield when he  isn't pitching and is one of the Monarchs' top hitters with a .353 average,  nine home runs and 35 RBIs. Other top offensive players are outfielder Scott  Thomson (.401, five homers, eight triples, 17 doubles, 38 RBIs), third baseman  Ty Hawkins (.333, 24 RBIs) and catcher Scott Hafling (.325, 23 RBIs).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Creighton  </P> <P> Record: 46-20  </P> <P> Coach: Jim Hendry, sixth year  </P> <P> Conference finish: Third in the Missouri Valley  </P> <P> How got here: At-large berth  </P> <P> Ranking: 24th by Baseball America  </P> <P> Comments: The Bluejays, who finished behind NCAA participants Wichita State and  Southern Illinois in their conference, set a school record for victories and  will be making their first playoff appearance in 18 years. They have one of the  nation's top pitchers in junior left-hander Dan Smith, who is 13-3 with a 1.71  ERA. Smith, who led Team U.S.A. in seven statistical categories last summer,  set school records for complete games (11), shutouts (five), strikeouts (126)  and fewest earned runs allowed by a starter (21). Creighton's No. 2 pitcher is  right-hander Mike Heathcott, who is 7-2 with a 3.32 ERA. Offensively, the  Bluejays are led by sophomore first baseman Scott Stahoviak, who is batting  .406 and leads the team with 86 hits, 61 runs and 24 doubles. He has 45 RBIs  and has struck out only 27 times in 212 at-bats. Third baseman Pat Mooney leads  the team in home runs with nine but hasn't hit one since April 24.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Texas Arlington  </P> <P> Record: 31-28  </P> <P> Coach: Butch McBroom, 17th year  </P> <P> Conference finish: First in the Southland  </P> <P> How got here: Automatic berth for winning the conference  </P> <P> Ranking: Unranked  </P> <P> Comments: McBroom has won more than 500 games in 19 years as a head coach, but  this will be his first trip to the NCAA tournament. The Mavericks were 9-17 in  mid-March but have gone 22-11 in the second half of the season. They swept a  doubleheader from Sam Houston State on the final day of conference play to win  their first-ever Southland championship. Mirroring the team's turnaround has  been sophomore shortstop Lawrence Hanlon, who started the season with a  1-for-37 slump but hit .500 (22 for 44) in conference games. Outfielder Tony  Vilaros leads the team in hitting with a .323 average, five home runs and 33  RBIs, but the Mavericks, with a .253 team batting average, don't have much  offensive punch. Their top pitcher is junior right-hander Lee Jones, a transfer  from Louisiana Tech who has an 8-4 record and a 3.16 ERA. Texas Arlington has a  solid reliever in sophomore right-hander Gary Paul, who has appeared in 26  games and has a 2-2 record, 2.41 ERA and five saves.  </P></p>

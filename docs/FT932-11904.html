			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / UK Company News: Fenner confirms takeover approach based producer of power transmission equipment, industrial conveyor belting and fluid power products, which has seen its profits slide over the past few years yesterday responded to the recent sharp rise in its share price by confirming takeover interest in the company. Fenner said it had 'received indications of interest which might or might not lead to an offer being made' for the company. The shares have risen from 65p over the past week and yesterday closed 1p higher at 85p following the company's statement. At this level the group is valued at Pounds 37m. The statement immediately increased speculation that Wassall, the mini-conglomerate which acquired a 1.6 per cent stake last June, might be preparing a bid. Mr Chris Miller, Wassall's chief executive, would not comment yesterday. Mr Mark Abrahams, Fenner's finance director, said the statement was made in the interests of shareholders, and without any acceptance or denial of the speculation about Wassall. The announcement raises the prospect of a bid for a company which has recently been going through a difficult period. Over the last three years pre - tax profits have fallen from Pounds 16.4m to Pounds 5.5m in 1991 - 92. In February Mr Tom Brown resigned as managing director and on March 26 Fenner said it expected to report an attributable loss for the six months to February 28.</p>

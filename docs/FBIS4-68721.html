			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with President of Kyrgyzstan Askar Akayev by </F> Mikhail Serdyukov in Bishkek; date not given: "I Am Looking for  the Formula for Life"]    [Text] Question to Kyrgyz Radio: "What Does  Kyrgyzstan have in abundance and what is lacking?" Answer: "We  have a lot of lazy and foolish people, and Akayev has no  alternative."    "That is it," said the president, "I am leaving...."    He said that to his wife, but she knows him very well  and she was not very frightened. Again the opposition...both  looked out the window. The sun played on the nearby mountains,  covered with eternal snow. In such moments, if they managed to  remain alone, they did not turn out the light in the residence.    "I will leave if I get less than two-thirds of the  votes on the referendum," stated the president.    "Oh, God almighty!" Mayram begged. "When will you  deliver our family from such words?" She was praying,  understandably, for herself.    Is Allah present in Kyrgyzstan? The president received  98 percent of the votes. The figure reminds one of the days of  stagnation, but that is a part of the past. The people were left  with their chosen one, and his wife with her fate.    As the sun went down we drank tea and complained about  the spring: It brought nothing but disaster--mud slides,  mountain torrents, flooding, and--asked: Is it easy to be  president under such conditions? When there is disaster after  disaster, when the people do not really want to live in the old  way but they have simply not learned the new way....    [Serdyukov] I bet you never dreamed of such a fate when you  were a child....    [Akayev] I wanted to be a historian. Military. Since third  grade I have been addicted to reading about the campaigns of  Suvorov, Nakhimov...I read everything there was to read about  Napoleon. Then I saw the film "Waterloo" and it seemed that I  already knew it all, I understood, but how I wanted Napoleon to  be defeated....    [Serdyukov] Were there military people in your family?    [Akayev] Both military people and government leaders.  Incidentally, I am the great great great grandson of Atake-Biye  himself. In 1785 he was the Khan and sent ambassadors to Russia.  They were received by Catherine II, and with great respect.  Because she was an intelligent woman and she understood that  Russia would have a great interest in our region. My ancestor  Shadan-Batyr ruled in northern Kyrgyzstan and helped General  Skobelev unite the southern part of our country with Russia.    My father, as a descendent of the Khan's tribe, was forced  to  hide on the steps of Kazakhstan. There he met my future mother.  Asel is alive, she is 93 years old. She is Kazakh.    [Serdyukov] So you are good friends with Nazarbayev--thick  as  thieves!    [Akayev] Yes, we are not simply friends. We are  relatives...my mother is a second cousin of Nursultan Abishevich.    [Serdyukov] This is the first time I have heard of that. And  I do not think I am the only one....    [Akayev] What is so special about this? Such things are not  really miracles in Asia. But here is what is surprising: Until  1989 Nazarbayev and I did not know one another very well. We met  in Moscow when we both became deputies of the Supreme Soviet of  the USSR. I told him about our kinship....    [Serdyukov] Was he very happy?    [Akayev] We were like two brothers.    [Serdyukov] You do not happen to be a relative of Yeltsin as  well?    [Akayev] No, we are simply good friends. We have been  helping  each other since the times when we were both deputies.    [Serdyukov] Does it seem to you that the very concept of  "male friendship" is impossible in its true sense for high-level  politicians? How, for example, do you deal with the situation  when "you may die, but you rescue your friend"? Is such a thing  really acceptable for a president? What should he do, destroy  his state while saving another leader?    [Akayev] Did you see "Dinner" with Oleg Tabakov and Armen  Dzhigarkhanyan? I know that it is hard to get in to see this  show. When my wife and I were in Moscow, only Tabakov himself  was able to get us tickets. Anyway, in this show two important  politicians, Fouche and Talleyrand, are vowing their friendship  to one another even though they are actually sworn enemies.    Talleyrand wanted to use Fouche to get into power and then  quietly get rid of him. But Fouche understands this and is  saving up compromising material against his "friend." It becomes  clear to Talleyrand that he will not be able to betray his  friend. And so he concludes what is now a truly friendly  alliance with him for the rest of his life. Question: How real  is it? This is a show all presidents would do well to see. I was  convinced once again that the professional politicians today are  not so different from their colleagues back in those feudal  times. What is bad? All the presidents' forces are now going for  an empty struggle, they are using up all their ammunition in  verbal battles. That is no way to emerge from the crisis. And I  am beginning to understand why dictatorial regimes have achieved  success in economic prosperity....    [Serdyukov] Do you have to keep a tight rein?    [Akayev] How else was Napoleon able to keep Fouche and  Talleyrand in check? After all, they were sold out and they  betrayed other people, but for the most part they served him  faithfully and truthfully. Him and, understandably, the empire.    [Serdyukov] When you became president, did you have to  change  any of your habits or get rid of former friends?    [Akayev] One of my mottoes is always remain yourself. I will  not betray myself. For which I am frequently criticized: They  say the president should be a little more pompous, definitely  secretive, and of course, powerful. And "he"--that is,  I--continue to be...a member of the intelligentsia.    [Serdyukov] But has it ever happened that you have broken  off  relations with a recent friend because of high-level political  considerations? Let us say that at one time he was a good  comrade to both you and Yeltsin. And suddenly he had a large  fallout with Boris Nikolayevich. Upon meeting him, how would you  act with the person who was "out of favor"?    [Akayev] As I did before.    [Serdyukov] And if Yeltsin was offended and your relations  with him became cool? Would the whole republic not suffer?    [Akayev] No, I cannot remember such a thing with him. Here  is  an example--Gennadiy Burbulis. We became friends back when we  were deputies. He was the one who at my friendly request  organized Yeltsin's first visit to Kyrgyzstan as president of  Russia. That was a month before the August putsch, and I had  certain information about preparations for it. Of course, I  warned Boris Nikolayevich in a private conversation. And he  said: "Can you discuss this where everyone can hear?" "Of  course, I can!" And I did when we exchanged official greetings.  Gorbachev was greatly offended at that time...he did not believe  it...but then there was Burbulis. He parted ways with Yeltsin,  but that does not diminish our friendship. I recently flew to  Moscow, phoned him, and invited him to dinner: I said, let us  sit down and talk...he was terribly surprised about something:  "All the rest of the presidents are avoiding me, they think that  I will have the wrong influence on their relations with Yeltsin,  but you...." I'm a friend of Boris Fedorov, Yegor Gaydar...they  did not fall in my estimation at all after losing their posts.    [Serdyukov] Askar Akayevich, what do you think: Can the  president have shortcomings?    [Akayev] I have a pile of them. But my main teacher, the  scholar Sergey Aleksandrovich Mayorov, who is well known in his  field, taught me to fight against them: Write down all your  shortcomings on a card and every day try to correct at least one  of them.    [Serdyukov] Are you succeeding?    [Akayev] I am trying. But still, in 1986, when they took me  into the Central Committee to be in charge of the department of  science and scholarly institutions, I received a letter from my  teacher in which he gave me, as a person "who is now a leader  and an official," several pieces of advice. Guess what the first  was?    [Serdyukov] Always keep smiling.    [Akayev] That is a character trait, the external  manifestation of it--I am a confirmed optimist. And that is in  my blood, without any advice....    [Serdyukov] Well, then do not contradict the leaders.    [Akayev] I contradicted them. For which they very quickly  asked me to take less "responsible" work.    [Serdyukov] I give up. What?    [Akayev] "Beware of journalists!"    [Serdyukov] And so, is it very terrible?    [Akayev] Sometimes it is not terrible but very revolting.    [Serdyukov] Your position is such that you are always in the  public eye. Incidentally, I recall one boom not so long ago.  Your name was fluttering in the newspaper-journalistic wind of  the boundless CIS area in connection with the notorious Seabeco  campaign, which you for some unknown reason endowed with gold  from the treasury. And now Boris Birshteyn is repaying you by  educating your eldest daughter in the best Swiss higher school.  I know there is a bitter taste in your mouth. But if possible,  for SOBESEDNIK, shed some light on this situation just one more  time.    [Akayev] It is all painfully simple. Back before I was  elected president, the Swiss firm Seabeco concluded with the  former Kyrgyz Government a contract that was very advantageous  for itself and essentially extortionate for the republic for  joint development and extraction of our gold. I demanded all the  documents, studied them attentively along with specialists, and  came to the conclusion that further joint work would be  inexpedient.    Well, since Seabeco had already invested a certain amount of  its money in this project, we decided to return its money from  the republic budget. That is all there is. I think we dealt with  this Birshteyn in a gentlemanly way and one can say that we  settled our accounts immediately. As for my eldest daughter  Berma--she has nothing to do with this story. She is a student  in the department of computer mathematics and cybernetics of  Moscow State University, in her third year. The best students  were sent abroad. And she was among them. The training is  financed by the "business and management" fund. Birshteyn and  certainly I have nothing to do with this. It is just that my  eldest daughter is a very hard worker.    [Serdyukov] Like her father?    [Akayev] Mayram spends more and more time with the children.  We have four. Two students--a girl and a boy. Two  schoolchildren--the same combination. My eldest son, Seydar, is  also abroad, in Washington. He is taking exams in an American  University. He lives with friends. Remember Sagdeyev, the  academician?... He is our friend and welcomed our son...I think  that whether or not I am president, the children should receive  the best education possible. This is of major value to them.    [Serdyukov] Have you studied all your life?    [Akayev] And now--where can you hide? I was a specialist in  the area of precise sciences. But a president cannot do without  knowledge of economics.    [Serdyukov] The more I get to know you, the more clearly I  understand that you were not all that eager to become  president...    [Akayev] That is exactly right. In the Supreme Soviet I  worked on the committee for economic reforms. With Bunich and  Bogomolov--real jewels--and we became friends...there, of  course, I became interested in politics and economics.  Imperceptibly I became more involved. And then suddenly in  Kyrgyzstan the parliament decided to elect a president. They  came to me and I said immediately: "No. Categorically. Look for  a president among the professional politicians. There are so  many of them nowadays...or--I advised--draft Aytmatov. He has  enough respect for any position...." Well, it seems they backed  away from me. Thank God!... And then my daughter and I happened  to be guests of academician Samarskiy--an extremely great  mathematician--we were talking...there was a phone call from  Bishkek--the democrats had found me here too! Well, they drafted  me: I had to fly home immediately. And I was elected president  on the first round. I had to work....    [Serdyukov] How many hours a day?    [Akayev] Figure it out. I wake up at 0500. I do not go to  bed  until after I have seen all the news on television--after  midnight.    [Serdyukov] All those hours without letting up?    [Akayev] What do you mean? I spend about 40 minutes shaving.  At home they know that this is my weakness. Previously my wife  was always scolding me, especially when we lived in a tiny  apartment in Leningrad: I was the only person knew who could  take so long in the toilet. I do not use mechanical razors. Only  razor blades. It gives me wild pleasure.    [Serdyukov] And, of course, jogging?    [Akayev] Absolutely. With friends. My doctor and the general  who is the chief of my personal guard. Twenty kilometers a  week--a golden norm.    [Serdyukov] Do you really have to have a guard?    [Akayev] I do not have to. But like any president, my  freedom  is quite restricted.    [Serdyukov] Is there any place where you can get away from  it  all?    [Akayev] Yes. In the mountains. My whole family enjoys  downhill skiing. True, the chief of the guard is there as  well....    [Serdyukov] During hours of recreation Nazarbayev takes out  his mandolin and Yeltsin--his spoons. And when you are together,  what role do you play in this trio?    [Akayev] I listen. And very attentively. It turns out that  presidents need listeners very much. And I feel simply  irreplaceable in this trio. I know that both Yeltsin and  Nazarbayev value me as an attentive conversationalist. I am  capable of understanding their thoughts. It is important to have  such a person. I never let anyone think that he is the only one  who is right....    [Serdyukov] And do you swim in cold water? Boris  Nikolayevich  respects....    [Akayev] That is exactly right. But now I have a new  diversion. Nazarbayev recently suggested that we arrange a  tennis tournament among the presidents. I had to have a court  built in the yard of my residence. Now I am training hard. Since  I had never before learned....    [Serdyukov] They are clever. They have been playing tennis  for a long time. Ask for a handicap.    [Akayev] Why? I will suggest my own sports. A triathlon, for  example. And definitely running. In order to even out the  chances.    [Serdyukov] You probably go hunting for "wild boar"--with a  rifle.    [Akayev] Boris Nikolayevich has a dream of hunting in  Kyrgyzstan. But it has not all worked out yet....    [Serdyukov] Probably because you are not a hunter.    [Akayev] Not even a fisherman.    [Serdyukov] But what entertains you most?    [Akayev] Music. I love classical music. When I need a burst  of inspiration I listen to Mozart. In moments of heavy  reflection nothing can replace Liszt's "Hungarian Rhapsody."    [Serdyukov] Do you spend a lot of time listening to Liszt?    [Akayev] I can put the record on in the morning and listen  to  it all day long. Over and over again...that is the way it is so  far.

			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> As city officials in Tiburon agonized over how to get rid of the carcass of a  30-ton gray whale that washed up on the beach, would-be good Samaritans hauled  it out to sea. But it came back, smelling worse than ever. This time it was in  Pacifica, about 15 miles south of Tiburon, and its stench wafted along Main  Street's scenic restaurant row, several hundred yards from the beach. Police  Lt. John Gurney said Pacifica authorities were not taking any chances with the  41-foot whale that was estimated to have been dead two weeks. After conferring  with the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, Pacifica officials  decided to have the beast sliced into pieces, loaded on a truck and buried. The  body was hauled away to a landfill site in Livermore.  </P></p>

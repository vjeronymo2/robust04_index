			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUNNY, SUNNY BEACH EXHIBIT;  </P> <P> DESIGN: A LIGHTHEARTED EXHIBIT OF ARTFUL WHIMSY IS OFFERED AT THE GALLERY OF  FUNCTIONAL ART IN SANTA MONICA. IT'S A WITTY PARODY OF WHAT'S OUT THERE.  </P> <P> While watching a weenie roast on a fork jutting from the center of his  dish-shaped solar barbecue, artist David Gale ran through the many uses he  imagined for his fanciful fryer.  </P> <P> "The barbecue could double as a hot baptismal font," he said. "All I want to do  is to stimulate ideas for enjoying our plentiful beach sunshine."  </P> <P> Gale's "Dogmaster 2400" solar barbecue, priced at $1,950, is included in "A Day  at the Beach," an exhibition of beach objects created by artists presented by  the Gallery of Functional Art in Santa Monica through Sept. 10.  </P> <P> "We wanted to set up a lighthearted summer show," said gallery owner Lois  Lambert. Pointing to a pair of scantily clad skateboarders rolling along the  sidewalk past her Main Street gallery windows, Lois added: "The stuff in here  relates to what's out there."  </P> <P> A witty parody of "what's out there" is reflected in Phil Garner's made-over  1973 Toyota Corolla. Stripped of doors and roof, its motor exposed, the Toyota  is painted sunshine-yellow outside and blood-red in its interior. Renamed  "Restless Nature," the "beachified" car has a electric horn mounted on its  windshield and a rear fender stenciled with the gentle message: "Protect the  Innocent."  </P> <P> At $3,995, Garner's Toyota is a steal compared to Peter Schroff's $18,000  untitled surfboard.  </P> <P> Described by the artist as "a home entertainment center for the beach,"  Schroff's shocking pink fiberglass surfboard includes: an aquarium with live  fish, a Sony TV, a bubble-gum vending machine, a radio, a beer keg, an electric  guitar, a fan, a clock, an ashtray with cigarette lighter, and a live parrot.  </P> <P> "It's a total beach environment -- the ultimate party board for you and your  friends," Schroff said. "Everything you need to survive on the sand is here,  for body and soul."  </P> <P> If 18 grand is a trifle too steep for your body and soul, Schroff offers $2,600  customized surfboards to suit all tastes. Some are painted with Day-Glo  sunsets. One, fit for an Indian fakir, is studded with sharp orange spikes.  </P> <P> In a solemn mood, Lambert said that Schroff's surfboards represent "totem-like  sources of language, music and fashion for an entire subculture" by "turning  the tables on one of the most potent of all California beach icons." Cracking a  smile, she added: "They're also terrific fun."  </P> <P> Also great fun are Jim Ganzer's $1,500 "Palm Chairs," cleverly constructed of  screwed-together, seasoned palm wood, and Philip Miller's "Heal the Babe," a  welded steel rocking chair that looks as if it could survive both earthquake  and tidal wave.  </P> <P> And if the present drought lasts long enough to wither palms, you could sit on  the sand under Ty Bowman's "Utilities," a tree whose trunk and drooping fronds  are made of recycled black rubber tires.  </P> <P> For beach cyclists, architect Gregg Fleishman has crafted an $11,500 reclining  bike made of plywood and steel.  </P> <P> Fleishman's low-slung cycle marries the curved, laminated wood of his  well-known line of furniture with racing bike technology. "The bike has a low  center of gravity for safety, and the plywood seat flexes with the movements of  your body," he said.  </P> <P> "Most bikes look as if they're either impaling their rider or putting him to  sleep. I wanted to make a bicycle that was both stylish and comfy to ride."  </P> <P> Comfort seems less crucial to artist David Flynn. His $1,800 rocker, "Chevy  '37," is actually a wooden park bench mounted on the suspension of a 1937 Chevy  he found lying in the street near his Wilmington studio. Also scavenged from  his junk-fertile neighborhood are bolted and chained railroad ties that have  been turned into a giant folding beach chess set. Entitled "Chest" it looks as  if it were designed for sun-loving giants.  </P> <P> "I'm interested in the implications of chairs," Flynn said. "Ever since people  stopped squatting on the ground, they've played a million variations on the  idea of sitting."  </P> <P> An earnest intention to recycle abandoned objects and conserve natural  resources is a theme that preoccupies many of the designers whose works are on  display in "A Day at the Beach."  </P> <P> Sheryl Weinberg's sheet-steel, multi-tiered fountain is designed to make a  strong ecological statement.  </P> <P> "My fountain incorporates both the need to keep reusing our precious water and  the warning that the man-made world will rust if we don't take care of it," she  said. "At the same time it gives pleasure during a hot day at the beach, giving  out negative ions that recharge the spirit and soft sounds that soothe the  mind."  </P></p>

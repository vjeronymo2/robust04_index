			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "Chinese Economic News" Column: "Regulations on </F> Responding to Foreign Accusations About Dumping"]    [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Corporation promulgated the "Regulations on Responding to  Foreign Accusations About Dumping" not long ago to resolve the  issue of weak responses to the implementation of anti-dumping  cases overseas, protection of legitimate rights of Chinese  production and export enterprises, and maintenance of exports  market.    Based on the regulations, when Chinese products are accused  of having been dumped, the respondant should be 1) the  enterprise who has the right to operate in foreign trade, whose  products are being targeted in dumping cases and exported to the  country or region that lodges the accusation during the period  of investigation; and 2) the enterprise that manufactures the  exports referred to in the aforesaid clause. It is stipulated  that all export-and-import chambers of commerce and associations  for foreign-funded enterprises are to be in charge of organizing  and coordinating the response to foreign accusations about  dumping; at the same time, special persons should be appointed  to take charge of such cases. Under specific conditions, local  commissions for foreign economic relations and trade, when  authorized, may be in charge of organizing the response to  foreign accusations about dumping, too.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpt] The president of the House of Representatives  Second Commission, Lucas Lebolo Conde, denounced the use of  large sums of money in the political campaigns in various  municipalities of Atlantico and he said the Treasury Inspector  should conduct an investigation.    The situation is so worrisome, judging from what other  politicians have said, that some of them have decided to unite  in a common front to defend their political territory because  the money is coming from persons in other departments or outside  the country.    He also asked Treasury Inspector Jorge Garcia and Prosecutor  General Gustavo de Greiff to investigate the source of financing  of the different candidates for Congress since "the fortunes  spent in this department in the months of November and December  are not in conformity with the stipulated legal standards for  investing in campaigns."

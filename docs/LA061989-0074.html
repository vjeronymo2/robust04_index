			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 11-YEAR-OLD PILOT LANDS IN OSLO AFTER 6-HOUR ATLANTIC CROSSING  </P> <P> Unseasonably warm weather greeted 11-year-old Tony Aliengena after he conquered  the North Atlantic and made a European landfall here Sunday on his quest to fly  around the world.  </P> <P> The San Juan Capistrano aviator glided to a picture-perfect landing at Oslo's  Fornebu Airport, ending a tedious, six-hour flight from Reykjavik, Iceland.  </P> <P> Emerging from the cockpit of his single-engined Cessna, Tony was mobbed by  Norwegian news reporters and photographers, who asked him to pose by his plane.  </P> <P> Then without having to show a passport or clear customs, Tony and his entourage  of eight were shuttled to a suburban Oslo Hotel, stopping along the way for a  look at Norway's Royal Palace, home of King Olav IV.  </P> <P> On the drive, they saw scores of picnicking families and bicyclists brought out  by the 80-degree weather.  </P> <P> Oslo's heat wave, not unlike temperatures in his native California, came as a  welcome respite from the bitter cold that Tony experienced during his  2,500-mile journey across the north Atlantic.  </P> <P> "No sweat," Tony said of the treacherous crossing. "It was a piece of cake."  </P></p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Observer: Liter-ally Not content with one begging letter, the Turks have just come up with five in the hope of persuading the rest of the former Soviet Union's quintet of Turkic states to join Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan in abandoning Cyrillic notation in favour of Roman script. Turkey's decision to increase the alphabet by the five new letters is a historic gesture. It is the first such change since the western reforms of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1928 when the Turks themselves adopted the Roman script in place of the Arabic used under the Ottomans. The additions, agreed after a four-day conference in Ankara, represent sounds already voiced in the dialect of Turkish used in the republics. Besides an additional e (written as a backwards E), the letters are a w, an x, a q, and an n with the reverse of a French circumflex over the top. As an added incentive to join the alphabetical alliance, Turkey is offering the republics printing machinery and substantial technical assistance.</p>

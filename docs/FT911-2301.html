			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Algeria offers nuclear inspection Algeria yesterday offered to submit its nuclear programme to international inspection following a series of western newspaper allegations that it had embarked, with China, on a secret project to develop atomic weapons, Francis Ghiles writes. Ministry of Scientific Research officials in Algiers told the El Moudjahid newspaper: 'Now is the time to supply international public opinion with information concerning the peaceful use of nuclear energy'. The nuclear programme is being developed in Ouessera, near the town of Bouira 80km from Algiers. Bush and China, Page 7</p>

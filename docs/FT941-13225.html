			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): IBM news, technical questions hit Dow Wall Street US stocks retreated yesterday as jitters over the market's technical conditions proved more compelling than a fresh batch of corporate results, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 17.45 down at 3,895.34 and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dipped 1.05 to 470.92. The American SE composite shed 2.78 to 480.59 and the Nasdaq composite fell 4.26 to 786.39. NYSE volume came to 326m shares. The market opened with a slight decline, but losses mounted steadily until mid-afternoon, when the Dow bottomed out with a 22-point deficit and began to retrace some ground. Those issues most closely tied to the economic cycle have prospered in recent weeks, but many were hit hard yesterday by profit-taking. Caterpillar declined Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 98 5/8 , Boeing Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 43, Allied Signal Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 77 7/8 and Bethlehem Steel Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 21 5/8 . The negative sentiment reflected growing anxiety over the failure of the broad market indices to keep pace with the Dow blue chip barometer, which is heavily weighted towards the cyclicals. Analysts said the divergence might be an indication that the bull market had gone past its peak. Stocks drew scant support from the bond market or the day's economic news. The benchmark 30-year government security was down  5/16 to 98 3/4 in late trading. Meanwhile, the Conference Board's January consumer confidence index, at 83.2, proved to be less bullish than forecast. The announcement of a 6.7 per cent month-to-month rise in sales of existing single-family homes in December was a more welcome development. Shares in International Business Machines were highly volatile after the company posted fourth-quarter earnings of 62 cents a share, in line with expectations. At one point the stock had fallen nearly Dollars 3, after an equivalent gain the previous day, but rebounded to close just Dollars  3/8 off at Dollars 58 1/4 after 10.1m shares traded. Pharmaceutical issues were active, with health care reform expected to be a central theme of President Bill Clinton's State of the Union speech yesterday evening. Merck added Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 35 5/8 after reporting better than expected operating income. Mylan Laboratories, a generic drug supplier which could benefit from health care reform, climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 24 3/8 in spite of flat earnings. Among the Dow components, American Express rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 32 3/4 after revealing late on Monday plans to spin off its Lehman Brothers investment banking subsidiary. Trading in Cooper Industries, an electrical and automobile equipment supplier, was briefly suspended after it said a 25 per cent fall in 1994 earnings was possible. When reactivated, the stock plummeted to Dollars 41 1/2 , down Dollars 10 on the day. On the Nasdaq, technology issues remained out of favour. Canada Toronto shares continued to retreat in fairly active trading amid cautious profit-taking. The TSE 300 index closed 9.6 off at 4,456.2 and falls led rises by 439 to 360 after volume of 66.4m shares valued at CDollars 842m.</p>

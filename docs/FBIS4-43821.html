			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "As of 1 July: France Reorganizes </F> Its Military Representation to NATO"]    [Text] France has appointed General Patrick Woillez to a  newly created senior position in NATO. This choice reflects the  government's determination to accommodate its military  representation to the structure of the major allied commands,  whose current reorganization is scheduled for completion in  1995. Prompted by the end of the Cold War in Europe, this  reorganization consists in personnel reductions within military  commands with a view to reducing operating costs.    To take effect on 1 July, the government has appointed Air  Force Brigadier General Woillez as head of the French military  mission to the Commander in Chief of Allied Forces for  Northwestern Europe (CINCNORTHWEST). This command is based in  High Wycombe (Great Britain) and is intended to combine two  previously distinct allied commands: The Northern European  Command (CINCNORTH), which covers allied forces in Norway and on  the Baltic coastline, on the one hand, and CINCUKAIR, the  command which includes the United Kingdom's NATO Air Force, on  the other hand.    The new allied command for northwestern Europe is under the  authority of the General Headquarters of Allied Forces in Europe  (SACEUR), headed by U.S. General George Joulwan and based in  Mons, Belgium.    The newly created French military mission with the new  Northwestern European Command will fall under the command of  Admiral Lanxade, chief of staff of the French Armed Forces,  through the French representative to NATO's Military Committee,  Air Force Major General Jean-Paul Pelisson. The 51-year-old  General Woillez, whose position was created within the scope the  reorganization of NATO's commands, was formerly deputy chief of  the "Planning, Programming, and Evaluation" Division of the  French Armed Forces' staff headquarters.    It has already been a year since France appointed Rear  Admiral Dominique Raguet as its representative in Naples, where  the Allied Command for Southern Europe (CINCSOUTH) is located.  The Naples headquarters controls allied (land, naval, and air)  forces deployed in southern Europe as well as NATO's  intervention force. A number of these units have been enforcing  the UN embargo against Serbia and Montenegro since the beginning  of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.    This summer, France also plans to appoint Brigadier General  Gerard Folio as its military representative with the General  Allied Command for Central Europe (CINCENT), located in  Brunssum, the Netherlands. Like the new Northwestern European  Command, the CINCSOUTH and CINCENT commands come under General  Joulwan's direct authority.</p>

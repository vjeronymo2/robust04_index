			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: CENTRAL VACUUM CAN REDUCE CLEANING NOISE  </P> <P> QUESTION: I was considering installing a central vacuum cleaning system to  reduce vacuum cleaning noise and dust in my home. Does a central vacuum system  use more electricity? Is a higher horsepower motor always better?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Vacuum cleaners use a significant amount of electricity. Some uprights  and canisters use up to 4 peak horsepower. This is as high an electricity usage  rate as some central air conditioners.  </P> <P> A vacuum cleaner with the highest horsepower motor may not clean the best. A  rating called "Air Power," which factors in both suction and volume of air  flow, is a better measure of cleaning ability. Be sure to check whether the air  power rating is at the tank or at the end of the hose.  </P> <P> A central vacuum cleaner design using two smaller motors may clean as well or  better than a canister or upright with a single larger motor. Higher total  horsepower uses more electricity. The price of a central system is about as  much as some top-of-the-line standard vacuum cleaners.  </P> <P> If you are handy with tools, you can install one yourself. These units use a  32-foot flexible hose, so you generally need only one or two vacuum wall  outlets on each floor. In existing houses, you can easily run the 2-inch  plastic vacuum pipe up through closets, cold air return ducts, etc.  </P> <P> There are several advantages of a central system. The collection unit and motor  are located in a basement, garage or utility room. This reduces the noise level  in your home. You don't have to lug a heavy vacuum cleaner around your house.  </P> <P> Also, many manufacturers recommend venting the outlet from the main unit to the  outdoors. This eliminates the small amounts of dust that get through the  multiple-stage filters. With a standard vacuum cleaner, this dust ends up back  on your carpet and furniture.  </P> <P> There are two basic types of dirt storage designs for central vacuum cleaner  systems: bag or cyclonic. With a bag design, a 6-gallon disposable vacuum  cleaner bag is used. When it's full, you replace it.  </P> <P> The cyclonic design forces the dirt to swirl around to compact it in the  central unit storage canister. When it is full, you just empty it into a  plastic garbage bag or trash can.  </P> <P> Although the bag design requires bag changes, its cleaning performance can be  better. The cleaning air power with a bag system stays very constant until the  bag is nearly full. Then it drops off quickly, so you know it's time to change  it. The air power of a cyclonic system continuously drops gradually, so you may  let it overfill and get inadequate cleaning.  </P> <P> You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 378 showing manufacturers of  bag and cyclonic central vacuum systems, information on a high-efficiency  two-motor bag model, and installation instructions for an existing house.

Would it help in the winter if I put the foil  under the floor joist above the crawl space?  </P> <P> A: Reflective foil can also be effective for saving heat in the winter. As long  as there is an air gap above the foil, it will reduce the radiant heat loss  through the floor and make your room feel warmer. Staple the foil up under the  floor joists with the shiny side facing up. Poke holes in the foil to allow  water vapor to escape.  </P></p>

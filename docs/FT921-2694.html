			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Local heart in Italy's body politic: The role of the regions in April's general election WHEN THE administrator of one of Milan's most famous charitable foundations was found by police last month with L7m (Pounds 3,250) - alleged to be bribery money - on his desk, few eyebrows were raised at what seemed like another case of everyday petty corruption. But the administrator, Mr Mario Chiesa, was a prominent member of the Socialist party, which has run Milan almost uninterruptedly since 1945. As the police investigation deepens, the cash hordes built up by Mr Chiesa, who has run the city's venerable Pio Albergo Trivulzio old people's institution for the past six years, are alleged to have ballooned to reach at L16bn at the last count. The Chiesa affair has proved acutely embarrassing for the Socialists, with suggestions in political circles that the funds he is alleged to have raised via commissions on contracts and complex property deals were eventually destined for the party's coffers. Having wasted no time in ejecting Mr Chiesa, now being held on corruption charges, from their ranks, the Socialists are loudly protesting that the case has been deliberately pumped up by their opponents in the run-up to Italy's general election on April 5. But the Chiesa affair highlights the unusually close connections between local and national politics in Italy. Born out of the country's belated reunification and its strong regional traditions, and nurtured by the country's proportional representation electoral system which breeds multi-party local governments, urban politics often have national impact. The collapse late last year of long-standing councils in the big northern cities of Milan and Brescia set the alarm bells ringing at many national party headquarters. The breach in Brescia, the second-biggest city in Lombardy and a Christian Democrat stronghold for decades, stemmed from squabbling among local party notables, whose failure to paper over their differences eventually triggered an early poll. Only a few weeks later, the Socialists took their turn in the spotlight when the Milan council they dominated collapsed after teetering for months. In both cases, national politicians immediately initiated attempts to resolve the local differences. Prominent Christian Democrat leaders were drafted into Brescia to patch up the local feud, while in Milan, Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialists' national leader, made it his mission to prevent the rift leading to early polls, as required by law when a new council cannot be formed within 60 days. The importance with which local disputes are viewed by national leaders stems partly from the new constellation of Italy's politics. The collapse of Communism and reform of the former Communist Party (PCI) into the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) have loosened voters' allegiances and encouraged regional autonomist movements such as Mr Umberto Bossi's Lombard League. Brescia, one of Italy's richest cities, is a League stronghold, as evidenced by the graffiti on walls and signposts and the large number of League activists handing out leaflets in the town centre. By playing on northern voters' antipathy towards the 'free-spending' politicians in Rome, the party has also made strides in Milan. The prospect of sharp gains for the League at early elections in both cities was a powerful tonic for national politicians to take action late last year. With general elections only months away, the bigger parties feared that a local upset could prove nationally embarrassing. In the event, the Christian Democrats failed to prevent local elections in Brescia, and the League duly beat them into second place. In neighbouring Milan, a new council was formed only days before the deadline for elections expired. Even before the rise of the Leagues, local politics had traditionally had considerable impact on the national arena, argues Mr Vittorio (Bobo) Craxi, the son of the Socialist chief, who heads the party's local organisation in Milan. 'Local councils allow the parties to experiment with coalitions that might not be possible nationally at the moment, ' he says. For example, 500 communes are run by coalitions between the Christian Democrats and the PDS. Among them are provincial capitals such as Pavia to the south of Milan. Local councils can also be part of the more elaborate system of political horse-trading between the main governing parties at national level. With only about 14 per cent of the vote in Rome and 19 per cent in Milan, it would be virtually impossible for the Socialists to appoint the mayor in both cities, as they have, without the acquiescence of the Christian Democrats. A weak showing by the Socialists in Milan or a poor performance by the Christian Democrats in Brescia in the general elections, could quickly trigger instability within the local council as opponents seek to exploit differences within the coalition parties and alliances start to unravel. For, while local politics play an unusually prominent role in Italy's national political game, matters can, and often do, work the other way.</p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / BA fails to impress City with 40% rise British Airways yesterday reported a 40 per cent increase in pre-tax profit as passenger and cargo traffic continued to recover. But the strong performance failed to impress the stock market with BA shares falling 12p to close at 417p. BA's first-quarter profit of Pounds 88m for the three months to June 30 was up from Pounds 63m a year ago. Turnover for the period rose to Pounds 1.69bn from Pounds 1.52bn. Although profits were in line with expectations, they did not match the more bullish forecasts, which had exceeded Pounds 90m pre-tax. The market's reaction also reflected continuing worries about BA's Dollars 400m (Pounds 259m) investment in a 24.6 per cent stake in USAir. The sixth largest US carrier is struggling to win labour concessions to help it return to profitability. BA said yesterday it was not close to deciding whether to write off its USAir stake. But it acknowledged that the current negotiations between USAir and its unions were not encouraging and would probably drag on into the autumn. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, said he was encouraged by the overall first-quarter performance. It reflected 'buoyant demand' for passenger and cargo services, with first and business-class premium traffic reaching an all-time high. First-quarter operating profits rose 32.4 per cent to Pounds 143m. Fully diluted earnings per share were 6.4p, slightly up from last year's 6.3p, largely due to a higher estimated tax rate and the rights issue of June 1993. A total of 8.3m people flew on the airline's scheduled and charter flights in the first quarter. Passenger traffic increased by 6.9 per cent on scheduled services. The biggest improvement was in the high-yield first and business class traffic which rose by 12 per cent, double the rate of economy class traffic. This helped passenger yields on scheduled services to rise by 3.4 per cent. Cargo traffic rose by nearly 20 per cent with a total of 171,000 tonnes carried. BA also said net borrowings fell by Pounds 201m in the first quarter, taking its gearing to 56.9 per cent - a 2.7 percentage point improvement since the end of March. Lex, Page 16</p>

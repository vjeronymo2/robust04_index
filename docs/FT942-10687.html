			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / More Italian cabinet delays President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro was last night reported to be holding up confirmation of Italy's 53rd post-war cabinet headed by media magnate turned politician Silvio Berlusconi. The president was said to be holding reservations over the compromise arrangement worked out for two key posts, interior and justice. This had been agreed by Mr Berlusconi earlier in the day with his two main allies in the Freedom Alliance - the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco Fini. Mr Berlusconi had to allow the League's number two to take the Interior Ministry on the basis that the Justice Ministry was earmarked for Mr Cesare Previti, a newly elected senator for Forza Italia and Mr Berlusconi's principal lawyer. President Scalfaro has previously been critical of the interior portfolio going to the League, which is rooted solely in the north and has strong federalist demands.</p>

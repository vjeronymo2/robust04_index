			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: I PASS LIKE NIGHT BY JONATHAN AMES (VINTAGE: $8.95)  </P> <P> Yet another tale of angst, alienation and ennui in New York City. By day,  Alexander Vine works as a doorman at a ritzy Midtown hotel; by night, he prowls  the seamy underworld of the Lower East Side.  </P> <P> As the Manhattan drug scene has become passe, Jonathan Ames uses the narrator's  morbid interest in street prostitutes and bums as a metaphor for the  degradation lurking behind the urban glitter. (Vine also consorts with gay men,  enabling Ames to drag in the threat of AIDS as an unconvincing demon ex  machina.) The conceit might have worked if Ames had created a character who  embodied either the wealth or sleaze that surrounds him. But Vine lacks the  requisite aspirations and predatory appetites: He's just another uninteresting  loser in the big city, and the weak-limbed prose of "I Pass Like Night"  collapses under the weight of its pretentions.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- Thokoza residents and  residents of Angola Hostel fought running battles with each  other in the southern section of the East Rand township on  Tuesday.    One National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] soldier was reported  to have been shot dead, and SAPA reporters at the scene saw at  least half a dozen cars ferrying wounded to Natalspruit  Hospital. Spokesmen at the hospital reported five deaths and at  least 40 wounded in the violence.    It also appeared as if SADF [South African Defense Force]  troops were returning to the township to restore order. By  2.30PM on Tuesday order had been restored to lower Khumalo  Street by what appeared to be defence force troops, SAPA  reporters said.    A spokesman for the SADF's Wits Command told SAPA the army  was lending "limited support" to the peacekeepers at the request  of the NPKF. It did not mean a full scale military return to  the East Rand was imminent, said Major Christo Visser of Wits  Command.    NKPF members patrolling Khumalo Street, which was covered  with stones, tree stumps and burning tyres, came under sporadic  fire. Township residents repeatedly charged the hostel and took  many casualties, according to a witness.    At 1PM a dozen South African Defence Force Ratel armoured  vehicles, a fire engine and NPKF armoured vehicles arrived,  reporters on the scene said. The arrival of SADF troops was  cheered by those in the hostel.    In a statement to SAPA, the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] --  whose supporters dominate most hostels -- demanded the NPKF  withdraw from the East Rand's townships by 5PM on Tuesday  (today) "and the immediate return of the SADF". "The IFP also  delivers an ultimatum to the NPKF command to unconditionally  return licenced weapons and their registration papers illegally  dispossessed from their IFP- supporting owners yesterday," said  the statement issued by Abhraham Mzizi, IFP constituency  chairman for Thokoza.    He also alleged members of African National Congress  supporting township self defence units (SDUs) had been seen  among NPKF members during a gunfight with residents of Thokoza  Hostel No 3 on Monday. Photographs which appeared in Tuesday  newspapers confirmed this, according to Mr Mzizi. "NPKF members  allegedly escorted MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation;  ANC military wing] members to the hostel yesterday to retrieve  weapons they claimed were hidden there. This in itself was a  provocative gesture. Together with SDU members they then  proceeded to fire indiscriminately at the hostel," charged Mr  Mzizi. "This culminated in the crossfire that triggered the  tragic death of STAR photographer Ken Oosterbroek..."    NPKF members had also illegally taken away from IFP  supporters their legal firearms and registration papers on  Monday, Mr Mzizi alleged. "This was done in the clear knowledge  that it would leave hostel residents vulnerable to an ANC  assault... "When confronted by IFP officials, NPKF members  refused to identify themselves and allegedly threatened IFP  leaders. When IFP officials challenged them (NPKF) to hand over  the firearms to police for ballistic testing, they refused to do  so," according to Mr Mzizi.    There was no immediate comment from the NPKF.    Mr Mzizi said the decision to send the NPKF into the East  Rand was a "lethal error of judgement".    Returning from a tour of the embattled township, IFP  Transvaal leader Mr hemba Khoza on Tuesday said law and order  had broken down and the language of the township was a bullet.  "They are talking though the barrels of guns," he told  reporters in Johannesburg.    Mr Khoza said he was in an NPKF vehicle when it was  petrol-bombed and stoned by residents near Buthelezi section.  "There is serious trouble and people are going to die. I was  really scared; we're lucky up to now so few people have been  killed."    On the IFP's decision to contest the elections, Mr Khoza  said  "it is nice that the leadership has found each other, but they  have to quell the violence". He said a lot more had to be done  to end violence or there would be no free and fair elections.    Mr Khoza repeated the IFP's demand for the withdrawal of the  NPKF from Thokoza. He said members of the NPKF were  undisciplined and blatantly ignoring orders of their commanding  officers. Mr Khoza said he had seen NPKF members refusing an  order to disperse a crowd of African National Congress youths  and swearing at the commanding officer.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Paying for consumer protection Sir, I run a small, independent financial advice business, with a team both honest and competent. I have retained 95 per cent of my clients for more than 20 years, some quite well known. I do not choose to handle clients' money, yet I have to pay ever increasing fees to Fimbra, the self-regulatory organisation for independent financial advisers in the UK, to protect the public from unscrupulous advisers. Now the powers that be are getting rid of Fimbra, and the Personal Investment Authority is being foisted on us with even more people who know nothing about financial products peering at our files and, you have guessed, ever increasing fees. I am 100 per cent behind consumer protection but, please, is there anyone out there who can explain to me why Roger Levitt has been discharged from his Pounds 65m debts and received a sentence of 180 hours' community service, and why I, and hundreds like me, will be squeezed out of business in the next few years because of onerous charges? How I wonder will that help the consumer. But, in any case, do any of you care? Maureen Watson, Maureen Watson Financial Advisers, 110 High Road, Loughton, Essex IG10 4HJ</p>

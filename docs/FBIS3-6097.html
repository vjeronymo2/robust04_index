			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Shigemichi Tomabechi, MAINICHI SHIMBUN editorial </F> staff: "SDPJ's Four Groups Tossed About by Political Situation"]    [Text] The woods are lovely, dark and deep,  But I have promises to keep,  And miles to go before I sleep.    On 11 January [1994], speaker of the House of  Representatives  Takako Doi, who made a guest speech at the 60th Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] Convention at the Kudan Kaikan  Building in Tokyo, closed her message by quoting from a poem by  Robert Frost.    The frame of mind of Speaker Doi, who occupies the honored  position as the first woman speaker in Japan's parliamentary  history to head the highest organ of state authority, is not  clear when she quoted Frost's poem to the SDPJ members.    Although she was given the important role of lower house  speaker because the SDPJ had become the largest party in the  Hosokawa coalition government, her own party--the SDPJ--has  continued strife that has split the party every time it faced a  crucial political issue. Judging from the confusing  circumstances of choosing between support for the coalition  administration or withdrawing from it, she sounds as if she was  strongly encouraging it to fulfill its mission as a responsible  party.    Also, depending on how it is interpreted, there is a  prominent theory that Ms Doi, who has powerful clout within the  SDPJ as the leader of the pro-Constitution group, was  conveniently promoted as speaker of the lower house where she  would be unable to speak out on party management, whereas  various hindrances would occur concerning coalition operations  if she were to remain within the SDPJ. It is possible to  interpret that Ms Doi, who was aware of such circumstances,  hinted that she was prepared to relinquish her seat as speaker  and take action as a savior to rescue the pro-Constitution group  from its straits.    However, perhaps not a few members of both the right-wing  and  left-wing representatives who filled the convention hall heard  her message as asking how long will it take for the SDPJ to  disintegrate in view of the split in the party?"    The purpose of the convention, which was held amid a  maelstrom and was a major turning point in the upper house  deliberations on political reform-related bill as the focal  point in the extraordinary Diet session, was to reach a decision  on the 1994 campaign direction proposal. However, because  passage of the bill depended on the response from the SDPJ, the  principal aim of the Executive Division was to reconcentrate the  party's will and strengthen solidarity toward passing the bill  to support the Hosokawa coalition administration.    The slogan, "Let us cultivate a new future of the SDPJ for  the coalition government and political reform," posted in front  of the convention hall vividly illustrates the enthusiasm of the  Executive Division.  <H5>  Moves in Anticipation of a Split. </H5>   However, the expectation and speculation of the Executive  Division failed completely. Under the situation of a fierce  confrontation within the party between the right wing that  advocates maintenance of the coalition administration by passing  the bill and the left wing that stresses independence of the  party above the coalition administration, it was not possible to  seek a union of will concerning the bill.    It is impossible to expect an agreement in debates between  the right wing, which supports the coalition, aggressively  responds to political restructuring by introducing the  single-seat constituencies with proportional representation  system as the core of political reform, and seeks to rise both  in form and substance to a "ruling party" and the left wing,  which opposes introduction of a "proportional representation  system" as leading to the destruction of the SDPJ as a  "pro-Constitution party."    Sure enough, it merely turned into a scenario of mutual  criticism and condemnation, and the debate ended with the party  on the verge of dissolution. It only amplified mutual distrust  and hate and portrayed the party that was actually heading  toward rupture.    Already preparatory moves are seen within the party with  "spliting" in mind.    The moves can be roughly separated into four groups:  "Democrats," "New Policy Discussion Group," "Liberal Group" and  "Group To Promote True Political Reform."    The "Democrats," formed by some 40 Diet members of the  faction which promotes political restructuring and supports the  coalition government, anticipated the introduction of a  "proportional representation system" and aimed at the marshaling  of "social democratic/liberal forces including Sakigake  [Harbinger], the Japan New Party and a portion of the LDP  [Liberal Democratic Party]." It has in mind the formation of a  new party by recruiting Hokkaido Governor Takahiro Yokomichi as  its new leader.    It is the largest right-wing group with former party General  Secretary Hirotaka Akamatsu as chief of the secretariat  supporting General Secretary Wataru Kubo. However, Chairman  Akira Yamagishi of Rengo [National Confederation of Trade  Unions] waits in the wings and cannot be ignored, inasmuch as he  will be the nucleus of a second phase in political restructuring.    The "New Policy Discussion Group," with 30 Dietmen including  lower house member Aogu Matsumae as chairman and Director Masao  Sakon of the lower house Ad Hoc Committee on Political Reform as  members, is more aggressive than the "Democrats" concerning  political restructuring and is therefore more splinter-bent.    An approach to and union with a group headed by lower house  member Masayasu Kitagawa that is showing strong signs of  splitting within the LDP is frequently rumored. The "New Policy  Discussion Society" is a militant group that indicates a strong  possibility of becoming the vanguard of splintering within the  SDPJ.    In opposition to the right-wing groups, more than a dozen  Dietmen of the left wing centering on upper house Diet member  Hideo Den of the United Social Democratic Party and led by upper  house member Masao Kunihiro formed the "Liberal Group," which is  actively against the "proportional representation system." It is  cooperating with the "national network to revitalize the  pro-Constitution SDPJ" and is expected to form a new  pro-Constitution party in the future.    The left-wing "Group To Promote True Political Reform,"  which  supports Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and consists of about 30  lower house Dietmen of the neutral faction, was originally  opposed to the "proportional representation system." The group  emphasizes independence and had established rapport with  "Liberal Group." However, Chairman Murayama has been forced to  adopt the position of promoting political reform and maintaining  the coalition administration, and the situation within the group  is complex and deeply troubled.  <H5>  Defensive Evolvement </H5>   Meanwhile, each of the four groups is moving in its separate  way publicly and privately amid rife speculation. What they  have in common is the fact that no one has the slightest idea as  to how the political situation will evolve in the future and  what will happen to them when they plunge headlong into the new  political phase that is sure to come.    Even the right-wing groups, although they announce  solidarity  of the "social democrats and liberals," require an adversary to  justify it. Unless the Sakigake, Japan New Party, and the LDP  liberals act in unison, their "solidarity" would have no  practical purpose, and it would become a monodrama. How  effective can cooperation in the elections be?    It is the same in the case of the left-wing group. How many  seats can be garnered by reuniting the pro-Constitution forces  in a "proportional representation system" election? If only  several seats can be anticipated in the proportional  representation districts, the raison d'etre of the group itself  would be questioned.    As this article is being written, the fate of the political  reform-related bill is unclear. However, if it is passed, the  impact of introducing the "proportional representation system"  will unmistakably hasten the dismantling of the SDPJ.    What follows political reform is the issue of a hike in the  consumption tax rate that will inevitably result in a major  debate within the party.    "The woods dark and deep" lie ahead of the SDPJ. How many  miles to go before one sleeps?</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Claudia Safatle] </F>   [Text] The government is preparing an ingenious solution to  the problem of privatizing the state-owned companies of the  electric energy producing area that belong to the federal  government, without having to depend on the approval of the  draft bill on franchises. This draft bill has been languishing  in national Congress drawers.    The solution consists of dividing the Brazilian Electric  Power Company, Inc [Eletrobras] into two companies by separating  what is a typical government function from what can be exploited  by the private sector.    A provisional measure accompanied by a report on the reasons  for this proposal -- which was signed by Mines and Energy  Minister Alexis Stepanenko, Planning Minister Beni Veras, and  former Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso -- has been  under study at the Finance Ministry Executive Secretariat. The  idea is to send this proposal and the studies, as soon as  possible, to the presidency of the Republic, which will then  send them to the national Congress.    The proposal to divide Eletrobras into two enterprises --  Eletrobras Participacoes (Eletropart) and Eletrobras -- resulted  from studies made by the Eletrobras technical team, the National  Bank for Economic and Social Development, and the Mines and  Energy Ministry. The objective of these studies was to  privatize the field of electrical energy, which yields an  overall $15 billion per year. Half of this amount is produced by  the companies owned by the federal government.    Eletropart would have control over the shares of Furnas  Electric Power Plants, Inc., Sao Francisco Hydroelectric  Company, Southern Electric Power Plants, and Northern Electric  Power Plants, and would be able to open its capital and sell the  shares of these companies at the stock market of [unfinished  sentence as published].    This proposal changes the government concept of  privatization  only through the sale of physical assets. According to  government sources, this system would represent a sort of  "socialization of capital" of the federal state-owned companies  in the electrical energy field.    The provisional measure that would make this possible  establishes that all Eletrobras areas that have functions  typical of those performed by the government will remain with  the company that will retain this name. Such will be the case  of the Electrical Energy Research Center, the planning and  coordination areas, the nuclear energy enterprises, and the  Itaipu Binational Enterprise. Eletrobras would continue to  manage two companies that are already in the privatization list:  the Light and Power Company and Escelsa (Espirito Santo State).    According to official sources, the current text of the  proposed provisional measure would receive a favorable report  from jurist Fabio Konder Comparato. It has still not been sent  to the presidency of the Republic because of the recent  installation of a new finance minister. As a result, the  Finance Ministry Executive Secretariat is late in examining this  new privatization model.    Another contribution this model could bring to the  privatization of the federal state-owned companies in the  electrical energy field would be to make biddings unnecessary.  The draft bill on franchising for the exploitation of the  energy field by private sector companies makes biddings  mandatory. Privatization through the sale of shares and the  system of share control would not alter the franchise contracts.    The privatization program has been dragging on, and the  companies producing electrical energy represent nowadays the  most attractive companies in the hands of the federal government  unless constitutional monopolies become more flexible. The  government has been keeping this provisional measure secret, at  least for the time being, so as not to have to face corporatist  reactions from employees of the electrical energy producing  companies.    Official sources believe that this proposal is, therefore,  an  effort to preserve the field and to create the required  conditions to finish construction work that has been paralyzed  for lack of resources.</p>

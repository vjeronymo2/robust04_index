			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Observer: Standard fare Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery but timing is important, too. No sooner had the plongeurs washed up on the last Friday afternoon of the FT's Lunch for a Fiver fortnight, than representatives from London's Evening Standard were ringing restaurateurs to see if they were interested in their proposed Dinner for a Tenner during April. Although the FT scheme was described by Brian Clivaz, general manager of Simpsons-in-the-Strand, as 'the most successful restaurant promotion ever', his fellow restaurateurs are also aware that April usually heralds an upturn in trade. Surprising if there were many takers.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos by </F> correspondent Monique Mas; date and place not given -- recorded]    [Text] Our guest today is Jose Eduardo dos Santos. His  visit to France was his first trip outside Africa since his  victory in the September 1992 presidential elections and the  resumption of the war with UNITA [National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola]. After the visit was postponed, and in  spite of the opposition of French supporters of UNITA, the  Angolan president was met officially in Paris by his  counterpart, President Francois Mitterrand, and also by Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur and the French ministers of  cooperation and the interior. This was a form of diplomatic  recognition for Eduardo dos Santos, but France failed to commit  itself at any level. Paris has made the resumption of its  cooperation conditional on a peace agreement, has referred the  rescheduling of the 1 billion francs owed to it by Angola to the  IMF, and has upheld its embargo on arms sales. Monique Mas  began by asking President Dos Santos if he was not disappointed  by his visit:    [Santos] No, we are not disappointed. The most important  thing for us is that France has a firm position on the current  problems in Angola. We heard from the French authorities that  there was a legitimate, elected government in Angola. It is  with this government that France will maintain relations of  friendship and cooperation within a relatively privileged  framework.    We view the question of the [arms] embargo within the  broader  framework of the United Nations, in light of the resolution  adopted by the Security Council, whereby the Angolan Government  is free -- at least until the cease-fire is reimposed in Angola  -- to reequip itself militarily. France is a permanent member  of the Security Council, and so I hope that France will apply  this United Nations resolution.    Regarding the resumption of economic cooperation in the  post-war period, I think that there was considerable interest  from the French Government in broadening current levels of  cooperation, so that Angola can enjoy not only the support of  France, but also that of the international community as a whole.  The possibility was even raised of organizing an international  conference on the rehabilitation of Angola.    [Mas] On the subject of the international community, the  United States and Great Britain have lifted the military embargo  against Angola. How do you explain France's differing position  on this issue, and do these two countries supply you with  anything significant in terms of arms?    [Santos] It is more a political than a military question. We  have not asked for arms from either the British, U.S., or French  Governments, but, as I have stressed, there is a rebellion in  Angola, the French Government has diplomatic relations with the  Angolan Government, which it recognizes as a legitimate and  elected government, so we do not see any reason for an embargo.  We are sure that the French position on this issue will change.    [Mas] With France in a period of cohabitation, have you been  reassured as to this government's attitude to Angola in contrast  to that of the previous socialist government? What do you  expect from France, in particular on the subject of the Lusaka  talks?    [Santos] As I told you, we heard a common position from the  French authorities regarding the political, military, and even  economic problems in Angola. We are very satisfied with this  position. We have asked France to play a role in this region in  order to establish a regional climate which can accelerate the  negotiating process in Lusaka.    [Mas] What role in particular?    [Santos] We would like France to put pressure on all the  countries in the region that continue to give military aid to  UNITA, helping it wage war against the democratic institutions.    [Mas] Would this be mainly Zaire?    [Santos] South Africa -- let us say conservative, radical  elements in South Africa -- and also Zaire of course.    [Mas] The Lusaka talks have touched on political issues. How  far are you prepared to go in your talks with UNITA?    [Santos] Taking account of the basic principle that the  party  that won the elections should set up a government and should  govern, we are prepared to offer portfolios to UNITA, within a  framework of national reconciliation, just as we have offered  portfolios to other political parties represented in our  government.    [Mas] What can you offer Mr. Savimbi?    [Santos] What UNITA asks for is a special status. The terms  of this status will be discussed in Lusaka.</p>

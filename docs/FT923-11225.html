			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Arts: Sunk by the guns of commercialism - Richard Newbury finds himself disappointed by an exhibition of British sea power WHEN THE Duke of Edinburgh officially opens the 20th Century Sea Power gallery at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London, later this year (it opened to the public this week), it will be a moment of some historical irony. One hundred years ago, the Duke's great-great grandmother, Queen Victoria, presided over the mightiest navy the world had seen. This awesome force was a shield for the world's greatest merchant fleet. British maritime and economic power were supreme. So spectacular has been the decline of this power during the intervening century, that the very possibility of this new gallery has depended on the sponsorship of a Taiwan-based shipping company. It is therefore appropriate that a section of the 20th century gallery should be devoted to trade, not merely because trade is chiefly seaborne, but because it creates the wealth upon which naval power is founded. Britain's mighty fleets in the early years of this century must be seen in the context of her imperial interests and trading advantages. Equally, the disintegration of the Empire and the loss of its valuable trade can be seen to have contributed to Britannia's fall from world to merely European power. However, instead of an analysis of this sort, the section devoted to trade is largely taken up by a wall of video screens each showing the same film - but out of synch with each other - of random images loosely connected with trade. The effect is like looking through the window of a television shop, and is about as instructive. This meaningless farrago is accompanied by loud music. An adjacent board explains in a few lines that 90 per cent of our trade is still seaborne, and that our merchant fleet is now ranked 16th in the world. Is this an adequate summary of the subject? Does it explain anything? Again, the first section of the gallery aims to introduce the theme of sea power but, far from providing a description of its various civil and military manifestations, it presents the visitor with another wall of video screens showing guns firing, ships exploding, aircraft landing, etc., without coherence, chronology or any apparent intellectual rationale. Only the most hardened video-junkie could watch for more than a few seconds. The sound of explosions on the sound track makes contemplation of the surrounding displays difficult. The promise of electronic gimmickry made in the gallery's press release is amply fulfilled in the following 'interactive display area'. It is legitimate that the technicalities of radar-links and missile systems be given some coverage; after all, this is not an exhibition of portrait miniatures but of technological science. However, to what extent actually trying to work these systems oneself contributes to an understanding of the subject as a whole must be open to argument. A large area given over to play will displace more historically instructive material. A single factual insight concerning technology itself can be far more illuminating than any amount of button pressing. For example, next to the Jutland display it would have been interesting to read that at the beginning of the First World War the numerical superiority of the Royal Navy was offset by the German technological lead in many crucial areas, such as range-finding and torpedoes, and that this was partly due to the superiority of the German educational system which produced more graduates from technical colleges and universities. Indeed, the standard of education attributed to the visitors to this gallery is not flattering. There must be a patronising belief at directorial level that museums must above all be entertaining, and that the public does not want to read anything but only wants to watch video screens. The next section deals with battle fleets. This is a large subject and needs to be carefully introduced and developed. The approach here, however, is to present the visitor with scattered paragraphs of information in which no one aspect of the subject is thoroughly tackled. There is a sense of historical progression, but it is not structured in any intelligible way. The battle of Jutland is dealt with in some detail on an audiovisual loop tape, the sound track of which, again, makes the study of neighbouring displays difficult. Through this 'lowest common denominator' approach one can detect a strong curatorial desire for something better. The selection of paintings is excellent. Mostly the work of official war artists (including some German), these paintings are of unique documentary as well as artistic value. The pressure to produce propaganda seems to have been resisted, given that the censors would not have allowed depictions of British disasters. Some of the painters represented here produced their best work as war artists. Stephen Bone, whose pedestrian vision is familiar in views of Camden Town back gardens and kitchen sinks, conveys something of the unheroic routine of ordinary men in extraordinary circumstances in his paintings of life on an S-Class submarine.' Up The Conning Tower' of 1944 is unquestionably one of his best compositions. In contrast, Charles Pears cannot resist producing an epic effect, as in his painting 'An Arctic Convoy'. These pictures are a reminder of the limitations of documentary photography which, for all its value as a mechanical record, communicates no trace of the witness's emotions. A problem peculiar to a museum of maritime history is the impossibility of displaying anything more than a few peripheral fragments of the ships themselves. Credit is therefore due here to the designers, who have imaginatively chosen to install the display areas in the reconstructed hull of a ship, the bows of which confront the visitor at the entrance to the gallery. Again, the ship models are superb, particularly the King George V, made by Vickers as a scale prototype for examination by the Admiralty. Over six feet long, it is perhaps the star of the gallery. Having felt excited about the opening of this gallery for a number of months, it is a great disappointment to see so many momentous themes and dramatic events chopped up into brief paragraphs that are assumed to suit the concentration span of the public. If the subject is simply beyond the scope of a single gallery, why waste precious space with needless electronic entertainment? The subject demands more history and less 'whammy'.</p>

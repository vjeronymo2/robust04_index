			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 10 DEAD AS ARGENTINE FOOD RIOTS SPREAD;  </P> <P> 1,600 LOOTERS DETAINED AS EXPLOSION OF UNREST AFFECTS 12 CITIES  </P> <P> Food riots spread to more than a dozen Argentine cities and towns Tuesday,  engulfing the vast industrial belt around Buenos Aires and leaving at least 10  dead in an explosion of anger over hyperinflation.  </P> <P> Five bombs went off in the capital, causing little damage but further jangling  nerves as President Raul Alfonsin's lame-duck government groped to rein in the  chaotic economy and restore order.  </P> <P> More than 1,600 looters were detained under state-of-siege powers imposed  Monday night, including 1,000 in Rosario, Argentina's second-largest city,  about 165 miles northwest of the capital, authorities said.  </P> <P> Hundreds of supermarkets and other stores were ransacked in working-class  suburbs and squatter towns, mainly around Buenos Aires and Rosario, and  hundreds of looters were injured in running battles with police firing  handguns, rubber bullets and tear-gas grenades.  </P> <P> The pillaging tested Alfonsin's resolve to see his term through its December  finish and thus preside over the first constitutional transition of power from  one party to another in Argentina's history. The largest trade union  confederation joined a range of sectors in demanding that Alfonsin step down  and allow the Peronist president-elect, Carlos Saul Menem, to assume office  early.  </P> <P> Menem, the La Rioja province governor who won a landslide victory May 14,  appealed for calm and made clear he was in no hurry to step in. "We are all  worried by this situation, and I ask understanding and support from the  people," he said.  </P> <P> The government insisted that ultra-left agitators were stirring up the poor to  break into shops and steal goods, including appliances and furniture, as well  as food. But leftist politicians and many residents themselves scoffed at that  explanation as an excuse to deflect attention from the desperation and hunger  brought on by the government's repeated economic failures, culminating in an  unprecedented burst of inflation -- about 70% for the month of May alone.  </P> <P> Police officer Jorge Garcia, who was in charge of 30 to 40 officers guarding a  large supermarket barricaded with upturned chairs and pallets, said: "It's a  mix of reasons. There are needs, but it is also organized. If there was no  need, the agitators wouldn't have fertile ground to sow problems."  </P> <P> The death toll rose to six in Rosario, including a store owner who shot himself  as looters ransacked his shelves. Severe rioting had broken out before dawn  Monday and it resumed Tuesday. The looting spread to nearby Villa Gobernador  Galvez, where Mayor Santos Mauro said, "They left practically nothing, they  stripped everything -- supermarkets, stores, shoe shops."  </P> <P> In greater Buenos Aires, home to one-third of the nation's 31 million people,  at least 11 towns suffered waves of sackings.  </P> <P> San Miguel, a city of about 300,000 people northwest of the capital, counted  four dead as poor residents burst out of their squatter and working-class  neighborhoods and ransacked and destroyed shops along a half-mile-long avenue.  Military helicopters clattered overhead and police vans roamed the street,  firing in the air and shooting tear gas and rubber bullets at groups of  looters.  </P> <P> Police traded fire with a young man and captured him in an alley, dragging him  away to a squad car, one of several reported cases of gunfights between  civilians and police in different clashes.  </P> <P> The principal target in more than 18 hours of looting in the area was a  wholesale food warehouse, in which the crowd stripped nearly bare dozens of  racks full of food. Police fired tear gas into the warehouse, driving out the  looters, who left a trail of broken jars of olives, mayonnaise, noodles and  grape juice.  </P> <P> Farther down the street, the mobs smashed windows and tore open the metal  shutters of small stores selling products ranging from furniture to food.  Although police reinforcements were brought in from several towns, the patrols  took little action, reluctant to cause further casualties.  </P> <P> "There is much hunger here, the people are earning the equivalent of $18 to $20  a month," said a civil defense worker who was tending to the wounded. "They are  mostly mothers with children. They didn't throw anything. They want sugar and  milk, some are even asking the police to let them pass."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Increase in Minimum Wage  </P> <P> The government announced a 117% increase in the minimum wage Tuesday, to 8,700  australs a month; that equalled only about $43 because of the collapse of the  austral against the dollar since February. However, increasing numbers of  workers complained their pay is below the minimum wage. Stella Maris de Varias,  a 38-year-old mother of six from the Barrio San Isidro housing project in  suburban Buenos Aires, said her husband, a metal shop worker, earned 20  australs an hour, or $16 a month.  </P> <P> The government also imposed ceiling prices for bread, sugar and flour that are  below the current selling prices.  </P> <P> In a new program of monitoring price increases, government inspectors ordered  seven major companies to close for 24 hours for overcharging.  </P> <P> Yet it was unclear whether such measures would calm widespread anger over lost  buying power and the emergence of real hunger in Argentina, a major beef and  grain exporter.  </P> <P> Mercedes Carmen Herrera, standing outside a supermarket in San Miguel that had  been sacked Monday, said she worked as a maid for 100 australs -- about 50  cents -- for four hours' work. Another woman shouted over her shoulder: "She  works four hours to buy a two-pound bag of sugar!"  </P> <P> Stores throughout greater Buenos Aires and Rosario closed two hours early. Food  markets rationed purchases to no more than two of any item.  </P> <P> With banks limiting withdrawals to just over $100 a person per week, many  Argentines are desperately low on cash and many don't know how they will pay  their employees, rent and other end-of-the-month accounts. Currency exchange  houses have remained closed because of a lack of australs.  </P></p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Custos slides SKr398m into red CUSTOS, the Swedish investment group, slid to a SKr398m (Dollars 55m) loss after tax in 1992, a sharp reverse from the SKr159m profit recorded a year earlier. The group, which is majority-owned by Volvo, the motor vehicle group, and Skanska, Sweden's largest construction company, blamed the loss on high interest rates, turmoil in the capital markets, and a downturn in the Swedish stock market. The group cut its dividend to SKr1 from SKr7. Custos said income fell to SKr408m from SKr457m, while interest costs climbed to SKr694m, compared with SKr585m. An injection into a subsidiary amounted to a further SKr400m. The group noted that the adjusted value of its share portfolio fell by 23 per cent to SKr5.76bn, compared with a fall of just 1 per cent for the Stockholm stock market as measured by the Affarsvarlden general index. At January 15, the company calculated its own net worth at SKr74 per share, or a total of SKr3.52bn. Volvo and Skanska launched a bid for full control of Custos last October in what many thought would be the first step in the dissolution of cross-shareholding links between the two groups. The offer was later abandoned after it was rebuffed by big shareholders and share prices began to recover. However, a joint bid for a minority stake in a smaller investment company, Protorp, did proceed successfully after the original terms were improved. Skanska and Volvo said yesterday they now owned 99.6 per cent of Protorp's shares, including those held by Euroc, Skanska's building materials affiliate. The offer was worth SKr200 per share, valuing the company at SKr2bn.</p>

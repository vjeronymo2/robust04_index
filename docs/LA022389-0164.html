			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVE MAKES CHALLENGE OF EVIDENCE MORE LIKELY;  </P> <P> JUDGE WON'T RULE ON SURVEILLANCE AT EXCHANGES  </P> <P> Calling it "an interesting and difficult question," a federal judge Wednesday  refused to rule immediately on the legality of electronic surveillance used by  the FBI during its undercover investigation of alleged fraud at Chicago's two  major commodity exchanges.  </P> <P> The decision by John F. Grady, chief judge of the Northern District of  Illinois, left the door open for lawyers eventually to contest the  admissibility of evidence gathered by "human bugs" -- electronically outfitted  FBI agents working undercover in the trading pits of the Chicago Board of Trade  and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  </P> <P> Civil liberties lawyer Burton Joseph said Grady's language suggested that the  judge believed "the argument is far from frivolous and merits serious  consideration."  </P> <P> Criminal lawyers representing many of the traders called before the special  grand jury hearing the government's case believe that the challenge to the  recorded evidence could undermine the unprecedented government investigation of  commodity futures trading.  </P> <P> Former federal prosecutors Susan Bogart and Stephen J. Senderowitz filed the  novel challenge on behalf of three traders subpoenaed in the probe. They  contend that this type of electronic monitoring, where ambient conversations  are overheard, requires judicial authorization. Apparently, the government did  not have that authorization when FBI agents recorded conversations on the  trading floors.  </P> <P> If prior judicial approval was necessary before the wired agents went into the  trading pits, Joseph and other lawyers said, much of the government's evidence  in this investigation could be tainted and unusable.  </P> <P> Grady did not address that question in his ruling. Instead, he said it was the  wrong time to file the challenge because Bogart's and Senderowitz's clients,  who were not identified by name, had not yet appeared before the grand jury. If  they do appear and are cited for contempt for refusing to answer questions,  Grady wrote, then the legality of the electronic surveillance can be  challenged.  </P> <P> Bogart said an appeal of Grady's Wednesday decision was being prepared.  </P> <P> While the challenge was heard in secret last week -- and all the proceedings  except Grady's eight-page decision remain secret -- the ruling provided  additional insight into the government's investigation.  </P> <P> The judge wrote that the three traders represented by Senderowitz and Bogart  "have indicated that, should they appear before the grand jury, they intend to  invoke their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination."  </P> <P> Because of that, Grady wrote, "the court sees no reason to decide the  electronic surveillance question as a mere academic exercise."  </P></p>

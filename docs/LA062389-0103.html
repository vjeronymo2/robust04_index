			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRIME COMPUTER DISCLOSES SECRET WHITE KNIGHT  </P> <P> After months of searching, Prime Computer disclosed Thursday that it may  finally have found a white knight buyer to rescue it from a hostile takeover  bid by MAI Basic Four of Tustin.  </P> <P> The Natick, Mass., minicomputer maker said its board is reviewing an  acquisition offer it received from a bidder that asked not to be identified. In  a prepared statement, Prime said the terms of the offer prohibit the company at  this point from disclosing the amount of the bid or the identity of the bidder.  </P> <P> MAI, meanwhile, said it intends to raise its pending $1.1-billion offer for  Prime, but the company would not say by how much.  </P> <P> Analysts said the emergence of a rival bidder and MAI's willingness to boost  its offer indicates that the seven-month takeover struggle is nearing a finale.  </P> <P> "We're getting close to the end of this one," said Robert M. Johnson, a  technology analyst with the brokerage firm Rotan Mosle Inc. in Houston.  </P> <P> The disclosure of a second bidder was not entirely unexpected. Prime recently  said it was talking to several prospective buyers. It identified them only as  two Fortune 500-size corporations and two firms specializing in debt-financed  acquisitions known as leveraged buyouts.  </P> <P> A Prime spokesman said he did not know when the company would disclose the  identity of the bidder or details of the offer.  </P> <P> Trading in Prime's stock was halted Thursday to give investors time to digest  the new information. The company's stock closed unchanged at $15.875 per share  in New York Stock Exchange trading.  </P></p>

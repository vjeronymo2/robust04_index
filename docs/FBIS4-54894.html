			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik "prepared by" </F> Julius Gembicky in Bratislava; date of interview not given: "A  Prime Minister for the Short or Long Term?"]    [Text] Bratislava--Following last year's visit by former  Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, the NARODNA OBRODA editorial  office welcomed Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik 43 days  after he formed his Cabinet. They are both from central  Slovakia. However, each is made of different stuff--different  vocabulary, drive, and temperament. To be honest, the diplomatic  polish of the latter prime minister is not, on the outside, in  any way reminiscent of the Polana temperament. It is perhaps  only revealed by the quiet determination with which he worked  his way to the top rung of the Slovak political ladder.    [NARODNA OBRODA] Mr. Prime Minister, you traveled along part  of the same political path as Vladimir Meciar. When did you  begin to part ways, and what was the moment of truth in your  mutual relations?    [Moravcik] The break did not occur in our personal relations  but involved a mutual political parting of ways. There is a  tendency to personalize political disputes in our country. For  example, I have always had different views from Jan Carnogursky,  but we have always remained friends. The rift in relations with  Meciar began last year after I was appointed foreign minister  and became an open rift in May or June. It consisted of a  different point of view on looking after Slovakia's interests.    We each had a different feeling about how this should be  done. In my opinion, the methods and style of Meciar's  government did not do our interests any service. My--almost  singular--opinion did not at that time represent within the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] an alternative to this  style of government. It came about with great difficulty and  under dramatic circumstances.    [NARODNA OBRODA] In the most recent public opinion poll,  however, almost 45 percent of respondents are of the opinion  that the HZDS will again emerge victorious from the early  elections....    [Moravcik] I am also convinced that the HZDS will obtain the  highest number of votes in the elections. Obviously, the  majority of you feel the same. This is very likely, and it  probably cannot be changed. Of course, this does not mean that I  support the HZDS.    [NARODNA OBRODA] What, then, are you doing specifically to  alter this situation? What kind of chairman are you if you do  not venture to win the elections?    [Moravcik] No, we cannot cope with this responsibility. We  will not win the elections ourselves. Nevertheless, I am  convinced that this governing grouping will be successful if it  combines its efforts. I am willing to work hard for this. I am  even willing to work on my image.    [NARODNA OBRODA] Some coalition radicals are criticizing you  and are claiming that the necessary drive alone will not suffice  for a more effective preelection campaign against the  opposition. They say that you will not win over the politically  undecided and irresolute with nonconfrontational decency. Why  have you adopted defensive tactics?    [Moravcik] Because carrying on along confrontational lines,  which I indicated in my speech when I introduced the  government's policy statement, would not bring us what we are  striving for--a calm atmosphere among the population. If we do  not maintain this, we will not manage to achieve what we have  set out to achieve. Calm also represents an economic value that  can be expressed numerically. Therefore, we have no reason to  change what we started with. I believe that a cooperative style  of politics will also be asserted after the elections.    [NARODNA OBRODA] However, it was possible to discern a  certain tension within the broad coalition government after your  election as Democratic Union of Slovakia chairman. This also  took some of your coalition partners by surprise....    [Moravcik] We consulted all of our partners on this  eventuality. However, as far as the consultations with Party of  the Democratic Left [SDL] representatives are concerned, I admit  frankly that, during them, we confused informal talks with  formal ones. We apologized earnestly to Peter Weiss for this  mistake and added that it should not affect our relations.    [NARODNA OBRODA] However, it is still fresh in the people's  minds that it was your Alternative that did not want the  political elite to become involved in executive power....    [Moravcik] Even I do not like this solution much. I know  that  we have lost some points over this. However, it was a necessary  compromise that enabled us to implement a plan of cooperation  among those political entities that have a compatible or close  orientation.    [NARODNA OBRODA] Could this issue not have been resolved,  for  instance, by using the method applied in Great Britain? There  they differentiate between the party chairman and leader....    [Moravcik] Such a solution was on offer. Only it is unknown  in our political environment. Our solution corresponds to it.    [NARODNA OBRODA] Other factors, however, may have a much  more  significant influence on the outcome of the elections--how much  money will be left for the social sphere, what kind of price  hikes there will be, while the increased value-added tax on  foodstuffs in particular is a major bugbear.    [Moravcik] Health care and education are on the verge of  collapse. To be able to at least maintain education at the most  essential level and provide health-care services and medicines,  we simply have to have additional resources. We can acquire  these by raising taxes. To reduce expenditures and bring in  resources, we are preparing an option whereby value-added tax  will be set at the single rate of 25 percent--for luxury  foodstuffs and services. We want to raise consumer tax on  cigarettes and alcohol. We are still considering beer. However,  we do not want to live to the detriment of the future.    [NARODNA OBRODA] It is said that a government that  increases the price of beer will fall.    [Moravcik] Therefore, we are merely considering it. First  and  foremost, however, we would like to bring more resources into  the budget by means of greater financial discipline, even by  increasing the fines for misdemeanors. Although not very much is  obtained from this, the penalty for them is low, and so we can  allow ourselves to be more strict. We would like to save  something in expenditure on the Army. It is a problem, but we  are also thinking about reducing the subsidies for agriculture.  This will be even more complicated. We want to partially reduce  the subsidies for energy, but, so far, these measures are merely  being taken into consideration.    [NARODNA OBRODA] Although we are at the end of April, the  greatest change is expected in the budget. Was it perhaps  formulated too optimistically, not only with regard to the  sources of revenue but also with regard to expenditure?    [Moravcik] The sources were overestimated and the  expenditure  was underestimated. This causes hidden tension in the budget. We  will have to take active steps to ensure that health care and  education do not collapse. If we were to choose the path of  lesser resistance and permitted a deficit at the level of last  year's, the state's overall indebtedness would again increase  and we would nudge the solution to our current problems into the  future. This would be at variance with what we have undertaken  to do in the government's policy statement.    [NARODNA OBRODA] Your Cabinet is making the maximum possible  effort to reach an agreement with the IMF that would create a  favorable climate for the Slovak Republic's cooperation with the  financial world. Is this not merely patching up the budget with  the aim of maintaining the koruna's internal convertibility?    [Moravcik] The standby loan and the most advantageous terms  for its repayment will create an important background,  especially for the entry of foreign investors. The issue does  not so much involve the $140 million as the possibility of  earning some money. Investment injections from outside improve  our credibility and thus the reliability of our economic and  trade relations. We could also get loans under more  disadvantageous conditions, but we value this effect. That is,  we will enter into this even with the knowledge that some of our  measures will be unpopular and will affect the pockets of every  citizen. Therefore, we have to create a form of compensation for  the socially weakest sectors. We are specifying what kind.  However, we will decide when all the negotiations are concluded.    [NARODNA OBRODA] Did Deputy Prime Minister Schmognerova and  Finance Minister Filkus get on well at their talks in Washington  with representatives from the IMF and the World Bank?    [Moravcik] As far as I know, yes. The talks took place in a  pleasant atmosphere and confirmed the interest from abroad in  helping Slovakia.    [NARODNA OBRODA] With your permission, Mr. Prime Minister, a  heretical question. It seems to us that foreign investors are  still waiting in front of the gates, at least until the  elections, because they consider your Cabinet to be a  provisional one.    [Moravcik] Despite this skepticism and the short time we  have  at our disposal, I am an optimist. I believe that we will manage  to convince both potential investors and our citizens before the  elections.    [NARODNA OBRODA] Every government has made promises of its  willingness to help businessmen. This is as far as most of them  got. Moreover, you have little time....    [Moravcik] Therefore, the most important task will be to  guarantee sufficient sources of credit. The National Bank of  Slovakia may also increase its credit margin. But this will not  be enough. We see additional sources in activating the National  Property Fund, in the Guarantee Bank, and, apart from this, we  will seek foreign assistance--all during this short period. We  are thinking about reducing the tax burden on businessmen, which  is on the verge of tolerability, in the future. It does not  motivate anyone, but it does lead to tax evasion. Therefore, we  intend to accede to tax liberalization, which, in essence, has a  motivating effect and, in the final analysis, increases budget  revenue.    [NARODNA OBRODA] Some foreign sources have said that, even  under the former government, the economic decline was halted and  that we have already pushed off from the bottom....    [Moravcik] We would not assess the state of our economy so  optimistically. Although there have been some positive trends,  we have not managed to turn the export-import ratio in the  desired direction. However, this is also due to the fact that  exports are usually lower in the first few months of the year;  they culminate sometime in November. Nevertheless, it is  possible to expect what we so carefully formulated in the policy  statement, that the trend toward zero growth is a partial reason  for optimism. Moreover, the foreign currency operations have  also shown some signs of life.    [NARODNA OBRODA] In your opinion, will the negative  reaction from the Czech side to the mutual assignment of  certificates for imported foodstuffs and products also be  projected into the higher prices for agricultural products in  Slovakia?    [Moravcik] When we assumed executive power, the  implementation of the legal stipulation on their mandatory  assignment, approved by the National Council of the Slovak  Republic, had still not been adequately prepared from a  technical point of view. Therefore, we agreed to a postponement  of one month. It could not be resolved hitherto because of the  different interests of the Slovak and Czech sides. However, I do  not think it is exactly helpful if, a week before the deadline  expires, the whole issue is transferred from the specialist to  the political level, even though there was no time to resolve  the contentious points before 1 May. However, this does not  release us from the mandatory assignment of certificates as laid  down by the law. I also conveyed this to [Czech Trade and  Industry] Minister Dlouhy in a telephone conversation when he  requested a further postponement. However, if problems have  cropped up on their side, they could have let us know earlier.  It was already too late for us. And will this matter be  projected into the increased prices? Issuing certificates does  not exact especially high financial costs. But it could if it  stiffly curbs the import of cheaper Czech products.    [NARODNA OBRODA] Mr. Prime Minister, your government is to  prepare a number of laws for parliament. Will you be able to  cope with the process of adopting them in view of the fact that  summer and the recess are approaching?    [Moravcik] Yes, if we proceed from the idea of a working  summer. For us to achieve this, parliament will hold a working  session at the end of July. We would like to adopt some of the  norms, while others will be at least legislatively prepared for  the postelection government. Our ambition is that it is our  coalition government, although we do not know whether it would  have the same personnel it has at the moment.    [NARODNA OBRODA] In your opinion, what will the HZDS  deputies  come out with in their proposal to recall Deputy Prime Minister  Kovac?    [Moravcik] I am convinced that the accusation is fabricated.  I am also convinced that this is merely an attempt to denigrate  government members. This is a scheme according to which, if they  do not prove anything, they will at least sow seeds of doubt in  the people's minds. Such a way of thinking is alien to me.  Political practices like this merely damage Slovakia. I do not  think it is a decent form of political rivalry.    [NARODNA OBRODA] Is your situation also not complicated,  Prime Minister, by the rumors that one of your Cabinet team has  problems with the screening law?    [Moravcik] As it is made clear in the screening law, I asked  for all government members to be screened to find out if they  comply with the law's conditions. I am waiting for an answer.    [NARODNA OBRODA] Apparently, some coalition partners are  also  thinking about changing the election law. The issue involves, in  particular, increasing the number of electoral districts from  four to seven. Moreover, the SDL is proposing that the election  campaign be shortened to two weeks and that the number of  broadcasts on radio and television be cut....    [Moravcik] At the moment, opinions are not unanimous in  everything. However, we have agreed that we will adhere to the  hitherto valid rules of the game--that is, four electoral  districts and a month-long election campaign. Nonetheless, we  have left this issue open. We did not consider it to be a  fundamental problem.    [NARODNA OBRODA] In connection with the term of your mandate  and the unpopularity of some measures, you may find yourself in  a dilemma over whether to postpone the early elections....    [Moravcik] I admit that this is the case. Six months is too  little to be able to change more substantially the ratio of  political forces--that is, the problems of the old parliament  will, to a certain extent, recur after the elections. I make no  secret of the fact that, during the talks with our partners, we  also discussed the idea of postponing the elections until 1995.    [NARODNA OBRODA] Why was the idea not adopted?    [Moravcik] Some parties were of the opinion that this would  not be to their advantage. It seems this was not quite the  correct conclusion to reach.    [NARODNA OBRODA] Mr. Prime Minister, you are a native of  Ocova. When did you last sing with Jan Berky-Mrenica?    [Moravcik] I have never sung with him. But I like his music  very much. It is a shame we have not seen each other for a  couple of years.    [NARODNA OBRODA] So, what if you were to meet in NARODNA  OBRODA next time?</p>

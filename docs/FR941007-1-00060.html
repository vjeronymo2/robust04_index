			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A small institution that met each of the standards for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``satisfactory'' rating and exceeded some or all of those standards could have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received an overall rating of ``outstanding'' depending on the degree to which it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeded the criteria for a ``satisfactory'' rating and, at its option, its record of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making qualified investments and its record of providing services. If a small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution failed to meet or exceed all of the standards for a ``satisfactory''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rating, the relevant agency would have conducted a more extensive examination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the institution, including, at the option of the institution, an examination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its investment and service performance. Also, if a small institution operated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more than one service area, the relevant agency would have evaluated the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's performance in all of those service areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many community and consumer group commenters asked the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies to eliminate the small institution assessment method because they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed that it would operate as an exemption for qualifying institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, many banks and thrifts, as well as the weight of Congressional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments, supported the streamlined approach. The agencies have retained the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> streamlined assessment method as modified in the revised proposal. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies also have retained the December proposal's exemption of small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions from the new data collection and reporting requirements for small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business, small farm and community development loans, although the agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have clarified that small institutions would not be subjected to those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements because they request to be evaluated under the strategic plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agencies reiterate, however, that they do not intend by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal to exempt small institutions from the CRA or subject them to a less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demanding standard of performance. The revised proposal has been redrafted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> so that the format of the small institution approach is more straightforward.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised proposal first states the criteria that the agencies would use to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assess the performance of a small institution, and then describes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance levels that correspond to satisfactory performance. As under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests for large retail institutions, the agencies have eliminated the structure of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rebuttable presumptions and have proposed a rating profile. A small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's performance need not fit every aspect of the rating profile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> describing ``satisfactory'' performance for it to receive that rating.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Exceptionally strong performance on some aspects can compensate for weak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance on others provided the institution's overall performance is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the rating profile. Small institutions that do not meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for a ``satisfactory'' record would be given the appropriate rating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without the necessity of a ``closer review.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters expressed concern that under the December  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal an institution would be required to affirmatively elect to be examined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the streamlined assessment method and suggested that the streamlined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method be the default examination procedure unless a qualifying institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elects another assessment method. The agencies agree and have drafted the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised proposal accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters representing holding companies and small institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are affiliates of holding companies with total banking and thrift assets over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $250 million urged that the $250 million asset limit take into consideration only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the assets of the subject bank or thrift and not the aggregate amount of bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and thrift assets held by the holding company or, alternatively, that the asset  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit be raised. Many community and governmental groups, on the other hand,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed that the asset limit should be lowered. After considering all of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments, the agencies have decided to retain the definition of small institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set forth in the December proposal. No compelling evidence was presented to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support a change of the asset limit. Further, the revised proposal reflects the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notion that the CRA performance of a small independent institution or small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affiliate institution of a small holding company should be measured against  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different standards than a small institution affiliate of a larger holding company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The consideration of assessment context added in the revised proposal will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit the agencies to make this differentiation. The larger holding company  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be expected to provide support and assistance to a degree not available to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a small independent institution or to an affiliate institution of a small holding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

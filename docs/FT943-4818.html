			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / People: Change at the top Regret in the City yesterday over the departure from Cowie, the car-leasing and motor-trading group, of Iain Jane, 49, the director responsible for the motor division, after 15 years with the company. Analysts said it was sad to see the break-up of the experienced management team which had built the Sunderland group into one of the industry's biggest companies. Last year Sir Tom Cowie, 71, stepped down after 45 years as chairman of the company he founded and was replaced by Sir James MacKinnon, previously director general of Ofgas. Cowie refused to comment on the reasons for Jane's departure, but analysts believe he may have lost out in the race to succeed Gordon Hodgson, 62, the chief executive, who now assumes overall responsibility for the motor division. The succession was always thought to lie between Jane and Neil Pykett, 46, the director responsible for Cowie contract hire and leasing business, which makes the bulk of group profits. Another possible factor is that Jane is a very hands-on manager, who may have felt cut off by the layer of divisional management which grew with Cowie.</p>

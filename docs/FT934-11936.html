			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Prominent Italians form queue for their day in court: Today's opening of the first corruption trial THE focus of Italy's corruption scandals shifts from investigation to prosecution today when the trial of Mr Sergio Cusani, alleged to have been a key middleman, opens in Milan. Mr Cusani is the first of the well known financial figures implicated in the corruption scandals to come before the courts. The evidence is his trial should provide a clearer picture of the political corruption and the links between politicians, businessmen, pliant judges and friendly bankers that have marked the scandals. So far countrywide investigations have involved more than 1,300 politicians, local party officials, civil servants and businessmen, plus at least 20 judges and magistrates and at least 15 members of the security services. Until now considerable information on the corruption scandals has been deliberately allowed to leak out by the investigating magistrates to discredit the politicians and frighten others into talking. But this is the first time that evidence will be heard in open court on matters relating to one of the biggest scandals of the past decade, the Enimont affair. Milan magistrates need an exemplary case study such as this to demonstrate how the old political system worked. Only after they have been able to do this will it be publicly acceptable to draw a line on their inquiries. For they themselves admit the investigations cannot be completely open-ended since corruption permeated every aspect of Italian society. Mr Cusani, who was arrested on July 23, also has the distinction of being the only person to refuse to co-operate with investigating magistrates and demand an early trial to ensure his point of view is fully aired. He faces a string of charges, including falsifying accounts, that relate to the affairs of the collapsed Ferruzzi-Montedison empire. In Milan business circles, he was a well known deal maker with close links to the Socialist party. The magistrates allege among other things that Mr Cusani was entrusted with overseeing a phoney property deal on behalf of the late Mr Raul Gardini, then head of Ferruzzi-Montedison. They allege the deal provided the cover to use Montedison funds for pay-offs worth some L150bn (Dollars 94m) to the politicians. This was in return for letting Ferruzzi-Montedison pull out at a huge profit in 1990 from Enimont, the joint chemicals venture with Eni, the state oil concern. Mr Cusani is also alleged to have handled at least part of the political pay-offs. Among the 60 odd people being called by the prosecution and defence in a trial expected to last into December are the leading political figures of the time - Mr Bettino Craxi, the then Socialist leader who is alleged to have received L75bn from the Enimont affair, and Mr Arnaldo Forlani, then head of the Christian Democrats, also alleged to have been given a pay-off. The corruption inquiries that began in Milan in February 1992 with the arrest of Mr Mario Chiesa, the socialist-appointed head of the city's largest old people's home, have moved extremely fast. This is partly because the magistrates have been successful in extracting confessions on a plea-bargaining basis. Extensive use of computers in cross-checking and data compilation has also helped. Elsewhere in Italy, the process has been slower. This has led the more zealous Milan magistrates to try to encroach on the turf of their colleagues in Naples, Rome and Turin, often resulting in procedural disputes. As time goes by, the united front of the Milan magistrates, increasingly exhausted by the sheer volume of work, has begun to crack. This has come into the open over whether to go ahead with the prosecution of senior figures in the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) for receiving illicit funds. The bulk of the investigative magistrates claim there is no case to answer, while the judge of first instance is refusing to bury the case. A big new development is likely to come from the series of secret conversations that Mr Craxi has been holding with Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the leading Milan investigative magistrate. The former Socialist leader earlier this month dropped his previous hostility to Mr Di Pietro and now seems willing to cut some sort of deal to head off prosecution. Mr Craxi is the first of the big political figures involved in the scandals who has volunteered testimony. He is alleged by the magistrates to be a central character in the system of corruption that evolved in the mid-1980s under his premiership. The press has already begun to speculate he has explosive information on Eni, Ferruzzi-Montediso, Fiat, Berlusconi's Fininvest media empire, and Olivetti as well as his old enemies, the communists. Developments surrounding Mr Craxi are likely to determine the speed at which the politicians agree to co-operate. Until now the majority have battled hard to preserve their parliamentary immunity.</p>

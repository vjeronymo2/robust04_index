			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Car design company goes into receivership IAD (UK), one of Europe's leading automotive design and engineering consultancies, has been forced into administrative receivership with debts of about Pounds 13.5m. Mr Maurice Withall and Mr Peter Flesher of accountants Grant Thornton have been appointed joint administrative receivers. Mr Withall said last night that offers for IAD had been received from several companies and a sale could be completed before the end of next week. 'We are very hopeful and expect to be successful in selling the business as a going concern,' he said. Mr Godfrey Harker, IAD group finance director, said the company's debts included bank debt of Pounds 7m, trade debt of Pounds 4m and Pounds 2.5m owed to the Inland Revenue. It expected to make a loss of Pounds 2m to Pounds 2.5m on a turnover of up to Pounds 52m in the year to the end of this month. Turnover had begun to fall sharply since mid-1992. The company had been profitable until halfway through the present financial year, but turnover had declined significantly from about Pounds 60m achieved in both the previous two years. The strain on IAD's finances was increased by the financial collapse in February of Daf, the Dutch truck maker, which owed IAD around Pounds 500,000. International Automotive Design, based at Worthing, West Sussex, has carried out contracts for many of the world's leading vehicle makers since it was formed in 1976 by Mr John Shute. The company is owned 77.5 per cent by Mr Shute and his family, and 22.5 per cent by Cinven, the UK's second largest venture capital investor. The company, which won three Queen's awards for exports in the late 1980s, has established a presence in most of the leading car producing countries with subsidiaries in Germany, France, Spain and the US and liaison offices in Tokyo, Seoul and Moscow. It has played a leading role in the design and prototype development of a wide range of vehicles including the Ford Scorpio estate car, Ford's Lincoln Town Car in the US, the Volvo 440 and the Mazda MX-5 sports car. It has played a leading role in the development of electric vehicles and recently won a substantial design and development contract from Telco, the large Indian commercial vehicle maker. The IAD group has a workforce of close to 1,000 worldwide, including a large number of independent consultants working under contract. The company employs just under 300 in the UK mainly at its Worthing headquarters. Only the UK parent company and five UK subsidiaries have been placed in receivership. Mr Harker said last night: 'It is the back end of the recession catching us. We had been looking for additional capital for a little while and had been trying to interest the venture capital market, but falling turnover did not help.' Under Mr Shute's forceful leadership IAD has been built into the UK's leading automotive design and engineering consultancy. Its concept vehicles have been exhibited at many of the world's leading international motor shows, and the company had started to rival many of the long-established Italian automotive design houses such as Pininfarina, Italdesign and Bertone.</p>

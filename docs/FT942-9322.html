			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Tokyo banks tire of Euro-mess: The resistance to European loans Japanese banks are experiencing a bad case of Europhobia. 'We're all saying anything which starts with 'Euro' ends up in a mess,' says an official of a leading Japanese bank. Large European projects such as Eurotunnel and Euro Disney have become big disappointments for the Japanese banks, which are alarmed by the continuous refinancing requests. Among the largest creditors in the projects, they now perceive that what they had expected to be one-off financing programmes have turned into commitments to churn out endless amounts of money. Since the burst of the economic 'bubble' of the late 1980s, Japanese banks have been generally cutting their international operations and their exposure to overseas investments. Capital flows from Japan to the US and Europe have changed sharply. According to Sanwa Research Institute, the research arm of the commercial bank, average annual Japanese investment of the past two years to the US has fallen by 48.6 per cent from 1988 and 1989 levels to Dollars 29.7bn (Pounds 20.3bn), while it has dropped 30.5 per cent to Dollars 41.2bn in Europe. The sluggish domestic economy and the sharp fall in loan growth have led the banks to turn instead to the fast-growing Asian economies. Capital flows to south-east Asia have grown more than 20 per from the late 1980s to Dollars 7.1bn in 1991-92. The rise in the yen has increased direct investment into Asia by Japanese manufacturers and companies, and banks have increased exposure in the region. Investment in the south-east Asian countries has started to slow during the past year, while growth in China has drawn investments from Japanese manufacturers and banks. 'We don't get a feel of what's really going on in Europe as we do with Hong Kong, China or Singapore,' says one banker. The prolonged haggling over Euro Disney's financial restructuring package, and the tensions over the Pounds 700m refinancing efforts of Eurotunnel, which needs new funds because of delays, have stemmed from the banks' un-Japanese show of resistance. Last month they grudgingly agreed to help Euro Disney reduce its FFr21bn (Pounds 2.45bn) debt. But earlier in the year, some of them appeared to have already unloaded their equity holdings because of pessimism over the project. The lack of enthusiasm in large Euro-projects, say the banks, is partly due to the absence of traditional and emotional ties to the region. Projects like Eurotunnel and Euro Disney are providing services which are not exportable, and have little commercial relevance outside Europe. 'The banks feel that they do not have the level of control they do in Asia, where Japanese companies wield influence,' says Mr Mark Faulkner, banking strategist at brokers SG Warburg in Tokyo. The lack of any political or other business benefits have meant decisions over the European projects have become purely commercial. Japanese banks have gradually started to increase lending to US companies, which are seeking funds as the economy recovers. The large refinancing programmes for blue chip US companies have started to attract Japanese lenders. For example, the banks played a leading role in International Business Machine's Dollars 10bn loan syndicate last November. While some banking officials claim that they are not deliberately avoiding European deals and would still actively participate in leading European financings, the Euro projects have left a bad aftertaste. Suggestions that central bankers and the government would use pressure to force the refinancing have left many banks especially angry. 'If the European governments think it's such an important project, they should use public funds,' says a Japanese banking official.</p>

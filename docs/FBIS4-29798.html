			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Sat. -- The increasing support for the  MCA [Malaysian Chinese Association] shows that the party is now  more acceptable to the Chinese community and this augurs well  for the Barisan Nasional [BN], Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr.  Mahathir Mohamed said today.    He said a strong MCA meant that BN would become even  stronger.    In congratulating the party leaders and members for their  hard work in making MCA a strong and respected party, he said  the community should continue to support the party as it was the  only one which could safeguard the interests of the Chinese in  the context of a multi-racial society.    "The MCA is also acceptable to UMNO [United Malays National  Organization] and other component parties as it is not extreme  or racist.    "It can also resolve problems in a rational way, quiet but  effective," he said at the opening of the 41st MCA annual  general meeting at Wisma MCA [MCA Building], here.    Dr. Mahathir also said that it was important that the people  support the Barisan Nasional government for the country's  continued stability, development and prosperity.    The government was a "tested" one and had proven its ability  to fulfil the needs and aspirations of all races, he said,  adding the BN government was fair to all races and gave priority  to their interests and those of the country.    "As a result, the country enjoys peace and prosperity and is  free from any racial strife."    Dr. Mahathir drew applause from the delegates when he said  that the country's successes in various fields had drawn  worldwide attention and many countries had even indicated their  intention to learn from Malaysia.    Dr. Mahathir said the moderate BN government also strongly  opposed any form of extremism.    "Extremism, racial or religious, in a multi-racial and  multi-religious country like Malaysia will only bring about  instability and riots," he added.    Dr. Mahathir, who is also the BN chairman, said that despite  the country's successes, there were certain quarters who were  unhappy and had criticised and alleged that the country was  undemocractic, unfair and had no respect for human rights.    "What is more disappointing is that there are opposition  politicians who are influenced by this or have joined in such  efforts to smear the country's image. They (opposition  politicians) even supply false information to these people," he  added.    Dr. Mahathir said the government was aware of individuals  and  opposition politicians who alleged, among other things, that  there was no freedom of speech through their interviews with the  foreign media.    "The fact that they can express their opinions and provide  incorrect information only shows that they are lying," he said,  adding that the government was disappointed with the actions of  these opposition politicians which he described as "betraying  the country".    "The difference between BN members and the opposition  parties  is that BN members are responsible for maintaining the country's  image, to develop the nation and preserving harmony and peace.    "On the other hand, the opposition parties do not have any  programmes for the good of the country.    "Besides, these opposition parties only know how to reject  facts and criticise the country's success, knowing that such  actions would be detrimental to the country and the people."    Dr. Mahathir also spoke of some opposition parties which had  even belittled the country in the international arena.    "They even accuse Malaysia of aiding the Bosnians through  its  participation in the United Nations peacekeeping force in  Bosnia-Herzegovina ... when they have done nothing for the  Bosnian victims."    He reiterated that it was Malaysia's sovereign right as an  independent nation to voice opinions and views on issues that  involved the country and other developing nations.    On talk about an early general election, Dr. Mahathir said  the "election fever" had already started and attributed this to  the opposition parties.    "It is believed that the opposition started this and fearing  that this will only affect their own members, they have also  decided to spread the fever to the Barisan Nasional members," he  said, drawing laughter from the delegates.    He reminded the delegates that the BN had the mandate to  rule  the country until October next year and said: "We have yet to  decide on the date."    However, all BN component parties must be ready to face the  general election any time.    He said the opposition parties were worried due to lack of  issues.    He said there was a party which was so desperate that it  abandoned its so called liberal policy.    It tried to get Malay support by changing its name and  claiming to be a Malay party for the Malays.    However, when they were confronted by non-Malays, they  claimed to be championing the cause of non-Malays, he said.    He said it was the same with a party which claimed to be  championing the cause of the Chinese but when challenged to do  something for the Chinese, they denied championing the cause of  the Chinese.</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Partco plans sharp gearing reduction Partco, Britain's largest independent distributor of automotive parts and equipment, said yesterday it planned to cut gearing in half and repay Pounds 13.4m of preference shares following its flotation next month. The Northampton-based group predicted its placing and intermediaries offer would raise Pounds 25m, giving the company a market value of Pounds 50m. Mr Chris Scott, finance director, said funds raised by the float would enable the group to repay preference shares issued to institutional investors as part of the 1986 buy-out from Quinton Hazell, the 1989 purchase of GKN Autoparts and a refinancing package in 1991. 'After repaying the prefence shares, we will reduce gearing by more than Pounds 2m and use the remainder to strengthen the balance sheet,' he said. The company, which delivers branded and own label products to business customers from a 210-branch network, said the placing would also enable it to proceed with expansion plans that could see it double in size over the next few years. Mr Peter Redfern, managing director, said its ability to pursue that course was underlined by a sharp improvement in profits. Pre-tax profits more than doubled to Pounds 4.28m (Pounds 2.05m) in 1993, while turnover increased 5 per cent to Pounds 124.3m. Operating profits rose to Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 3.5m), and gross margins were 34.3 per cent. The group announced earnings per share of 11.6p (3.1p) and a 2.9p dividend - the first in three years. COMMENT Independent garages like one-stop shopping and Partco has gained 45,000 customers as a result. Although it over-extended itself with the Pounds 22.7m GKN acquisition in 1989 and was forced to resort to refinancing during the recession, it is coming to the market at a time when garages and fleet operators are consolidating orders with a few national suppliers. Even though some of the original backers want out, the company should have enough cash to begin its ambitious expansion strategy and keep gearing at manageable levels.</p>

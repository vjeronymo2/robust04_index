			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Uncertainty in a stable world: Strains in the housing market and the government's need for funds are afflicting UK building societies Britain's building societies emitted a collective sigh of relief when the government unexpectedly cut the rate of interest on its newest National Savings product, the First Option Bond, on Monday. A general increase in mortgage rates, which looked all too likely after Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester raised its mortgage rate from 10 3/4 to 10.99 per cent late last week, has, on the face of it, been averted. Yet the rejoicing may be premature. In spite of this temporary accommodation, the broader logic of the government's present fiscal and monetary policies is pushing in an unhelpful direction for borrowers; and the structure of the housing market is subject to unprecedented strain. First, consider fiscal policy. As the chart implies, National Savings have been taking a rapidly growing share of the personal sector's nest egg, largely at the expense of the building societies. This reflects the Treasury's efforts to broaden its funding options in response to the dramatic deterioration in the public finances over the past three years. From a public sector debt repayment equivalent to 3 per cent of gross domestic product in 1988-89, the government has shifted to a borrowing requirement that is widely predicted to run at more than 5 per cent of GDP in the current year. On present policy UBS Phillips &amp; Drew predicts a public sector borrowing requirement of 8-9 per cent of GDP by 1996, reflecting the impact of recession on government spending and tax revenues. No matter that policy will have to adjust to pre-empt this untenable set of figures. In the absence of a remotely respectable economic recovery, and even allowing for a tough round of public spending cuts in the autumn, it is clear that the building societies and the Treasury will be on a collision course in the markets for the foreseeable future unless the government is prepared to raise taxes, which seems unlikely for the moment. A confrontation could always be avoided as long as the government refrained from raising short-term funds aggressively in the retail savings market. Building society deposits are still just about competitive against short-dated gilt-edged stock. But since National Savings have been promoted more aggressively, savers have been presented with an opportunity to increase their return by forsaking building society deposits for government IOUs. One of the longstanding certainties of the building society world was that retail deposits were stable. Yet the experience with First Option confirms that they become a great deal less stable if the government is offering an attractive alternative. Just as US retail savers have exploited a positive yield curve, in which bonds and equities offer a much higher income than short-term bank deposits, by removing their money from the banking system, British savers are demonstrating their sophistication, not for the first time, by abandoning the building societies. The stability of retail deposits increasingly hinges on price, which is another way of saying that they are not that stable; and in today's circumstances the building societies are obliged to dance to the Treasury's interest rate tune. The move to reduce the interest rate on First Option from 10.34 to 9.67 per cent on Monday will help curb the outflow from the societies' coffers for now. But the longer-term problem remains, not least because the initial interest rate on First Option was broadly in line with market rates. Nor will the current debate on overfunding the PSBR do anything to help the building societies' plight. City economists, including Mr Tim Congdon of Lombard Street Research and Mr Roger Bootle of Midland Montagu, are urging the government to abandon the so-called full funding rule, whereby the PSBR, together with maturing debt and any increase in the reserves, is fully funded by sales of debt outside the banking and building society sectors. The case for such a move is that it would expand broad money and stimulate the economy by leading to lower long-term interest rates and higher equity prices. At the same time it would help stabilise sterling and reduce long-run funding costs, if the government really believes in its own disinflationary policies, by shifting the debt burden from the long to the short end of the gilts market. The argument is compelling, which means trouble for the building societies because short-term rates, which matter most to them, would rise relative to long rates. For the moment politics have prevailed over economics. But a departure from the full funding principle in due course would lead to more upward pressure on mortgage rates in the absence of a monetary deus ex machina. None is in prospect. The Bundesbank, which raised its discount rate last week in response to continuing post-unification inflationary pressures in the German economy, is reluctant to contemplate a significant decline in German interest rates as long as the large fiscal deficit persists, which it threatens to do into the mid-1990s. All this gives rise to a more fundamental question. Do current mortgage rates adequately discount the risk in a housing market that has become much more volatile than in the past? A 10 3/4 per cent mortgage rate is around one and a half percentage points higher than the risk-free redemption yield on a medium-dated gilt-edged stock that matures in seven years - the life of the average mortgage. That looks a very slender margin in a business heavily biased towards a single market where prices in some parts of the country have fallen by 25 to 30 per cent. It looks doubly slender, bearing in mind that it takes a fall of no more than 5.6 per cent in the balance sheet value of the top 20 building societies' commercial assets to wipe out their reserves, known as 'tier one' capital. The widespread view is nonetheless that building societies are well capitalised on a risk-weighted basis, still profitable, and well capable of meeting the ratios demanded by the regulators. An analysis of the building societies' sensitivity to bad debts by Mr John Wriglesworth, of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, suggests that even on a worst-case assumption of a 20 per cent fall in house prices and a 200 per cent increase in bad debt provisions for 1992, the top 20 societies would have no difficulty complying with their capital adequacy requirements. But could the risk-weighting in the capital adequacy regime, which puts a weight of 0.5 on residential mortgages, compared with 0.1 for short gilts and 1.0 for other types of lending, reflect an outdated view of the housing market and of building society profitability? Arguably not, given that much of the credit risk in housing finance has leaked into the insurance sector via mortgage indemnity policies. Yet here lies the next big hurdle for the housing market and the societies. Over the past four years bad debt provisions of all the building societies, including Abbey National which has converted to banking status, have risen from Pounds 25m to Pounds 1.2bn. Because insurance companies were meeting around three-quarters of the societies' losses in the first three of those years, the societies enjoyed substantial protection. Yet Mr Simon Adamson of the bank rating agency, IBCA, has estimated that the building societies' share of the losses jumped to 44 per cent in 1991. In other words they were selling repossessed houses at well below the level of their insurance cover. The further prices fall - and they are down by more than 5 per cent so far this year - the more exposed the societies become. But the insurance companies have no reason to cheer, since indemnity claims in 1991 were running at nearly four times the level of insurance premiums. Not surprisingly, the insurance companies have concluded that providing cover for the top slice of a mortgage, typically 75 to 100 per cent of the purchase price, is a mug's game - especially if the insurance companies leave it to the building societies to assess the credit and sell the repossessed homes. They are now demanding tougher, and more or less uniform, terms from the building societies. Instead of leaving the insurers with the top slice of the property value, the new deal involves the two parties taking a fixed share of the loss. The insurers are also asking for a range of exclusions to cover, inter alia, fraud and, more worryingly for the societies, negligence. And they are demanding access to building society records before meeting their claims. Since most mortgage indemnity policies are renewed at the end of August, this time bomb carries a short fuse. For the building societies, the insurance companies' proposal would materially increase the risks that they bear. Already one small society, Lambeth, has said that it will be reducing the percentage of value that it is prepared to lend to home buyers. The impact on an already groggy housing market if others follow suit is potentially powerful, given that first-time buyers could be forced to save more over a lengthier period for a larger deposit on a home. Coming just after the government's temporary stamp duty exemption runs out, this will create despair in the estate agency fraternity. It will also worry the government, because of the implied change in savings behaviour. The sluggishness of consumer spending, and the related failure of the economic recovery to materialise, owes much to the inexorable rise in the household savings ratio. The last thing the government needs now is an outbreak of prudence on the part of first-time buyers. The Building Societies Association is doing its best to head off the threat, by hiring consulting actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow to examine alternatives to the insurance companies' proposition. According to Mr Adrian Coles of the association, the options they have been asked to examine include self-insurance and captive insurance. But whatever Bacon &amp; Woodrow suggests, it is hard to escape the conclusion that credit risk has increased and that lending terms to first-time buyers will in the end have to reflect that fact. The all too obvious way out of this fiscal and financial box is the inflationary route that Mr John Major, the prime minister, so firmly ruled out in his anti-devaluation speech on Monday. Yet the simultaneous move to relieve pressure on the building societies' deposit base carried an echo of the old inflationary days. Once again, borrowers were being favoured at the expense of savers. It looked suspiciously like a straw in the wind.</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Fact File 8 Name: Prudential Status: Proprietary Founded: 1848 Market position: Largest UK life company, biggest provider of personal pensions. Financial strength: Standard &amp; Poor's assessment is 'good' Funds under management: Pounds 73.5bn (at 31/12/93) Premium income 1993: Pounds 7.9bn worldwide, Pounds 4.1bn UK (broadly life and pensions) Number of personal pension plan clients: 870,000 Number of transfer plans sold: 80,000 Sales outlets: Over 97 per cent personal pensions sold through direct sales force, under 3 per cent through independent advisers. Commission paid: For advisers, up to industry average, eg approx 60 per cent of value of first years' premiums on long-term regular premium plan; less for salesforce. Nil commission terms available? Only through independent advisers. Expense ratio: (management expenses divided by total premium income) 38.66 per cent in 1992, 21.61 per cent in 1991, (industry average in 1991 was 19.3 per cent) Reduction in yield*: (equivalent annual percent charge over the life of the contract) Good on direct sales product - 0.7 per cent on 25-year regular premium unitised with profits plan (industry average 1.3 per cent). Penalties on early retirement or termination: Yes, based on outstanding charges for rest of contract (up to 25 years), levied at 5 per cent of first year's premiums on with-profits plan. Performance*: With-profits plan just below average for regular premium contract over five and 10 years, above average over longer terms and excellent for most single premium investment periods. Managed unit-linked fund just above average over five years but very poor over longer terms. Charges: At present life office illustrations of what your investment may produce use a standard basis for charges set by Lautro (the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation). To reveal the impact of real charges on the final fund of Prudential's unitised with-profits plan (sold by direct sales), we asked for illustrations using actual charges for a man age 45 who expects to retire at age 65 (ie, a 20-year contract), paying (a) Pounds 200 per month and (b) a stand alone single premium of Pounds 10,000. Illustrations using Lautro standard charges, which in fact are lower than those used by most life offices, are shown in brackets. The last illustration gives a theoretical value if no charges were deducted.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                        Full commission paid  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                        6% growth        12% growth Monthly premium Pounds 200         Pounds 78,300    Pounds 152,000                                   (Pounds 80,900)  (Pounds 158,000) Single premium Pounds 10,000                      Pounds 26,800     Pounds 81,900                                   (Pounds 28,200)   (Pounds 85,200)  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Nil-commission: Not disclosed because not available through direct sales force, the main outlet for personal pensions.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                               Theoretical no charges  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Monthly premium Pounds 200                         Pounds 91,129    Pounds 183,971 Single premium Pounds 10,000                      Pounds 32,071     Pounds 96,463  -------------------------------------------------------------------- *Source: FT Personal Pensions 1994 handbook, Pensions Management and Money Management</p>

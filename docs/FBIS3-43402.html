			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Machado da Graca on the "Dotting the i's" </F> program]    [Text] The accusations made by Afonso Dhlakama, Mozambique  National Resistance [Renamo] leader, against Mozambican Army  General Domingos Fondo has created a new situation in our  country's political scenario. The Mozambican media have long  reported that the public feels some figures are involved in  dealings which range from somewhat shady to very dark. No one  has, however, been able to piece together enough evidence to  point out specific names and place the dots on the i's.    In his news conference in Maringue, Renamo leader Afonso  Dhlakama took a step forward and indicated one name, that of  Domingos Fondo, whom he accused of being involved in smuggling  arms to South Africa. The Renamo leader went even further and  said that President Joaquim Chissano was aware of it. Nothing  can stay quite the same in the face of this new situation.  Beginning with the attorney general, our legal structures  simply cannot stand and wait for some unidentified person to  come up with evidence. At this stage, the matter rests between  two citizens: Afonso Dhlakama, who has made an accusation in  public and who must be in possession of the relevant evidence,  and Domingos Fondo, who has been publicly accused and who must  respond to Dhlakama's evidence with other evidence and witnesses  to prove his innocence. That is what one calls a legal state.    The normal thing to do under such circumstances is for Gen.  Domingos Fondo to institute legal proceedings against Renamo  leader Afonso Dhlakama for defamation and offensive remarks that  could jeopardize his reputation. In turn, the court must  establish who is in the right and penalize whoever is in the  wrong. Things could follow a different path, though: Were the  accusation only about purely individual interests, the matter  could be laid to rest. It would be enough for Gen. Fondo to  ignore those accusations. That accusation, however, involves a  very serious crime and the simple fact that such an accusation  has been made in public should force the Attorney General's  Office to open an inquiry to investigate the truth of the  charges. There is no escaping that responsibility.    What is more, we all hope that the Attorney General's Office  will not tell us yet again that it does not have the material  means for conducting the investigation.</p>

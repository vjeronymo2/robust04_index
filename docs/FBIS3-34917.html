			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An informed political source has revealed that a  large U.S. delegation of military and political officials  arrived recently at the U.S. Embassy in 'Awkar.    The U.S. delegation's visit at this time has particular  political connotations because it coincides with the resumption  of the talks between Lebanon and "Israel." And there have been  reports of repeated U.S. attempts to breach the Lebanese and  Syrian positions and encourage Lebanon to join the multilateral  talks.    Other reports have stated that a U.S. delegation visited the  "occupied zone" a few days ago. This is a signal that the  current bilateral talks in Washington have begun to discuss the  details after drawing up the outlines of the agreement between  Lebanon and "Israel."    The same source said U.S. Ambassador Mark Hambley, who  formed  a new political and media team when he assumed his duties in  Beirut, personally asked for the large U.S. delegation to come  to Beirut and stay at the U.S. Embassy for a few days far from  the limelight to help prepare the U.S. Embassy's plan of action  and give "advice" to Lebanese officials on how to deal with  anticipated developments.    The political source has monitored [rasada] U.S. Ambassador  Mark Hambley recently intensifying his contacts and meetings  with the Lebanese officials within the framework of following up  the bilateral talks in Washington.    According to the same political source, this month or next  at  most will witness the "ceremony" of the signing of the  declaration of principles between Lebanon and "Israel." The  large U.S. delegation has carried this information from the U.S.  Administration in Washington.    The political source noted that a U.S. military helicopter  has recently been making frequent trips between the U.S. Embassy  in 'Awkar and Cyprus carrying U.S. military and political  officials each time.</p>

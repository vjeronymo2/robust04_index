			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Meat-eaters chew over changes in vegetarian menu - A buy-out team hopes the Cranks chain has produced its last small brown rock EVERYONE LOVES a bargain and at the moment receivers across the land have plenty. Does Cranks, the vegetarian restaurant chain recently purchased by a management buy-out, come into that category? The MBO, put together by Piper Trust, the retail consultancy, has bought eight restaurant/takeaway outlets and the Cranks name - a brand that some would say had passed its sell-by date, even though the healthy eating market is growing. In many minds Cranks will forever be tarred with a hippy brush or stuck with an image of sandaled, CND-campaigning liberals, proselytising about the virtues of bowls of bran and the evils of meat-eating. Mr Ian Cheshire and Mr Christopher Curry, the non-vegetarian forces behind the buy-out, hope to nail those prejudices, saying that vegetarians now come from all walks of life and that at some time or other everyone chooses non-meat, unprocessed dishes. While anxious to preserve the 'integrity' of Cranks, they are keen to move away from 'the small, brown rock school of wholefood cooking' - stodgy grains and wheat - to lighter meals using more vegetables. Overall, they are keen to tap into the consumer's general trend of eating out more, but going for quality. Initially, the main changes will be in the menu. For example the dough will be reformulated so that instead of being available only in bap form, it can be baked in loaves, and can therefore be sliced. Piper has been sworn to silence by Stoy Hayward, the receiver, not to reveal the financial size of the package it put together for Cranks. However, Mr Curry, who runs Piper Retail Fund, the venture side of the MBO, did admit that it was 'quite a lot less' than the Pounds 1.5m Piper bid in 1988 when Guinness, the then owner, sold it to Bewley's Cafes and Badger Hale, the Irish catering chain and property developer. 'We're much happier to have bought it now than then,' he says. Stoy could have got more for the business, he adds, but receivers are obliged to dispose of loss-makers as quickly as possible. In fact, there were other contenders, one of which placed a higher bid, though with 'theoretical' money. Thanks to its previous bid and to its close knowledge of the business, Piper already had its package sewn up and pipped the others. The close knowledge comes from Mr Curry and Mr Cheshire, his partner from Piper Trust. While Mr Curry learned about Cranks when preparing the 1988 bid, Mr Cheshire's familiarity is more direct, stemming from his time at Guinness, when Cranks was part of the drinks group's portfolio before it reverted to its core businesses in the wake of the Distillers episode. A child of its time and endorsed in the late 1960s by The Beatles and other Swinging London luminaries, the health food company rode the crest of its trendiness in the 1970s, but began to fall out of fashion in the 1980s. Financially it was hit by the now familiar litany of 1980s scourges - too much debt, over-rapid expansion, demand reduced by recession and spiralling rent and rates. In its most recent year, Cranks' pre-tax losses were Pounds 1.4m on sales of about Pounds 4.5m. The restaurants broke even but the company was tipped into receivership, on February 19, by interest costs and losses on the wholesale side - which serviced such companies as P&amp;O, Safeway, Forte (its Welcome Break motorway service stations), and Loseley. You can cherry pick when buying from the receiver and so the factory in Islington, London, which supplied food to all the outlets was not bought, though Mr Curry and Mr Cheshire are keen to continue and expand the wholesale side. They point to a 1991 survey which revealed that 12 per cent of the UK population knew the Cranks name for its healthy eating reputation; in the south-east the figure jumped to 25 per cent. The duo will be forming a joint venture with a third party to license or sub-contract out the food making process and harbour longer-term ambitions to roll out frozen branded food products - 'like Bird's Eye's vegetable meals', says Mr Cheshire - across the grocery multiples. In the first year the emphasis will be on gaining wide distribution for a small range; thereafter the variety of dishes will be expanded. Another big change will be in the way Cranks is managed. Mr Cheshire stresses that there will be a 'change of style - it won't be run from the top down'. The Piper Retail venture capital fund, backed by Standard Life and Royal Life, has a stake of a little over 50 per cent and the balance is split equally between Piper Trust and the middle managers, who previously worked under Cranks' various owners. These managers will be the operational team and, apart from the incentive of growing the company to increase the value of their investment, they also have the opportunity, in a complex arrangement dependent on profits, to raise their stake from the low 20s to 30 per cent over the next five years. The whole project is 'mostly equity financed with just a bit of debt'. Mr Curry says that only half of Piper's package of 'substantially less than Pounds 3m' went to acquire Cranks: the other half is to move the unwanted kitchens in the restaurants, for development and expansion of the business. Franchised restaurants outside the south-east - Mr Cheshire and Mr Curry envisage expanding the chain - will be satellites to a Cranks-owned outlet. Food would be supplied at cost to each franchise and Cranks would take 5 per cent of sales. As Body Shop prefers, Cranks' name would be on the lease, not the franchisee's. Other changes will be evolutionary. The woven basket lampshades - a particular hate of Mr Cheshire - will go, but the pine-dominated decor will only be changed when the money becomes available.</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Takagi Securities closes London affiliate TAKAGI Securities, a third-tier Japanese broker, has announced the closure of its London-based affiliate. The move comes as the slump of the Tokyo stock market is forcing second and third-tier brokerages to review operations and cut costs. Medium-sized brokers expanded overseas and domestic operations in the stock market boom of the late 1980s and made extensive investments in capital investments. Many medium-sized brokers, which depend heavily on revenues from trading commissions, are now facing a severe decline in income and profits because of the low trading volumes in the stock market. According to the Tokyo Stock Exchange, average daily volume for February fell to 196m shares, the lowest figure since June 1982, when activity fell to 172m shares. Second and third-tier securities houses will also be hard-hit by the financial deregulation expected to be implemented as early as next year, when the rules separating banks and brokerages will be eased. Mergers and acquisitions among the smaller brokers are expected to increase due to the rise of competition in the securities industry. Tokai Bank, a leading Japanese commercial bank, is to send officials to help reconstruct Central Finance, its consumer credit affiliate. Japan's non-bank financial institutions face problems due to the surge in bad debts caused by the slump in the property and stock markets. Central Finance was involved in last year's bank loan scandals. It had made loans up to Y30bn to an Osaka restaurateur on fake deposit certificates by an Osaka-based credit association used as collateral. Tokai said it would send seven officials and lend Y110bn to the company. Central Finance will set up a separate subsidiary in an effort to recover up to Y100bn of loans.</p>

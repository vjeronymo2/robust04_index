			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / The Property Market: Treading troubled waters - John Redwood outlines government policy on regenerating Britain's inner cities Mr John Redwood, the UK inner cities minister, would make an unlikely estate agent. But he is talking up the property market with an enthusiasm that would put many agents in the shade. 'Since I entered business in the early 1970s I have never seen better conditions for investing money in land and buildings,' he said in a speech to the building industry yesterday. These sentiments echo a House of Commons speech the minister made a month ago when he said that the private sector needed 'more courage and confidence and a willingness to respond to the new climate'. The commercial property industry has responded wearily to these exhortations. Its reaction was summed up in the Estates Times, a property magazine, with the headline: 'Tosh, Mr Redwood.' It accused the minister of navety in underestimating the problems facing recession-hit banks and property companies. Some critics go further, arguing that the government is harming any chances of renewed development by its failure to act over the uncertainty surrounding commercial lease structures and contaminated land legislation, and by delays in agreeing infrastructure projects. Mr Redwood is undaunted by the derision that greeted his comments. He, in turn, is scathing about the advice given by industry experts in recent years. Industry criticism of his Commons speech has reinforced Mr Redwood's viewpoint. He turns the argument that there is a shortage of finance for property investment on its head: the tightness of credit, which is now easing, is precisely the reason why he thinks the bottom of the cycle has been reached. Mr Redwood is on less secure ground in his belief that when the pick-up occurs, investors will focus on new developments in the inner cities. After the huge losses of the past few years, there is little enthusiasm among developers and banks for such ventures. Mr Redwood thinks sceptics are commiting the 'metropolitan fallacy' of assuming that the problems of the London office market are replicated round the country. 'Those in the north, on Tyneside, Teesside or in Manchester have a less jaundiced perspective as regeneration has received less of a jolt from the recession,' he said. He acknowledged that London is a special problem. But he is still convinced that recovery will extend to even the blighted parts of Docklands. Canary Wharf will be 'a flourishing and successful development' in 5-10 years, he said. What about the Royal Docks, a vast area to the east of the Isle of Dogs which has spent heavily on infrastructure without, so far, having attracted any private sector development? Even Mr Redwood recognises that the oversupply of offices elsewhere in Docklands makes large-scale office development at the Royal Docks unviable. But he is anxious to see action. 'I am impatient about the Royal Docks,' he said. Mr Redwood has already given approval to an urban village housing scheme on the south side of the docks. And he believes there is scope for leisure and retail uses; he said he would even contemplate approving plans for warehouses. Mr Redwood has given the London Docklands Development Corporation, the quango overseeing the regeneration of the area, until the summer to come up with plans to develop the Royal Docks. If the LDDC fails, Mr Redwood said he would hold a competition in the hope that the private sector will come up with a viable idea. But even if the private sector is brought on board again, doubts remain about the broad thrust of government policy on reviving inner cities through physical regeneration. Mr Christopher Jonas, president of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, recently described government investment in inner city regeneration as 'little more than a complete failure'. He added: 'Despite some notable successes, cities such as Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield and Bradford have a startling array of failures which collectively represent hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money, which could, perhaps, have been more usefully directed elsewhere.' Government strategy is also criticised as being too preoccupied with physical regeneration and insufficiently concerned with its impact on local communities. A report published this week by the University of Durham said that government-created urban development corporations (UBC)  - which are empowered to clean up land, assemble development sites and provide grants to kick-start development  - were expensive, concentrated excessively on physical regeneration and had little positive impact on inner city communities, such as in job creation. Mr Redwood rejects criticism of the UDCs, insisting that their record was one of 'considerable achievement'. UDCs remain a central aspect of the government's strategy for urban renewal. Mr Redwood recently announced the setting up of a new UDC for Plymouth, while the new Urban Regeneration Agency  - responsible for regenerating broader urban areas and described by Mr Redwood as a 'roving UDC'  - comes into force later this year. In some respects government policy towards UDCs has evolved. While the policy of attracting private sector funds to augment public investment remains fixed, there has been a shift in the government's attitude to the role of local councils. The combative exchanges between local authorities and UDCs in the early 1980s has given way to a more harmonious relationship. 'It is more possible now for UDCs and local government to work together,' he said. Mr Redwood is also proud of the City Challenge programme, a partnership between councils, the private sector and voluntary bodies to give local communities a greater involvement in urban regeneration. A decision on the next round of City Challenge has been postponed because of a lack of money, but Mr Redwood remains enthusiastic about its future. 'As soon as I get additional money it will go into City Challenge. I like the concept.' The most recent shift in government policy on inner cities came in the Autumn Statement, when the Treasury was given powers to relax rules on private-sector investment in public projects. This blurring of the edges between public and private finance could allow the government to shoulder some of the risk involved in development. 'To get it (development) going we should be prepared to take on some of the risk,' Mr Redwood said. The mechanism by which the government would shoulder the risk would, in commercial property, be by granting developers rental guarantees for up to three years; in private sector housing, it would be by taking a share of profits in return for providing land. But these measures aside, Mr Redwood's claims that the risks of development are being exaggerated by the private sector are unlikely to spur developers. Confidence is at such a low ebb that his exhortations will continue to fall on deaf ears for some time yet.</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERCEPTIONS OF COLOR  </P> <P> We tell ourselves about the problem, examples are given and we show the  results. But no one seems to proffer a solution or even a suggestion of one.  Are we hopelessly and inexorably bound toward a nation divided by race? If that  is the only answer then what was experienced 25 years ago will be nothing  compared to the violence ahead.  </P> <P> The question of race will never be totally eradicated. That's a constant.  However, we can ill afford to ignore the alternatives. We must instruct our  children and we must not quit in our effort to solve this dilemma.  </P> <P> RODNEY K. BOSWELL, Los Angeles  </P></p>

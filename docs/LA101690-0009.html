			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAUGHTER, GRANDSON HELD IN SLAYING OF WOMAN, 78  </P> <P> A La Canada Flintridge woman found dead Sunday night was shot and killed by her  daughter and 11-year-old grandson as she sought help by telephone after being  stabbed, authorities alleged Monday.  </P> <P> Family members said the slaying culminated more than two decades of mental  instability by the daughter, who they said was diagnosed as a paranoid  schizophrenic.  </P> <P> Roma Jaul Jacobs, 78, dialed 911 around 6:50 p.m. from her home in the  upper-middle-class community and told Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies  that she had been stabbed. Officers taking the frantic call reported hearing  gunshots in the background.  </P> <P> By the time deputies arrived a few minutes later and forced their way into the  ranch-style home in the 600 block of Durwood Drive, Jacobs was dead,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Deputies discovered a woman dressed in combat fatigues and a boy clad in girl's  clothing in the back yard. Deputies said they also found three firearms on the  suspects and in nearby bushes.  </P> <P> Authorities said the pair turned out to be the victim's daughter, Victoria  Elizabeth Jacobs Madeira, 43, of Anaheim, and the victim's 11-year-old  grandson, whose name was not released. Both were booked on suspicion of murder.  The mother and son offered no resistance to arrest, deputies said.  </P> <P> "They were just standing there," said Sheriff's Lt. Robert Flores. "But they  refused to talk, wouldn't say anything."  </P> <P> Jacobs' family said Madeira has aimed her aggression at the family for the last  22 years, despite their efforts to help her. They said she has been  institutionalized at times.  </P> <P> "What happened here was a tragedy, a tragedy of this family and a tragedy of  the failure of the mental health system," Brian Jacobs, the victim's son and  Madeira's brother, said in a brief interview at the crime scene.  </P> <P> Jacobs and other family members declined to discuss details of Madeira's  history, but he testified Monday in Los Angeles before a state Senate panel on  mental health and plans to appear in Sacramento today on the same subject to  express his concerns about the system used to treat the mentally disabled.  </P> <P> Neighbors, warned to stay inside Sunday night as deputies moved into the Jacobs  house, watched from their homes as Madeira, handcuffed, was led quietly to a  squad car. But her son slammed his head against the side of the vehicle and  began screaming when his mother was taken away, witnesses said.  </P> <P> Jacobs, a homemaker who neighbors said had lived in the house for 35 years, had  been stabbed and shot several times, deputies said.  </P> <P> "It was apparent that she had been bleeding before she made the (911) call  because the blood came from the kitchen door all the way to the phone," Flores  said. "There was a lot of blood, and a lot of expended (bullet) rounds."  </P> <P> "We have no motive yet," said Deputy Larry Mead. "That's what we'd like to find  out."  </P> <P> Samantha Kalmer, 15, who lives a few doors from the Jacobs home, said that  about 6 p.m. she and a friend noticed a large woman in military fatigues and a  large boy or man with closely cropped hair who appeared to be wearing gold  earrings, women's makeup, a colorful blouse and silk pants.  </P> <P> "I thought he was a girl," Kalmer said. "It looked very, very weird."  </P> <P> Other neighbors recalled the boy wearing a dress and an orange wig. Police  would say only that he had on "female clothing."  </P> <P> Brian Jacobs' fiancee, Carla McLelland, said of the boy's attire: "That's just  Betty and another one of the symptoms of her schizophrenia."  </P> <P> Laura Gatkowski, who lives next door, was watching TV and said she did not  believe it when guests in her home said they thought they heard shots.  </P> <P> "I heard the 'bang, bang, bang,' " she said, "but I didn't know they were  gunshots. I'd never heard gunshots before. I just couldn't believe it. It's  scary to even think about."  </P> <P> Robert Wolff, who lives next door to Jacobs and said his children visited the  victim frequently.  </P> <P> "She was such a sweet, wonderful person. This is the sort of person anyone  would like for a grandmother," Wolff said. "How do you explain to a 4-year-old  now that someone was murdered?"  </P> <P> Times staff writer Tammerlin Drummond in Orange County contributed to this  article.  </P></p>

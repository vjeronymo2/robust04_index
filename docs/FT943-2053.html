			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Tesco cautious on margins but lifted by sales A recovery in margins and faster sales growth helped Tesco, the UK's second-largest food retailer, to increase interim pre-tax profits 8 per cent to Pounds 250.2m, from a restated Pounds 231.4m, but the company remained cautious on the outlook for margins. Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman, said Tesco's gross profit margin, which fell 0.7 percentage points in the previous half-year amid intense price competition, had recovered to 0.1 points below the first half in last year. The increase was due to better terms from suppliers and shifts in products, including the introduction of higher-margin clothing and leisure goods. But Sir Ian warned that price competition would remain fierce in the second half, and Tesco did not expect much improvement in gross margin compared with last year. His caution led to a 3p fall in Tesco's shares to 248p. 'The competition has not taken its foot off the accelerator, and it is not going to be taken off,' Sir Ian said. He reiterated his view that last year's margin decline was a 'step change', not the 'downward spiral' City analysts feared. But Tesco would respond firmly to any competitive price moves. UK sales increased 11.8 per cent to Pounds 4.47bn, of which 7.8 percentage points came from 12 store openings. Existing stores contributed 4 percentage points, made up of 1.5 per cent inflation, and a 2.5 per cent volume increase. Sir Ian said sales benefited from lower prices on basic goods - countering the threat from fast-expanding discount grocers - and from Tesco's wider range, new store design, and improved service. UK operating profits rose 9.7 per cent to Pounds 249m, representing a fall in operating margins from 6.1 to 6 per cent. Group sales increased 17.3 per cent to Pounds 4.69bn, including a first-time Pounds 219.4m contribution from Catteau, the French supermarket chain acquired last year. Nine new store openings contributed to Catteau's operating profit of Pounds 8.1m, but like-for-like sales were down. Tesco gained control of its latest Pounds 250m acquisition, Scottish grocery chain Wm Low, on September 2. Sir Ian said acceptances had been received from 95 per cent of shareholders, about 70 per cent opting for the share alternative rather than the 360p-per-share cash offer. This meant the acquisition would dilute earnings 'slightly' this year - rather than have the 'neutral' impact previously expected - but would enhance earnings next year. The interim dividend was lifted from 2.45p to 2.7p, although earnings per share increased only 0.4 per cent from 8.43p to 8.46p owing to an increased tax charge. Lex, Page 22</p>

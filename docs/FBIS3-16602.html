On commenting his earlier visit to Israel, Meri recalled as  most remarkable language-teaching to immigrants. It was  interesting to see how in only six months a person virtually  melts into the society, Meri said. Meri also said that after  meetings with the president, prime minister, foreign minister  and representatives of the Israeli parliament, he knows that  Israel understands the tasks that lie ahead of Estonia.    On commenting on Ukraine, Meri said he thought the west  often  made a mistake in talking of the Baltic countries and former  regions of the defunct Soviet Union. Ukraine is one of the  biggest European countries, Meri said. We could see ourselves  that gigantic economic reforms lie ahead of Ukraine and that the  country intends to build a strong independent state which would  be open to all countries of the world, he added.</p>

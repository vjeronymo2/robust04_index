			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by Foreign Ministry; date not given]- </F>   [Text] Following the signing of the agreement on self-rule  between the Palestinians and the Israelis, the Foreign Ministry  has issued the following statement:    Tunisia has noted with satisfaction today's signing between  the PLO chairman and the Israeli prime minister on the agreement  to implement the Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho,  which should initiate the implementation of the Declaration of  Principles signed in Washington on 13 September 1993, bolster  the peace process in the Middle East, and which is an important  step toward a just and comprehensive solution in order to  guarantee the legitimate rights of the struggling fraternal  Palestinian people and its right to lead a dignified life in a  sovereign state.    Tunisia, which has always been tireless in maintaining and  consolidating the independence of the Palestinian  decision-makers, supporting the Palestinian people's just cause,  and following up the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, is hoping  that the new agreement will give fresh momentum to continue the  peace process at all costs in order to bring about the total  Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories and peace  in the region in accordance with the UN resolution and  international legality.</p>

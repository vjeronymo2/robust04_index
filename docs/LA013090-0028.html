			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 1992 CANDIDATES  </P> <P> This is my guaranteed prediction for the next presidential campaign.  </P> <P> Gov. Deukmejian is leaving office.  </P> <P> Ethnic is in and very chic right now. Coupled with that is the good chance that  we will be in heavy inflation and a large recession with this Administration.  </P> <P> As the Democrats will most likely put up Gov. Cuomo (his parents came over from  the old country), the Republicans will be forced to put up Gov. Deukmejian  (whose parents came over from the old county). Cuomo is pro-choice and  Deukmejian is anti-abortion. That subject for the plank has nothing to do with  politics or religion or ethnic background.  </P> <P> It should prove to be a right nasty battle.  </P> <P> DICK PETTIT  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

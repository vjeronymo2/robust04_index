			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: More franchises for BR sell-off THE government yesterday signalled its determination to proceed with the privatisation of British Rail by setting out its detailed plans for transferring the whole of the passenger network to the private sector. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, announced that BR's passenger services would be divided into 25 geographically based business units which would ultimately be taken over by private sector franchisees. Mr MacGregor predicted that the first franchises would be handed over to the private sector in the second half of next year and that a 'substantial proportion' of passenger services would be in private hands within the lifetime of the current parliament. However, he said it was impossible to predict how long the process would take to complete. Mr MacGregor said he placed particular importance on the fact that franchising would be an 'evolutionary' process. 'There won't be sudden dramatic difficulties in terms of big closures or anything like that,' he said. 'As people see their services improving, as people start to see the individual franchises working, they will start to see the whole point of it.' The 25 franchise areas - which include seven announced in February - will be operated by BR as 'shadow' franchises until they pass to the private sector. The aim is that they build up a trading record that will be known when the bidding begins. Mr MacGregor said the precise boundaries of the franchise areas could change if that helped the pro-cess. The Department of Transport has also yet to settle on a final scheme for franchising Regional Railways' sprawling central division, the Regional Railways long-distance services and InterCity's cross-country operations. Mr MacGregor confirmed that overseas railways such as SNCF, the French national railway, would not be precluded from bidding, but said the franchising director would be looking for bidders with a commercial orientation.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE 18 SECTORS ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- InterCity West Coast Main Line - London to Birmingham, Manchester,   Liverpool, Glasgow and Inverness.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- InterCity Midland Mine Line - London to Nottingham, Derby and Sheffield.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- InterCity Anglia - London to Norwich.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- InterCity Cross Country - Scotland to south-west England and the south   coast.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Thames Line - London Paddington to Reading, Oxford and   Stratford-upon-Avon.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Chiltern Line - London Marylebone to Aylesbury.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Northampton and North London Lines.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- West Anglia and Great Northern - London King's Cross to Peterborough and   London Liverpool Street to Cambridge.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Great Eastern - London to Ipswich, Harwich and Southend Victoria.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Thameslink - from Bedford to Surrey and Sussex through central London.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Kent Services - between London and the Kent coast.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South London and Sussex Coast  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- North East Region - regional services in the Sheffield, Leeds and   Newcastle upon Tyne areas.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- North West Region - regional services in the Liverpool and Manchester   areas.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Merseyrail Electric Services  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Central Region - the east and west Midlands.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Wales and West Region - regional and branch line services in rural   south-west England and south Wales.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cardiff Valley  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: BR sale to stress quality of service TRANSPORT ministers will next week try to present the privatisation of British Rail as an opportunity to improve service quality before the next general election, Ralph Atkins writes. The long-awaited white paper on BR's privatisation will stress the possible benefits in terms of increased flexibility in services, improved customer service and lower fares. The department regards the sell-off as unique in that there will be less emphasis on the amount it will raise for the Treasury. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, is expected to argue that the continuing high level of public subsidy for the railways means the government will continue to have a say over the level of services.</p>

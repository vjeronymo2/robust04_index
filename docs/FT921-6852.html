			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / FT Law Report: Ship is entered at Bombay THE ANTCLIZO (NO 2) Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Parker, Lord Justice Stocker and Sir John Megaw): February 18 1992 A CHARTERED vessel which has completed the prior entry procedure at an Indian port and has been granted free pratique, is 'entered' at Customs House and can validly give notice of readiness to discharge, though the inwards entry register is not yet complete. The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by the Food Corporation of India, charterers of the Antclizo, from Mr Justice Hirst's decision (FT, May 17 1991) upholding an arbitration award in favour of the shipowners, Antclizo Shipping Corporation. A cross appeal by the owners was dismissed. LORD JUSTICE PARKER said that under the terms of a charterparty Antclizo carried a cargo of wheat from the US to India. Discharge was completed at Bombay on February 10 1974. Disputes arose between the parties as to despatch, demurrage and balance of freight. Arbitrators were appointed in 1975. Arbitration took place in 1990. The arbitrator held that notice of readiness given at Bombay was valid; and that there was no cause of action for balance of freight until the date of his award. Mr Justice Hirst upheld his conclusions. Clause 34 of the charterparty provided that at port of discharge time was to count from 24 hours after notice of readiness, 'vessel also having been entered at Customs House and in free pratique'. By section 30(1) of the Indian Customs Act 1962 the master had to deliver an import manifest to the proper officer within 24 hours after arrival at a customs station, or 'before the arrival of the vessel'. By section 31(1) he was not to permit unloading until an entry inwards order had been granted by the proper officer. By section 31(2), no entry inwards order would be given until the import manifest had been delivered. According to the Indian Excise and Customs procedural manual, the procedure at Bombay for entry of vessels and goods had three stages. The first stage, known as 'prior entry' was that prior to arrival the ship's agents would lodge an import general manifest, and an entry inwards application, at Customs House. The customs clerk would give the vessel a serial rotation number and enter it in the inward entry register. He would exhibit the vessel's name and serial number on the Customs notice board, with the reference P/E, which indicated that prior entry procedure had been completed. He would provide the agents with a certificate that various formalities had been completed, and that after submission of the store list and crew property list, the preventive officer might grant entry inwards. The second stage arose when the vessel had reached inner anchorage or was in berth, and was ready to discharge. If a Customs preventive officer was available he would examine the crew's property and seal the vessel's bonded property store. Unless his suspicions were aroused he would endorse the certificate 'inwards entry is granted to this vessel'. Discharge might then lawfully begin. At stage three the certificate was taken to the import department at Customs House. If documents were in order the clerk would fill in the blank columns in the inward entry register. Regulation 15 of the Customs manual provided that at that stage 'on receipt of the certificate in the import department the manifest is admitted finally'. If a boarding officer was not available when a vessel was ready to discharge at inner anchorage and Customs had given permission to break bulk in mid-stream, discharging started at once. On December 29 1973 the owners' agents completed the prior entry procedure and obtained Customs permission to discharge at inner anchorage, ie to break bulk in stream. On December 30 the vessel anchored at the floating light. She was then an arrived ship. On December 31 she received free pratique by radio, and gave notice of readiness. She anchored at inner anchorage at 2030 hours. On January 1, the agents lodged the required documents with Customs at 1630 and the register was then completed. Some time between 2030 on December 31 and 1630 on January 1, Customs granted inwards entry. The question was whether the vessel was 'entered at the Customs House' within the meaning of clause 34 of the charterparty, on completion of prior entry. Mr Hamilton for the charterers argued that since prior entry did not carry with it an order permitting inwards entry, only final entry would satisfy clause 34. That argument had obvious difficulties. First, if notice of readiness could not be given until final entry and that did not take place until after inwards entry had been granted and discharge commenced, it was unlikely that clause 34 was intended to produce the result contended for. To provide for a 24 hours' notice of readiness to be given after discharge had already begun, made no sense at all. Second, the vessel was physically entered at Customs House when prior entry was completed. Third, prior entry was important for importers, who would know they could proceed and arrange for discharge. There was no binding authority to compel the court to reach a different conclusion from that of Mr Justice Hirst and the arbitrator. Accordingly the vessel was entered at Customs House at the time notice of readiness was given. The next question was whether the vessel was ready to discharge when notice of readiness was given. The charterers contended she was not ready to discharge until granted inwards entry. The arbitrator's case stated that there was no reason why immediately the ship reached inner anchorage and obtained customs approval of documents she should not have been allowed to discharge in stream at once; and there was no reason why she should not have received such approval at once. In The Delian Spirit (1972) 1 QB 103, in which the absence of free pratique did not prevent the vessel being ready to load, Mr Justice Donaldson said a vessel was ready to load 'if she is in such a state of physical readiness that there is nothing to prevent her being made ready at once if required'. In the present case as the vessel had already been given permission to discharge at inner anchorage, she could have been required to discharge and there would have been no material delay. Either the preventive officer would have been present and granted inwards entry, or if he was not, discharge would have commenced. There was a possibility that if a preventive officer became suspicious there would have been a delay; or that some accident would occur which would result in delay. Those possibilities could not affect the validity of notice of readiness. If they did, no notice of readiness could ever be given. The case was covered by The Delian Spirit. Notice of readiness was therefore valid. The charterers' appeal failed. The owners cross-appealed against the decision that there was no cause of action for balance of freight until date of award. Clause 29 of the charterparty provided for 90 per cent freight to be paid within seven days of signing bills of lading and 'the balance freight will be paid after completion of discharge and settlement of demurrage/despatch'. The owners said the arbitrator had awarded interest on demurrage less despatch as from December 1 1974, and that the cause of action had accrued by that date. On the face of the clause the primary obligation to pay did not arise until net demurrage/despatch due had been agreed or determined. The owners accepted they could not succeed except on the McKay v Dick principle ((1881) 6 AppCas 251). For the principle to apply it had to be shown that the charterers' 'wrong' prevented settlement. What prevented settlement was the charterers' contention that they were owed despatch. To advance a contention ultimately proved wrong was not a 'wrong'. The cross-appeal also was dismissed. Their Lordships agreed. For the charterers: Adrian Hamilton QC and Geraldine Andrews (Gagrat Gardi &amp; Co) For the shipowners: Anthony Clarke QC and Charles Haddon-Cave (Herbert Smith)</p>

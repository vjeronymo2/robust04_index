			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Abta barred from limiting compensation SIX TRAVEL companies were yesterday granted a high court injunction preventing the Association of British Travel Agents from limiting compensation to customers of failed school trip operators. The decision followed a two-day hearing last month during which Abta said the failures of school ski trip operators threatened the association's financial stability. Last April, the association wrote to schools and education authorities saying that if failed companies' bonds proved inadequate, Abta would only refund deposits up to Pounds 25. Deposits paid more than a year in advance would not be refunded. The balance of payment would only be refunded if paid less than 10 weeks before departure. The six companies - Campus Centres, Equity, Ski Partners, Seasun Holidays, Travelbound and STS Travel - asked the court to prevent Abta from limiting compensation until a full hearing could take place. The attempt to limit compensation is a departure from Abta's policy over the last two decades of ensuring that none of its members' customers suffered any loss. Abta told the court that school operator failures in 1991 had brought the organisation close to insolvency. In the current year, school operator failures had resulted in claims of Pounds 4.2m, of which the companies' bonds covered only Pounds 1.8m. The remainder had to be met from the association's own insurance. School operators represented 85 per cent of claims on the association's insurance. Most of the holidaymakers who lost their money in the collapse of SFV Holidays last month were Dutch, according to Kingsland Holidays of Plymouth, which bought SFV's client list. Mr Simon Law, a Kingsland director, said 130 Dutch and 40 British clients stood to lose their holidays. A further 650 customers would be able to get refunds as they booked by credit card. As each booking is for several people, the number thought to have lost their money is 600. SFV was unbonded and was not a member of any travel association.</p>

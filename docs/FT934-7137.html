			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Arts: Tuned in to jazz WHAT pocketsize selection of discs from 1993 would I recommend to represent favourite moods evoked during the 12 months? Assume it is an overcoat which can accommodate a dozen and start with Jan Garbarek's Twelve Moons (ECM 519 500-2). This is the best of the Norwegian saxophonist's bands, the regular electro-bass and twinkling synth augmented by Marilyn Mazur's agitato percussion and the icily serene blasts of traditional singing. The music is alternately earnest and thrilling, always magnificent, but requiring the listener to keep the collar turned up for warmth. There ought to be a Norwegian proverb to describe Garbarek's music along the lines of 'cold notes, warm heart'. As a means of thawing out, choose Don Pullen's African-Brazilian Connection and Ode To Life (Blue Note 0777 7 8923329). In this tribute to longtime partner George Adams, the pianist's attacking runs are made into the cushioning sounds and syncopation of Senegal and Sao Paulo. Intelligent and at the same time devil-may-care in his percussive construction, the Pullen mixture of piquancy and poignancy is richly concentrated here. Randy Weston leads a big band which includes new boy Wallace Roney and Talib Kibwe opposite old hands Hamiett Blueitt and Teddy Edwards in Volcano Blues (Verve 519 269-2), a similarly spicy concoction. One of the first exponents of so-called world music, the gangling pianist's precipitous style is harnessed by arranger Melba Liston for some openly creaking, blue washed charts of big hearted pleasure. But if the loose-boned relaxation of Pullen and Weston proves too much of a good thing then guitarist Joe Pass has produced a typically taut mainstream delight in My Song (Telarc 83326), which sees him swinging precisely through standards in a quintet reinvented after so many year's absence. More often heard solo (but sounding like a duo) these days, the addition of rhythm guitar and piano to Pass's clean and melodic lines gives new dimensions to the swinging virtuoso. You need to have a high and wild big band in the pack of course and end of millennium madness dictates that it be led by young English eccentric Django Bates, who almost the reincarnates Loose Tubes with his 'Delightful Precipice'. In several sides of inspired and hugely musical lunacy Summer Fruits (and unrest) (JMT 514 008-2) ) manages to combine Charles Mingus with Spike Jones to spectacular and breathtakingly cheeky effect. Some muscle should be given to the collection and that means bad bass driven funk: Marcus Miller obliged in 1993 with The Sun Don't Lie (FDM 36560-2). The sonorous and often foundation shaking bass guitar of Miller leads jazz funk/rock statesmen such as David Sanborn, Wayne Shorter and Omar Hakim through his own dark compositions. The inventor of the genre, Miles Davis even pops in, posthumously. And a favourite newcomer for 1993? British tenor saxophonist Theo Travis made his debut with an authentically intoxicating early hours set, 2 am (33JAZZ01 1). Fluid and fluent in technique, Travis also writes a good tune. A prodigious number of reissues were mined from the back catalogues this year, like last. Polygram and EMI Records have the richest seam with the Verve and Blue Note labels respectively. My own favourites were a Stan Getz retrospective The Best of the Verve Years Vol 2 (Verve 517330-2) and The Rodgers &amp; Hart Songbook (Verve 516 158- 2). The latter matches the great jazz singers (Vaughan, Fitzgerald, Holiday, Simone) with great American songs such as 'Little Girl Blue', 'You Took Advantage Of Me'. Blue Note favourites included, among many, The Best of Grant Green (Blue Note 0777 7 8962229) which, in this almost 'acid' setting exposes the late Green as a greatly underrated talent. The combination of Nancy Wilson's lean and expressive vocal tones alongside Cannonball Adderley's alto sax in the 1961 sessions from the same stable (Capitol Jazz 07777 81204 2 I) is sublime.</p>

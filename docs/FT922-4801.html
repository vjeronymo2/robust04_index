			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Del Monte Foods Intl plans float with likely Pounds 450m tag DEL MONTE FOODS Internat-ional, the processed fruit manufacturer, has confirmed that it is preparing for a flotation which is likely to value it at Pounds 450m. Mr Leon Allen, chairman and chief executive, said a significant amount of the new money raised would be used to expand the group's interests in mainland Europe through acquisitions. The group's advisers believe the retail element could be as high as 50 per cent which would increase competition among institutional investors wanting to buy the stock. There is also likely to be a significant placing of shares on the Continent. The sale will make multi millionaires of the company's four executive directors, who together bought 5 per cent of its shares in the Dollars 375m management buy-out in May 1990. While other big buy-outs of the last few years have struggled to hit their financial targets, DMFI's profits have risen rapidly. Profits before tax increased by 82 per cent to Pounds 24.7m for the year to November 29 1991, reflecting unit volume increases in all markets and product categories. Operating profit from trading activities before interest increased by 19 per cent to Pounds 36.7m. DMFI is completely separate from the Del Monte fresh fruit business, which was bought by Polly Peck, the fruit and electronics conglomerate that collapsed in 1990. When Nabisco was bought by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the US buy-out specialists, in February 1989, Del Monte was sold and broken up. DMFI has exclusive rights to use the Del Monte name for processed foods in most parts of the world except the US. Its biggest market is Italy, where its annual sales are Pounds 78.2m, followed by the UK, where the turnover is Pounds 71m. The business is being floated by Charterhouse, the merchant bank whose investment funds own 60 per cent of DMFI, and Cazenove, the stockbroker. The group expects some of its institutional investors to sell although it is not clear what proportion will want to realise their holdings. The four senior executives plan to hold on to most of their stock. DMFI has expanded throughout Europe and developed a worldwide business which operates in 35 countries. The brand strength is sustained by unusually high expenditure on television advertising and marketing. Marketing costs were Pounds 9m in 1989, the year before the buy-out, and have risen to Pounds 24m this year. As a result, DMFI is the number one or two leading canned fruit and beverage brand in 12 European countries.</p>

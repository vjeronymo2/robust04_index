			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> UCI ACTS TO CLARIFY GAY HOUSING ISSUE  </P> <P> Administrators at UC Irvine, in their strongest declaration to date on the  thorny issue of domestic partnerships, said Wednesday that "gay and lesbian  couples . . . do not qualify for family housing."  </P> <P> A university policy statement said that gays have the same rights as all other  students to seek exceptions to the housing policy based on such factors as  financial hardship. But it emphasized that the procedure "does not authorize an  exception to be made on the basis of a gay or lesbian relationship."  </P> <P> In the wake of protests on campus in recent days over what was seen as a  reversal of gay rights, the university's formal statement on the issue was  aimed at quelling widespread speculation and some confusion over the school's  policy. But some gay leaders reacted angrily nonetheless.  </P> <P> The issue of whether gay couples can rent family-housing units on campus,  modestly priced at $450 to $650 a month, took on added potency, coming less  than three months after city of Irvine voters stripped gay rights protections  from a city law in a heated ballot initiative.  </P> <P> University administrators insisted that their statement Wednesday marked only a  clarification of existing policy, not a change -- even though at least three  lesbian couples are now living together in student housing.  </P> <P> "A gay or lesbian relationship is not grounds for a non-student being allowed  to live in student housing, and it never has been," Chancellor J.W. Peltason  said in an interview.  </P> <P> Under the university's policy, unmarried heterosexual couples are also excluded  from family housing. But gay leaders counter that -- unlike heterosexual  couples -- they are prohibited by law from being married and should instead by  recognized as domestic partners.  </P> <P> Some gay-rights advocates said that Peltason's statement appeared to mark a  softening of the administration's position as a result of recent protests.  </P> <P> In sending word to the campus last week that gays would not be given married  housing, the gay-rights advocates said, the university appeared to leave no  room for exceptions, but the issue now seems open to that possibility.  </P> <P> "It's a win in the sense that we're back to where we started," said Christine  Browning, a university psychologist who helps head a campus panel on gays.  </P> <P> But gay student leader Randy Kerr disagreed, saying: "I consider this a step  backward."  </P> <P> "The university's saying 'you don't have a right (to family housing), but we  may give it to you anyway.' That's not going to be enough; in fact, it's pretty  demeaning," Kerr said.  </P> <P> None of the three lesbian couples now in family housing is being asked to  leave, administrators said.

The project, which was accorded pioneer status, will be  implemented under a 25-year Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT)  agreement PEC reached with National Power Corp. The first unit  is expected to be operational by December 1998 and the second  unit, by March 1999.    PEC has an authorized and subscribed capital stock of  P100,000, in which P25,000 has been paid-up.    The second biggest project approved by the BoI is the P10.8  billion expansion project of Digitel Telecommunications Phils.  Inc.

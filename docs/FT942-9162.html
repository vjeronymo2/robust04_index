			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: Regional growth lifts Thai telecoms groups United Communication Industry (Ucom), the diversified Thai telecommunications group whose parent company is 25 per cent owned by Motorola of the US, yesterday announced almost doubled net profits for the first quarter of this year to Bt416.6m (Dollars 16.5m) from Bt209.4m previously. Ucom, one of several Thai companies profiting from a rapid expansion of telecommunications business in south-east Asia, was listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand five months ago. Earnings per share were Bt3.56, against Bt10.47 because of the issue of new stock. The quarterly profit 6m compares with the Bt713m made in 1993. Further financial details were not immediately available. Samart, a smaller communications company, reported a near quadrupling of net profit in the first quarter to Bt46.62m from Bt11.92m. Earnings per share rose to Bt1.04 from Bt0.75. Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest bank, reported weaker profits in the first quarter, with net earnings slipping 4.3 per cent to Bt3.55bn. The bank explained that the comparable quarter of 1993 included an exceptional gain of Bt1.5bn. Other big banks reported increased profits. Thai Farmers Bank said net profit rose 34.7 per cent to Bt2.11bn, while Krung Thai Bank announced a 25 per cent rise to Bt1.71bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The chain of terrorist acts launched against Russian  Army officers in Tajikistan in the past few days is a campaign  planned in advance for the purpose of destabilizing the  situation locally, Russia's Deputy Defence Minister, Cl.-  General Georgiy Kondratev, told INTERFAX on Monday [6 June].    According to him, the hard-line opposition has not abandoned  its intention to resolve the Tajik problem by force, including  military measures. As the general said, at the moment the  opposition is concentrating its forces not only on the border  with Afghanistan, but also within Tajikistan. Russia's 201st  motorized infantry division stationed in Tajikistan is capable,  in cooperation with Russian frontier guards and Tajik Government  forces, of thwarting any military actions the opposition may  launch from within Tajikistan and from neighboring Afghanistan,  Kondratev declared.</p>

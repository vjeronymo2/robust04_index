			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Maynayev] </F>   [Text] Bishkek, 10 Feb -- President Askar Akayev has today  signed a decree "On Urgent Measures To Strengthen State and  Finance Discipline," introducing tough measures aimed at  bringing Kyrgyzstan out of the economic crisis.    The document says that the republic continues sliding into  the economic abyss. This is caused, among other things, by a  sharp deterioration of finance, tax, and budget discipline. For  example, in the fourth quarter of 1993 taxes accounted for 7.2  percent of the gross domestic product, whereas the appropriate  level would have been 20 to 25 percent; in January 1994 this  figure dropped to just 2.6 percent.    The president regards this situation as undermining the  country's economic independence. To prevent this, he has  introduced a number of measures by decree. These include  creating a department of tax police, substantial fines,  withdrawal of registration certificates from companies,  instituting criminal proceedings against those concealing their  incomes, a tenfold increase in state excise tariffs, and a  20-fold increase in tax on land and in tax on private vehicles.  Under the decree, no tax or customs rebates will be granted.  It orders that a single computer network listing all tax-payers  be created in the country.    Declarations of all company accounts as they were on 1  January 1994 are to be submitted. The decree instructs the  National Bank to exercise strict control over credits and  monetary emission, introduces a limit for bank credits, and  completely forbids granting hard currency credits to  enterprises. The National Bank is requested to begin  immediately those actions aimed at preventing insolvency,  including reorganization and -- if necessary -- liquidation of  insolvent state enterprises.</p>

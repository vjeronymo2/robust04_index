			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GILBERT SOFTENS UP JARRYD;  </P> <P> KRICKSTEIN ALSO PREVAILS IN STRAIGHT SETS  </P> <P> Brad Gilbert has won four tournaments this year, but he never seems to do it  the hard way.  </P> <P> Gilbert has spent the year killing them softly, never once bruising the air as  he pitches his normal assortment of slowballs at opponents.  </P> <P> Is this Brad Ball?  </P> <P> Anders Jarryd got a look at it Wednesday night.  </P> <P> "He's very tough to play because he plays very soft," Jarryd said. "You have to  give all the speed yourself. . . . You have to do all the job yourself."  </P> <P> But Gilbert does darned good work himself and his 6-2, 7-6 (7-5), second-round  victory over Jarryd in the Volvo/Los Angeles tournament was fairly  representative of Brad Ball.  </P> <P> Pace is what tennis players call the speed with which balls travel back at  them. Gilbert is not a pacemaker. He doesn't believe in something that travels  as fast as pace, for gosh sakes.  </P> <P> "He hits soft and soft and soft and suddenly he's there and hits the ball very  hard," Jarrydsaid. "He's a very goodplayer."  </P> <P> Gilbert, whose No. 7 ranking is his best, trailed, 4-2, in the tiebreaker, but  got back even at 5-5 and then watched Jarryd commit back-to-back errors to  endit.  </P> <P> Whatever Gilbert's pace, it has taken him into the third round against  defending champion Mikael Pernfors. Anything after that? Gilbert's not saying.  </P> <P> "He's tough to play, but if you start worrying about the next round, you'll be  on the sidelines," he said.  </P> <P> Aaron Krickstein, who shot free throws with James Worthy and Michael Cooper in  the afternoon, stayed at the baseline a few hours later and beat Ronald Agenor  of Haiti, 6-1, 6-4.  </P> <P> Krickstein, a big Detroit Pistons fan, had a chance to try his luck at the  free-throw line against a couple of Piston archrivals, a meeting arranged by  the tournament.  </P> <P> Soon, Krickstein arranged a third-round date with either Pieter Aldrich or  Andrew Sznajder. Krickstein said he thinks his chances of winning the  tournament are as good as anyone else's.  </P> <P> "I have a real shot, but I have to serve better," he said.  </P> <P> Some found they had no shot at all.  </P> <P> Quicker than you can say Slobodan Zivojinovic, he lost.  </P> <P> Pernfors beat the 26-year-old Yugoslav, 6-3, 6-0, in 55 minutes and advanced to  the third round.  </P> <P> Zivojinovic fell when he ran for a drop shot at 3-3 in the first set and play  was halted briefly.  </P> <P> Once it resumed, Zivojinovic did not win another game.  </P> <P> Pernfors, who joked after his first-round match that he plays with an injured  brain, had no problems with it against Zivojinovic.  </P> <P> "I didn't need to use it that much," he said.  </P> <P> There was nothing he could do, Zivojinovic said, partly because of Pernfors'  extreme good luck.  </P> <P> "It is like sometimes you are really feeling hot," he said. "When he closes  your eyes and still hits the ball, well, what can a person do?"  </P> <P> So what will Derrick Rostagno do after losing, 6-7 (1-7),7-6 (7-2), 6-2, to  ScottDavis?  </P> <P> "What can you do?" Rostagno said. "Run away?"  </P> <P> Instead, Rostagno is planning to drive away. He is taking his 34-foot mobile  home on a scenic trip up the coast to next week's tournament at San Francisco.  </P> <P> "I'm going to be a little sad and then cheer up, like everybody else," Rostagno  said.  </P> <P> The Santa Monica-born Davis, 27, may have earned the quietest $990,254 in  history, with two wins in seven years and none since 1985.  </P> <P> Davis, a 1983 All-American at Stanford, is hoping that the week he spent in  Phoenix working on his serve with Ken Walts will pay off.  </P> <P> "I've been struggling to achieve my potential and it's because of my serve,"  Davis said.  </P></p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Clinton faces healthcare compromises President Bill Clinton is fighting to salvage what he can of his plan to reform the US healthcare system, in the face of waning popular support and continued deadlock in Congress. Mr Clinton said yesterday that his proposals were misunderstood because of a Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.5m) lobbying campaign against them by the health insurance industry and other interest groups, but offered to concede on virtually any point, so long as the end result guaranteed private health insurance to everyone. 'I think what will happen is people of good faith who want a plan that gives healthcare security to all Americans - that is, healthcare that you can never lose - will get together and come up with a system that meets the criteria I laid out,' Mr Clinton said on breakfast television. But recent opinion polls show that the Clinton reform plan is losing ground. A Washington Post-ABC poll taken last week showed 48 per cent of those questioned disapproved of the plan, while 44 per cent approved of it - the first time since it was unveiled last September that more have disapproved than approved. In Congress the plan is making little headway through the legislative machinery. Jurisdiction over the bill has been divided up between a wide array of House and Senate committees, but none has yet managed to agree on a text. One of the Clinton plan's key supporters, Congressman Henry Waxman of California, this week gave up attempts to work out a compromise in the health subcommittee he chairs. The committee includes Congressman Jim Cooper of Tennessee, who is sponsoring one of the chief rivals to the administration plan, a proposal he calls 'Clinton Lite'. Another health subcommittee chaired by Congressman Pete Stark, another California Democrat, has also postponed its efforts to agree on a bill. Mr Stark has his own proposal, based on an expansion of the existing government Medicare scheme. The full committees over the heads of Mr Waxman and Mr Stark are chaired by two of the president's staunchest and most powerful backers on the healthcare issue: Congressmen John Dingell of Michigan and Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois. Both recognise that they will have to compromise on many aspects of the Clinton plan if they are to win passage, and have decided not to start dealing away concessions to win agreement at the subcommittee level only to have to start again at the full committee level.</p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Bimec gives up struggle to survive Bimec Industries, once a stock market favourite for its focus on environmental services, yesterday gave up the struggle for survival just eight months after bankers agreed a Pounds 13m rescue. Despite three restructurings in six years, and the abrupt departure of its controversial entrepreneur and chairman, Mr Sam Smith, the water and waste treatment engineer called in accountants Arthur Andersen as administrative receiver. Mr Roy Barber, the company doctor appointed in 1992 who had previously failed to save Astra Holdings, the munitions group linked to the Iraqi supergun affair, said Bimec was unable to generate enough cash to carry it through the summer. The group's cash resources were almost Pounds 4m below target due to several unexpected difficulties, including a payment dispute with the UK government, delays on a water treatment contract in Belize and a shortfall in disposal proceeds. Lloyds Bank said yesterday it had refused to increased facilities following an investigation by Arthur Andersen, jointly commissioned from Bimec and the bank. The report concluded Bimec would need at least a further Pounds 2m in working capital, which it could not repay. In August, Lloyds agreed a refinancing in which it wrote off Pounds 5m in debt and converted a further Pounds 3.5m into an 8 per cent stake in Bimec. The bank had also provided a Pounds 5m working capital facility, which was increased to Pounds 7.5m this year. Bimec's total exposure to Lloyds is about Pounds 10m, of which about Pounds 7m is secured. Trade creditors are estimated at a further Pounds 7m. Two of the group's profitable subsidiaries, Three Star Engineering and Dewey Water, are not in receivership. These companies will be sold. The group's difficulties date back to Mr Smith's chairmanship, when the company sought to build its environmental business through acquisition to take advantage of the newly-privatised water industry. However, last year Mr Barber reported losses of Pounds 27m, after a Pounds 10.9m write-off to cover the overstatement of past profits. Bimec had launched proceedings to sue the former auditors Grant Thornton for negligence. The receivers are expected to examine the case.</p>

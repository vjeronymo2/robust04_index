			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unsigned article: "Publication of the Preliminary </F> Orientation Report on the Major Objectives of French Research"]    [Text] Paris--The national debate on the main objectives of  French research has begun now that the preliminary orientation  report prepared by twenty-seven important figures in the fields  of science, technology, and economics has been sent to the  directors of the major organizations.    The report of about fifty pages is the result of five work  sessions held in September and October. It will now be analyzed  and evaluated by the academies (the Academy of Science and  Academy of Ethical and Political Sciences) at College de France;  by the Parliamentary Office for Scientific and Technological  Options; by the conference of university presidents, deans of  major educational institutions, and directors of engineering  schools; by the heads of organizations such as CNRS, INRA, or  INRIA; by the Economic and Social Council; by unions; and by  cabinet ministers.    A new meeting of the study committee, in January, should  incorporate findings stated in a new report due on 20 January at  the latest, so as to form the focus for an in-depth  institutional consultation and for national and regional forums,  and later for a national summary debate as well (these being  scheduled between 15 February and 31 March). The result should  be a final orientation report intended to be the solid core of a  document which will be sent to Parliament for debate during the  spring 1994 session.    Francois Fillon, minister of Higher Education and Research,  has been the moving force behind this vast national consultation  on scientific and technological research policy for the coming  years, which is meant to continue the national forum on research  held twelve years ago at the initiative of Jean-Pierre  Chevenement who was minister at the time.    For Robert Dautray, president of the study group and high  commissioner for atomic energy, who commented on the preliminary  report, one of the most difficult problems which absolutely must  be included in assessments of higher education and research  problems, is the increase in the number of students, the  changing role of the teaching profession, and the resulting need  for new opportunities.    The influx of students in general education further  increases  the importance of the problem. It would be appropriate to create  training programs that are brief, technical, and less selective  than the current IUT and BTS. There should be many more  full-time instructors, and more university awareness of the  industrial world and its problems. According to Jacques Friedel,  president of the Academy of Sciences, it would be appropriate  for researchers to crown their careers in an academic setting.    Another problem is the question of major research equipment,  indispensable but increasingly expensive tools which often  require joint purchase and management with many countries. Basic  research must in no way be neglected or channelled because it  nurtures future applied research, according to Catherine  Cesarsky, an astronomer at CEA (Saclay). French basic research  is good, recognized in countries abroad and in turn more open to  them because it has improved during the past ten years. It  provides five percent of the material in major scientific  publications. France's competition must be met, its engineering  research increased, its risk-taking encouraged, and its chronic  conservatism overcome.    For the study group, and particularly for Pierre Douzou,  member of the Academy, life sciences, medical research and  agronomic research with their applications are increasingly  converging at a fundamental level through genetic studies, but  too often, except for the pharmacological sector, industrial  applications are late in coming or fall short of expectations.    Concerning the major programs which are also at the core of  these investigations, second only to space problems, the  preliminary report finds as does Jacques-Louis Lions, former  CNES president, that it behooves the government, if it chooses  these programs, to also set their goals concretely, clearly,  with specific objectives and timeframes. They should be  evaluated openly and he did not deny that the computer,  supergenerator, and space programs should have been reassessed  in a timely fashion.    Thanks to their increasing capabilities and speed, computers  have become a universal tool which spill over into all fields  such as aeronautics research as a whole. The constant influence  of present circumstances and of economic problems on industrial  research, which together with innovation in PME-PMI (small and  medium enterprises) is still much too inadequate, often has  negative effects. At the same time transfer of knowledge and  technology continues to take place too slowly and badly, notably  with respect to small enterprises, partly because of inadequate  basic research which is not "finalized" and because work likely  to be of interest to research and already performed in  laboratories is not well known.    According to Pierre Aigrain, former minister, the  preliminary  report has drawn up a list of questions and has defined some of  them very well. According to him, for science and technology to  play their proper role today, research has to be less  compartmentalized, has to recover its flexibility while keeping  its discipline, its quality, its very excellence; its work must  be held relevant to industrial requirements.    In a way, according to sociologist Alain Touraine, science  has to become more community-oriented and scientists must  examine the ways in which the consequences of knowledge affect  society.</p>

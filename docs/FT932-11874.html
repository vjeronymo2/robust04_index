			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Intel steps up battle with AMD INTEL, the leading US semiconductor manufacturer, has thrown more legal hurdles in the path of Advanced Micro Devices, a rival Silicon Valley chip maker that last week began shipments of its own version of Intel's top selling 486 microprocessor chip. Intel said it had filed a new copyright infringement suit against AMD, continuing a seven-year litigation feud between the two companies over intellectual property rights. AMD's entry into the 486 market last week followed a judge's decision setting aside a jury verdict favourable to Intel in a related copyright licensing dispute. The judge ruled that a new trial should be held because Intel had failed to produce documents that could have been relevant to AMD's case. Intel said yesterday it had asked the judge to reconsider his decision. Separately, in another legal dispute, Intel said Cyrix, a small semiconductor company that makes clones of Intel's microprocessors, was denied a preliminary injunction that would have prevented Intel from making patent infringement claims against Cyrix's customers.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / US ethical fund turns against Body Shop A US ethical investment fund has advised its clients to sell shares in Body Shop International, partly because of concerns about forthcoming press criticism of some of the company's social and environmental activities. Franklin Research &amp; Development has over the past few weeks sold about 50,000 Body Shop shares which it manages for clients, and has advised others to withdraw their investments. It is planning to provide a more detailed article on the company in a newsletter to subscribers within the next few weeks. Mr Patrick McVeigh, a senior vice president at Franklin, said yesterday the action partly reflected concerns about Body Shop's commitment to its 'trade not aid' programme, the use of oil-based ingredients in its products, and emissions from its former New Jersey factory. He said there was also some concern that there was insufficient publicly available information to verify some of the company's claims. Franklin's decision was partly triggered by information it saw in draft articles due to be published shortly in the US press, which are expected to be critical of Body Shop. Mr McVeigh said there was a commercial element to its 'sell' recommendation: the negative publicity could reduce the value of the stock in the near-term. He stressed that Franklin believed Body Shop's share price was likely to fall in the short-term because it had risen well above the market this year, and because of increased competition from Bath &amp; Body Works, its leading US rival. Mr Gavin Grant, general manager for corporate communications at Body Shop, said he was 'bewildered' by Franklin's decision. 'I'm not aware of major companies who do more or who are heading more in our direction.' Body Shop was currently discussing - and challenging - some of the facts in Franklin's forthcoming article. He said it was difficult to quantify the extent of the company's 'trade not aid' purchases from Third World groups, but that it was between 1 and 10 per cent of UK turnover. 'It is a small part of what we do but we are committed to its rapid development.' He said he did not believe Body Shop had any 'major environmental skeletons in the closet', and that it was seeking to move away as quickly as possible from non-renewable ingredients in its products wherever practicable. 'I don't think the company claims perfection,' he said. 'We are not an environmentally friendly company. No company can be. But we are environmentally responsible.' The company said there had been only two, non-toxic, emissions from its New Jersey plant, and these had been reported to the authorities. Mr McVeigh said Franklin manages more than Dollars 350m in funds on behalf of 300 clients interested in ethical investment, including a Fortune 500 company and a number of charitable foundations.</p>

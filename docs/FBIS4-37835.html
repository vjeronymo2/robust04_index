			<p>BFN     [Text] In the Kashmir Valley, the two Britishers -- Kim  Housego and Mr. David Mackie -- kidnapped by the militants have  been released after 17 days of captivity. The two were released  unconditionally today in the jungles of Pahalgam. Later, they  were brought to Srinagar where they were handed over to the  first secretary of the British High Commission in India. The  two Britishers were kidnapped on the 7th of this month from  Kharo in Pahalgam by a militant outfit, Harkatul Ansar.    Talking to AIR [All India Radio] correspondent in Srinagar  after their release, Kim Housego and David Mackie said they did  not know the exact location where they were kept. They were  taken from place to place during their 17-day ordeal.    The British foreign secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd, has  welcomed  the release of the two Britons. In a statement in London, he  thanked the Government of India and others who helped their  release.</p>

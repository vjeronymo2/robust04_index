			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Technology: Searching for a clearer picture of the future - After European HDTV's expensive crash, Della Bradshaw, Louise Kehoe and Michiyo Nakamoto ask what can be salvaged from the wreckage The single European market is only one month old, yet the community's flagship technology project has already foundered. The high-definition television strategy promised to bring cinema-quality pictures to Europe's television screens, by imposing a single standard, HD-Mac, on Europe's broadcasters. But that promise now seems increasingly hollow. 'The European Commission's approach has been most unfortunate,' says Philip Carse, a consultant at National Economic Research Associates (Nera) in London. 'It has backed a standard which is becoming more obsolete by the minute.' For the European taxpayer the bill for research and development into HDTV runs into hundreds of millions of pounds. But the cost to Europe's struggling electronics companies is more than monetary. They have now missed the opportunity to accrue manufacturing experience in the latest technologies, while Japanese manufacturers have grasped the opportunity with both hands. Japanese broadcasters, too, are garnering experience in programme making for HDTV. But as manufacturers sift through the bones of Europe's high-profile venture, many experts are increasingly sceptical that consumers would have paid for a technology which brought only incremental improvement in the quality of the television picture. 'My view was that it would always be a slow take-up,' says John Forrest, chief executive of NTL, the privatised transmitter and engineering arm of what was the UK's Independent Broadcasting Authority. 'The question was whether people would be prepared to pay to switch from pretty good quality television to HDTV. It was not the same jump as from black-and-white television to colour.' Even the most ardent proponents of HDTV acknowledge that the full benefits of the improved picture cannot be achieved on the standard 21- or 23-inch television set. Initially viewers would probably need projection television  -where the picture is broadcast like an old-fashioned home movie on to a screen. As technology developed, large flat-screen television sets would be used, but for these viewers would probably have to wait until the next century. HDTV promises a better-quality picture because it crams more picture elements, or pixels, into each square inch of the screen. While conventional TV pictures have 120,000 pixels, HDTV has about 700,000. The fundamental dilemma was whether consumers would even notice the difference. To the exasperation of many television engineers, viewers appear quite content to watch fuzzy pictures on tiny portable televisions with aerials made out of wire coathangers. And most viewers are prepared to ignore, or at least tolerate, the deterioration in picture quality when watching a programme which has been recorded at home on a VCR. Perhaps the biggest factor pointing to the demise of HD-Mac was that it was developed for satellite and cable transmission only. In the UK, for example, only 12 per cent of homes are connected to such services - most viewers receive their programmes through a network of terrestrial transmitters. Carse, one of the authors of a recent Nera report on HDTV, compiled in conjunction with Brunel University, says that if the analogue HD-Mac system were implemented in Europe only about 5 per cent of viewers would take up the service. In Japan, NHK, the national broadcaster, has also opted for analogue HDTV technology which therefore can only be broadcast on satellite and cable. NHK has been broadcasting daily eight-hour doses of programmes in High Vision, the Japanese name for HDTV, which the public can view at more than 450 points in public areas, such as railway stations and public halls. Although NHK and consumer electronics manufacturers have kept up the publicity in a concerted effort to maintain the momentum - November 11 has even been named national High Vision day since the Japanese system uses 1125 lines - there is growing scepticism about Japan's chosen path. High Vision has been introduced at a time when grim economic news has largely extinguished consumer interest in expensive, highly sophisticated luxury electronic goods. The cost of a HDTV set in Japan is at least Y1m (Pounds 5,300). To compound the problem, public knowledge of digital television is increasing, and the improved picture-quality of High Vision seems to pall in the face of what digital television could offer - better information services, interaction with computers and, above all, superior picture and sound quality. For the broadcaster, digital signalling brings other advantages. At least four times as many digital channels can be squeezed into a given amount of broadcast capacity as analogue ones. That means that one or two high-definition channels could be transmitted in the capacity used today for a conventional signal. Digital signals also use only one thousandth of the power of their analogue counterparts. Everyone acknowledges that eventually everybody will go digital - the only question is when. The US government has decided to skip the analogue phase altogether. The Federal Communications Commission has recently completed technical tests of five proposed HDTV systems and a panel of FCC testers is meeting in Washington this week to prepare a preliminary decision on which should become the US standard. The Advisory Committee is scheduled to bring its recommendation to the full FCC at the end of this month and a final decision should then be reached by the summer. 'The FCC intends to double the number of broadcast stations in the US, with the new stations being dedicated to HDTV service,' says Jerrold Heller, executive vice president of General Instrument's VideoCipher Division, in San Diego, which has developed DigiCipher, one of the five systems being tested. The advisory committee could select a single system but seems increasingly likely to recommend a combination of two approaches. If all goes according to schedule, then the first HDTV sets should be available to consumers by mid-1995 or early 1996, at a price of up to Dollars 3,500 (Pounds 2,300). Prices are expected to come down quickly with volume manufacturing, but even at Dollars 1,000 an HDTV set would be between two to four times as expensive as a television set in the US today. In Europe it looks increasingly as if viewers will have to wait until the introduction of a digital system before they will be able to view HDTV. Rob van Oostenbrugge, European television development manager at Philips, the company which precipitated the European crisis by announcing it would not be manufacturing HDTV sets this year as previously planned, believes it will be at least 2000 before a digital standard can be adopted in Europe. Others believe digital broadcasts could be introduced via satellite more rapidly. In the meantime, the demise of the European version of HDTV means European television viewers will continue to face a plethora of standards - Pal, Secam, Pal Plus, D2-Mac. 'It will only become worse not better,' complains van Oostenbrugge. This proliferation of standards will fragment the marketplace further and drive up costs to the consumer, he argues. For European broadcasters and electronics manufacturers, digging among the ashes of HD-Mac, the news is not all gloomy. Numerous developments can be retrieved and exploited. Although the picture transmission part of the HD-Mac specification is analogue, much of the studio technology and that used in the television sets themselves is digital, and could be developed for use with a digital high-definition system. What the consumer will see more quickly is the proliferation of wide-screen television sets, an interim step on the way to HDTV. Wide-screen sets have screens with a height to width ratio of 16:9 compared with 4:3 for conventional box-shaped sets. The wide-screen format also brings slightly better picture quality. European broadcasters are already beginning to broadcast some programmes - notably films - in the wide-screen format and manufacturers are selling the new sets in Scandinavia, France and Germany. The options for European broadcasters when selecting the digital HDTV standard will be numerous. A Scandinavian group which includes the Swedish Broadcasting Corporation and the Swedish Television Company, for example, has developed a prototype system for digital terrestrial HDTV called HD-Divine (digital video narrow-band emission). And in the UK, NTL has developed a system for the Independent Television Commission which squeezes digital signals between the existing analogue signals. The spaces are 'no go' areas for further analogue signals as these would interfere with those already there. A third option would be to adopt the same system as the US. The likelihood of this increases if Japanese manufacturers and broadcasters also decide to follow the US in digital broadcasting. While European manufacturers and broadcasters puzzle over the next move, their Japanese counterparts are forging ahead, gaining invaluable experience on how to best exploit HDTV in programme making and equipment manufacturing. By waiting for a digital standard, manufacturers in the US are in pole position to determine a world standard for digital high-definition broadcasts.</p>

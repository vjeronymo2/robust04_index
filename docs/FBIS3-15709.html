The most popular  television game shows, starting with the well-known "Field of  Miracles," are precise copies of their U.S. or European  originals. The serials "Trifles of Life" or "Goryachev and the  Others" are pale imitations of their "soap operas."    Last Saturday the prominent Ostankino Television Company's  main news program joined the ranks of the "copycats." Now  "Novosti-Plus" will appear once a week instead of "Novosti."  Just like in Paris on their Channel Five. The presenter of the  first broadcast did not explain the advantages of this  innovation very intelligibly. It seems that common-or-garden  news will be supplemented by analysis and summaries.    A few hours before the program aired there was another  airing  -- this time for the amnestied inmates of Lefortovo. The  program had a splendid opportunity to demonstrate its new  principles. But nothing of the sort: Ostankino's journalists  did not dare analyze the incident straightaway. They were  afraid.    You may retort: I thought the times had gone when television  operated on instructions from on high. Now if it is dependent  on anyone it is only on our tastes and requirements as viewers.  But no. On the Wednesday that the Duma voted in favor of the  amnesty -- it was Fatherland Defenders' Day -- the Russian  Television [RTV] schedule included P. Todorovskiy's excellent  film "Encore, Encore Again." At the scheduled time, when  millions of viewers were settling down in front of their  television sets, a toothy presenter appeared on the screen  instead of the well-known movie and made a short speech. From  which it emerged that RTV had received a host of telephone calls  protesting the showing of the movie.    The next day some newspapers revealed the secret identity of  the anonymous defenders of public morality and Soviet officers'  dignity who had telephoned RTV. They were the defense minister  and the chairman of the War Veterans' Committee. I vividly  remembered a similar thing happening three years ago involving  former [Defense] Minister D. Yazov. When he was told that  producer Peter Stein intended to stage the "Oresteia" by the  ancient Greek dramatist Aeschylus in the Soviet Army Theater, he  said that he would not allow a German to stage a Greek there.  This rapidly flew around the capital's intelligentsia and the  marshal lost all their respect even before the August putsch.    However, there was at least some logic to that decision: The  Army Theater is subsidized by the Defense Ministry. But what  about in this case? The government allocates money for  television, only half of what is required, moreover. So there  was no reason but overbearing arrogance for the telephone calls  to the television station. And the leaders of RTV who postponed  the movie until another day demonstrated the basic principle of  playing it safe.    The events of the last week on television enable us to view  the problem of television's destatization from a new angle. A  few days ago there were rumors going round yet again that an  edict on the flotation of "Ostankino" is supposedly on the  president's desk awaiting signature. During the "Without  Touching Up" program on Monday during which journalists met with  V. Shumeyko, he was asked -- as recent minister of the press and  someone who advocated the flotation of television before other  leaders -- to speak about this. His answer was extremely  indicative.    The speaker of the upper chamber of parliament thinks that  one of the two main television channels must remain a state  channel. But the other must be proclaimed a national channel and  a prominent industrial and financial association like AvtoVAZ or  LogoVaz must be allowed to take part in its flotation. I noted  that he named these firms with their close links with the  government.    The man behind the plan indirectly acknowledged this saying  that "you have to go to the limit in this, you have to be able  to walk a knife edge." And although that idea was not  developed, I saw it as a desire on the part of the authorities  to keep control over the two major television channels. In  order to ensure that on Chemical Worker's Day or Teacher's Day  the relevant minister can call the head of the television  channel on the "hot line" and demand that a program he finds  unsuitable be taken off.    And the latter will take it off, he will have no other  option, my dear....</p>

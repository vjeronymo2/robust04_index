			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Five O'Clock Sharp" newscast] </F>   [Excerpt] At a very lively news conference during which  reporters asked many questions, General Humberto Ortega said the  Army and the executive branch had still not reached an agreement  on the military organization law. He said an agreement will  probably be reached in 15 days but that the draft has not been  sent to the legislature because no consensus has been reached.  We asked Gen. Ortega if he was not the center of discord [words  indistinct] his retirement. He denied this. Let us hear what  Humberto Ortega said:    [Begin Ortega recording] I think we have to be confident.  Our work with the executive branch has been detailed and  determined. We have discussed it several times precisely  because we want to give the country and the Army a law that is a  solid basis for the future. We do not want things to be done  haphazardly. I think it is preferable to have a delay and end  up with a solid document that can take us into the end of this  century and into the next than to reach an agreement quickly.  We want a serious law, not something done carelessly that will  not be respected later or whose regulations will not be followed  or that impede the institution's efforts to mature, as has been  the case throughout this century.    The truth is that we did not inherit a Nicaraguan Army. The  National Guard was destroyed in the 1979 revolt. We started to  build the Army after the peace agreement was signed in Sapoa in  1988. During the war [words indistinct] during the Reagan  administration, it was impossible to build an Army for all  Nicaragua. So this Army is still young and things are still  rough. It is true that there has been a delay in the executive  branch's and Army's search for a mature, adequate, and feasible  law. We think it is worth it to wait 15 days at the most to see  if we are able to reach an agreement on a law that will not be  disregarded later on. The Army and I are totally willing to  achieve this goal, and we are confident that we will overcome  the problems that still, today, prevent me from telling  Nicaragua that the executive branch and the Army have reached a  thorough agreement. We agree on many things, but there are  others crucial issues about which we have not been able to reach  an adequate consensus. I am confident that we will reach it.

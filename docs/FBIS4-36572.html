			<p>BFN     [Text] Honored listeners, an official spokesman at the  Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] Defense Ministry has issued  the following statement to the YEMENI NEWS AGENCY, Aden: At a  time when the sons of our Yemeni people, brothers, and friends  were looking forward to the declaration of the cease-fire, with  effect from 1800 this evening, 9 June, in implementation of UN  security resolution No. 924, and in response to the sincere  efforts of Mr. al-Akhdar al-Ibrahimi, the UN secretary general's  envoy to Yemen, our forces deployed on the Abyan and Lahij axes  were subjected to a comprehensive surprise attack and  concentrated artillery barrage, which was launched by the forces  of the ruling military regime in Sanaa. This attack is still in  progress. The Armed Forces of the DRY, which are absolutely and  totally observing the cease-fire resolution in effect from 1800  this evening, so as to prevent the shedding of Yemeni blood in  respect and appreciation for the good and sincere efforts of the  UN envoy, affirm to the masses of our people in the DRY their  complete ability to repel the cowardly aggressors, and to force  them into respecting the international authority and its  resolutions. The Defense Ministry wishes at the same time to  praise the good efforts resulting from the high degree of  responsibility on the part of the UN envoy, and to appeal to the  UN Security Council to take stern measures against this raging  aggressor, who not only sheds the blood of our Yemeni people,  but defies the will of the whole international community.</p>

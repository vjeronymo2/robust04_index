			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EVELYN HOOKER  </P> <P> I greatly appreciated your article, "The Grande Dame of Gay Liberation," by  Bruce Shenitz (June 10). People like Evelyn Hooker should be commended for  their advocacy on behalf of gays and lesbians -- groups that suffer from  extreme oppression in our society. We, as a society and as individuals, must  accept homosexuality in other people as well as in ourselves if we are to ever  view gays and lesbians as worthy and normal.  </P> <P> CYNTHIA LEE CARR  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

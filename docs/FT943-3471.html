			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Getty plea on statue rejected A High Court judge yesterday ruled that Mr Stephen Dorrell, national heritage secretary, did not act unfairly in allowing extra time for Pounds 7.6m to be raised to keep the sculpture The Three Graces in Britain. Mr Justice Laws refused the California-based J Paul Getty Trust, which had agreed to buy the statue, a judicial review of Mr Dorrell's decision. The trust told the court sitting in Leeds that a fresh application would be made to the Court of Appeal within seven days. The Getty Trust had agreed to pay Pounds 7.6m for the Antonio Canova sculpture. The government extended a deferral of a decision to grant an export licence earlier this year to allow the Victoria and Albert Museum and the National Galleries of Scotland to raise the money. On August 9 Mr Dorrell allowed a further three months' delay. The Getty Trust argued that Mr Dorrell had said the first delay of six months was a final one and the delay should not have been extended, and that Pounds 3.6m towards the purchase from the National Heritage Memorial Fund was unlawful state aid under European Union rules. The judge accepted the government's denial that it had assured the Getty Museum in February that the six-month deferral would be final. He said Mr Dorrell was entitled to give great weight to what he saw as the cultural importance of the Graces, and he was reasonable to conclude that a British offer was at that time within striking distance of matching that of the Getty Trust. The judge rejected the argument over state aid, as neither the V&amp;A nor the National Galleries are commercial undertakings. He awarded costs against the Getty Trust in respect of the case against the secretary of state but said it should not pay the court costs of the National Heritage Memorial Fund.</p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Baghdad warned on missiles THE US yesterday expressed concern at Iraq's deployment of additional anti-aircraft missiles in the southern no-fly zone, and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Washington was considering how to respond, Reuter reports from Washington. 'We're monitoring the missiles. We're very concerned. We're still considering our options,' Mr Fitzwater said during a visit to the US military academy at West Point, New York, with President George Bush. The US Defence Department said Iraq had moved extra surface-to-air missiles into the southern no-fly zone, where an American fighter jet shot down an Iraqi MiG fighter last month. The Pentagon warned Iraq against turning on the missile targeting radars against US reconnaissance and fighter aircraft policing the area south of the 32nd parallel where Iraqi aircraft have been banned. Mr Fitzwater did not say what types of options were under consideration. However US defence officials said there was concern that the movement of the missiles might signal an attempt by Iraq's President Saddam Hussein to shoot down an American warplane in the area. The US, Britain and France set up the no-fly zone south of the 32nd parallel last year to keep Mr Saddam's aircraft from attacking dissident Shia in the south. Iraqi aircraft have violated the zone repeatedly in recent weeks and a US F-16 fighter shot down an Iraqi MiG-25 fighter over the zone on December 27. Iraq said later it reserved the right to respond. But Baghdad gave no details on whether or how it might retaliate.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rustam Narzikulov: "Nonmonetary Jugglers"] </F>   [Text] The "group of experts" formed under First Vice  Premier Oleg Soskovets is planning to refute one of the basic  postulates of current macroeconomic theory, which establishes a  strict functional and cause-and-effect relationship between the  size of a monetary emission and the rates at which prices  increase.    The former specialists in "the dialectics of socialism" and  "optimum planning" have declared their readiness to carry out  the prime minister's directive on "adjustment of the course of  economic reforms" and to curb inflation by "primarily  nonmonetary methods."    It is no coincidence that the strange combination of words  (similar to "fighting a fire by nonfire methods," "rescuing  someone who is drowning by not pulling him out of the water,"  and the like) has become part of the vocabulary of Council of  Ministers officials. A common economic dilemma for any country's  government--inflation or a production recession  (unemployment)--has become exacerbated to the limit because of  the extremely deformed structure of the economy and the absence  of developed market institutions.    For this reason, it is still impossible for the voters to be  pleased by the good condition of even one of the two key  macroeconomic parameters. Everything that was accomplished in  1993 was to lower inflation by one-third (to 900 percent  annually) and slow the rate of recession by a factor of 1.7 (to  11 percent). However, the voter, like the president and his  prime minister and the financial institutions, has not finished  and wants to see a global result right away.    And those who want to meet all the voters' demands at once  (the hypnotists, lawyers, academicians, and those who are simply  crazy) make their appearance right away. While the first two  categories of political illusionists received a vote of  confidence in the 12 December elections, the academicians' hour  of triumph came during the government crisis in mid-January.    There is no question that statements by the "group of  experts," which promises to cope with both the recession and  inflation right away, are aimed at pleasing the premier, who is  naturally worried to death about both problems. The guarantees  are being given by persons who are quite reliable--the  academicians. It is unlikely that they will really be lying.    However, the premier would not have become the head of the  government if he had not learned from his own mistakes and been  insured against possible political traps. Viktor Chernomyrdin is  well aware what the first attempt to make use of the services of  the "reputable" economist Leonard Vid cost him. After the  former deputy chairman of the USSR Gosplan [State Planning  Committee] provided Mr. Chernomyrdin with his written concept of  the reform, the press accused the prime minister of attempts to  revive the system of directive management of the economy. Mr.  Vid disappeared completely from the political scene as a result  of the economic experiment in the spring.    This time, Viktor Chernomyrdin is being cautious, and "the  experts" have been attached to his first deputy, who will assume  full responsibility for the work's unavoidable failures. It has  also not been ruled out that the government order to the  academicians is a budgeted grant for the economic NII  [scientific research institutes], which are at death's door and  whose staffs are comparable with the work force of associates in  large corporations. However, regardless of the true motives for  enlisting the services of these persons in the Council of  Ministers or how long they are held in the White House, the  damage inflicted on the Russian economy by the use of  "nonmonetary methods" will be enormous. After all, each  "nonmonetary" day will cost the country the inflation, measured  in percentages that are entirely monetary, which is being  generated by the increased productivity of the printing press.</p>

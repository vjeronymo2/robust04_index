			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Informal Japan-U.S. trade  talks are progressing without any numerical targets being set,  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said Tuesday.    "I've heard that the talks are proceeding gradually...and  our  basic stance on numerical targets remains unchanged," Fujii told  a regular news conference after a morning cabinet meeting.    "We (Japan) can't accept anything that is clearly a  numerical  target," he added.    Japanese and U.S. officials are holding informal meetings in  Washington since last week in a bid to reopen the "framework"  talks which have been at a stalemate since February, when then  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. Bill Clinton [as  received] failed to agree on "objective criteria."    Fujii declined to make any predictions or disclose details,  saying "negotiations are still under way."    While acknowledging news reports that an agreement to reopen  the frameworks talks is expected later in the day, Fujii said,  "I want to watch for a little while."    But he noted that the informal talks are focused on the  three  priority areas -- automobile and auto parts, insurance, and  government procurement of telecommunications and medical  equipment.    On the insurance field, which is overseen by his ministry,  Fujii suggested that Japan is not offering any new commitments.    "We want to reach an agreement within our voluntary  measures," he said, referring to the March market-opening  package, including further deregulatory steps and simpler  licensing procedures.</p>

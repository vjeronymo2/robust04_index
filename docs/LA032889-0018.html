			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: OSCAR WATCH  </P> <P> More on the Case of the Disappointed Jurist Desperately Seeking Oscar Tickets:  "People's Court" Judge Joseph Wapner, who last week was in search of a ticket  to the Academy Awards, has decided to just stay home and watch. He had wanted  to attend the festivities because of Dustin Hoffman's repeated references to  him in the much-nominated film "Rain Man," and a Warner Bros. rep even went so  far as to try and get him booked onto the show. That plea was over-ruled by  Oscar show producer Allan Carr. Now, it turns out, Wapner will be taping his  own show on Wednesday, then will spend the evening in front of the TV like  millions of others to watch the Oscar outcome. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

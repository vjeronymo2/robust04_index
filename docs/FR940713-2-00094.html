(``BMI'') has filed with the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York a motion to modify the Final Judgment in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States v. Broadcast Music, Inc. et al.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 64 Civ. 3787, and the Department of Justice (``Department''), in a stipulation also filed with the Court, has consented to modification of the Final Judgment, but has reserved the right to withdraw its consent based on public comments or for other reasons. The Complaint in this case (filed on December 10, 1964) alleged that BMI and 517 broadcasters who owned its voting stock constituted a combination to restrain and monopolize, and an attempt to monopolize, the business of acquiring and licensing to broadcasters copyrighted music rights, in violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1 and 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Final Judgment (entered on December 29, 1966) provides, among other things, that any licenses obtained by BMI from composers for music performance rights must be non-exclusive, that BMI must offer through-to-the-viewer and per-program licenses to radio and television networks and cable programming services, and that BMI's license rates and terms must be non-discriminatory. Unlike the similar decree in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. v. ASCAP  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Civ. No. 13&hyph;95 (WCC), however, the BMI Judgment has no provision for court adjudication of license fees for music performing rights where BMI and a potential licensee are unable to reach agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has filed with the Court a memorandum setting forth the reasons why it believes that modification of the Final Judgment to provide a rate court for the adjudication of disputed license fees would be in the public interest. Copies of the Complaint, the Final Judgment, the defendant's motion papers, the Stipulation containing the Government's tentative consent, the Department's memorandum, and all further papers filed with the Court in connection with this motion will be available for inspection at Room 3235, Antitrust Division, Department of Justice, 10th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20530 (Telephone: (202) 514&hyph;2481), and at the Office of the Clerk of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Foley Square, New York, New York 10007. Copies of any of these materials may be obtained from the Antitrust Division upon request and payment of the copying fee set by Department regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons may submit comments to the Department regarding the proposed modification of the Final Judgment. Such comments must be received within the sixty-day period established by court order, and will be filed with the Court by the Department. Comments should be addressed to Gail Kursh, Chief, Professions and Intellectual Property Section, Antitrust Division, Department of Justice, 555 Fourth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20001 (telephone: (202) 307&hyph;5799). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Constance K.

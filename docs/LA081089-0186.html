			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORD CONSIDERS EUROPEAN JOINT VENTURE WITH MAZDA  </P> <P> Ford Motor Co. is studying a joint venture to produce vehicles in Europe with  its Japanese partner Mazda Motor Corp., a top Ford official said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Speaking to reporters at a University of Michigan automotive seminar, Ford  Executive Vice President Philip Benton also denied trade publication reports  that the auto maker has killed its PN38 truck program, an ambitious plan of new  trucks and mini-vans for the 1990s.  </P> <P> In the first direct public comments by a Ford executive on the program, Benton  said it has not been canceled but has been modified.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Construction Dates  </P> <P> Ford owns about 25% of Mazda, in what is considered the most successful  partnership between a U.S. and Japanese auto maker. Mazda builds the Ford Probe  at its Flat Rock, Mich., plant, and its 323 subcompact provides the base for  the Mercury Tracer, built by Ford in Mexico.  </P> <P> "We're looking at how we can best get together in Europe," Benton said of the  potential venture.  </P> <P> Mazda officials said earlier this year that they were holding talks with Ford  on a European venture, but Ford did not confirm the statement.  </P> <P> Benton said any venture would require an expansion of Ford's already tight  production capacity situation in Europe. "We would have to find means to expand  capacity," he said.  </P> <P> Although Ford has not built a U.S. plant since its Kentucky truck facility  opened in 1969, Benton also said Ford has not ruled out the possibility of  building new production centers in the United States during the 1990s. He said  the company has decided that new plants are inevitable.  </P> <P> "It's only a question of time," Benton said.  </P> <P> However, he would not say exactly when these plants will be built. "When does  tomorrow come? I don't have the foggiest idea."  </P> <P> The first vehicles in Ford's PN38 program were expected to be introduced in the  early 1990s. The program involves a new series of full-sized trucks, mini-vans  and sport utility vehicles and its importance had been compared by some  analysts to the auto maker's Taurus and Sable car development program.  </P> <P> Some reports had said the recent softening in U.S. auto sales was responsible  for the program being killed. Ford's U.S. auto sales are down about 2% this  year.  </P> <P> "We have not canceled PN38. We have changed its complexion," Benton said.  </P> <P> He said the project would have involved developing new engines and  transmissions, and Ford is already strapped for capacity in those components.  The revised plan, Benton said, will allow Ford to use existing engines and  transmissions.  </P></p>

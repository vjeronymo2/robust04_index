			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Brazil names day for new currency Brazil will introduce a new currency, its fifth since 1986, on July 1 as the final step of the government's latest effort to tackle inflation, now near 50 per cent a month. President Itamar Franco yesterday confirmed the date for the switch to the new currency, the real. However, several important details - for example, future policy on the real's exchange rate with the US dollar - will not be announced until next month. Mr Rubens Ricupero, the new finance minister, said final decisions on monetary and exchange rate policy were still being finalised. It is expected the real will initially be backed by Brazil's more than Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20bn) of foreign exchange reserves. Mr Ricupero said he and Mr Pedro Malan, central bank chairman, would also examine how state and federal banks would be affected by the introduction of the real. Several such banks rely on profits from high inflation to remain solvent. There are fears that, before presidential and congressional elections in October, the government will have to support these banks and thus put tight monetary policy at risk. The confirmation of the advent of the real provided a welcome lift for Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who resigned as finance minister in March to run for the presidency. The success of the anti-inflation plan, which he negotiated, is seen as very important to his campaign. Opinion polls late last week show Mr Cardoso's support at 15 per cent, down nearly five percentage points in the last month, against about 40 per cent for Mr Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-of-centre Workers' Party. Mr Cardoso has been damaged by bickering with his election allies, the right-wing Liberal Front, and by the choice as running-mate of a lesser known senator, Mr Guilherme Palmeira.</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rebounds on improved sentiment INVESTORS were encouraged by the announcement late on Wednesday by the Osaka Stock Exchange (OSE) of measures to enhance transparency in the derivatives market, and the Nikkei average rebounded after declining for two consecutive days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average gained 168.55 to 22,104.92, helped by arbitraged-related buying after a rise in futures prices. The index opened at the day's low of 21,975.05 and rose to the day's high of 22,284.80 in the morning session, but later eased back towards the close. Volume was steady at 200m shares. Advances led declines by 626 to 347, with 156 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 5.20 to 1,631.25 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 4.96 to 1,250.97. Traders said that the OSE's announcement improved sentiment. The OSE said that trading by brokers of futures and options contracts would be disclosed, and trading hours for futures would be shortened by 10 minutes. Option contracts, currently exercised once a week, will be exercised once a month, starting with the June contract. 'Changing the rules may affect liquidity and increase the volatility in the market, but some investors were relieved that the authorities showed that they cared,' said Mr Peter Johnson at Baring Securities. The recent overt expressions by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party for support of the sluggish stock market have soothed investors' worries that authorities were unsympathetic. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y35,000 to Y750,000 on rumours that the government may include measures to support the NTT share price in its effort to support the overall market. Investors sought cyclical stocks. Electric furnace steelmakers advanced with Tokyo Steel Mfg up Y50 to Y2,640 and Tokyo Tekko rising Y20 to Y1,590. Machineries were also favoured with Rheon Automatic Machinery up Y110 to Y1,540. Heavy electricals fell sharply on downward revisions of earnings expectations by leading Japanese brokerages. Projections that the recovery of the semiconductor market may be delayed also prompted selling. Hitachi, the most active issue of the day, fell Y25 to Y903 and Kyocera lost Y90 to Y4,350. Short-term trading lifted bio-technology related stocks. Meiji Milk Products rose Y22 to Y909 and Okamoto Industries, the prophylactic maker, advanced Y14 to Y933. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 139.10 to 23,728.57 in volume of 101.8m shares. Bargain-hunting by individuals supported the index. Turnover once again topped 100m shares due to heavy cross-trading by financial institutions looking to lock in profits ahead of the March book-closing. Roundup The Pacific Rim was mixed as many bourses re-opened after the Chinese New Year. Hong Kong, Taiwan and New Zealand were closed. AUSTRALIA saw two large portfolios of programme trading coming out of Japan, which accounted for 30 per cent of turnover. The All Ordinaries index fell 8.3 to 1,594.6 in turnover of ADollars 228m (ADollars 302m). Coles Myer, the retailer, continued its decline, shedding 18 cents to ADollars 11.38, while CSR, the building and sugar group, fell 4 cents to ADollars 4.72 after announcing an asset writedown on Wednesday. The banking sector was mixed, with Westpac putting on 4 cents to ADollars 4.22. It announced that it was issuing 73m new shares to the Australian Mutual Provident Society, raising the latter's stake to 15 per cent from 10 per cent. National Australia rose 2 cents to ADollars 7.50 and Commonwealth shed 7 cents to ADollars 7.05. News Corp gained 42 cents to ADollars 15.00 on the back of good trading in New York. Its half-year results are due next Wednesday. MANILA firmed in narrow trading: the composite index up 5.50 to 1,252.37. Political uncertainty ahead of the May elections is keeping some investors out of the market. Turnover fell to 165m pesos (255m). Philippine Long Distance Telephone rose 25 pesos to 915.00 on a strong showing in the US. SEOUL fell on profit-taking. The composite index slipped 0.53 to 690.84 in turnover of Won509bn. The manufacturing sector was broadly down: Lucky fell Won400 to Won18,500. KUALA LUMPUR rose on bargain hunting and index-linked buying. The composite index put on 5.17 to 575.81 in volume of 28.6m shares. Kedah Cement was actively traded, rising 10 cents to MDollars 2.77. Motor stocks also firmed after the government said it would reconsider a ruling which would raise the tax on four-wheel drive vehicles. SINGAPORE was quiet as late profit-taking pulled prices down: the Straits Times Industrial Index rose 4.88 to 1,530.85 in volume of 36.08m. BANGKOK was active in property after Wednesday's new issue of Bangkok Land shares: it rose Bt15 to Bt169.00 in turnover of Bt1.75bn. The SET index gained 7.68 to 771.09 in turnover of Bt7.64bn. JAKARTA fell in active trading, the official index down 1.40 to 287.06 in volume of 16.6m shares. Inco, the nickel company, put on Rp50 to Rp3,950</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Letter: Eurostat supports new trade data system Sir, In her article 'Blackout on trade figures at time of great import' (December 14), Emma Tucker gives the impression that Eurostat did not attach enough importance to Intrastat, the new system of collecting intra-EC trade figures. Nothing could be further from the truth. Intrastat is one of the most important projects we have ever undertaken. The single market means removal of the customs formalities on which current trade figures are based. As a result of general acceptance that trade figures would still be essential after 1992, Eurostat started to develop a new system of collecting data as early as 1985. By the beginning of 1989 our plan was ready to submit to the Council of Ministers. However, the complications resulting from the linking of Intrastat with the VAT systems of member states delayed final approval until November last year. Only then could we begin detailed implementation. Since then Eurostat has underlined the importance of Intrastat by what amounts to a quite exceptional level of support for its implementation. Our aim throughout has been to reduce the burden on the business community. Such a fundamental change to European trade statistics is challenging for everyone. In theory, running the old and new systems side by side might seem 'sound practice'. In practice, think of the burden on already hard-pressed business people. At the end of the day, Intrastat will mean a cheaper and simpler way to obtain detailed, harmonised and comparable figures on intra-Community trade. Surely an invaluable resource for any business seeking to exploit the challenge of the single market?

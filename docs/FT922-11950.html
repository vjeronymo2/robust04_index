			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Stolpe refuses to resign amid fresh Stasi claims MR Manfred Stolpe, east Germany's most popular politician, yesterday resisted pressures to resign as prime minister of Brandenburg state after fresh allegations that he was an informer of the former Stasi security police. German television and the Berlin newspaper BZ produced Stasi documents purporting to show that Mr Stolpe was a top Stasi informer on the Protestant Church whose code-name was 'Secretary'. Mr Stolpe was formerly the senior lay official in the Protestant Church of Berlin-Brandenburg. He said yesterday he would present documents showing the Stasi kept a file on 'Secretary' five years before his first meeting with a Stasi officer and that the file consisted of information collected on him. BZ quoted Mr Klaus Rossberg, a Stasi officer who worked with 'Secretary', as saying he regularly met Mr Stolpe from 1969. The news paper also cited a Stasi document allegedly showing that Mr Stolpe favoured arresting members of Church-backed civil rights groups. Mr Stolpe called this 'nonsense'. West German retail sales in February were around 2.5 per cent lower than a year earlier, and showed no improvement over the previous month, the HDE retailers' association reported said yesterday, writes Christopher Parkes in Bonn.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Large gains for Scots Nats The Conservatives slipped to third place in Scotland, taking only 14 per cent of the vote in the elections for the nine regional and three island councils. In Lothian, a council that the Tories once controlled, the they lost 7 seats to Labour and the Liberal Democrats, ending with only 5. Mr Major is scheduled to address the conference of the Scottish Conservative party at Inverness on Friday.

'The Scottish people have gained the confidence to vote for their power to change,' he said.

The Liberal Democrats passed their modest target of increasing their share of regional council seats from 42 to 50 or more. They are likely to end up with about 60 seats, and will replace Labour as the biggest single party in Grampian region. Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservatives, admitted on BBC Radio Scotland that former Tory voters had stayed at home - 'which is clearly disappointing'. The Conservatives lost seats even in blue-chip suburbs of Edinburgh. Mr Alistair Darling, Labour MP for Edinburgh Central, said: 'The Tories have lost their heartland vote.'</p>

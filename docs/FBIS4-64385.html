			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 2 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb officials plan to  try at least three French aid workers Sunday [8 May] on charges  of smuggling weapons to Moslem forces, the relief organization  Premiere Urgence said.    Eleven members of the emergency aid group have been held at  a  Bosnian Serb barracks near Sarajevo since April 8.    The organization issued a statement saying the Serbs "seem  to  have refrained from judging all 11 of Premiere Urgence's  volunteers in order to bring charges against three members of  the team."    The organisation strenuously denied Serb charges that it had  channeled arms to Bosnian Moslem forces.    The group said it believed the other eight volunteers could  be released before their colleagues go on trial.    France recently demanded the immediate and unconditional  release of all 11 aid workers. French Foreign Minister Alain  Juppe has said he believes they have been framed by the Serbs.    Several observers, including lawyers and also  representatives  of the International Federation of Human Rights and Amnesty  International, hope to make their way on Friday to the Bosnian  Serb headquarters at Pale, outside Sarajevo, where the three  workers are to stand trial, Premiere Urgence added.</p>

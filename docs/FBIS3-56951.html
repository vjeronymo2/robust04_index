			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with (Yakovlev), Russian deputy foreign minister </F> in charge of Korean affairs, by station reporter (Krietov) on  Russia's relations with the DPRK and the ROK--from the "Various  Aspects of Cooperation" program; place and date not given]    [Text] (Yakovlev), Russian deputy foreign minister in  charge of Korean affairs, answered questions posed by station  reporter (Krietov).    [Krietov] How were Russian relations with the DPRK and the  ROK in 1993?    [Yakovlev] Relations between Russia and the two Koreas were  developed in various areas last year. Let us recall what Russia  has inherited from the former Soviet Union.    Relations between Russia and the DPRK have been complex and  painful. The ROK has treated us with a certain suspicion  [ilchonghan pulsin]. Seoul did not understand how Russia would  develop and how Russia's development would effect the situation  on the Korean peninsula.    What did we do last year? Russia and the DPRK reassessed the  grounds of relations between the two in 1993. The reassessment  was made on the line of big changes in Russia, the Korean  peninsula, and all over the world. We have dissolved the DPRK's  misgivings that Russia would take a biased policy while adhering  to the ROK's view on South-North dialogue. We are working with  Pyongyang in political and economic areas and help in removing  obstacles to South-North relations.    Deputy Foreign Minister Kunadze visited Pyongyang last year  as a special envoy of the Russian president. During this visit,  Russia and the DPRK agreed to amend treaties on and legal  grounds of relations between the two countries, including the  1961 Russia-DPRK treaty, and to resume and activate contacts  between the two countries' foreign ministries, including  contacts in the United Nations.    In 1993, Russia and the DPRK signed a treaty on scientific  and technological cooperation and a treaty on cooperation in the  fishery area. They have continued mutual cooperation in the  DPRK lumbering business in the Russian territories. I emphasize  that this is complementary [sangho powanjok] cooperation. We  will continue such cooperation based on the amended grounds.    We are generally satisfied with the development of relations  between Russia and the ROK. We have developed practical  [silmujok] cooperation based on the grounds of relations between  the two countries. We remember that a treaty that secures a new  atmosphere [sae chuserul hwakposikinun choyak], a lump-sum  economic agreement, and a series of important documents, and a  series of other important documents between Russia and the ROK  were signed when President Yeltsin visited Seoul in November  1992.    We continued political dialogue with the new ROK  administration of President Kim Yong-sam last year. Based on  our mutual political understanding, we have solved even problems  rooted in the past. When I say this, I have a series of  problems, including the one involving the ROK airliner, which  was shot down in 1983, in mind. Another series of problems,  including the one involving the burial of radioactive waste in  the Sea of Japan, have not yet been solved.    We highly assess ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's visit  to  Russia in the summer of 1993. During this visit, Russia and the  ROK confirmed their mutual interest in the results of Russia-ROK  relations in various fields, the same view Russia and the ROK  hold on many world and business issues, and each other's  willingness to cooperate in resolving those issues.    It is more important, however, that contacts of people,  including sportsmen, art groups, businesses, and scholars, have  become more active. This reinforced the atmosphere of mutual  trust not only on the official level but also between the people  of Russia and the ROK.    A schedule of cultural cooperation for 1994 has been signed.  This has increased the possibility of learning the history,  culture, and traditions of each other's country. Relations  between scientific and educational organizations of the two  countries have been promoted comprehensively, and contacts  between the two countries' scientific academic organizations.  Scientific and technological cooperation has also rapidly been  developed. Hundreds of Russian experts and scholars are working  in the ROK, and many ROK experts are in Russia.    [(Yakovlev) continues] An important aspect of relations  between Russia and the ROK is economics. Regrettably, the  relations had a difficult time last year due to the adverse  economic situation in Russia and decreases in production in the  ROK. The volume of trade of goods between the two countries  amounted to $1.5 billion.    We plan to start 25 large-scale projects this year after  overcoming difficulties facing economic cooperation. They  include construction of an ROK industrial complex in the  Nakhodka free economic zone and a gas pipeline between Russia  and the ROK via the DPRK.    [Krieto] How do you assess the overall situation on the  Korean peninsula?    [Yakovlev] The situation on the Korean peninsula is very  complicated. Pyongyang and Seoul signed the Agreement on  Reconciliation, Nonaggression, and Exchange and Cooperation in  February 1990. North-South talks and premiers contacts started.  Regrettably, they discontinued soon because the disagreement on  mutual inspections and the Washington-Seoul decision to resume  the Team Spirit military exercise. This issue is now being  resolved in the course of talks between Washington and  Pyongyang. We demand that the talks be concluded with success.    Russia resolutely opposes nuclear weapons proliferation in  any form, and we oppose the emergence of nuclear weapons on the  Korean peninsula. Safeguards are necessary to prevent the  emergence of nuclear weapons. Safeguards will be ensured when  the International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] rules are  adhered to strictly. We demand that all (?problems) between the  DPRK and the IAEA be resolved completely without specific  national circumstances being considered.    We fully support the Joint Declaration on the  Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, signed by the DPRK and  the ROK. We think this declaration will give impetus to  Seoul-Pyongyang talks on denuclearization. Russia, China, the  United States, Japan, and other countries concerned must promote  a favorable environment for denuclearizing the Korean peninsula,  alleviating tension, and promoting North-South trust.    [Krieto] What do you think of the future of relations  between Russia and the ROK?    [Yakovlev] It is time Russia and the ROK start carrying out  the various large-scale projects that were agreed on during  President Yeltsin's visit to the ROK. We are looking forward to  new summit talks in Moscow this year. We must hold the talks  based on results from the implementation of the previous  agreements.    We plan to develop cooperation with the DPRK, first, in the  economic field. The two countries must form a joint committee  on the treaties existing between them.    We must [word indistinct] an organization for regular  negotiations on urgent issues on the Korean peninsula and  restructure the DPRK's debt to Russia, which amounts to over 3  billion rubles at 1990 prices.    The repayment of the debt is not an issue that can be  resolved in a year but must be resolved based on more efficient  forms of economic cooperation. Collectivization of agriculture  [words indistinct] is one of them. Experts say we can pool the  potential of the DPRK, ROK, China, and Russia to develop natural  resources, build social infrastructures in Russia's Far East,  and develop the Tumen River estuary bordering Russia, China, and  Korea.    Russia's policy toward the Korean peninsula has also focused  on improving North-South relations. As President Yeltsin has  said, the North and South hold the key to national  reunification. An important task of Russia's policy is to help  the DPRK and ROK use it.    No doubt, Russia's interests on the Korean peninsula can be  promoted when Russia maintains normal good-neighbor relations  with the North and South.</p>

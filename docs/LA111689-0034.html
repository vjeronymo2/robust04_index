			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: EDDIE WAS A WALKER YOU HAD TO NOTICE.  </P> <P> If you get around much in La Canada Flintridge, you must have come to know of  Edson Johnson, at least obliquely.  </P> <P> He was the walker.  </P> <P> Eddie was a walker you had to notice. He looked quaint heading down the street,  even from a distance. His clothes were out of style and uncoordinated. His  pants sagged. Sometimes his clothes looked as if they needed a wash. He hunched  slightly over a walking stick.  </P> <P> Most remarkable was the gait itself. He stepped smartly, with a keen sense of  destination, even though, if you saw him often enough, you could guess that he  was caught in a loop. He simply took great pleasure in walking. His stride made  him look younger than his age, the mid-40s.  </P> <P> Eddie sent letters to The Times publicizing the Rainbow Walkers, a group he had  created. It left every Sunday from the gates of Descanso Garden, bound at a  leisurely pace for destinations with romantic names such as Winery Canyon and  Fair Haven, the estate of actor Victor McGlaughlin. Eddie charged a fee of $1.  </P> <P> The form of the letters was more interesting than their content. They were  crudely typed in script with broken spacing, errors corrected in ballpoint pen.  Several weeks of announcements came together on a single sheet or sometimes on  the back of a used envelope, the words tapering to the tip of the flap.  </P> <P> This was strange enough to call for investigation. It was a little more than a  year ago that I conducted the inquiry, in person. Besides myself, 10 people  assembled that day for the hike, one man and seven women who were regulars, a  young couple who were new.  </P> <P> The women came in expensive cars and wore chic outfits. They chatted for a few  minutes, bringing one another up on news of mutual friends. Eddie walked down  from a handsome house on Fairlawn Drive, in which he had lived with his elderly  mother for many years. He made small talk about the theories of  electro-physicist Nikola Tesla, inventor of the alternating current motor.  </P> <P> Then he began the walk, which covered several miles, all on city streets.  </P> <P> Eddie played both guide and savant. He gave pointers on exercise theory and La  Canada history. He recited the names and medicinal properties of the flowers  that grew on the hillsides as well as the weeds that poked from the sidewalk.  </P> <P> Eddie said he formed the group because he was tired of Sierra Club hikes.  </P> <P> "All they do is hike," he said. "I like to talk."  </P> <P> The new couple vanished before the hike was half over. The others straggled in  small groups. But all managed to take in some of Eddie's banter.  </P> <P> One of them said the women belonged to the Rainbow Walkers because they needed  the exercise and because they found Eddie to be a fun companion. Obviously,  they also found him non-threatening. Eddie's gushing laugh was as free of  psychological pressure as it was absent of social acumen.  </P> <P> Anyway, Eddie had passed the test. His announcements continued to find a place  in The Times.  </P> <P> A few months ago, signs of trouble in Eddie's life began to appear.  </P> <P> He raised his fee to $1.75. About the same time, his announcements grew even  stranger. They came taped to the inside of preprinted mailers for the  Children's Museum in downtown Los Angeles. It appeared that Eddie had found a  way to post his messages without buying stamps.  </P> <P> Resolving not to honor the illicit use of the mail, I threw out a few of the  releases. But soon I gave in. Lives held together with such flimsy string as  Eddie's are not made for heavy handling.  </P> <P> It was no surprise, then, when the news arrived last week that Eddie's life had  come undone the previous Sunday. His 84-year-old invalid mother fell and called  her son-in-law in Monrovia, who called 911. When paramedics arrived, Eddie  became frightened and wouldn't let them in. Sheriff's deputies were called. The  son-in-law arrived to let them in. They found a terrible mess of trash, empty  cat food cans and cat droppings.  </P> <P> Before the day was over, the county Fire, Health and Animal Control Departments  had all dispatched agents to the house.  </P> <P> "The odor in the house was just so bad that while they were working there, the  Fire Department lent our workers oxygen tanks," said Dan Sturkie, manager of  the county's Baldwin Hills animal shelter.  </P> <P> The cats appeared to have come from all around the neighborhood for handouts,  entering through a broken window, Sturkie said. About 20 had been trapped.  </P> <P> By day's end, Eddie's mother was sent to a hospital for treatment. She was  later released to the care of the son-in-law. Social workers found Eddie  another place to live. Health officials declared the house a hazard and ordered  it cleaned. An official said the son-in-law planned to take responsibility for  the cleanup, then sell the house.  </P> <P> And so the Rainbow Walkers have lost their guide and savant.  </P></p>

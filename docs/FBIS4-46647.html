			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Valentin Rudenko: "Russian MiGs `Breach' the </F> Malaysian Market"]    [Text] Difficult negotiations on the  sale of 18 frontline MiG-29 fighters to Malaysia went on for  more than 2 years. And even when it seemed as if all of the  details had sorted themselves out (recall the well known  statement by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahqthir bin Mohamad at  the end of last year at the "Lima-93" International Naval and  Aerospace Exhibition: "It's almost a done deal, and it's already  time to order the champagne") suddenly some new sort of  circumstances appeared, and signing of the contract was  postponed indefinitely.    Sad as it may be to say this, but not only American firms,  which have offered Malaysia the latest F/A-18 airplanes almost  at dumping prices, but also Russian firms and even private  individuals, which have literally besieged this country's  government and military structures with assurances to one and  all that they in particular had been granted the right to sell  the MiGs, made their contribution to causing this deal to occur  as late as possible and at the least advantage for us. According  to the journal BROOKINGS REVIEW around 20 such firms visited  Malaysia over a short period of time. The newspaper ROSSIYSKIYE  VESTI asserts that there were 50 of them.    And in the meantime the exclusive right to conduct  negotiations and sign a contract to deliver MiG-29 fighters to  Malaysia was granted by a decision of the government of the  Russian Federation to the Moscow Aviation Production  Association. And it was precisely owing to the persistent and  purposeful work by specialists of this association, as well as  of the Rosvooruzheniye State Arms and Military Equipment Export  and Import Company, with which the Moscow Aviation Production  Association worked in close contact, that such a contract came  into being. It is estimated at an amount on the order of $600  million U.S. The initial proposal was to pay half of the  contract with deliveries of palm oil. But as a result of  negotiations conducted by First Deputy Chairman of the  Government Oleg Soskovets, who headed the Russian government  delegation that was to sign the contract, and his Malaysian  colleague Anwar ibn Ibrahim, only a fourth of the value of the  contract will be compensated with palm oil.    The first MiG-29 is to be delivered to Malaysia in April  1995. The issue of creating a special technical center to  service our fighters is presently being considered.    Malaysian Defense Minister Mohamed Najib bin Tun Haji Abdul  Razak called the MiG contract "the largest deal with Russia,"  and expressed interest in developing military and technical  cooperation further.</p>

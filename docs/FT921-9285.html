			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Soviet Union suffered Dollars 14bn capital flight last year THE former Soviet Union was forced to stop debt repayment to foreign banks last year largely because Soviet enterprises illegally kept at least Dollars 14bn, and possibly up to Dollars 19bn, in foreign accounts rather than repatriate hard currency at an overvalued exchange rate. 'The combination of a Dollars 5bn current account surplus, Dollars 2bn in net external borrowing and more than Dollars 9bn in sales of gold and foreign exchange suggests large-scale capital flight in 1991. A large part of this was probably by enterprises that were reluctant to remit foreign exchange under the requirement that 40 per cent of hard currency earnings be exchanged at the increasingly overvalued exchange rate of Rbs 1.7 to the dollar', according to the Institute of International Finance (IIF), the Washington-based research group funded by international commercial banks. In its latest report on the former Soviet economy, the institute says that 'monetary tightening to curb capital flight is essential'. While noting that Russia has taken the lead in economic reform, it states that the programme 'lacks crucial elements, including monetary control'. It warns that 'retreat from fiscal adjustment, or a failure to reinforce it with with monetary and structural measures including privatisation, would risk hyper-inflation, further weakness of the rouble, increased capital flight and continued foreign exchange shortages.' The IIF doubts whether a sufficiently comprehensive reform package can be implemented to secure financial support from the IMF even if membership is agreed by spring. The IIF estimates that the convertible currency debt of the new CIS rose to Dollars 61.5bn at the end of 1991 from Dollars 59.4bn in October. The now-defunct Soviet state managed to borrow less than Dollars 2bn from abroad last year. A rise in official lending from Dollars 23.2bn in 1990 to Dollars 36.5bn at the end of 1991 was largely offset by repayments to commercial banks. The latter 'may have received net repayments of as much as Dollars 11.1bn in 1991, of which Dollars 7bn was in short-term credit,' the report notes. Net disbursement by non-bank private creditors amounted to a mere Dollars 0.4bn after taking into account 'at least Dollars 1bn in loans collateralised against diamonds'. Trade arrears remained 'broadly unchanged' at around Dollars 4bn to Dollars 4.5bn, the report added. Looking ahead, the IIF warns that the CIS may find it more difficult to raise external credit than the former Soviet Union. 'The breakdown of a unified administrative structure will disrupt traditional trade flows .shortages of material inputs are likely to intensify. Real net material product (NMP) may fall another 15 per cent in Russia ..and output may fall  .by more than a quarter, in several republics.' In these circumstances, 'access to external credit may be more limited in 1992 ..financing flows may amount to Dollars 10bn in 1992, with official creditors providing nearly all new disbursements'. Meanwhile, international institutions are likely to play 'only a limited financial role'. Credits from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) are unlikely to be above Dollars 50m while it will be difficult for the IMF and World Bank to reach agreement and disburse funds this year, the report concludes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Australian foreign minister, Senator Gareth  Evans, has urged the United Nations Security Council to be  careful about any decision directed at North Korea. Speaking in  Manila, Senator Evans said the situation needs to be handled  delicately. Trevor Watson reports.    [Begin Watson recording] Senator Evans said he would deplore  any decision that drives the North Koreans beyond the point of  no return in their dealings with the International Atomic Energy  Agency or the world community. Nobody, he said, knows if  sanctions will do that or encourage the North to be more open in  the future.    [Evans] Will it serve the purpose of keeping them committed  in the future to ensure that we at least know there won't be  diversion of nuclear material in the future, or we would be the  trigger which in fact pushes them over the brink to walk away  from the non-proliferation treaty all together.

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Dixons installs new chief at US offshoot DIXONS, the electrical goods retailer, has replaced the head of Silo, its US subsidiary which last month announced mounting losses. Mr Robert Sirkis, who was appointed president in September 1991, has left the company and been replaced by Mr Peter Morris, Dixons group property director. Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman, said Mr Morris was 'a better man for the job. He has a greater knowledge of what we want to do'. Analysts said the appointment suggested Dixons was taking closer control of Silo. Most of the original US senior management has now been replaced and more decisions are being taken in London. Dixons bought Silo in 1987 for Dollars 320m and, as with several other UK retailers in the US, has seen its investment perform poorly. Silo was hit hard by the US recession and last month announced operating losses of Pounds 14.9m in the 28 weeks to November 14. Silo is closing 45 of its 225 stores, which is likely to cost Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.4m), and full year operating losses are likely to exceed last time's Pounds 16.9m. Some analysts do not expect the company to return to profit for several years. 'They are making the effort to sort it out, but long term problems of over eager expansion and poor store location remain,' one said. Mr Morris, 45, joined Dixons in 1988 but is not well known in the industry. He is a member of Dixons retail management group of senior managers, but not of the main board. He has recently spent time in the US overseeing Silo's property review and will take charge of the company's disposal programme, which Mr Kalms described as 'well under way', and store remodelling. Dixons shares gained 3p to 226p.</p>

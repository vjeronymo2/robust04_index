			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: CRT defies downturn in sector with 6% rise CRT, the consultancy, recruitment and training company, defied the downturn in its sector with a 5.6 per cent rise to Pounds 2.61m in pre-tax profits for the six months to October 31. The interims mark the first set of accounts to be released which show CRT - created through the reverse takeover of textile manufacturer Smallshaw in 1989 - in its virtually finished form. Smallshaw's knitwear businesses were sold in the latter part of last year. 'CRT is now actually happening, whereas previously it was a concept,' said Mr Barrie Clark, finance director. In the last two years, the group has paid more than Pounds 20m for seven companies. The pre-tax figure was struck on turnover 7 per cent higher at nearly Pounds 20m, on a pro forma basis, and compared with Pounds 2.47m. During the six months CRT made two acquisitions, Pitman Office Training for Pounds 2.2m, and Doctus, the management consultancy, for a nominal sum. Pitman, which incurred losses last year, had contributed profits of about Pounds 100,000, said Mr Karl Chapman, chief executive. Of the group's three divisions, the decline in general recruitment had been offset by the demand for workers in information technology. 'We are doing as badly as everyone else in general recruitment,' he said. However, the training division - which accounted for50 per cent of sales and 80 per cent of profits - had shown steady progress. Profits were held back by a switch in the method of fee payment to a performance-related basis. This meant CRT's group profits would be more weighted towards the second half, Mr Chapman said, as payments came in when students achieved qualifications. The consultancy side, which was formed from the Doctus acquisition and included for three months, had performed to expectations. Earnings per share rose to 3.47p (3.19p). The interim dividend is raised from 0.5p to 0.575p.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Fall in US drink sales hits GrandMet: International food group keeps its options open on the future of struggling IEL joint venture Shares in Grand Metropolitan, the international drinks and food giant, fell 26p to 457p yesterday as the group disclosed that de-stocking in the US drinks market was likely to cost it Pounds 40m this year. The group also dashed hopes of immediate disentanglement from its struggling Inntrepreneur Estates (IEL) joint venture with Courage, saying only that it was 'studying a range of options'. IEL, Britain's biggest pub operator, broke even in the half compared with a loss of Pounds 12m last year. Group pre-tax profits were up 10 per cent at Pounds 446m, in line with expectations. Mr George Bull, chief executive, said the revival of the US economy had prompted GrandMet's IDV drinks subsidiary to stock up last autumn in the hope of increased sales. In fact, the market had fallen 3 per cent and IDV's sales by 2 per cent. At the same time, IDV had tackled overstocking problems caused by concentration among US drinks wholesalers. 'We decided that now was the moment to grab the nettle,' Mr Bull said. Half the cost had been incurred in the first half, with the balance to come in the second. IDV's worldwide operating profit fell 2 per cent to Pounds 254m, with an 18 per cent rise in North America offset by a 13 per cent fall in the rest of the world. The North American increase was almost wholly due to a one-off payment of around Pounds 17m on the termination of US distribution rights for Absolut vodka. GrandMet said IDV's longer-term prospects were better than at any time in the past decade. 'The market we're selling in has the capacity to double. China and India alone are providing 500m new drinkers who weren't available to us two years ago,' said Mr Bull. Operating profit in food manufacture rose 6 per cent to Pounds 147m, with a 19 per cent increase in North America while Europe fell into a Pounds 3m loss, from Pounds 1m profit. Mr Bull said the improvement in the US was strategically very important. 'We've done a lot of work straightening it out, and it's now starting to pay off.' Profits at the Burger King hamburger chain were up 16 per cent, with 244 new restaurants opened and 5 per cent volume growth in existing outlets. The Pearle opticians chain broke even, after a Pounds 2m loss. GrandMet aimed to return the business to modest profit, then sell it. The tax charge fell from 32.4 per cent to 29.2 per cent. Mr Gerald Corbett, finance director, said restructuring of group borrowings to take advantage of tax losses would cut the tax charge by some Pounds 30m this year and for three or four years thereafter. Lower tax helped earnings per share to rise 15 per cent to 15.0p before exceptionals. The dividend was raised 6.2 per cent to 5.15p. Free cashflow was Pounds 232m (Pounds 95m), due largely to falls in working capital, interest charges and capital expenditure. Net borrowings were Pounds 2.4bn down Pounds 460m. This reduced gearing from 83 per cent to 62 per cent including intangibles. Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman, said funds from cashflow and disposals would be spent on add-on acquisitions in branded food and drink, on which GrandMet had already spent Pounds 350m in the half year.

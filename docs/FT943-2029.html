			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: BM makes Canadian disposal BM Group, the engineering concern, took a further step in the disposal of its Blackwood Hodge interests with the sale of Blackwood Hodge (Canada) in a deal worth Pounds 4.5m. It could raise a further Pounds 2m to Pounds 3m from the sale of assets being retained. The company is being sold for a nominal sum to a consortium including local management and Mr Howard Sutton, who resigned as chief executive last year after announcing higher than expected restructuring costs. The consortium also includes Mr Ronald Strasser a former non-executive director of BM. The deal includes the repayment of intercompany loans of Pounds 1.2m. In addition BM will be relieved of bank borrowings, stock finance and finance leases amounting to Pounds 3.3m. As a result of earlier provisions and taking into account the Canadian company's trading losses, BM said the sale would have a positive impact on net assets. BHC lost Pounds 6.2m (Pounds 4.1m) before tax and exceptionals on turnover of Pounds 49.6m (Pounds 65.2m) for the 1993-94 year.</p>

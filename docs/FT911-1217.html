Mr Thomas Niles, US ambassador to the European Community, is expected to be nominated shortly as the new Assistant Secretary for European and Canadian affairs, in which job he would handle the review of US security relations with Europe. He would take over from Mr Raymond Seitz, who has just become US ambassador to Britain. The 51-year-old Mr Niles is a highly experienced career diplomat, having served in Belgrade, Moscow (twice), at Nato headquarters in Brussels and as ambassador to Canada from 1985 to 1989, when he dealt with the US-Canadian free trade agreement, as well as in various senior positions at the State Department. He has held his present post for the past two years. Mr Niles is to be succeeded in Brussels by Mr James Dobbins, now principal deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of European and Canadian Affairs, who deals with many European issues. Aged 48, he has served in various State Departments posts in the US, Paris, London, and Bonn, where he was deputy chief of mission from 1985 to 1989.</p>

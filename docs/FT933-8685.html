			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / French chief for EBRD likely MR Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Banque de France, is almost certain to be the next president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, after the Italian government yesterday withdrew its support from the Italian candidate, Professor Guiliano Amato. Mr Giuseppe Maresca, the Italian director at the EBRD, said he had received a communication from his government yesterday morning, saying it would no longer be supporting Prof Amato, a former Italian prime minister. Mr Maresca said he had been unable to establish yesterday whether the third candidate, Mr Leszek Balcerowicz of Poland, had decided to continue in the contest. But Mr Maresca said it was almost certain that Mr de Larosiere would be elected. The decision to withdraw Prof Amato had been taken in close consultation with Prof Amato himself. The French Foreign Ministry yesterday welcomed the news. A spokesman said: 'We have no confirmation yet that Mr de Larosiere is the only candidate. But we think he will be elected now.' The announcement marks the end of several weeks of intense political lobbying among the European countries over the successor to Mr Jaques Attali, the former president of the EBRD, who resigned last month after allegations of financial mismanagement and lavish spending. Although Mr de Larosiere had initially been considered the most likely candidate, the decision by the Italian government last month to submit Prof Amato as a nominee threatened to cause an embarrassing diplomatic split among the European governors. However, French diplomatic lobbying, and a desire on the part of the EC officials to present a show of European unity, appear to have forced the Italians to back down. The voting will close on August 18 and the result announced on August 19, or earlier if Mr de Larosiere remains the sole candidate.</p>

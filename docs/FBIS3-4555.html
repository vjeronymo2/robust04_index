			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 27 KYODO -- The Bank of Japan (BOJ) sees  no big impact on the currency market but some market dealers  expect the yen to rise next week after no clear affirmation for  stable rates at the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting, BOJ and  currency market sources said Sunday.    Finance ministers and central bankers of the G-7 leading  nations failed to produce a clear affirmation at their meeting  in Germany Saturday of their past accord on stable currency  rates reflecting economic fundamentals.    "This has been already factored in by the currency market,  and is unlikely to have a big impact on the yen rate," said a  central bank source.    But a market dealer said, "a stronger yen is expected next  week as the U.S. side reiterated its hard-line stance" at a  meeting between Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and  U.S. Secretary Treasury Lloyd Bentsen.    "Speculations over the U.S. guiding the yen higher to solve  the deadlocked issue of trade imbalance is receding," the BOJ  source said. "A wild gyration is unlikely although the G-7  failed to make an accord on stable currency rates."    Fujii reportedly called for reaffirmation of a past G-7  accord favoring stable currency rates reflecting economic  fundamentals, but U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and  other finance ministers said currency issue was not discussed  much at the G-7 meeting.    Bentsen told a press meeting in Germany that Japan must "put  in place a substantial and effective program to strengthen  domestic demand, reduce its large trade surplus and open its  markets."    Meanwhile, the central bank maintained its cautious stance  over a further cut in the official discount rate as Japan's  stimulus action.    Speaking at a press meeting in Germany, BOJ Governor Yasushi  Mieno stressed that the discount rate is at the "record-low  level" of 1.75 percent.    With Japan's long-term rates already turning higher, the BOJ  source said that effects of a discount rate cut on the economy  will be limited.</p>

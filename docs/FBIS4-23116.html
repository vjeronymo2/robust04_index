			<p>SUMMARY                                         Following stern Israeli warnings to the Palestinians, both Israel  and the PLO are apparently seeking to avoid what had appeared to  be an imminent confrontation over the status of Jerusalem during  the interim phase of Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.  Although an immediate crisis has thus probably been averted,  disputes over Jerusalem are likely to arise again as interim  negotiations continue.                                       END SUMMARY     Following press reports, such as that in the 13 June Jerusalem  Post, that PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat had written to Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin agreeing to deescalate a growing Israeli-  Palestinian rhetorical battle over Jerusalem, 'Arafat himself  appeared to moderate PLO rhetoric on the subject.  Addressing a  conference of the Organization of African Unity in Tunis, 'Arafat  charged "some members of the Israeli Government" with creating a  "fabricated storm" over Jerusalem and with "working to impose a  status quo . . . regarding an issue that touches the feelings not  only of the Palestinian people   . . but that of the Arabs,  Muslims, and Christians throughout the world."  Such actions, he  continued, violate both UN and other international resolutions as  well as "stances of the U.S. administration, the European Union,  Russia, China, Japan and others" and are aimed at "weakening the  steps [toward] building trust" between Israelis and Palestinians.  Significantly, however, 'Arafat did not voice his customary claim  to Jerusalem as capital of a future Palestinian state and said  that Palestinians "understand the importance of the religious  position of the holy city for all religions."  After calling on  all parties to "protect these civil, religious, historic and  humanitarian values," he vowed that Palestinians "will not allow  any extremist forces . . . to obstruct or sabotage the peace  process or to alter the character of the holy city" (Egyptian  satellite TV, 13 June).     In contrast to 'Arafat's caution, Nabil Sha'th, a principal  Palestinian negotiator in recent talks with Israel, had made a  point only two days earlier of rejecting reported Israeli  intentions to restrict existing Palestinian institutions in  Jerusalem and of reasserting the Palestinian claim to the city.  While acknowledging that negotiation of Jerusalem's final status  had been deferred, Sha'th said in an interview that Palestinian  institutions in the city "should remain to serve the Palestinian  people in Jerusalem and the other areas of the Palestinian  territories."  Moreover, he added, once final status negotiations  begin, Palestinians "will emphasize that Jerusalem is a city that  was occupied in 1967 and should be liberated when a definitive  solution is reached so that it may be the Palestinian capital of  the independent Palestinian state."  Such a status, he argued,  constitutes "sound implementation of UN Security Council  Resolution 242 and the Declaration of Principles" (Radio Monte  Carlo, 11 May).     Israeli Carrot and Stick     The PLO's apparent tactical retreat on Jerusalem follows both  strong statements from Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, among  other Israeli Government officials, that the government would not  tolerate any Palestinian attempt to establish governing  institutions associated with the Gaza-Jericho accord in Jerusalem  (See Note 1)  and assurances that Israel would not seek to alter  the status of existing Palestinian institutions.  Interviewed by  Israeli television on 9 June, Peres began by emphatically  rejecting Palestinian claims to Jerusalem, which he dismissed as  "mere dreaming."  For good measure, he went on to reject  suggestions that Jerusalem could serve as the dual capital both  of Israel and a future Palestinian entity, saying that "one  cannot have two capitals in one city because that would mean a  division of Jerusalem. . . . the historical capital of Israel and  Israel's capital today."  While pledging that Israel would  maintain open access to all religious institutions, Peres  asserted that "in the political sense, the issue of Jerusalem is  closed."  Turning to alleged Palestinian efforts to create new  political institutions in the city, Peres warned that "the  Palestinian Authority must handle autonomy-related affairs from  Jericho" and that Israel "will not countenance any transfer of  institutions from Jericho to Jerusalem."     (Note 1) As reported by Egypt's official MENA news agency on 3  May, the Gaza-Jericho self-rule agreement between Israel and the  PLO specifies that offices of the Palestinian Authority will be  located in Gaza and Jericho.     Despite his warning, Peres also evidently tried to play down  Israeli press reports (for example, Ma'ariv, 7 June) claiming  that the Israeli Government was preparing tough new legislation  to restrict Palestinian political activity outside the territory  of the autonomy regime.  The government,' he said, is "looking  into the issue" of allegedly prohibited Palestinian political  activity, including "whether additional legislation is called  for."  However, he concluded, "it may very well be that any  deviations from the law may be rectified through the use of  existing legislation and no new laws are necessary."     Background: Rhetorical Battle Over Jerusalem     Despite their agreement in Cairo on 4 May on detailed  arrangements for implementing the Gaza-Jericho accord, Israel and  the Palestinians engaged over the next month in an escalating  verbal battle over Jerusalem, highlighted by a controversial  speech by 'Arafat and the Israeli Government's embarrassing  revelation of a previously denied secret letter containing  assurances regarding the status of Palestinian institutions in  Jerusalem during the interim period.     'Arafat's speech, delivered at a Johannesburg mosque on 10 May,  was evidently intended to reassure Palestinian skeptics that the  compromise agreements with Israel, beginning with the Oslo accord  in September 1993, did not mean any Palestinian concessions on  Jerusalem, but it also stimulated Israeli concerns about the  eventual status of the city and of Palestinian institutions in  it.  In the speech, 'Arafat called for a continued "jihad" to  liberate the city (text appears in Tel Aviv Ha'aretz, 23 May),  although he subsequently attempted to play down his remarks,  claiming he meant a nonviolent campaign (Ool Yisra'el, 18 May).  Even prior to the speech, Israeli political leaders across a  fairly broad political spectrum had begun reasserting their claim  to the city, focusing in particular on the status of Palestinian  quasi-governmental institutions in Jerusalem, such as Orient  House, the de facto mainstream Palestinian headquarters.  For  example:     --Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, a member of the opposition Likud  party and frequent critic of the government's handling of the  peace process, said in an interview that he "would take any step  necessary to curb Palestinian political activity in East  Jerusalem, barring infringement of civil rights" and specified  that he "would close down Orient House" (Tel Aviv Ha'aretz, 6  May).  Deputy Mayor Shmu'el Me'ir went further, charging in an  interview that "the large number of daily terrorist attacks  against Jews [in Jerusalem] are initiated and funded by the PLO  office in Orient House" (Ha'aretz, 13 May).     --According to Qol Yisra'el radio, Rabin reaffirmed during a  reception at Jerusalem's City Hall that under a permanent  arrangement with Palestinians, the city will be "united under  Israeli sovereignty and as Israel's capital" (8 May).  Similarly, Peres said in an interview that Jerusalem's status as  the unified capital of Israel is "absolute and irrevocable" (Qol  Yisra'el, 27 May).     --On 9 May, the Knesset approved a resolution introduced by Likud  leader Binyamin Netanyahu but endorsed by Rabin asserting that  Jerusalem would remain united under Israeli sovereignty and that  Israel would block any effort to change its status (Qol Yisra'el,  10 May).     Israeli media reports and commentary also tended to fuel concern  over the city's status.  For example:     --The independent New Channel 2 television claimed that Israeli  security services had uncovered a PLO plan to transfer a large  part of the Palestinian administrative structure for Gaza and  Jericho to Orient House and cited an unidentified "senior  security source" as saying that "recent PLO attempts to create  facts in Jerusalem have increased beyond belief" (28 May).     --Both the daily Yedi'ot Aharonot on 31 May and the daily  Ha'aretz on 3 June published editorials calling for the closure  of Orient House.     For their part, Palestinians clearly sought, following the  signing of the Gaza-Jericho implementation agreement, to attach a  symbolic aura of sovereignty to their existing institutions in  Jerusalem while claiming that they were adhering to the letter of  the Gaza-Jericho agreement and reiterating longstanding charges  of Israeli bad faith.  For example:     --In a press release on 9 May, Orient House charged Israel with  "continuing to pursue the fait accompli policy toward Arab  Jerusalem by reinforcing a series of measures aimed at enhancing  a growing [Jewish] settlement in the city."  It is "obvious," the  statement claimed, that "the political, social, and cultural  reality that Jerusalem has experienced during 27 years of  occupation affirms the failure of all Israeli attempts to unify  and Judaize Jerusalem."  After denouncing Israel's "unfounded  historic claims" to the city, the statement called for an end to  "unilateral Israeli measures that are liable to prejudice  Palestinian rights" and vowed that Palestinians' "top priority"  in final status talks would be the establishment of Jerusalem as  "the political and historic capital of the future Palestinian  state" (Jerusalem Al-Nahar, 10 May).     --In a statement broadcast by Ool Yisra'el, West Bank Palestinian  leader Faysal al-Husayni said that Palestinians "are fighting a  battle to end the isolation of Jerusalem" from the rest of the  occupied territories and charged that Israel is "trying to open a  new . . . battle against us" (30 May).     --In an interview broadcast with Qol Yisra'el, Sha'th rejected  Israeli complaints about Palestinian political activity at Orient  House.  Distinguishing between Orient House and institutions  directly related to the administration of Gaza and Jericho,  Sha'th noted that Orient House existed prior to the Gaza-Jericho  accord and claimed that Israel had agreed to its continued  operation during the interim period.  Thus, he charged, Israeli  complaints about Orient House constitute "an open violation of  the agreement."  Palestinian agreement to defer negotiations on  the final status of Jerusalem, he argued, "does not at all allow  the Israeli side to behave as if Jerusalem was an annexed city"  (31 May).     --In an interview with the East Jerusalem Palestinian daily Al-  Nahar, al-Husayni said that "the battle of Jerusalem is a  political, diplomatic, economic, social, educational, and  cultural battle" in which Orient House plays an important role.  Israel, he continued, must recognize that Jerusalem is "the  Palestinians' religious, political, economic, and education  capital."  Referring to the "Jerusalem Committee," a Palestinian  body apparently created last January of which al-Husayni is the  head, he said that it "will comprise shadow institutions for all  the other institutions existing in Jerusalem" and will "pursue  things and put pressure to gain Palestinian rights in Jerusalem"  (3 June).     Coming after the month-long Israeli-Palestinian verbal sparring  over Jerusalem, revelation of the long-denied secret Israeli  letter to Palestinians--technically addressed to the Norwegian  foreign minister--appeared to seriously damage the Israeli  Government's credibility and prompted immediate Israeli press  speculation on the existence of other, as yet undisclosed  agreements (for example, Israel TV, 6 June; Yedi'ot Aharonot, 7  and 8 June).  Although the letter consisted of seemingly bland  assurances that Israel would not interfere with existing  Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem (see text in The Jerusalem  Post, 7 June), its repeated references to "Palestinian  institutions" and "East Jerusalem" undoubtedly alarmed Israeli  critics fearful of secret concessions on the city and may have  prompted the government to toughen its stand against even the  appearance of flexibility on the issue.     Implications     The evident wish of both the Israeli Government and the  Palestinian leadership to avoid an early showdown over Jerusalem  demonstrates their mutual desire to continue implementation of  the Gaza-Jericho plan in particular and the peace process in  general.  Nonetheless, they have clearly only deferred, rather  than relieved, their deeply rooted and emotional conflict over  the city.  Moreover, as future negotiations move closer to  fundamental Israeli-Palestinian differences over matters  affecting territory and sovereignty, open disputes over Jerusalem  are almost certain to reemerge, with leaders on both sides caught  between conflicting pressures to preserve the peace process and  defend their rival passionate claims to the city.  Considering  the tortuous negotiations already required simply to agree on the  Gaza-Jericho plan, the early reintroduction of far more  tendentious, fundamental issues such as Jerusalem will likely  place a serious strain on the existing structure of negotiations  and increase pressure on both sides to take up matters currently  consigned to final status talks.

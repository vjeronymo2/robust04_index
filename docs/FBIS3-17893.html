Private P.,  a native of Dagestan, shot a guard and seized a combat vehicle  guarding missiles carrying nuclear warheads. You can imagine  what the terrorist might have done had he reached the positions  where the intercontinental ballistic missiles are held.    The regiment commander had difficulty persuading the soldier  to surrender. Criminal proceedings have been instigated. But  the conclusion is self-evident. Evidently, our valiant  missilemen are having problems in obtaining fresh troops since  unsuitable people are being admitted to secret installations.</p>

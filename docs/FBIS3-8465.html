			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Presidency of the Social Democratic Party of  Bosnia-Herzegovina supports the preliminary agreement on  establishing a federation in the regions of Bosnia-Herzegovina  with a majority Bosniak and Croatian population as a significant  step toward reaching a complete solution to the  Bosnia-Herzegovina issue.    This presupposes creating the possibility and finding a way  to include the Serbian [words indistinct] generally solving the  problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Thus the agreement is very  valuable in terms of the cessation of combat activities and the  establishment of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which are  necessary conditions for making political decisions that would  ensure lasting peace in the region.    We want to point out in particular that we expect on the  basis of the text of the agreement, along with the devising of  more efficient mechanisms and instruments, the full protection  of human rights, the return of the refugees, and the  establishment of a state based on the rule of law.    The agreement requires the active and honest engagement of  all political factors and the creation of a political consensus  to find the best constitutional solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina.    At the same time, the outline of the preliminary agreement  on  establishing a confederation between the Republic of Croatia and  the Federation is a significant step and a serious basis for a  principled normalization of relations with the neighboring  republics, which will at the same time make it possible for  Bosnia-Herzegovina to integrate itself more easily into European  cultural, economic, and political currents.    Therefore, we demand of the Presidency of the Republic of  Bosnia- Herzegovina and the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina the  broadest political consultations and the opportunities for full  participation in creating constitutional solutions, reads the  public statement by the Social Democratic Party of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

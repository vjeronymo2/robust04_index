			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATHLETES  </P> <P> Patricia Loverock's article about science and sport ("The Athlete of the  Future," March 19) provided an incisive overview of the exciting strides taking  place in the world of athletic performance. As the director of physical therapy  and training for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Committee and a professional  trainer, I know that visionaries such as Harmon Brown, Gideon Ariel and Bob  Gregory are literally expanding athletic horizons.  </P> <P> The advantages of scientific study of sport reach beyond the world-class  athlete. Average 10K runners, C-League softball players and senior citizens who  work to keep fit -- even weekend athletes -- can take advantage of  sophisticated techniques, including strength measurement, flexibility analysis  and computerized performance evaluations. In that sense, the athlete of the  future is really today's jogger on the sidewalk.  </P> <P> GAIL WELDON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEAT DESIGN CITED IN SURVIVAL OF MANY IN DC-10 CRASH  </P> <P> While blind luck and fortunate circumstances helped more than 180 passengers  survive the fiery DC-10 crash in Iowa, firmly anchored seats were cited Friday  as an important factor in keeping the death toll lower than initially feared.  </P> <P> A number of experts have said they were astonished at the relatively low death  toll in the crash of United Airlines Flight 232, bound from Denver to Chicago  on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Experts said that many of the survivors lived because their seats remained  fastened to the aircraft floor, sparing them from potentially fatal injuries as  the jetliner crashed into the ground, burst into flames and separated into  three sections.  </P> <P> Most of the passengers injured or killed were thrown out of the airplane and  hurled down the runway, still strapped into their seats, according to David J.  Greco, emergency medical director of Marian Health Care Center in Sioux City.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Massive Injuries  </P> <P> "They looked as if they had been rolling for up to half a mile at high speeds,"  Greco said, noting that many suffered massive head, arm and leg injuries.  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration has proposed a rule -- which must be  approved by the secretary of transportation -- that would require airlines to  install seats with even greater crash resistance by June, 1995.  </P> <P> "Stronger seats are less likely to break out of the seat tracks. If the seats  break out, it's rather devastating," said Henri Branting, manager of the FAA's  technical analysis branch.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if the NTSB (National Transportation  Safety Board) in their final report (on Wednesday's crash) urges the FAA to  expedite the rule," said Nancy Gilmer, coordinator of air safety and health  research for the American Assn. of Flight Attendants.  </P> <P> Currently, aircraft seats are designed to withstand up to nine G-forces, or  nine times the force of gravity. The proposed rule would order installation of  seats capable of withstanding 16 G-forces, said Gilmer, who noted that most  automobile seats can withstand up to 20 G-forces.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Impact  </P> <P> Stronger seats can absorb more impact in a crash, Gilmer said, and they are  less likely to separate from the floor.  </P> <P> United Airlines spokesman Herb Gardner in Chicago said that he could not  discuss the type of seats installed in the DC-10 that crashed Wednesday because  the company has turned all maintenance records over to the NTSB. "I'm certain  the seats comply with current FAA standards," he said.  </P> <P> The DC-10 came down in a cornfield yards short of a runway at Sioux City after  the pilot reported that he had lost all control. The disaster apparently was  caused by an explosion in the plane's tail engine and the subsequent failure of  its hydraulic systems.  </P> <P> Heading into what experts called a "controlled collision" with the runway, the  plane pitched to the right and scraped its right wing. It cartwheeled, breaking  into pieces as it rolled.  </P> <P> Many of the survivors were seated in Rows 9 to 19 in a section of the plane  that landed upside down after the crash. They were able to unbuckle their seat  belts and walk away from the wreckage.  </P> <P> A number of unusual circumstances enabled such a large number of people to  survive, experts said.  </P> <P> Because the aircraft was in a landing position, "it hit in a flat manner," said  Allan Mears of the Flight Safety Foundation. "The clipped wing caused it to  roll, and the impact forces were not tremendous."  </P> <P> The DC-10 broke into three sections: the cockpit, the main body and the tail  end of the plane. "Those (seated) away from the immediate break points probably  had a good chance of surviving," said Wayne Williams of the National  Transportation Safety Assn.  </P> <P> But experts said that there is no predictably safe place to sit on an airplane  since the impact of every crash differs. "There are too many variables in an  accident," said Michael Benson, spokesman for the National Transportation  Safety Board here.  </P> <P> Even though the wings increase the strength of the middle section of a plane,  that area is surrounded by fuel tanks. Flight 232, which had flown for more  than two hours before it crashed, may have used most of its fuel, lessening the  fires that broke out when it crashed.  </P> <P> "Fire, smoke and toxic fumes really kill most people in these crashes, rather  than the crash itself," said Edmund J. Cantilli, executive director of the  Institute for Safety in Transportation.  </P> <P> Fire-resistant seat cushions, required in all airplanes under a 1988 FAA rule,  probably slowed the spread of the fire in the cabin. In the past, seat cushions  made of polyurethane foam spread fire quickly, emitting toxic gases in the  process.  </P></p>

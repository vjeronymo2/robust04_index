			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / ITV proposes to block re-runs by rival broadcasters THE NEW ITV network plans to buy rights to programmes for up to 15 years to keep them out of the hands of rival broadcasters. Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV Association and chief executive of London Weekend Television, said yesterday that ITV wanted to buy the right to show a programme three times over 10 years. There would also be an option for a further five years. 'What we are trying to do is defend ITV and not find its programmes used against it,' Mr Dyke said. He was speaking as ITV published the details of the new centralised ITV network and the proposed contracts that will govern programme commissioning and purchase in the future. The new policy on buying rights is expected to be investigated by the Office of Fair Trading in addition to its general responsibility under broadcasting legislation to ensure the network arrangements are open and fair. Mr Dyke said the ITV companies did not want to fall into the trap of networks in the US, where re-runs of their old programmes shown by independent stations and on cable television had eaten into audience share. The ITV move to control rights and often keep programmes on the shelf for years will undermine hopes that a secondary market will develop in the UK for the rights to programmes already shown once on national commercial television. The strategy will prove controversial with independent producers, who want to keep as many of the secondary rights in programmes as possible to sell in other markets. Mr Dyke said yesterday ITV would if necessary be prepared to pay more to guarantee full rights to programmes, and added that it was very much a buyers' market for programmes. ITV might end up 'buying less or not buying at all' from producers who did not want to sell 10-year rights. If approved by the OFT, the new policy, which would take effect from September next year, might have a significant effect on Channel 4, which has scored significant ratings successes with repeats of popular ITV programmes such as the detective series Inspector Morse. In future, the ITV network will be put together by a centralised system run by a chief executive and a network director, who will be spending an annual programme budget of about Pounds 500m.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Where dribbling is child's play - Peter Berlin in New York on the next generation of soccer fans and the star players they idolise Soccer in the US is the world's largest child-minding service. The US Soccer Federation claims 16m registered players - more than any other Fifa member - of whom most are children. At World Cup games, middle-aged middle Americans are a common sight. Almost always they are being led through colourful crowds by an excited child wearing a T-shirt commemorating his or her participation in some age-group soccer tournament. Fifa and the World Cup organisers have played the child card ruthlessly. The ceremonies at each stadium consist largely of poorly-drilled hordes of children, clad in youth-league kit, parading round the ground holding flags and balloons. Before each game, half-a-dozen children carry the yellow 'Fair Play Please' banner on to the field to the tune of the Fifa anthem. There is calculated naivety in this, as anyone who can recall their childhood soccer - or who has watched children playing unsupervised - will know. Park or playground 'rules' are highly negotiable. Touchlines and goal-lines are elastic. Goalkeepers change without warning. Games often end in heated, perhaps violent debate over some foul. Yet one thing children rarely do is kick each other. And suddenly the professionals are kicking each other much less often, too - not in the interests of fair play but because referees have been punishing them. The World Cup record for yellow cards, 163, set in Italy four years ago, was broken last Saturday, the mid-way point. By Tuesday the total was 198 after 44 matches. Sendings-off are rising - five in the last three second-round games - leaving matches with the unbalanced look of park games, where sides always seem to be picked from an odd number of players. There is another influence at work. The heat has sapped the professionals' stamina. Last Saturday's game between Saudi Arabia and Sweden, in blazing afternoon Dallas, resembled a three-hour game between 11-year-olds in a hot summer park. The impression that this was a children's game was heightened by the way the Saudis play. The Swedes are typical products of western European professional soccer - scouted by clubs in their teens or earlier; coached from an early age; accustomed from youth to playing in organised leagues. They have been taught to forget what every child knows about soccer. With the exception of Tomas Brolin and, once, Kennet Andersson, the Swedes knew better than to dribble the ball past opponents. They know that if they dribble they will be kicked, or might lose the ball - the cardinal sin - and have no-one to blame. How much easier not to take chances. But the Saudis took risks. Time and again Saeed Owairan tried to unpick the Swedish defence, as he had Belgium's, with mazy dribbling. Hamzah Falatah tormented the full-backs with feints and dummies. Finally, Fahad Al-Ghashiyan scored the goal his team deserved with a move straight from the park. Where most European pros, wide by the goal-line and confronted by a defender, have turned and rolled the ball back down the wing to a supporting player, Fahad Al-Ghashiyan did what any child unworried by failure, unwilling to surrender the precious ball, eager to show off, would have tried. He ran at his man, beat him and banged home a goal. This childlike quality, not to be confused with innocence or under-development, has not been totally expunged from European soccer. Jason McAteer, at 24 one of the babes of the Irish squad, started the season unsure of a regular place at Bolton Wanderers, a lowly English first division team. He ended it by playing in the World Cup, chasing Franco Baresi round Giants Stadium. McAteer was a breath of fresh air, trying to dribble at Paolo Maldini or flick the ball over Frank Rijkaard's head. The Saudis do not just dribble. They also take evident pleasure in the feel of the ball. Each pass was delivered with an unnecessary but attractive flourish; each pass received with a little juggle of joy. One of the delights of this tournament has been the reminder that the range of soccer possibilities is a wide one. The Asian and African teams, Brazil, Mexico and Colombia, have all solved the simple problems of soccer in distinct ways. They kick and trap the ball differently. Their formations are different. In familiar situations they produce unfamiliar passes, or dribble when they should not. But dribbling takes courage, flamboyance and close-ball skills. Children in playgrounds and parks all over Europe will try to emulate them, just as they always try to emulate players who bring the most childlike qualities into play. This is why Ryan Giggs, Manchester United's child-faced dribbler, is the hottest commercial property in English soccer. It is why the most interesting players in this World Cup are those who remain recognisably children playing a children's game, such as baby-faced Gary Kelly, the Irish full-back, who insisted on dribbling out of defence, risking all for a chance to display his pace and skill. There is Marc Overmars, the tiny Dutch winger, one of several examples of the success of the Dutch system in nurturing a youngster's love of the dribble. There is pudgy Tomas Brolin of Sweden and Sergi, the dribbling Spaniard. Nigeria fielded an entire team composed of players barely out of their teens. There is Romario of Brazil, refusing to pass to team-mates in better positions, abandoning his position to drop back to mid-field because he wants more of the ball, refusing to acknowledge team-mates who create scoring chances for him, yet somehow much more interesting than the equally talented, nicer, more mature Bebeto. There was always a Gheorghe Hagi in the parks of my childhood. Hagi is the best boy on the field, and knows it. He often expects the other Romanians to do the things he does not like: running, defending, tackling. His effort in the second half against Switzerland was that of a sulking child. For all his talent he is simply too unappealing to inspire imitators. And then there is the greatest child-genius of all: Diego Maradona, who carried the hopes of Argentina from his early teens, a player deprived of a childhood, except that his whole life has been a childhood. After his drugs-bust he blamed other people - adults - for his downfall. Children, as adults often forget, can be clear-eyed and forgiving in judging fallen heroes. If you go down to the park today, among the children imitating Saeed Owairan's dribbles, Martin Dahlin's flying headers, Romario's shooting and the Cameroonian goal wiggle, there will be others trying to emulate Maradona's goal against Greece and his screaming, eye-bulging, celebratory run at the camera afterwards. Maradona. A child playing a child's game without a child-minder. It shouldn't have been allowed.</p>

By the end of last year the number of nongovernmental  cultural and art troupes in Beijing exceeded 20.    The nongovernmental troupes are run by diverse entities,  ranging from state industrial enterprises, institutions,  collective troupes and individual actors and actresses.    Such cultural and art troupes, staffed by 30 to 60 people  each, specialize in different art forms, such as music, dance,  opera and folk arts.    Three of the major enterprises that manage cultural and art  troupes of their own are the Capital Iron and Steel Corporation,  Beijing Yanshan Petrochemicals Corporation and Beijing  International Art and Literature, a culture and art-oriented  enterprise.    Such enterprise-run cultural and art troupes, known for  their  flexible management system, have appeal for graduates of art  schools as well as noted actors and actresses such as Hu  Xiaoqin, Yang Jiuhong and Zhang Zhenfu.    The new types of cultural and art troupes, by exercising  self-autonomy, have cut to the minimum red tape and rigidity in  management, which plague government-run cultural and art troupes.    Meanwhile there has emerged a surge of marriages between  enterprises and cultural and art troupes, the two parties  sharing equally profits and losses.    An official from the local culture bureau said that that the  public-run cultural and art troupes have ended the state  monopoly in this sphere and will help enrich the cultural life  of the capital, as the practice better taps the initiative and  creativeness of the public.    But he also said that the overall artistic level of the  nongovernmental cultural and art troupes is still inferior to  that of those run by the government.</p>

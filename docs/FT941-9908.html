			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar crop estimate reduced ED &amp; F. Man, the London commodities trading company has cut its estimate of this year's world sugar crop by 1.6m tonnes to 110.8m. Its latest report on the market outlook puts consumption at 113.3m tonnes, leaving a deficit of 2.5m tonnes. The sugar crops in Thailand, Cuba, India and South Africa have failed to recover fully from last season's reduced output. In addition, shortfalls have emerged in China, Argentina and Mauritius. New York sugar prices have remained at about 11 cents a pound, however, reflecting uncertainty about the prospects for demand. Flat consumption in east and central Europe and rumoured changes to the Russian import tariffs for sugar have had a dampening effect on prices. Meanwhile, the Economist Intelligence Unit says improved prospects for most soft commodities are holding, though the impact of adverse weather in North America on grains and oilseeds is fading. In the February issue of its World Commodity Forecast, the EIU says it sees little prospect of physical demand for metals picking up this year but that demand from futures markets has been booming.</p>

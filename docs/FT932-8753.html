			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Salinas moves to make bank independent PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas of Mexico has sent Congress a constitutional amendment to make the central bank independent and give it a mandate to preserve price stability. The move to make the central bank independent follows similar steps by Chile in 1989 and more recently by Venezuela, and to a lesser extent by Colombia and Argentina. The amendment, sure to be passed by Congress, is intended to institutionalise a commitment to low inflation after Mr Salinas's term of office ends next year. While inflation is now down to 10.4 per cent, it peaked in the mid-1980s at an annual 157 per cent. 'This is a way of anchoring the current monetary policies that have worked so well in reducing inflation and ensuring the central bank is not subject to changes in the political mood,' said a government official. The head and other board members of the central bank would be chosen for a fixed term by the president and approved by the Senate. They could be removed only for a serious breach of duty, and would be selected on a staggered basis, ensuring one president could not pack the bank with his nominees. The bank will be mandated to 'preserve the purchasing power of the national currency' and given full control over management of its credit. In a country where the president is used to exercising untrammelled power, it is unclear how much effective independence the central bank will be allowed to enjoy, if conflict arises with the government. While the central bank alone will decide the discount rate at which it lends money to the financial sector, other interest rates and exchange rate policy will be decided between the federal government and the central bank, says Mr Guillermo Ortiz, under-minister of finance. The president's office said central bank independence would act as a counterweight to government agencies intent on pursuing policies that cause inflation. It would also persuade the private sector that increases in costs or prices will not be accommodated by a loose monetary policy. The amendment parallels other initiatives by Mr Salinas to lock in economic reforms beyond the life of his administration. It may strengthen the argument that current market-oriented policies are 'irreversible' and lessen uncertainty stemming from the North American Free Trade Agreement with the US and Canada, and from the Mexican presidential succession next year.</p>

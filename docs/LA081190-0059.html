			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIRL, 7, RECANTS; D.A. CALLS OFF ABUSE PROBE OF FOSTER FATHER  </P> <P> Three weeks after an administrative law judge ruled that a Whittier man had  sexually molested his 7-year-old foster daughter, authorities have decided not  to press criminal charges, saying the child has recanted her allegation.  </P> <P> The decision is another twist in the long-running investigation of Steve and  Becky Brown, who lost their foster care license July 17 after Administrative  Law Judge Ralph B. Dash found that Steve Brown had had sexual intercourse with  the girl and that his wife was aware of it.  </P> <P> The Browns declined comment Friday, citing a gag order imposed by a judge in  May. However, they have maintained their innocence throughout the criminal  investigation and the revocation of their license.  </P> <P> According to Whittier Police Detective William Heckel, the girl changed her  statements Friday while he and Linda Chilstrom, a lawyer with the district  attorney's office, interviewed her. Heckel said he is convinced that the child  has been molested but it is uncertain by whom. She was reinterviewed to prepare  the filing of a criminal case.  </P> <P> Instead of implicating Steve Brown as she had in the past, Heckel said, the  child told them she had been molested in a Los Angeles motel while she was  visiting her natural mother. Heckel said her statements point to a friend or  friends of the mother, but the child provided first names only and there are no  suspects.  </P> <P> Asked about the administrative law judge's finding against the Browns, Heckel  said: "I know what he found, but what can I do? How do I prove that with the  statements that I have? We asked her about (her testimony during the  administrative hearing) and she said she was scared to say anything else. Now  whether she's telling the truth to us, I don't know."  </P> <P> However, the child's lawyer, Linda Pate, said the girl has been consistent in  her statements for the last five months. She said it is not uncommon for child  sexual abuse victims to recant their stories, particularly if they feel  threatened or are in unfamiliar settings.  </P> <P> Pate blamed the district attorney's office for interviewing the girl alone in  an office instead of in a place where she felt comfortable. Pate said that she  had suggested the South-Central Los Angeles Regional Center -- a private  nonprofit agency where the girl initially implicated Steve Brown -- but that  authorities refused to conduct the interview there.  </P> <P> "This child is severely damaged," Pate said. "She's been totally consistent and  if the (district attorney) wants to get a good statement from the child they  ought to have the decency to interview a child in an environment where she  feels secure."  </P> <P> Pate said she will press forward with a civil lawsuit against the Browns. The  suit seeks damages for the alleged sexual abuse.  </P> <P> Whether the Browns will regain their foster care license remains unclear. State  officials who handled the case could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> The investigation began in February, 1989, when the 7-year-old and her three  sisters were removed from the Browns' home after medical examinations indicated  that three of them had been sexually molested. Both the Browns and the natural  family of the children were suspected, but no one was charged and the Browns  continued to operate their foster home.  </P> <P> Steve Brown passed a polygraph test, and Whittier police concluded that the  children had been molested in Los Angeles while with their relatives. But Los  Angeles police concluded that the girls were molested at the foster home.  </P> <P> A Juvenile Court judge later allowed the Browns unmonitored visits with the  youngest girl -- a move that angered state officials, who complained that the  child, who also showed signs of having been molested, should not have had  contact with suspected abusers.  </P></p>

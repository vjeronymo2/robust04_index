			<p>BFN     [Text] The Joint Standing Committee on Finance has  questioned the government's assurance that the 5 percent levy on  incomes over 50,000 rands a year will be a once-off deduction.    The minister of finance, Mr. Derek Keys, announced in his  budget speech that the levy would be used to cover the costs of  the Transitional Executive Council and the Independent Electoral  Commission. However, Mr. Ken Andrew of the Democratic Party  pointed out that next year's municipal elections would probably  cost more than the national and provincial elections. The  possibility of a referendum in certain provinces could also  [not] be excluded.    Earlier, Mr. Keys named the members of the commission that  is  to review South Africa's tax structure and make recommendations  on improving it. The commission will be headed by Professor  Michael Katz, who also heads the Tax Advisory Committee. Other  members are Professor Dennis Davis, Dr. J. de Villiers Graaff,  Mr. P. du Toit, Professor P. More, and Miss (D. Moktatle), and  Mr. J. Njeke. Mr. Keys announced the formation of the  commission in making his budget speech yesterday.    The commission will examine personal income tax, corporate  tax, VAT [value-added tax] and the income of the tax system on  small business, savings, investment, foreign finance, and  collection. Mr. Keys told this Joint Standing Committee on  Finance that it was in South Africa's best interest to continue  the Mossgas [Mossel Bay Gas] project. He said that not only did  the state have major investments in the project but it also  created job opportunities and was responsible for savings in  foreign exchange.    Mr. Billy Nair of the ANC noted that the government had  spent  about 3,000 million rands on the project last year and that the  work on the project was so specialized that it did not  contribute significantly to creating job opportunities. He  called for a viability study of the project.</p>

There were 267 deputies at the  morning session. Following a short debate, they began to  discuss certain articles of the Constitution as well as  amendments and supplements. Deputies' questions were answered  by republic's Attorney General Vasil Shaladonaw.    After a short break, the parliament resumed its work.  However, it turned out that the number of people's deputies  significantly dropped after the break. Due to this, the session  was adjourned until 15 March.</p>

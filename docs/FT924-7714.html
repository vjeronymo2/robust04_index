			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Revising views on the D-Mark THE DOLLAR fell nearly 3 pfennigs against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday as the market took the view that short-term German interest rates will be reduced more slowly than had been anticipated, writes James Blitz. In recent weeks, the market has ben divided over whether the dollar can rise above DM1.60 against the D-Mark this year. At the start of this week, the US currency had risen nearly 22 pfennigs since plummeting to its all-time low on September 2nd. A strong retraction was inevitable in the wake of this move, as dealers took profits. But, dealers are radically revising the belief that the Bundesbank is set to ease monetary policy, in spite of the worst recession in a decade. Last week, Bundesbank officials made strong warning noises on inflation. On Wednesday, they carried out a net drain in the German market, firming interest rates. And yesterday, a surprisingly strong figure for western German retail sales, up 3.2 per cent in September, increased speculation that the German central bank can postpone a rate cut until the new year. This pushed the dollar down to a low of DM1.5625, nearly 3 pfennigs below Thursday's closing level. The dollar later closed at DM1.5660, down DM2.20 on the day. Ironically, the dollar weakened despite surprisingly good economic indicators in the US. October retail sales, for example, rose 0.9 per cent against forecasts of 0.6 per cent. These figures were partly swamped by the D-Mark's indigenous strength, as seen in the D-Mark's surge against the yen, to a close of Y79.08 from Y78.10. But signs of economic recovery in the US may actually be negative for the dollar because they give President-elect Bill Clinton an excuse to reduce the size of the promised fiscal stimulus. This, in turn, would give the Federal Reserve less reason to tighten short-term interest rates next year. As one UK-based fund manager put it: 'Mr Clinton is an 'option' that the currency markets have bought, and signs of economic growth give dealers a reason to sell it.' In this environment, sterling's stronger performance against the D-Mark was a puzzle. The pound rallied on the back of Thursday's smaller-than-expected rate cut of 1 percentage point. The market also remains short of sterling after the intense selling of September. The pound closed nearly 2 pfennigs above its opening level in London, at DM2.4280, and more than 2 1/2 cents against its London opening against the dollar at Dollars 1.5500.</p>

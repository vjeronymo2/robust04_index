			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CALCZYNSKI TO OPEN DEFENSE OF NASCAR TOUR TITLE AT SAUGUS  </P> <P> The Dodgers, the Lakers, the 49ers, Roman Calczynski -- all will be trying this  year to repeat as champions.  </P> <P> Most fans probably would admit that all are bucking the odds. Even Calczynski,  a 37-year-old stock car driver from Sepulveda, acknowledges the difficulty of  the task before him.  </P> <P> "There are not too many repeat winners in anything," Calczynski said.  </P> <P> Which makes Calczynski the driver to watch as the NASCAR All-American Challenge  Series Southwest Tour kicks off its fourth season at 7 tonight with the Miller  125 at Saugus Speedway.  </P> <P> Calczynski, who is rapidly becoming the tour's Mike Tyson, Wayne Gretzky and  Joe Montana -- all rolled into one and stuffed inside a stock car -- won the  tour championship last season after two runner-up finishes.  </P> <P> Calczynski posted three victories and 12 top-five finishes, setting tour  single-season ($35,501) and career ($72,115) earnings records, on his way to  the title.  </P> <P> Yet, he is as humble as the 24 Hours of Le Mans is long.  </P> <P> "I don't really know what to say," Calczynski said, "except that the way the  competition is, it's awful hard to win this thing."  </P> <P> The tour, which will include a second race at Saugus on Sept. 9, consists of 20  events on 12 tracks in California, Arizona and Nevada. It concludes Nov. 4 with  the AC-Delco 300 at Phoenix International Raceway.  </P> <P> Calczynski's toughest competitors also will be back on track. Troy Beebe of  Modesto, who battled for the lead throughout the season before finishing  second, tied Calczynski with a tour-high three victories last year.  </P> <P> Mike Chase of Bakersfield, tour champion in 1987 and the tour's career leader  with 10 wins, finished third and will be back, as will Ron Hornaday Jr. of  Palmdale and Ken Pedersen of Sausalito, who finished third and fourth,  respectively. Hornaday and Pedersen battled for rookie-of-the-year honors with  Pedersen eventually claiming the award.  </P> <P> Loran Kelley (sixth) of Vacaville and Ray Hooper Jr. of Palmdale (seventh)  round out the top seven returnees.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of tough competition," Calczynski said. "Two second-place  finishes and one first -- that speaks pretty highly of the crew I have. It's  the same one we've had for three years. We should be pretty well intact."  </P> <P> Calczynski is no stranger to Saugus, which is celebrating its 50th season. A  regular at the one-third-mile oval from 1979-83, Calczynski posted  championships in Street Stock, Sportsman and Modified divisions, the only  three-division champion in track history.  </P> <P> Calczynski has won three of the past four Southwest Tour races at Saugus, where  the tour begins for the fourth consecutive year.  </P> <P> "It's my home track," Calczynski said, "so maybe I have a little bit of an  advantage."  </P> <P> NASCAR promoter Owen Kearns Jr. gives Calczynski a decided edge entering the  tour.  </P> <P> "But you never can tell what's going to happen," Kearns said. "You can't  control the variables."  </P> <P> Calczynski fell victim to variables last season at Silver State Raceway in  South Lake Tahoe. Leading the pack with 11 laps to go, his engine blew, forcing  him from the race.  </P> <P> Beebe held a late lead at Phoenix International Raceway when a car spun into  him and knocked him out of the race. Kelley fell victim to five flat tires  during the season.  </P> <P> Tires, Calczynski said, might be the determining variable tonight. Ordinarily a  100-lap race, tonight's 125-lap event might boil down to whose tires boil  first.  </P> <P> "You've got to get the guy in front of you to burn up his," Calczynski said,  "by staying on his butt. Brakes and tires -- whoever has the best. You'll have  to be a little smarter on the tire selection and change the car accordingly."  </P></p>

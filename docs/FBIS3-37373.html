Shenin is accused of state treason. Together with Valentin  Varennikov and Oleg Baklanov he visited on August 18 the then  Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev at his summer cottage in  Foros (the Crimea).    Shenin said Gorbachev warmly welcomed their arrival and  their  talk lasted 45-50 minutes in a friendly atmosphere. Shenin  emphasized that Gorbachev was aware of the difficulty the  country was in and the fact that the signing of the Union treaty  would cause the country's disintegration.    Shenin said that after the conversation the president  approved the introduction of the state of emergency in the  country, though he said that the decision should be taken by  parliament or the Congress of People's Deputies.    Shenin said that in the presence of other plotters,  Gorbachev  began to write the message to parliament. However, he gave up  the idea because he did not want to leave written evidence that  he shared the idea of imposing a state of emergency.    Answering the questions put by the prosecution, Shenin said  that no ultimatums were issued to Gorbachev and that the  plotters treated him as the president.    According to Shenin, on August 18, 1991, Gorbachev declined  Baklanov's proposal to return to Moscow together with the  plotters saying he was not well. He claims Gorbachev had done  this deliberately wait and see how the situation would develop.    Answering the prosecution's questions on the alleged  blockade  at Gorbachev's dacha, Shenin said that the president was free to  do what he pleased.    Shenin's interrogation will be continued Wednesday, February  16, at 10 A.M.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gerardo Tena] </F>   [Text] Altamirano, Mexico, 4 Jan (AFP) -- AFP has  confirmed that the forces of the Zapatista National Liberation  Army (EZLN) started to partially retreat to the mountains early  today, but the Mexican Army has not yet entered the towns that  the rebels have evacuated.    Reporters who managed to cross roadblocks erected about 18  km  from Ocosingo have said that there are still clashes in that  town. The Army surrounded it while EZLN members were barricaded  in several houses.    They added that several dead are lying in the streets and  injured people are seeking refuge.    The rebels retreated, taking the injured with them, between  a  place known as Rancho Nuevo, about 15 km east of San Cristobal,  and the town of Altamirano, near Ocosingo.    Residents of Oxchuc and Altamirano are nervous and afraid  that the EZLN will return, because there is no Army presence  there.    Several residents have assured the media that combatants  from  El Salvador and Guatemala are among the rebel ranks. "We have  noticed the way they talk and their strong bodies, and there are  no people like that here," a peasant said.    In Oxchuc, 60 km from San Cristobal, angry residents have  managed to capture six rebels, beat them up, tie up their feet  and hands, and take them to the town's main kiosk to turn them  over to the Mexican Army.    The captured, injured by the crowd's beatings, told the  media  that they are EZLN members and came to Oxchuc to pick up some  companeros.    Jose Perez Mendez, a 24-year-old peasant whose face was  bloodstained, said that he has been a member of the subversive  movement for the past three years, because "the government has  paid us no attention" and denied that combatants from other  countries are among his companeros.    The neighbors shouted in the Tzeltal language that they did  not want the guerrillas, according to Juan Santis, who said they  were angry because the rebels stole their vehicles, burned and  destroyed municipal offices, and kidnapped the assistant town  councillor, a policeman, and two other civilians, whom they used  as their drivers.    According to a detainee, the 200 residents who had scrambled  into the kiosk were saying in Tzeltal that they wanted the  guerrillas killed.    Altamirano, which the EZLN has called "the first liberated  town," the municipal palace of which was partially destroyed,  was abandoned between Monday night and Tuesday morning after the  guerrillas fled into the nearby mountains.    On Monday night "some 10 individuals arrived to take away  six  injured relatives, one of them in serious condition, in a  freight truck," bound for an unknown site, according to an  official at a hospital run by nuns from the Order of the  Daughters of Charity. The injured rebels, all with bullet  wounds, need treatment by doctors and medicines, but they did  not take anything from the hospital, the official said.    Neighbors gathered around the journalists in the town square  to ask them to tell the authorities that they have no means of  communications and that the Mexican Army should be deployed  there to protect the lives of the civilian population.    On the road leading from Altamirano to San Cristobal, dozens  of Tzeltal Indian peasants could be seen leaving their villages,  but rebels were not seen as in previous days. The Army, whose  presence is demanded by the residents, was not to be seen either.</p>

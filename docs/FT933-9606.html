			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Arts: Isadora's Day - Dance Isadora] The first name is enough, and she haunts us still. Whatever Isadora Duncan was in her life - free soul and freed body, the inspirational dancer of her great years or the sagging relic of the last days in Nice - she reverberates through the artistic consciousness of our century as have few other women. Extraordinarily, for a dancer whose legacy to us is no more than a frayed reputation and some glorious photographic images, Isadora still inspires, is still emulated. So, on Wednesday, the Royal Festival Hall's jolly Ballroom Blitz season (all kinds of dance for all kinds of people) held a Duncan Day. There were videos, classes, a performance of dances from Gluck's Orfeo (some ascribed to Duncan, others made in what is believed to be her style) by performers from Moscow, Paris and London, to indicate the continuing and persistent image of that heroic figure whom we see caught between the portals of the Parthenon by Edward Steichen's camera. Today Duncan's life matters less - typical of her as it was in its enthusiasms and impracticalities - than the idea of what she did. Gordon Craig, father of one of her children, told of the excitement of her presence. 'She was speaking her own language . . . and she was telling to the air the very things we longed to hear and until she came we never dreamed we should hear; and now we heard them, and this sent us all into an unusual state of joy.' This image of the ecstatic dancer, immeasurably beautiful in her message, is what her public and her pupils treasured, and it is one we treasure still. No film exists of Duncan. We know her through legend, through myriad drawings, through Steichen's and Steiglitz's photographs. 'Duncanism', as a way of movement, was perpetuated after her death by pupils, but little of what I have seen of reconstructions has persuaded me that this could inspire artists and thrill audiences as did Duncan's every move. Probably the best indications of Duncan's manner came from Ashton's Brahms' Waltzes for Lynn Seymour, where dancer and dance beautifully imagined her presence; from Vivienne Pickle's astonishing impersonation in Ken Russell's television study; and from the joint performances of Merle Park and Mary Miller in MacMillan's Isadora. What we sensed in these homages was the intoxication of Duncan's movement, and its communicative grace and power. Wednesday's dutiful exposition by dancers and pupils from the Moscow School of Music and Movement, and the London-based Isadora Duncan Dance Group, was something altogether more sober-sided - not a quality one would associate with Duncan. At its best, in Orfeo's two Laments and the Dance of the Blessed Spirits, the dance had a simplicity and a gestural clarity (arms slowly raised, bodies held in sculptural poses) that touchingly told of Duncan's worship of the antique. Other sequences were too innocent in means, and what was proposed as Duncan's own dances for the Furies did no service to her memory or to Gluck. Yet Isadora still speaks to dancers, be it in spirit messages - which these dances really were - or as educational example. The Duncan Dance Group plainly reveres her example. A Moscow Duncan Academy existed until 1946. (Duncan went to Russia in 1921 to teach the children of its new society to dance.) The Moscow performers are from a school lately founded to provide training inspired by Duncan's ideals. Edward Gordon Craig said that Duncan's dancing was 'Something uttered on the divine theme'. We can do worse for the young than show them this.</p>

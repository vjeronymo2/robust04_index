			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: EuroDollar priced at 220p Shares in EuroDollar, the UK's second largest car hire group which is coming to market via a placing and public offer, were priced yesterday at 220p, valuing the group at Pounds 107.9m. EuroDollar, the subject of a management buy-out from TSB last year, had originally planned to issue its prospectus and pricing details on Wednesday. However, the group postponed the flotation in the wake of turbulent market conditions earlier in the week in order to continue book-building. The group, which has a UK fleet of about 12,000 vehicles and operates from 107 branches across the country, claimed a 10 per cent share of the fragmented Pounds 583m domestic car hire market last year. EuroDollar has specialised in the business rental market and 77 per cent of its UK rental income comes from corporate customers. In the year to March 31, the group reported pre-tax profits from continuing operations of Pounds 12.6m on turnover of Pounds 72.8m. The issue, which is sponsored and fully underwritten by Schroders, comprises 22.7m shares of which 18.3m are being issued by the company with the remainder sold by existing shareholders. The offer will raise about Pounds 37.7m net of expenses, which will be used to fund the redemption of the outstanding preference share capital, held by the institutional investors who participated in the buy-out. Of the total, some 17m shares have been placed with institutional and other investors and the remaining 5.68m are being offered for sale to the public. Following the flotation, institutional shareholders will hold about 14.9m shares (30.5 per cent) and the group's directors will hold 6.98m shares, representing a 14.2 per cent stake. Yesterday Mr Ian Mosley, chief executive, said he was pleased with the price which was broadly in line with expectations. He said the issue had received good support from 'in excess of 50 institutions'. SG Warburg Securities is broker to the offer and share dealings are due to begin on July 8.</p>

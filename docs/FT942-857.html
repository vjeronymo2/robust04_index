			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (10): Opportunity for the peasants - Recent agricultural reforms are full of promise For the first time after seven decades of gross mismanagement by Communists who put Russian agriculture on its knees, Russian peasants are finally being given the chance to put things right themselves. A new reform programme introduced in the Nizhny-Novgorod province and decreed a blueprint for the whole of Russia, is based on the premise of Mr Boris Nemtsov, the local governor, that 'the Russian people are a lot cleverer than the country's leadership gives them credit for'. A clear system for collective and state farms to reorganise into more efficient private units is so simple and so promising that it prompts questions as to why Russia's rulers have come up with it only now, and only after the intervention of foreigners. But although he has been accused of bowing to foreign 'imperialism', Mr Nemtsov has nothing but praise for the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private investment arm, which developed the plan together with Russian agricultural experts. 'The foreigners did what Russians couldn't do. They carried an idea through to its logical conclusion,' says this energetic 34-year-old chief of a province often described as a laboratory for economic reform. 'In Russia, we have lots of ideas but little capacity to see them through.' Another reason for the failure of previous attempts at reform has been a fierce ideological debate over private land ownership. Since the collapse of Communism, agriculture has been held hostage to battles between radicals seeking to break up state and collective farms, and conservatives who oppose private property and call for more subsidies. Farm subsidies pushed through by the country's powerful agrarian lobby consume up to 10 per cent of national budget expenditure. Although agriculture has recorded a much milder drop in output than industry - and Russia has even begun cutting back grain imports - prices remain high, quality poor, and distribution uneven. Farmers are unable to use their land as collateral for bank loans to develop. A poorly-developed trade infrastructure and a backward, over-monopolised food-processing industry mean waste, high costs, and a raw deal for Russian consumers. Even when peasants manage to bypass middlemen and take their produce directly to town, they usually have to pay protection money to racketeers. A middle course followed by Mr Boris Yeltsin since his election as president three years ago sought to encourage the development of a new class of private farmers without forcing the break-up of collective and state farms. This meant that some city dwellers and peasants were able to obtain land from state reserves and existing collective and state farms. With generous injections of cheap credit, up to 300,000 private farms appeared around the Russian countryside. But old state and collective farms, ordered to 'reorganise' without instructions on how this should be done, remained basically unchanged: costly to maintain and no more efficient than before. President Yeltsin, having dissolved the conservative parliament last autumn, sought to adopt a more active land reform policy and issued a decree overturning a five to 10-year moratorium on the resale of land imposed by the old parliament. In a December referendum - the results of which have since been queried but not reversed - he pushed through a new constitution laying down private property as an inalienable right. At the same time, however, prospects for further reform appeared to receive a setback when December elections also returned a parliament dominated by ultra-nationalists, and neo-communists. A newly-reshuffled government, shorn of radicals, promptly announced protectionist import tariffs, new subsidies for agriculture, and old-style output targets specifying, for example, that Russia should produce 39bn eggs this year. But the government's lack of a coherent strategy for agricultural reform had Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin embracing the Nizhny-Novgorod project as a model for the whole of Russia last March. The government has since drawn up instructions spelling out how local authorities in other provinces can reproduce the scheme. Moscow also says it is about to submit to parliament a land code, setting out the ground rules for a land market. Relying on the greed of peasants rather than compulsion from on high, the Nizhny-Novgorod scheme is strictly voluntary. The scheme, bowing to peasants' suspicions of outsiders, for the time being restricts the distribution, and subsequent re-sale, of agricultural land to local farmers. These two elements make the programme much more difficult to challenge politically. The programme also differs crucially from Russia's initial system of encouraging individual farmers because it does not rely on the good will of local bureaucrats or collective farm chiefs. Once a farm has opted to reorganise, each worker gets a property entitlement certificate whose value is calculated according to an individual's length of service. Before equipment, stocks and land are auctioned off, farmers wishing to work together in a private partnership have an opportunity to pool their entitlements together and bid jointly for selected tractors and land. This means that rather than systematically breaking up farms into inefficiently small individual units - as was done in Lithuania, for example  -the scheme allows farmers themselves to decide what size farms are likely to be most effective. The first results of the reorganisation of six collective and state farms under the Nizhny-Novgorod pilot project are being closely studied by other regions. 'We don't know what the result will be but we chose this path and we are trying it,' says Mrs Yekaterina Makaricheva, 39, the energetic chief of Moshkinskoye, one of eight private farms spawned by the reorganisation of the Sixty Years of October collective farm. 'It is better to try rather than wait for a gift from on high because I'm sure nobody will give us anything.' She says the first results are encouraging. If the 300-member farm she heads proves unwieldy, she is confident that farmers like herself will survive by setting up smaller businesses. Another offshoot of the programme has been the encouragement of enterprises devoted to the servicing of the farms themselves. Mr Sergei Klementiev not only farms land he won at one of the auctions with his land-entitlement certificate, but has set up his village's first cafe, and takes produce to town for other farmers such as Mrs Makaricheva. Another local entrepreneur provides Mrs Makaricheva with fuel at half the price charged by the local state fuel monopoly. Clearly, not all the new businesses will succeed. Mrs Liubov Bubnova appears weighed down by her new responsibilities as head of the neighbouring Rostok farm. Of all the problems facing new farms, Mrs Bubnova suggested that motivation was the most serious. 'They need to be a little bit more ambitious,' observed Mr Christopher Shupe, a Michigan agricultural student working on Mrs Bubnova's farm to research the results of the reorganisation. But Mrs Bubnova said that it was difficult to get people to work harder on her 35-member farm when pay was 'low' - even though the local monthly wage of Rbs150,000 is not too bad for Russian standards - and often late. The reason the money was late was because many of her clients did not pay for deliveries. In Nizhny-Novgorod, the scheme is being accompanied by Rbs6bn this year in subsidised loans for farms like Mrs Bubnova's which decided to reorganise. Cheap loans for setting up small food-processing units designed to create competition for local monopolists also led to the creation of 123 new dairies and meat-processing businesses in the Nizhny-Novgorod region last year. The British government, which is financing the IFC's work, is also helping to establish local advice centres for farmers. While the Nizhny-Novgorod project displays an impressive alliance of Russian political will, and western technical assistance, it is clear that much painstaking work remains to be done to deliver similar results on a massive scale. Mr Nemtsov reckons it will take at least 10 years to reproduce the plan across the province and Russia as a whole. Dr Vassily Uzun, the Russian agricultural expert who is considered the main inspiration for the scheme, says he will be glad if it takes only 20 years. Providing Russia's squabbling politicians do not interfere with progress on the ground, the reform gives Russia's long-suffering peasants a unique chance to prove that they are capable of seizing the initiative with both hands.</p>

			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> AROUND THE NFL;  </P> <P> BROWNS WILL CLEAN HOUSE  </P> <P> The Cleveland Browns' 12 assistant coaches have been told they should begin  looking for other jobs.  </P> <P> Interim coach Jim Shofner avoided using the word "fired" when referring to the  assistants. But owner Art Modell said it would be in the assistant coaches'  best interest to look for work elsewhere, because the Browns will be hiring a  new head coach once the season ends.  </P> <P> New England quarterback Tommy Hodson's sprained left ankle was covered by a  soft cast Monday, but he hopes to play in next Sunday's season finale against  the New York Giants. If Hodson can't, Marc Wilson probably will start.  </P></p>

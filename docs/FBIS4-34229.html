			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 14 Jun (EFE) --  Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres defended the  "feasible" development promoted by the new Central America  during a time of peace and democracy, and he asked for access to  international markets as "the best cooperation possible."    Regarding the Haitian crisis, he backed the OAS and UN  efforts to reestablish democracy in that country. He also  referred to international commerce and the current trend to  liberalize it. He said that statements of principles are not  enough if events continue to show that nations are denied the  right to participate in this new commercial order because of  protection measures being implemented.    He especially regretted the difficulties of gaining access  to  European and United States markets encountered by several  Central American products. He asked Spain and Portugal to back  initiatives to resolve those problems "in their position as the  intermediaries between Europe and America."    In his speech at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, which is  being held in the Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, Figueres  asserted that the democratic system had become stronger in  Central America, "great improvements" had been made in human  rights, and the economies had advanced to the opening of  markets. "We must ensure those advances in the coming years,"  Figueres emphasized. He, however, expressed his concern for the  social effects caused by policies to improve economic  indicators. He insisted in benefits of the "Alliance for a  Feasible Development" program, established by the Central  American presidents on the basis of respect for their people's  social needs and the conservation of their natural resources.    To attain a feasible development, the governments' efforts  to  further the economic sector have to be carried out in  conjunction with their social investment, he asserted.  Concurrently, we have to "strengthen our democratic  institutions" because, he insisted, feasible development  requires a solid pluralist base as growth "can only be parceled  in a society that lives and produces in a democracy."    Figueres, who assumed the presidency on 8 May and who  participated in the continental summit for the first time, asked  for international understanding of the problems confronted by  Central America after the wars and political instability  suffered in the region during the past decades.    Costa Rica, he said, intends to give priority to its social  objectives and to "change the market and the state in a creative  manner."    The Costa Rican head of state believes the objective is to  gain access to the upper levels of international competition,  but not by offering advantages based on low wages or on the  excessive exploitation of natural resources.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Rescue plan for Everglades agreed FLORIDA sugar-growers and state and federal officials yesterday agreed in principle on a plan to clean up the endangered Everglades, ending a five-year legal wrangle. The plan, announced by Mr Bruce Babbitt, interior secretary, is the latest in a series of compromise deals worked out by the Clinton administration to settle disputes between business and environmental interests. Under the agreement the sugar-growers have promised to spend up to Dollars 322m over 20 years to reduce pollution from fertilisers and increase the flow of water to the Everglades, one of the world's most famous swamp areas and home to a huge variety of plant and animal species. The federal government will seek to contribute about Dollars 161m through flood control projects and the services of the Army Corps of Engineers. The state of Florida may also contribute funds to the project. A further Dollars 21.8m per year could be raised from from a special local tax, although this must be approved by voters. The plan has emerged after a series of lawsuits by federal officials and environmentalists. Phosphate fertilisers running off from sugar farms have caused new vegetation to choke native plants. Changes in the course of the Kissimmee river also damaged the Everglades by cutting water supplies. While some environmental groups gave general support to the plan, criticism is already emerging from environmentalists such as the Audubon Society, who say they were excluded from the negotiations. Issues left unresolved by the framework agreement include the timetable, construction schedules and water quality standards, Mr Babbitt said. One issue that promises to be contentious is whether sugar-growers can be asked to contribute more money in 20 years if the goals of this project are not reached.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Oleg Velichko and Igor Ivantsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 11 Feb -- Oleg Soskovets, the first deputy  prime minister of the Russian Federation Government, has  admitted that the government has partly lost control of the  economy through financial and credit resources.    Speaking today at an expanded session of the collegium of  the  Ministry of Fuel and Energy Resources, the first deputy prime  minister also said that "the problem of non-payments with which  the Russian economy is afflicted has not yet been studied very  well." He commented critically on the current pricing and tax  policy. "It ought to unite and not separate the government and  the producers," he said.    Oleg Soskovets sees one of the principal goals of the  present  cabinet in "creating conditions that will enable producers and  consumers to agree among themselves normally."    The first deputy prime minister said that the credit and  finance system needed adjustment, as did the banking system. He  called upon specialists working in the fuel and energy complex  to pursue "a policy of partnership with other industries."  Otherwise we will be unable to form a civilized market, he said.    In the opinion of Oleg Soskovets, active attempts were being  made "to discredit the policy of reforms, especially after some  members of the previous cabinet left the government." But "no  one talks about skilled workers and managers leaving, though it  is they who make the whole economy tick," he added.</p>

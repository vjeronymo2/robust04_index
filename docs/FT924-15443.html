			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Bank of England is 'not telling full BCCI story' US SENATOR John Kerry, who is investigating the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, stepped up his attacks on the Bank of England yesterday with the claim that it 'is not telling the full story' about the bank's collapse, writes David Lascelles. Last week the Bank denied a charge in Mr Kerry's report that it had colluded in a cover-up of BCCI's fraud with the claim that he had not taken evidence directly from the Bank or its officials. Mr Kerry said on the BBC yesterday he had approached the Federal Reserve Board for documents which it had from the Bank of England. 'The Federal Reserve informed us that under no conditions did the Bank of England want us or anyone else to have access to those documents.' Mr Kerry stood by his assertion that the Bank knew of BCCI's frauds in April 1990, more than a year before it was shut down.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Premier earnings up 16% despite difficult conditions PREMIER Group, the South African food, pharmaceuticals and retail group, overcame difficult trading conditions last year to record a 16 per cent increase in earnings per share to 283 cents. The results reflect a better than expected performance from Metro Cash and Carry, the food distributor and a substantial improvement in earnings from Premier Pharmaceuticals. Contributions from the group's core food division were flat as the drought and deteriorating socio-political conditions put margins under pressure. On the retail side, CNA Gallo performed slightly better and Clicks recorded good growth. Turnover rose 3 per cent to R10.1bn (Dollars 3.16bn) with trading profit 4 per cent higher at R438.9m. A decline in the interest bill to R23.6m from R58m boosted pre-tax profits, which rose by 15 per cent to R415.3m. A lower tax charge and higher dividend income and equity accounted earnings helped lift net profits by 23 per cent to R233.8m. The dividend is going up from 81 cents a share to 94 cents. Mr Peter Wrighton, the chairman, said the group was planning for real growth in the year ahead. This assumed a political settlement, a better performance from the food division and CNA Gallo, first time contributions from Bonnita and UPD, and other operations staying on course. Mr Wrighton stressed that last year, ending April, was characterised by a number of acquisitions and disposals. Premier paid R144m for a 39 per cent interest in Bonnita Holdings, South Africa's second largest producer of milk based products; increased its shareholdings in Premier Pharmaceuticals, Clicks and Metro; and formed United Pharmaceutical Distributors, a wholesale distribution company in which Premier has an effective 40 per cent stake. The chairman said the group had also substantially increased its investment in people development to over R20m a year.</p>

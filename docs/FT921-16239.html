			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Main oil companies cut price of petrol THE main oil companies are hitting back at the super-market chains by slashing petrol prices in a potential price war, Deborah Hargreaves writes. Shell, Texaco and Mobil followed rival oil companies Esso and BP in cutting up to 6p from the price of a gallon yesterday. The cuts follow a sharp decline in the price of oil on world markets - North Sea crude has slipped by Dollars 5 a barrel to Dollars 18.50 a barrel in the past month. But the companies are also trying to win back market share lost to the aggressive pricing policies of the supermarkets. Supermarket chains Safeway and J. Sainsbury yesterday matched Tesco's cut of 8p a gallon. Tesco has been the leader in the petrol-price battle and is offering all fuel at less than Pounds 2 a gallon. Supermarkets are now offering fuel at 16p less than the main petrol-station chains. The stores are charging 183.2p a gallon for unleaded fuel and 199.6p for four-star against oil company prices of 199.6p for unleaded and 216p for four-star.</p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / BCCI creditors may face compensation delay PAYMENTS TO creditors of Bank of Credit and Commerce International from an agreed compensation plan may be delayed by up to a year because of an appeal filed in Luxembourg by some creditors against the court-approved package. It also emerged yesterday that creditors are not receiving interest of Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) a week that would have been earned since the start of December had the agreement with the Abu Dhabi majority shareholders adhered to the original timetable. Originally Touche Ross, liquidator of BCCI, thought it would be possible to have the agreement secured in time for Abu Dhabi to place Dollars 800m, covering the first two instalments of its Dollars 1.7bn contribution, on deposit with the pooling fund and earning interest for the benefit of creditors from December 1. The initial timetable had to be scrapped because of delays resulting from a court appeal in the UK, and insistence by the Luxembourg district court that the liquidator take soundings from creditors on the agreement. Touche Ross believed it had overcome that hurdle when 94 per cent of creditors who responded to a circular agreed to accept the package. A hard core of creditors is continuing to resist the package, however, leading to the appeal lodged with the Luxembourg court on December 24. The appeal has been filed on behalf of three creditors, Mr Adil Elias, Mr Assilaos Artiki and Mr Hal Skolnik. Mr Elias, a US-based engineering consultant, is a member of both the UK and Luxembourg BCCI creditors' committees and heads the BCCI depositors' protection association. Mr Skolnik, a company director, has a permanent proxy on the UK committee to represent Sheerbonnet, a UK creditor. Mr Artiki is a Greek insurance broker. Mr Georges Ravarani, a Luxembourg lawyer and one of the liquidators of BCCI Holdings, the holding company for BCCI SA, said a decision on the appeal could be lengthy because all procedures and statements had to be in written form. He said: 'The delay could be as little as six months but I think that is unrealistic. I think a year is more reasonable.' Touche Ross fears court delays could cause further problems for the liquidation, although Abu Dhabi has made clear that it remains committed to the agreement and maintains that new timetabling for payments should not cause serious difficulties for the majority shareholders. The liquidator believes it may have to revise its earlier estimates of how much creditors might expect to receive. The projection is between 30p and 40p in the pound. Mr Brian Smouha, the chief liquidator of BCCI, said yesterday: 'It is unfortunate that this is being held up and it does not look as if it is in the interests of creditors. I want to concentrate on getting the assets in and the money out to the creditors.'</p>

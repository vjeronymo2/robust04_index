			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Teachers vote heavily to continue tests boycott INDUSTRIAL ACTION in schools in England and Wales looks set to continue after the largest teachers' union voted to maintain its boycott of national curriculum tests. The NUT's ballot had 69,732 members in favour of continuing the boycott with only 3,477 against. About 139,000 were eligible to vote. The government was swift to condemn the decision by the National Union of Teachers, which was made in spite of a series of concessions. Other teachers' unions showed solidarity with the NUT in continuing the boycott. Last summer, boycotts by all three main teaching unions reduced the first national tests for 14-year-olds to a farce, and forced the abandonment of plans to publish league tables of schools' performance in the tests. Since then, the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, chaired by Sir Ron Dearing, has announced that the number of items on which teachers must assess 14-year-olds will be cut from 41 to six, while plans have been scrapped for national tests in technology, modern languages, history and geography. But all the main unions said teachers had yet to see any evidence of reduced workload. Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, said: 'The interim Dearing report, the attitude of government and the material for future testing currently available have not convinced teachers that the problems of workload and educationally unsound tests have been resolved.' Sir Ron is due to report to the Department for Education on detailed changes to the curriculum by the end of next month, but Mr McAvoy said these were unlikely to have an impact on the NUT's boycott. The union will consult its members less formally when more information on testing is available. Baroness Blatch, education minister, said: 'Parents will find it difficult to understand the reason behind this decision given the changes already made as a result of Sir Ron Dearing, and the degree to which teachers have been consulted.' Mr Chris Woodhead, chief executive of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, described the news as 'disappointing', and said the tests had already been 'streamlined' to 'provide teachers and parents with essential information about children's progress'. However, other teachers' unions gave strong support to the NUT. Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, whose union will ballot on the boycott after Sir Ron's final report has been published, said: 'We would have expected the same result from our members. Teachers in schools, rather than policymakers, are yet to experience a real reduction in a killing workload.' Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers' union, said his union's boycott would continue.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["eli/ub"-signed report: "Bonn: No Medical Troops to </F> Rwanda"]    [Text] Bonn -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free  Democratic Party of Germany) has joined Volker Ruehe (Christian  Democratic Union) in his decision not to send German medical  troops to civil war-stricken Rwanda for the time being. Ruehe  had said: "We will not send our troops to Rwanda." The Foreign  Ministry said that if the defense minister, who is the minister  responsible for such missions, finds that the use of German  troops is out of the question, the foreign minister can only  agree to that view.    A week ago, the United Nations had asked Bonn via the German  Mission in New York whether it would be prepared to send a  medical unit of 100 soldiers, a field hospital, and 50 vehicles,  as well as an air transport unit to Rwanda. In a paper  assessing the matter, the Foreign Office says that this was a  "deviation from general practice." Usually, such requests are  made orally and on all the members of the community. In the  case of Rwanda, Germany was approached direct and in writing.  This shows the urgency with which the matter is being treated  and the pressure that the Security Council is putting behind the  request.    Irrespective of this request, a Bundeswehr Transall aircraft  is to take drugs and food to Rwanda. Government spokesman  Dieter Vogel said that the cabinet is "clearly willing" to meet  a relevant request by UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. But  first it must be clarified whether the situation is secure  enough for such a mission. The Transall plane is to operate as a  shuttle taking drugs and food from Nairobi to the Rwandan  capital Kigali.    The request from New York for the deployment of medical  troops has not yet been officially decided in Bonn. Ruehe said  that the security situation in Rwanda has to be clarified first  and the conflicting parties must agree to the mission. Also,  irritations must be avoided prior to the Federal Constitutional  Court passing its judgment on international Bundeswehr missions.    The Foreign Ministry said that there is absolute chaos in  Rwanda. The security of German medical troops would not be  safeguarded. Kinkel is torn between two opinions in the Rwanda  question. On the one hand he said that Germany must not stand  aside when there is a genocide happening. On the other hand, he  said that no European country is currently prepared to send  troops to the African country.    Kinkel and Ruehe had already discussed the UN request on  Wednesday [18 May]. In this discussion, Kinkel was especially  responsive to the argument of danger to German troops. The  decision to provide the Transall was made in a talk between  Kinkel, Ruehe, and Friedrich Bohl, the minister in the  Chancellor's Office.</p>

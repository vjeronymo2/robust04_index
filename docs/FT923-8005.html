			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / World Trade News: European Commission gives guarded welcome THE European Commission yesterday gave a guarded welcome to Nafta, but urged the US, Mexico and Canada to respect world trade rules in setting up the free trade area. A official said Brussels would not pass detailed comment on the deal until the Commission had been officially notified of the contents of the agreement. 'The Commission always welcomes free trade areas, on condition they respect Gatt rules'. The EC states have agreed to form an ambitious European free trade zone (European Economic Area) with the European Free Trade Agreement (Efta). An EC official said Nafta would offer attractions to outside investors. 'We can't do anything about that. That's what markets are about'. The EC is likely to study Nafta's car, textile and financial services clauses.</p>

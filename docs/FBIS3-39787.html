A Foreign Ministry statement on the subject noted that two  religious officials who left for western Thrace yesterday, were  sent back by Greek authorities at the Ipsala border checkpoint.  The statement added that the Greek ambassador to Ankara was  summoned to the Foreign Ministry and a protest was lodged with  Greece in connection with the incident.    The statement said: There is a lesson to be learned with  regard to contemporary concepts and norms from the fact that  Greece -- a member of the European Union -- is unable to  tolerate an invitation to two religious officials from abroad  extended by a minority in the country in order to meet their  needs for worship during a holy month.</p>

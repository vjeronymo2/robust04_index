			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MASTER CHORALE OUTDRAWS PACIFIC CHORALE BY 800  </P> <P> The Master Chorale of Orange County outdrew the Pacific Chorale by almost 800  ticket-buyers over the weekend as both groups kicked off their seasons at the  Orange County Performing Arts Center.  </P> <P> The Master Chorale drew 2,400 to its performance of Stravinsky's "Symphony of  Psalms," with the Lewitzky Dance Company, and Orff's "Carmina Burana" on  Friday, according to chorale board chairman John Rhynerson. About 200  admissions were complimentary -- to high schools and senior citizen centers, he  said.  </P> <P> The Pacific Chorale drew 1,807 people to its program of Beethoven's "Missa  Solemnis" on Sunday, according to executive director Bonnie McClain, who said  380 were complimentary admissions to local schools and church choirs.  </P> <P> Of the Master Chorale's 2,200 (minus the complimentary tickets), the breakdown  was 807 season subscribers and 1,393 single-ticket buyers, according to  Rhynerson, who attributed the single-ticket figure to a "big marketing push"  that included the mailing of "around 30,000 flyers" to local dance companies  and departments at colleges and high schools. "The assumption was that the  Lewitzky Dance Company would bring in a different audience," Rhynerson said.  </P> <P> 'It also was our first Friday (night) concert in the Center in quite a while,  and that helped . . .," he added.  </P> <P> The Master Chorale's next concert will a Christmas program with Shirley Jones,  Dec. 3 at the Center.  </P> <P> Of the Pacific's 1,427 (minus the free tickets), 1,137 were season subscribers  and 290 were single-ticket buyers, McClain said. "I am not unhappy with the  attendance figures," she said. "Of course, I would have loved 1,500  subscribers. . . . I'd like to sell 3,000 season tickets. But our  season-tickets sale started slow, which is always the case. . . . In the last  two and three weeks, it picked up."  </P> <P> McClain also said that the Center failed to insert flyers announcing the  Pacific's Dec. 18 "Messiah" Sing-Along into Sunday's program booklet, as  requested. "I don't know what the problem was," she said. "I was not thrilled."  </P> <P> A Center spokesperson acknowledged that "it is our responsibility to put flyers  into the programs" and said the error was "due to a miscommunication."  </P> <P> "It's hard for those of us with small staffs," McClain said. "I wish it could  be made easier for us. I was not happy that those (flyers) did not get stuffed.  The 'Messiah' Sing-Along is not a season-subscriber event. We want people to  know that they have to buy other tickets. Those kind of stuffers are a good way  and inexpensive way to let people know."  </P> <P> "We corrected the problem as soon as we found out about it and gave the flyers  to the ushers to hand out at the door," the Center spokesperson said. "As far  as we know, most of the people got them."  </P> <P> The Pacific's next concert will be a holiday program Dec. 2 at the Center.  </P></p>

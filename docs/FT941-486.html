			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Tyneside transit system go-ahead Plans for a Pounds 50m extension of Tyne and Wear's Metro rapid transit system through a combination of public and private-sector financing were launched yesterday by the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Authority, Chris Tighe writes. The proposals, which would extend Metro services 11.5 miles to Sunderland, comprise a mixture of new track and stations along the south bank of the River Wear, and the shared use of existing rail track and stations between Pelaw, near Gateshead, and Sunderland. The target completion date is 1999.</p>

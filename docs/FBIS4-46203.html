			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] A Muslim man was held by police  in Narathiwat's Muang district on Wednesday on suspicion that he  was a member of a southern separatist group preparing to carry  out an act of sabotage in the South.    Ma-ae Buraheng, 27, from Narathiwat's Bacho district, was  held after police stopped a taxi at a checkpoint in Ban Khao  Tanyong area, Narathiwat police chief Panya Thiansat said.    Police found a membership card of the Pattani United  Liberation Organization (Pulo) in his underpants, Pol Col Panya  said.    In a search of his camouflage backpack, police found  military  fatigues, a pair of jungle boots, an alarm clock, a bag of rice,  a needle and number of electric wires, he said.    He said police had not yet filed charges against Ma-ae. The  suspect may be charged with either organized crime or being a  rebel, as suggested by his Pulo member card, he added.    The suspect was being held at Tanyong police station pending  further questioning, which would be jointly conducted by police  and military officers, he said. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Temptations along the eastern aisle: Retailers are increasing investment in east Asia to take advantage of growing prosperity From a vast warehouse in a Singapore suburb, Mr John Deuchars, a burly, chain-smoking Australian, is plotting a small consumer revolution. In a few months, he aims to propel the country's retail distribution system, largely unchanged since British colonial days, into the information technology era. 'In terms of choice and display, stores here are as good as any in the world. But go to the delivery bay, and everything is completely antiquated,' says Mr Deuchars, local manager of Davids Holdings, an Australian retail distribution group which recently formed a joint venture with NTUC/Fairprice, Singapore's biggest supermarket chain. At present, NTUC/Fairprice's 52 stores are supplied by an irregular army of small wholesalers, which drop off odd lots of merchandise on average 150 times a day. Once the joint venture gets going, each store's orders will be placed and invoiced electronically, and delivered on one truck within 24 hours. As well as reducing traffic congestion and paperwork, the system will enable NTUC/Fairprice to cut stock levels by 40 per cent, save costs equal to 4 percentage points of its profit margin, and sharpen retail price competition. The venture is just one example of a wave of change sweeping through east Asia, as retailers scramble to meet the increasingly sophisticated demands of newly prosperous consumers - eager to buy products from deodorants and frozen food to luxury accessories and designer fashion brands. This is prompting a stampede across the region by leading retailers from around the world. They include Mitsukoshi, Takashimaya, Sogo and Yaohan of Japan, Carrefour of France, Makro of the Netherlands, Marks and Spencer of the UK, Sweden's Ikea, and Toys R Us of the US. A possible indication of the growth to come is offered by Hong Kong - now Asia's richest economy after Japan - where the number of supermarkets has increased 40 times since 1970. In South Korea, there are 10 times more stores than in 1980, and retailing employs 28 per cent of the labour force, more than any other sector. As economic growth bounds ahead, millions more people every year achieve the minimum annual income, roughly USDollars 5,000 in most countries, needed to become active consumers rather than relying on barter. In China, potentially the biggest market of all, some forecasts suggest their numbers will more than treble this decade to 200m. In most of Asia, the ratio of retail space to population is still well below western levels. However, it is rising rapidly in many cities as store groups compete to woo customers with ever larger and more luxurious premises. In Kuala Lumpur, retail space is set to double between 1992 and 1997, and in Singapore to increase by 40 per cent in the three years to 1996. Steeply rising land prices are adding impetus. Many local entrepreneurs have made fortunes by building shopping malls on a speculative basis and selling them to property or retail companies. These trends are condemning small shops and street markets to a diminishing share of business. Nestle, the Swiss food group, says sales to supermarkets grew from 20 per cent to 40 per cent of its total turnover in Malaysia during the 1980s. There are signs, though, that in some cities exuberant expansion of retailing capacity is outstripping even Asian shoppers' propensity to consume. In Singapore, only one department store, the old-established Robinson's, reported a profit in the second half of last year. Many industry observers think a shake-out is imminent. But fiercer competition is also encouraging further cross-border expansion by prompting locally owned chains to look abroad for new business. For instance, Parkson of Malaysia and CK Tang of Singapore, both department store chains, have recently moved into China. Until recently, many Asian countries restricted investments by foreign retailers. These curbs are being relaxed or, in countries such as Indonesia, increasingly circumvented by new entrants with the apparent approval of the authorities. China has recently allowed foreign retailers to set up trial operations in larger cities. But not every street in Asia is paved with gold. Mr Chris Nelson, head of Asian operations at Dairy Farm, the Hong Kong-based retailing group, says the first rule of success is to target selected population groups, not entire countries. At first sight, Indonesia, with income per head of less than Dollars 800 a year, looks unpromising. Yet in Jakarta, the capital, where most of the spending power is concentrated, there are more people with a higher standard of living than in Portugal. Yaohan, which operates 450 diverse retail outlets in 16 mostly Asian countries, has achieved Dollars 4bn annual sales partly by focusing heavily on overseas Chinese customers throughout the region. The company, which moved its headquarters from Japan to Hong Kong four years ago, aims to open 1,000 stores in China by 2010. The second rule is to find a reliable local partner. In much of Asia, joint ventures are a legal requirement. But having an ally able to grease the wheels - and palms - is also essential to get things done in many countries. Even then, pitfalls await the unwary newcomer. In most of Asia, distribution methods are primitive and depend, as in Singapore, on small wholesalers and middlemen, each of whom expects to take a cut. Efforts to bypass or modernise the system can stir reprisals, not least from racketeers who often extort cash from distribution. One foreign retailer recently discovered this to its cost in Taiwan, where an over-zealous store manager narrowly survived an attack by axe-wielding gangsters. In much of China, there are no wholesaling networks at all, and poor roads and scarce warehouse facilities make transportation a logistical nightmare. 'It will take years for supermarkets to reach the whole country,' says Mr Nelson of Dairy Farm. As well as keeping costs high, Asian distribution systems give manufacturers far greater power over retailers than in most western countries. In Thailand, some manufacturers refuse to supply supermarkets with their most popular brands unless they stock poorly selling ones as well. Another widespread problem is the shortage of skilled labour, particularly of managers. Before opening a big department store in Singapore last year, Takashimaya of Japan recruited and trained 400 local sales staff. But as soon as their training was complete, 100 left for jobs elsewhere. In addition, retailers must adapt their wares to local tastes and demand. This can be taxing in a region where market research is often rudimentary. Some local peculiarities are immediately obvious. In Malaysia, where 60 per cent of the population is Moslem, supermarkets must invest in special facilities for treating and storing food in accordance with religious standards. In northern China, consumers are willing to spend more on smart clothing than in southern provinces, where good food is the top priority. Other nuances are more subtle. Polarisation of incomes between a small minority of rich people and a great mass of poor ones can make it hard for retailers specialising in catering to the middle market to carve out a niche. One such retailer, Marks and Spencer, is still striving after several attempts to make its formula work in Kuala Lumpur. But it has cracked the problem in Hong Kong where, it says, its Kowloon store is enjoying good sales growth and making satisfactory profits selling clothing - 80 per cent of it made in the UK. Hong Kong, however, is unusual in having almost no import barriers. In other countries, heavy duties can destroy the advantage of retailers which depend heavily on selling imported goods. Such trade protection can also inhibit the development of discount operations. Mr Colin Buchanan, Marks and Spencer's director of Far East retailing, warns that overseas expansion involves 'pain and problems'. However, the potential rewards are so big that retailers seem certain to continue crowding into the region. As Mr Nelson of Dairy Farm puts it: 'Where else in the world are so many new consumers entering the market all the time?'</p>

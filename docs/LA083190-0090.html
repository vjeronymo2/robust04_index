			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OCC NAMES HEAD OF NEW HIGH-TECH UNIT  </P> <P> Orange Coast College has named John J. Waters, an associate professor of  machine technology for 14 years, as director of the college's new Center for  Applied Competitive Technologies.  </P> <P> The center is one of eight high-tech centers in the state started at community  colleges in the last year to provide technical training and consultation to  local small and medium-size manufacturing firms.  </P> <P> Orange Coast's center will help firms improve the skills of their employees and  the quality of their products.  </P> <P> The college received $90,000 from the state and other sources to establish the  center. That amount will be repeated for the next three years to maintain the  center and allow it to buy equipment needed to train students and employees in  the new technology.  </P> <P> Waters, 43, worked as a machinist for two large companies and taught industrial  arts at El Dorado High School before being hired by Orange Coast College in  1976. He developed the curriculum for the college's computerized numerical  control program.  </P> <P> "Many small to medium-size firms work as subcontractors for large  general-contracting firms," Waters said. "We'll assist those firms in improving  the quality of the products they supply to general contractors."  </P></p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Fuel famine cripples air transport in Nigeria: Paul Adams takes a much-delayed flight from Lagos to the political capital of Abuja Getting a domestic flight was easier in Nigeria before the oil workers went on strike and the jet fuel ran out. Last week in Lagos, the rush was for a ticket to Abuja, the federal capital where jailed opposition leader Moshood Abiola was due to appear in court charged with treason for saying he won the election. There are no trains unless you have a week to spare and it is a 10-hour drive to Abuja. The roads appear to have been shelled by heavy artillery but the pot-holes are there because the road is not maintained and the twisted, charred vehicles on the roadside are the result of bad driving. The last scheduled flight on Okada airlines to Abuja was at 3 pm. There is no such thing as a check-in time at the terminal, a sprawling row of gloomy sheds, and often there is no such thing as checking-in. Touts swarm around passengers, and work with the men in airline uniform and, occasionally, security forces in plain clothes. 'Okada - you have to pay more,' they yelled at the passenger gate by the runway. The price had doubled from N1750 (Pounds 22) that morning to N3500. Okada's operations manager confirmed it. 'Its because of the shortage of fuel,' he said. The extra money was about to be paid when it transpired there was no 3 o'clock flight any more. 'It's because of fuel,' they said again. Back came the extra money and the ticket (now useless) and one of the airline staff led a large posse of touts to get the one remaining flight to Abuja, which was from the other terminal. The 'last flight' was a Russian made Tupolov 134, with 'Maina Air' written on its side. It was not an airline I had heard of. 'It means chief in the Kanuri language,' said another passenger. The Bulgarian crew looked reluctant. They had barely enough fuel to fly to Abuja and back. They were finally persuaded, perhaps by the Kanuri chief, to get in the cockpit. I sat opposite a former government minister, going to Abuja for a constitutional conference, meant to decide the fate of Mr Abiola. The crew informed us that they had decided to fly, very slowly, to Abuja via Kano, which is in the same direction but exactly twice as far, and there re-fuel, and fly back to Abuja. Everyone groaned, then went very quiet for a minute or two after take-off, which was a little shaky. For the first time in recent memory, someone said he wished he had gone Nigeria Airways. 'You definitely feel that you are in a cabin,' said the retired minister. We headed towards the Atlantic coast, circled round the mass of creeks west of Lagos and climbed above the cloud. We reached the arid north, where the former minister pointed out his home town clearly visible beneath us. When we landed at Kano, one of the stewardesses took out a bag full of money, taken from the flight's ticket sales, and went off in search of fuel. Inexplicably, there was none. The passengers strolled around the deserted tarmac, spoke for hours on their cellular phones to Lagos and Abuja and discovered old friends and acquaintances were on the flight. A well-known trade union leader, now relieved of his job, earnestly explained that tomorrow Chief Abiola would be released on a great day for democracy in Nigeria, then he strolled with his entourage to the Kano airport VIP lounge. A pair of headlights appeared half a mile across the runway and headed slowly towards the aircraft. It was the fuel tanker and by 8 o'clock the aircraft was ready to go, arriving in Abuja five hours after we left Lagos. It is normally a 50-minute flight. The next day, the judge in the high court case resigned because no one trusted him, Chief Abiola went back to his cell, and everyone else stayed put because there were no flights. Nigeria Airways was the only flight out of Abuja and the captain actually apologised for a slight delay. On board were some more trade union leaders. Twelve hours later Gen Abacha announced that they had been relieved of their jobs. The airlines are still searching for jet fuel, Chief Abiola is somewhere in custody and Nigeria is still waiting for the dawn of democracy.</p>

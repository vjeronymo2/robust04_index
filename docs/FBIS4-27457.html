			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a report from Chhlong District of  Kratie Province, on 11 May at a ceremony held at the provincial  office of the Cambodian People's Party, the communist Vietnamese  puppets' military commander in Kratie Province provided arms to  hundreds of Vietnamese families to protect themselves and  threaten the Cambodians.    The people said that almost all of the Vietnamese settlers  in  Cambodia are already armed. By providing them with more arms,  the Vietnamese will increase their activities, including  bullying, robbing, and massacring the Cambodian people in  Chhlong District.    The Vietnamese men and women in the district have all along  been arrogant and hostile and have acted as masters of the  Cambodian land and sea and plundered Cambodian property.  Nevertheless, the communist Vietnamese puppets have given them  more weapons.    The people said that these Vietnamese monsters are  controlling and lording over almost all of the territory in  Chhlong District. This is a grave threat arising from the  Vietnamese and the traitorous acts committed by the communist  Vietnamese puppets.    Every Cambodian is furious and angry with the  Vietnamese-headed Cambodians who have sold out our nation and  land. Take a look at the areas in Kratie Province bordering  Vietnam. Vietnamese men and women are moving in and out of  Cambodia to plunder our resources and drive Cambodians off their  land. They have taken a large portion of Cambodian territory.    The Vietnamese have taken control of all the rubber  plantations in Snuol District. They have sent Cambodian rubber  for sale in Vietnam in exchange for dollars, while Cambodian  workers receive nothing. They have also felled Cambodian trees  and sent them to Vietnam.    The people said the Cambodians cannot tolerate this  traitorous act of the communist Vietnamese puppets and the  Vietnamese occupation of Cambodian territory.    The people in Chhlong District and elsewhere now realize  that  our nation will not survive under the old Vietnamese puppets who  have served as out-and-out lackeys of the Vietnamese since 1979  and the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent,  Neutral Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] which has followed  in the footsteps of the Vietnamese puppets. Thus, the people  have no other alternative but to jointly struggle to drive all  Vietnamese men and women out of our Cambodian territory. Only  by so doing can we defend our nation and race.</p>

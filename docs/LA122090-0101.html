			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> NO RING AROUND THE COLLAR  </P> <P> In a unanimous vote, the City Council last week directed city staff to study  the feasibility of requiring new office buildings to include showers and  lockers to encourage workers to ride bicycles to work.  </P> <P> "I would bicycle to work every day if I knew I didn't have to get sweat on my  shirt and collar," said Councilman Dennis Zane, who introduced the study  proposal.  </P> <P> The staff was asked to consider whether city-sponsored regional shower and  locker facilities are good ideas because some businesses would be too small to  afford their own facilities.  </P></p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Yeltsin pressed to quit as PM POLITICAL pressure is mounting in Moscow to remove Mr Boris Yeltsin as prime minister and install an administration less committed to radical economic reform. Mr Yeltsin, who is both president and prime minister, remains Russia's most popular politician, but has been identified with his government's severe economic reforms and made vulnerable to parliamentary attack. The first strong signs of the political offensive against him emerged this week. Tuesday's meeting of the Constitutional Commission cut the parliamentary votes needed to remove a prime minister from two-thirds to a bare majority and deleted Mr Yeltsin's right to appoint regional governors. Mr Yeltsin may be able to restore the lost clauses but the anti-government victory shows the rising tide of discontent. The opposition is centred among disaffected deputies who are unhappy with Mr Yeltsin's concentration of powers. Earlier this month, Mr Yeltsin added the post of defence minister to his portfolios. Under his presidency, Russia has assumed most of the powers of the former Soviet Union. Last October he also won the right to legislate by decree - a right deputies now regret. Mr Yeltsin admitted yesterday that the government would fall if he were replaced as prime minister, because it depends on his popularity. No one will challenge him as president, but many deputies feel he should go as premier. Some observers believe he will have to sacrifice Mr Genady Burbulis, the unpopular first deputy prime minister, although he may be able to defend Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform. A western diplomat said yesterday: 'Gaidar is very important for the IMF right now, and Yeltsin knows how important the IMF is to him.' G7 aid to Russia, Page 2 Oil price to rise, Page 40</p>

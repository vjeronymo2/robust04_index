			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ares-Serono optimistic on outlook for year Ares-Serono, the biotechnology-based drugs group, is 'quite optimistic' about its profit prospects for 1994. Mr Ernesto Bertarelli, deputy chief executive, said he thought the worst effects of drug price cuts in the important Italian market had been felt in the first quarter. Last year Ares-Serono profits fell by a third to Dollars 72.5m because of price cuts and currency devaluations in some of its main markets. At the group's annual press conference, Mr Bertarelli said overall profit margins were set to improve now that the weak over-the-counter drugs and diagnostics divisions had been sold. However, Mr Christian Raymond, treasurer, acknowledged that a continuing weak or weaker US dollar would have a big impact on profits this year. Ms Kathryn Biberstein, the group's general council, said Ares-Serono was unconcerned by lawsuits launched recently by dissident minority shareholders of Ares-Serono's Israeli subsidiary, InterPharm Laboratories. Two weeks ago, the group closed a tender offer for the 24 per cent of InterPharm shares it did not already hold at Dollars 22 per share. Dissidents representing 12 per cent of the shares have held out for a higher price, and have won an injunction in Israel preventing InterPharm from exporting its beta interferon technology to Ares-Serono. Ms Biberstein said the group expected to reach an agreement with Israel's chief scientist in the next few weeks on the use of the technology. Ares-Serono was also in discussion with the Nasdaq market, where InterPharm is listed, about delisting the shares. The company meanwhile confirmed that it would be paying a maintained dividend of SFr6 per bearer share and SFr2.40 per registered share.</p>

The government blamed fighting over rights to rich farmlands in western Kenya on 'outside factors', saying that tribes in the region had been living in harmony for generations. It implicitly accused Kenya's newly legalised opposition parties of fomenting trouble, noting that some of their leaders had threatened to make the country ungovernable.</p>

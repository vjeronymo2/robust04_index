			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Tube workers offered 4.5% rise LONDON Underground yesterday offered a 4.5 per cent pay rise to its rail and craft unions and appeared to make some progress on its disputed company plan with RMT, the transport union. The pay rise, the same as that offered and accepted at British Rail, is likely to be accepted by the unions. On the issue of London Underground's company plan, on which RMT members have voted 2 - 1 in favour of industrial action, 'there is still a long way to go', according to a union official. But both sides said that a useful start had been made in the discussions.</p>

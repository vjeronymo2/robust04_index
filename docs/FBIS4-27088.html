			<p>BFN     [Text] Malaysia has called on the world community to exert  its influence to have economic sanctions against Iraq lifted  soon. Minister of Youth and Sports Haji Abdul Ghani Othman said  Malaysia feels that the people of Iraq have suffered enough.  Malaysia supports the lifting of economic sanctions currently  imposed upon Iraq due to the humanitarian situation which is  deteriorating and will endanger the life of its people. He said  this in a speech when opening the International Conference  Against Economic Sanctions on Iraq in Kuala Lumpur. Haji Abdul  Ghani criticized the UN for its incapability, saying that as an  international body, the UN was slow and was even seeming to be  practicing double standards in responding to the needs of the  oppressed.</p>

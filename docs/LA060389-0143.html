			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> ABUNDANCE OF HERBS DISPLAYS DIVERSITY OF CUISINES, CULTURES  </P> <P> Orange County's growing ethnic diversity is obvious in many ways, and it  extends to what people are growing in their back-yard herb gardens.  </P> <P> Many Vietnamese have patches of onion and mint as well as other herbs. Some  grow lemon grass, the long, flat-leaved scallion-appearing grass that imparts a  lemon flavor to fish and soups. Others have dill, which is used in a variety of  foods, especially catfish.  </P> <P> For Italian cooks, this is herb paradise. Mediterranean herbs like thyme,  rosemary and lavender grow here as if Orange County were somewhere just south  of Naples. So does basil, which may have originated in India but has become a  Mediterranean staple.  </P> <P> It is no trick here to grow several varieties of basil and oregano, onion,  garlic, shallots and chives. Lemon basil is especially good with chicken and  fish, Spicy Globe and Dark Opal basil make attractive container plants, and  Italian sweet basil is the most prized for cooking and is the base for pesto  sauce.  </P> <P> Coriander, favored in Mexican cooking for its leaves (cilantro) and in Indian  curries for its seeds, also grows effortlessly here and can take over your  garden if not pruned. The same goes for mint, which has a wandering root  system.  </P> <P> To get an idea of what grows here and how big it gets, a stroll through the  herb garden at Fullerton Arboretum at Cal State Fullerton is instructive.  </P> <P> Situated behind the historic house built by Dr. George C. Clark, Fullerton's  first physician, the herb garden consists of four plots with edible or  medicinal herbs and ornamental flowers.  </P> <P> Here you can find well-marked samples of Genoa, Napoletano and Greek miniature  basils as well as fennel, borage, lemon verbena, sweet bay leaves, French  Tarragon, ginger, garlic, chives, sweet marjoram, creeping rosemary, orange  bergamot, savory, sage, and chamomile, to mention a few.  </P> <P> All can be grown easily in small spaces, except for the bay tree, which can  achieve considerable height and breadth.  </P> <P> One popular method is to fill a terra cotta container with several different  varieties, creating an herb bowl that can be moved around the garden or patio,  or brought into a bright kitchen window or atrium.  </P> <P> Most herbs take very little care, says Joyce Smith, the arboretum's Heritage  Garden coordinator. In fact, you can plant herbs and just "let them grow,  unless you know it is going to throw a lot of seeds out," such as the coriander  or fennel. Many herbs are ornamental as well as edible, and pruning can help  keep them full by facilitating new growth. Smith says she trims back large,  bush-like herbs such as rosemary to keep them from getting "woody" with too  much stem and not enough greenery.  </P> <P> Most herbs need substantial sunlight and good drainage, and can thrive in  sandy, semi-arid conditions. Smith says she doesn't use insecticides, since  many of the herbs are fragrant enough to repel pests.  </P> <P> There is no set schedule for watering, and it depends on how dry the weather  has been. Touching the soil every few days is Smith's recommended method. When  she does water, she sprays it overhead instead of irrigating because "it keeps  the plants cleaner and keeps the insects off."  </P> <P> As for fertilizing, she suggests that less is better. Smith uses mulch, but no  fertilizer.  </P> <P> "You can over-fertilize, and if you do, they kind of lose their flavor," she  explains.  </P> <P> Once every few weeks is probably sufficient for most herbs, and many can grow  without any help at all, thanks to their wild heritage.  </P> <P> "They were weeds to begin with in the forests and fields and were brought into  the garden," Smith says, noting that "any wild thing" can pretty much take care  of itself.  </P> <P> Herbs grow in Orange County year-round, and some bloom periodically with small  flowers.  </P> <P> The cinnamon basil flowers have deep purple petals, while the lemon basil  sports tiny white blossoms. Fennel is an annual or biannual with yellow  flowers, and borage has blue-violet flowers and leaves with a cucumber-like  taste that can be used in salads or candied and put on cakes as edible  ornaments.  </P> <P> Lemon verbena, a deciduous plant that is dormant in the winter, can grow as a  shrub or tree and has long slender leaves and tiny white flowers. The leaves  have (what else?) a lemony taste. Smith says you can get more leaves of verbena  as well as basil and marjoram by cutting off the blossoms, pretty as they are.  It all depends on whether you prize the plant more for cooking or decoration.  </P> <P> When cooking with fresh herbs, a good rule is to add twice as much as a recipe  calls for of the dried version. An exception is rosemary, for which one-third  as much fresh as is called for dry will do nicely, since it is "pretty strong,"  Smith says.  </P> <P> The alliums -- onions, garlic and shallots -- can be pulled from the ground  when the bulb begins to protrude, but Smith warns gardeners to wait until the  tops are dried before cutting them off. If you cut the stalks before they are  completely dry, mold will ruin the bulbs. Once dry, however, they will keep for  weeks in a cool, dry, well ventilated place  </P> <P> Next to the arboretum's herb garden is a small plot with several varieties of  chili peppers. A pepper garden is a natural complement to an herb garden,  especially for Oriental and Latin cuisines. The peppers take up little space  and can be dried and crushed for use in sauces, soups or to sprinkle on a piece  of meat in Cajun fashion.  </P> <P> The garden has cayenne, serrano and poblano/ancho peppers. The latter is mild  and can be used for chili relleno, the Mexican recipe for chili peppers stuffed  with jack cheese.  </P> <P> The others should be used with care, however. "The smaller the pepper, the  hotter it is," Smith says, pointing out a tiny chili fit for asbestos palates.  </P></p>

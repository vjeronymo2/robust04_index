			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: De La Rue in further talks with Portals Portals and De La Rue were last night locked in negotiations amid reports that the latter had made an offer in excess of Pounds 10 a share for the specialist paper group. The all-day meeting was the second the two sides had held this week and followed the news last week that De La Rue had made an approach to Portals. The fiercely independent Portals board is thought to consider a figure of more than Pounds 10 a share as the minimum it would be prepared to put to shareholders, with many observers expecting them to hold out for between Pounds 11 and Pounds 12. The approach by De La Rue was made public on December 6 following a sharp rise in Portals share price. A subsequent statement by De La Rue said that it would not make a bid without the agreement of the Portals board. It is the second time this year the two groups have been in takeover talks. De La Rue made its first approach in May, with analysts suggesting an offer being made of about 900p per share, which was rebuffed by Portals. The length of the latest round of talks suggests a higher offer has been forthcoming. Analysts said that an offer of Pounds 10 per share, which would value Portals at Pounds 648m, would most likely be funded by cash and equity. De La Rue has about Pounds 250m in cash. Portals shares closed up 14p at 920p yesterday. They have risen by 215p since the news of the latest approach. De La Rue shares rose by 21p to 955p. Last week, Portals attempted to bolster its defences by announcing a Pounds 100m contract with the Indian government, the biggest value banknote contract ever. Portals said the order, which will begin early next year, should allow the group to operate at capacity for the foreseeable future. De La Rue is one of Portals' largest customers and is believed to be keen to acquire Portals' technology and expertise in developing banknote security features.</p>

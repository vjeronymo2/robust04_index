			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading LIVELIER trading at the end of the three-week stock market account produced a firmer futures market and brisker activity in the options, writes Christopher Price. The latter market was underpinned by speculative interests, with some of the equity market's favourite takeover candidates featuring strongly. Lucas Industries totalled 2,719 contracts, with one broker selling 1,500 of the August 140 puts at 10.5p. United Biscuits, which saw its shares rise strongly in the equity market, was also prominent, reaching 2,217 contracts. The top-traded stock was Asda at 3,062, with 1,901 of the October 67 puts bought at 7p. In the futures, the June contract opened firmly at 2,775, but slipped back soon after, as some in the market took a gloomy view of the Conservatives' strategy after Thursday's elections. It tumbled to 2,768 on low volume, before rallying slowly for most of the remainder of the session. It finally finished at 2,799, one point up on its fair value level of around 7. Volume was an uninspiring 7,204 contracts.</p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Broker lifts world sugar output estimate CZARNIKOW, THE London sugar broker, has raised sharply its forecast for world production in the current season. World output is now put at 115.93m tonnes, 2.81m tonnes above the estimate published in May, and well ahead of projected consumption at 111.79m tonnes. However, consumption is the former Soviet Union is reckoned to be down 1.95m tonnes from last season's level. The initial estimates for 1992-93 show the sugar market much more closely balanced, with production at 115.59m tonnes and consumption at 114.55m tonnes. This season Czarnikow estimates that just over 3.5m tonnes will have been added to world stocks, bringing the total addition over the last two seasons to nearly 6m tonnes. However, in 1992-93 it expects stocks to rise by just 440,000 tonnes. More than 2m tonnes of the 1991-92 production increase is accounted for by just two countries - India and China. 'It remains a significant element in the world supply outlook that an important volume of this extra sugar has remained with the producers in these countries, even though some exports have been concluded.' Indian production is estimated at 14.57m tonnes, raw value, for 1991-92. This will lift the country's stocks to 4.75m tonnes by the end of next month. Chinese output is put at 8.6m tonnes - above domestic consumption at 8.25m tonnes. Czarnikow says the 1992-93 season 'is already emerging as one of sharp contrasts'. It expects output gains in the subsidised markets of the US, Mexico and the European Community, plus improvements in Thailand and Australia, to offset losses through drought in South Africa and a probable downward reaction in both China and India.</p>

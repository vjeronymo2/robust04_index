			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn EMI steady Thorn EMI was buoyed by talk of disposals, with analysts believing that the music and rental group is currently in discussions with several companies about various aspects of its non-core business. Top of the sell list is the company's defence business, with GEC said to be keen. Other Thorn divisions being touted around for sale are said to include its security arm, the lighting business and its HMV record stores. This would leave Thorn to concentrate on its rental and music businesses, with some suggestions of a demeger further down the line. Thorn shares held steady at 872p. GEC fell 5 to 300p.</p>

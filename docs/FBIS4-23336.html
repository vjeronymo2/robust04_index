			<p>BFN     [Text] Harare Jun 2 SAPA -- Zimbabwe has opened an embassy  in Pretoria and consulates in Johannesburg and Cape Town, Ziana  News Agency reported on Thursday. Zimbabwe's Foreign Affairs  Ministry said the embassy was being headed by a Charge  d'Affaires Chitsaka Chipaziwa, who was previously in charge of  the ministry's Africa and Middle East Desk. The Johannesburg  consulate replaced the trade mission which was in place during  the apartheid era. It would be responsible for issuing visas  and travel documents and for attending to the welfare of  Zimbabwean citizens in South Africa. The Cape Town consulate  would, among other things, follow parliamentary sessions.    Zimbabwe was one of the harshest critics of South Africa's  racial policy and refused to establish full diplomatic links  with its southern neighbour until after democratic elections.</p>

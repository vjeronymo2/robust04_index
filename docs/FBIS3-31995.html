This MP was approved by 190  votes to 111 in the Chamber of Deputies and by 39 votes to five  in the Senate.    Now that MP No. 400 has been approved there are still five  fiscal adjustment-related MP's pending: MP No. 407 that  increases corporate income taxes 5 percent, MP No. 404 that  establishes an inspection tax that banks must pay, MP No. 401  that increases the tax on financial operations for investments  in the financial market, PM No. 394 that bans the use of  Treasury funds at the Central Bank to pay anything but debts,  and MP No. 392 on privatizations.    Throughout the day the administration managed to get  approval  for only three of the nine other MP's Congress had to vote on.  The obstructionist attitude of the PPR [Progressive Renewal  Party] and the PFL [Liberal Front Party], unwilling to approve  tax hikes, was jeopardizing the voting on the main fiscal  adjustment measures. The PFL and the PPR broke the agreement  they had reached with Finance Minister Henrique Cardoso the week  before and asked for quorum verification. Unless there were 252  deputies present (the minimum required) the entire time, the  session would be discontinued and it would be very difficult for  the administration to get approval for the MP's, which would  expire over the weekend.    During the morning and afternoon of 26 January, Congress  approved MP No. 402 that establishes an income tax on foreign  investments in the stock market and the distribution of  dividends, MP No. 399 that changes the Rural Land Tax (ITR), and  MP No. 406 that reduces the deadline for the collection of  federal taxes and contributions. In view of the inflexibility  of the PPR and the PFL, Jose Serra, Brazilian Social Democracy  Party speaker in the Chamber of Deputies, went so far as to  threaten to withdraw the administration's support for the  constitutional reform.</p>

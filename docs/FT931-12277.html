			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / G7 nuclear safety accord LEADING industrial nations, fearing another Chernobyl-style nuclear disaster, have finalised plans for a Dollars 700m (Pounds 452m) fund to improve safety at east European reactors, officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Bonn. Officials who took part in nearly six months of German-led talks by experts from the Group of Seven leading industrial states said the group had finally agreed on rules for the fund on Wednesday. They said swift approval by G7 governments was expected for the fund, to be administered by the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which specialises in helping Europe's former communist states. Other industrial countries were expected to join the G7 states - the US, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Britain and Italy - with contributions to the so-called 'nuclear safety account'. The fund will finance loans to east European governments for upgrading operations and hardware in projects that cannot be covered by bilateral aid. The safety improvements are meant for some of 32 Soviet-built reactors deemed safe enough to be worth upgrading, but another 26 reactors, most of them of the Chernobyl type, will be excluded.</p>

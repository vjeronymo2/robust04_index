Nigeria is not eligible for Japan's official development  assistance (ODA) since the regime has dissolved the parliament,  banned political rallies and taken other undemocratic measures,  government officials said.    Japan, however, will continue to provide emergency  humanitarian aid to the west African country, they said.    Japan will resume aid when Nigeria restores civilian rule,  the officials said.    By fiscal 1992, Japan had provided 87.4 billion yen in  yen-based loans to Nigeria, the second largest amount it had  given an African nation, next to Kenya.</p>

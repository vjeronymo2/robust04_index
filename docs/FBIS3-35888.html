			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ona Stankeviciute: "Past Ghost Is Reviving"] </F>   [Text] On 11-12 January, a conference of the "Curonian  Spit" national park of the Russian Federation was held in  Zelenogradsk (Kaliningrad Oblast). Apart from talk about the  employment of local residents, environmental protection, and  other issues, the mention of oil found in this area was casual  as it were. Our neighbors, the Russians, intend to utilize this  oil in the future by installing a DF-6 test drill. The  Lithuanians would not feel anxious if it were not the same site  that caused so many emotions in 1986. All intelligent people in  Lithuania defended the Curonian Spit against the possible threat  at that time.    Sensing huge profits, several German firms have submitted  their construction projects. Although the final decision has  not yet been adopted, Lithuania's fears may be valid. In case  of an accident or some other emergency, southwest winds  prevailing in this area would float all pollutants toward  Lithuania's shores. All this risk would be undertaken only for  a meager of oil resources which, according to scientists, equals  the two-year processing capacity of the Mazeikiai refinery.</p>

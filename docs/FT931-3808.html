			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Making a meal of screen violence: Dr Lecter feels guilty. Dominic Lawson says he need not worry, although his taste in wine is poor THIS year Anthony Hopkins was knighted perhaps for services to screen violence. In the Silence of the Lambs, Sir Anthony, as he then wasn't, played the part of a cannibal, Doctor Hannibal Lecter, whose favourite meal was human liver, washed down with Chianti. For this portrayal of gastronomic perversion - Chianti, for heaven's sake, not even a decent claret - Hopkins was also awarded an Oscar. Now the great Welsh actor says that it might have been a terrible mistake to have taken part in such a violent film. And the man who approved making Dr Hannibal into Sir Hannibal, John Major, has told the Conservative Party faithful in Harrogate that something must be done about 'the relentless diet of violence in the media'. Major's argument, assuming that as usual, he is following the conventional wisdom, seems to be that the impressionable imitate the violence they see on their screens. Being an impressionable fellow myself, I thought it safer not to go to see The Silence of The Lambs. Otherwise I might even now be imitating the main character, turning into a transvestite serial killer and stuffing the larvae of rare moths down the throats of my victims. Perhaps you too might be impressionable. Have you murdered anyone recently? You must have seen hundreds of murders on television or in the cinema. Surely some of it must have rubbed off on you. Or are you still the same law abiding citizen with no sudden craving to eat human flesh washed down with cheap Italian wine? Television has become a convenient alibi, and not just for politicians seeking to shift the blame for rising crime on to other shoulders. The idea of television as responsible agent is also a convenient alibi for those who most need it - criminals and their lawyers. You know the sort of thing: 'My Lord, my client was a perfectly harmless football hooligan with only a few minor offences - and then he saw Denis Potter's Lipstick on Your Collar. After that he promptly and understandably raped his wife. I ask for the Court's clemency.' The point is that people who commit violent crime are not like you and me. Their violence comes from within themselves, not down a television tube. In fact, the more time such people spend watching television the safer the rest of us are. What is undeniable is that violence on television can be distressing to watch, particularly for little children. Alan Yentob, the new controller of BBC 1, said, in response to Major, that it was up to parents to protect their children from violent television. Parents should not need to defend their children from the BBC. Auntie should not be like an unpredictable dog, a sort of electronic Rotweiler which needs to be locked up and kept away from children and old ladies. But Yentob is partly right: as adults we have a choice of what to watch and what not to watch. If we grown-ups do not like violence on television, we should vote with our fingers and switch off. The new crusaders against what is usually termed 'gratuitous violence' argue that we have lost the will to switch off, because we no longer have the sensitivity to be shocked. They say we have become 'desensitised' to violence, so that we can sit calmly grazing at our TV dinners while watching scenes of horrific bloodshed. This may be true, but if so, it is the images of bloodshed to which we have become accustomed, not the reality. In common with many viewers of television news I have become emotionally immune to scenes of harrowing brutality. But recently when I witnessed someone being run over by a car, I was shaken and shocked. That is why crowds immediately gather at such scenes. They know that this is the real thing, not 'gratuitous' at all, and something quite different in kind from the edited dramas of the television screen. Sir Anthony says that he will not do a sequel to Silence of the Lambs, so disturbed is he by the effects of film violence. It is a fine stand. But Sir Anthony should go ahead and keep his agent happy. The world will not be a more dangerous place if Dr Lecter reappears in our cinemas. And who knows, Sir Anthony might win another Oscar, and this time be rewarded with a peerage. Rough Stuff, Page XI Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The dilemma created by Radio Pretoria's continuing  broadcasts received attention at the highest level today.  President de Klerk discussed the controversial station's future  with telecommunications minister, Piet Welgemoed, and Post  Master General Ters Oosthuizen. They haven't issued a statement  yet.    Radio Pretoria was still broadcasting today four days after  the supreme court had ordered the Afrikaner Kultuurbond  [Cultural League] to get the station off the air. The  Kultuurbond lodged an application this morning to appeal against  the court order. A date for hearing the application has still  to be fixed.    At Radio Pretoria' Donkerhoek premises the station is  guarded  round the clock. Last week two officials of the Post Master  General's Office were turned back at the gate. Mr. Oosthuizen  says the officials did in fact have the necessary know-how for  sealing the transmitter, but they were not allowed in.</p>

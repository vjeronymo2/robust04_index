			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Philip Morris compounds early problems Wall Street A PROFITS warning from Philip Morris, and an unexpected drop in non-farm payrolls, combined with higher interest rates to push US share prices sharply lower yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 68.63 at 3,370.81, its lowest level in a month. The more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended down 8.92 at 441.38, while the Amex composite was down 5.25 at 417.52, and the Nasdaq composite down 16.81 at 669.83. Trading volume on the NYSE was 326m shares. Trading throughout the day was volatile and confusing. Before business opened, the Labor department published the March employment report, which showed that non-farm payrolls had fallen by 22,000 last month. Analysts had been expecting a rise of as much as 100,000. Although bond prices initially firmed on the news, they quickly reversed course after economists attributed the unexpectedly weak figure to bad weather, and noted that both January and February payrolls were revised upward - indicating a still relatively robust trend in payroll growth. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond had dropped by more than a point, pushing the yield back above 7 per cent for the first time in six weeks. This sharp rise in interest rates unnerved equity investors, who were also unhappy about the jobs data. Matters were complicated by the effect on the market of an announcement from Philip Morris that its operating earnings from the company's domestic tobacco businesses (which make up almost half of the group's profits) would fall by as much as 40 per cent this year. Philip Morris said that it planned to slash prices on its most popular cigarette brand in an attempt to halt the decline in its market share. The news sparked heavy selling of the stock, so heavy that trading in Philip Morris shares did not open for more than an hour, meaning that the impact of the story on the Dow was delayed. The index was down only a few points at 10.30am, but when trading in Philip Morris started, the Dow plunged another 30 points. After that, the index was never able to stage a recovery, and ended close to its lows for the day. Volume was extremely heavy at 26m shares. Other tobacco stocks were sharply lower, with American Brands down Dollars 3 3/4 at Dollars 30, RJR Nabisco Dollars 1 1/4 weaker at Dollars 6 3/4 , and Loews down Dollars 16 3/8 at Dollars 94. Cable television stocks continued to suffer from Thursday's news of regulatory-imposed price controls. Time Warner fell Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 30 3/4 and, on the Nasdaq, Comcast dropped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 17 3/4 and TCI fell Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 18 1/8 . Canada TORONTO share prices followed New York's lead and closed lower in active trading. According to preliminary figures, the TSE-300 index fell 19.48 points, or 0.54 per cent, to close at 3,595.07, for a loss on the week of just 5 points. Losing issues led winners by 372 to 325 and 59.524m shares changed hands at a value of CDollars 526.1m, compared with Thursday's totals of 66.544m shares worth CDollars 538.7m.</p>

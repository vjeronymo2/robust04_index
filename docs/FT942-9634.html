			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Unilever disappoints with Pounds 449m in opening quarter Unilever's shares fell 57p to Pounds 10.23p yesterday in response to first-quarter figures showing tough trading in both the US and Europe. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 449m to end-March, up 2 per cent from last year's Pounds 440m, were at the low end of expectations. US operating profits were halved at Pounds 10m, on sales up 7 per cent at Pounds 1.3bn, giving operating margins of just 0.7 per cent. Unilever said the fall in US profits was entirely due to the price war in liquid detergents, which began last summer and was already doing damage in last year's second half. US sales of personal products were sharply up on last year, and food and chemicals had also done well. European operating profits were 7 per cent higher at Pounds 303m, on sales up 1 per cent at Pounds 3.64bn. However, profits were helped by undisclosed proceeds from Falcon, a Swedish drinks business sold in the period. Sir Michael Perry, chairman, said trading conditions in Europe remained difficult, though speciality chemicals were 'encouraging'. In the rest of the world, operating profits were Pounds 167m (Pounds 159m), on sales of Pounds 1.75bn (Pounds 1.6bn). Performance had been good in south-east Asia and Latin America, Sir Michael said, but Brazil had been 'difficult'. Group turnover was up 4 per cent at Pounds 6.69bn. Group operating profit was also up 4 per cent at Pounds 480m. There was a sharp rise in net interest charges from Pounds 31m to Pounds 55m, due partly to the redemption of preference shares and partly to higher interest rates. This was partly offset by a Pounds 13m exceptional profit on property sales in Europe. After tax of Pounds 138m (Pounds 133m) and minorities of Pounds 12m (Pounds 14m), net profit was up 2 per cent at Pounds 299m, calculated at constant exchange rates. At current rates profits were fractionally lower, as were earnings per share at 15.74p (15.8p). During the period, Unilever maintained an active programme of 12 acquisitions and 10 disposals, at a net cost of Pounds 520m. Net debt rose Pounds 400m to Pounds 2.2bn, with gearing rising to 30 per cent. This was due to the cost of refinancing preference capital as well as to the acquisition programme, the company said.

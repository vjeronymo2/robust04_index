			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COPPER prices fell in dollar terms at the London Metal Exchange in what dealers described as a consolidation following recent strong gains. The three months price ended Dollars 10 lower at Dollars 2,350 a tonne. The dealers noted that the market was still holding support levels. A late technical sell-off snuffed out a partial rally in ALUMINIUM, the three months position closing at Dollars Dollars 1,232 a tonne, down Dollars 13.25. Trading in aluminium was fairly volatile, with the market under early pressure from option-linked selling. But it moved off its lows when Dollars 1,200 call (buying) strikes were exercised. NICKEL was easier following early losses, although prices held near the middle of the day's range. Three months metal closed at Dollars 6,297.50 a tonne, down Dollars 115, and fell another Dollars 17.50 in after hours trading. SILVER prices were firmer, with the cash position closing 4 cents higher at 371.50 cents a troy ounce. But dealers were not expecting further gains. 'We did actually see quite good selling most of the way up, so silver has probably done enough for now,' one said. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTERPUNCH: RECORD FIRMS DON'T BACK DECEPTION  </P> <P> Milli Vanilli isn't going to be soon forgotten. It's a catchword that will  always be good for a laugh -- like the Edsel. And, unhappily, this synonym for  "phony" will forever be associated with the record business.  </P> <P> But Milli Vanilli is an aberration, a symbol of vaunting ambition gone awry.  Those of us in the business of finding and dealing with creative artists,  packaging and selling their records don't knowingly deal with deception, nor do  we encourage it from any quarter.  </P> <P> Still, we are an industry that is expected to earn a profit, and that simple  mandate can lead to excesses when the profit can't be attained in a normal  manner -- and there are lots of temptations being handed to us by technology.  </P> <P> It's now possible to put together a record with no musicians, no voices, no  anything. But why would we want to? It's not what we do. There are so many  legitimate, talented artists out there who can produce good music and offer  exciting performances that we would be fools if we deliberately set out to make  fraudulent records.  </P> <P> If I were a record producer today, I would make sure that I selected singers  who could sing; if I were going to take nobodies and make them somebodies, I  would be sure they were nobodies who could sing.  </P> <P> The Milli Vanilli affair spotlights the kind of technology it now takes to  produce records and the kind of image it, unfortunately, takes to sell some of  them. Record companies have no way of policing every studio and recording  session to make sure that the people credited with making an album are in fact  the ones performing on it. We assume they are.  </P> <P> But the technology of making records has taken us long past the days when a  Frank Sinatra could cut a record simply by coming into a studio and singing  while a live orchestra backed him.  </P> <P> Nowadays, making a record is like putting together an elaborate and complicated  jigsaw puzzle -- with only the producer having any idea of the whole picture,  with record-company executives unable to even see any work in progress.  </P> <P> There may be a rhythm track laid down first, then horns or other instruments  added; next, a vocal layer, then perhaps a back-up vocal. The various pieces  may be "sweetened" and modified in other ways long before the lead vocalist or  vocalists ever get there.  </P> <P> All along the way, there are opportunities to substitute other people for those  who are said to be there. We don't have someone in every recording studio  taking fingerprints. True, technology enables us to add augmentation in the  studio to various singers and instruments -- that happens all the time -- but  that doesn't mean there's widespread deception occurring.  </P> <P> Contemporary music is made by talented writers and performers who avail  themselves of technology to create the best audio experience possible --  synthesizers, 64-track recording facilities, drum machines are all now  available and make for wonderful listening experiences. Motion pictures and  television have been dubbing and using special effects forever. Where is it  written that we have to make music with a single microphone overhead and  include every mistake?  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the Milli Vanilli matter is a left-field intrusion. Even if the  record company was aware of the circumstances, even if Arista messed this one  up and made a mistake, it's not what the company's about. Arista is a company  that records and sells talented musicians -- Dionne Warwick, Aretha Franklin,  Whitney Houston, Hall &amp; Oates and many others. It doesn't need to resort to  deceptive practices to make money. I don't think any major player in this  industry is unethical in what it presents to the public.  </P> <P> But we are an industry that pays off big when you make it. That attracts a  certain amount of hustlers and opportunists. Milli Vanilli sold 7 million  albums in the United States alone, an additional 3 million in Europe. With  publishing, performing, video and subsequent personal appearances, this puts at  least $20 million to $30 million in play.  </P> <P> Video, of course, is the magic force behind a lot of the smoke and mirrors that  made up Milli Vanilli. Without video -- MTV, music videos, video advertising --  audio wouldn't sell as well these days. Music critics in today's media wish  that MTV weren't so. Maybe a lot of us in the music business wish that it  weren't so, that we weren't subject to brief video bites. But it is what it is.  </P> <P> We are dealing with a video generation that has grown up with MTV for the last  decade. Now, as the head of a recording company I have to make decisions that  take that into consideration, and so does every other recording company  executive. Because of the high stakes involved, it will be possible to pull off  another Milli Vanilli, but not because we in this business want it.  </P> <P> This situation will cause us all to check a little closer, but I assure you  that no checking will have to be done with artists of the stature of Paul  Simon, Bonnie Raitt, Stevie Wonder, Phil Collins, Quincy Jones or any of the  hundreds of other great creative men and women who make up the enormous body of  American contemporary popular music that's been the standard to which every  young musician around the world has aspired for decades.  </P></p>

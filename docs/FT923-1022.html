			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Pointing a finger is pure speculation - James Blitz and Emma Tucker on who brought Europe's currencies down AFTER the unprecedented turmoil on the foreign exchanges in recent weeks, politicians and popular newspapers are baying for blood. In Britain, Italy and Spain, politicians and central bankers are pointing accusing fingers at the speculators in the banks for forcing their currencies into humiliating devaluations. As the French franc battled against devaluation this week, Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, warned that during the French revolution speculators were beheaded. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK Chancellor has described the 'huge speculative flows' that drove the pound out of the exchange rate mechanism as a 'whirlwind'. Foreign exchange analysts maintain that this is too simple a view of the market. 'The foreign exchange market involves everybody from people going on holiday to government pension funds,' said Mr Jim O'Neill, research head at Swiss Banking Corp in London. 'The number of people who can be involved is enormous and the idea that it was just speculators at the banks causing all the problems last week is utter rubbish.' There is little doubt that some interbank dealers have made big profits from the recent devaluations. It has been in the dealers' interests to sell sterling, the lira and the peseta when the currencies were at their floor levels in the exchange rate mechanism, forcing a devaluation. The dealers could then buy the currency back for less money at the devalued rate, and make a profit on the difference. But bank dealers say that such speculation formed only a small part of the recent trading in European currencies, and that strict guidelines limit the amount by which they can speculate. Mr Peter Wood, Barclays finance director, said: 'Barclays has strict prudential position limits, agreed with the Bank of England, that control our ability to take risks in the markets.' Foreign exchange analysts believe there are three other types of investors who, through the banks which operate on their behalf in the foreign exchange markets, in effect forced sterling, the lira and the peseta to devalue in recent days. Corporate treasurers, who took fright and sold the currencies as devaluation loomed. UK importers, for example, would have wanted to protect themselves from the greater costs of a sterling devaluation by buying D-Marks. This was potentially a big movement of funds. It is said by critics of the way in which the foreign exchange markets operate that only 5 per cent of transactions carried out daily reflect underlying movements in trade between countries, while the rest is pure speculation. But one London-based analyst disagreed, saying that the 5 per cent did not take into account the boom in currency hedging by big corporations since the mid-1980s. The huge fluctuations in the dollar/D-Mark rate in the 1980s encouraged companies then to buy forward contracts and swaps to protect their trading positions. 'This dealing puts the figure for corporate-based trade in the market at 20 per cent,' he says. Pension and investment fund managers in the US, Europe and Japan, an even bigger group of players, who have developed big currency exposures in the last five years. These institutions can have a much bigger potential impact on the foreign exchange market than the interbank dealers. A currency dealing room at a leading foreign exchange bank will have tens of millions of pounds with which to buy currencies in the market on a daily basis. But a big pension fund is able to move funds into different currencies to the tune of billions of pounds if it so wished. These investment funds invested heavily in currencies with the globalisation of the securities market in the mid-1980s. They bought currencies to hedge themselves against the risk that their underlying assets would lose their value with currency movements. Although they take a long-term view of the markets, the big funds, especially in the US, were widely reported to be selling sterling in huge quantities last Wednesday. A broad range of investors around the world who bought currencies such as sterling and the lira in the mid-1980s for speculative reasons. The currencies had high interest rates attached and were believed to be an increasingly safe bet as the European Monetary Union project developed and inflation rates converged. Mr Brendan Brown, head of research at Mitsubishi Bank in London, estimates that Pounds 40bn to Pounds 50bn worth of short-term capital flowed into the UK between 1985 and 1992 from investors attracted by high UK interest rates. Britain's entry into the ERM, which tied sterling to the D-Mark and heralded the prospect of lower inflation, encouraged the investors further. This investment in the pound was massively reversed this summer. A fund manager at a large US bank has pointed out that Middle East and Far East clients were becoming increasingly worried about sterling ever since devaluation started to be mentioned by backbench politicians in the UK as early as June. 'If only 20 per cent of those who had bought sterling pulled their money out of the UK last week that would have accounted for the selling of Pounds 10bn,' said Mr Brown. The big winners in the sterling crisis according to Mr Brown, were not the interbank dealers, but these short-term investors in sterling. 'By buying the pound in the 1980s, they got a high return on the investment. When the Bank of England bought sterling last Wednesday, it in effect allowed these investors to get out of the currency without incurring any losses.'</p>

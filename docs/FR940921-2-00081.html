Consistent with that definition, aircraft leases are treated as conveyances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Leases and other conveyances are frequently submitted for recordation to the Civil Aviation Registry (the Registry). Prior to submitting documents to the Registry, law firms will often request the opinion of the FAA Assistant Chief Counsel for the Aeronautical Center with respect to questions concerning registration or recordation. In the last several years, when submitting such documents, law firms have typically asked the Assistant Chief Counsel a question similar to this: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> We hereby request your opinion that the Lease Amendment, with (i) Exhibit B (Table of Stipulated Loss Values), (ii) Exhibit C (Table of Basic Rents) and (iii) Exhibit D (End of Term Buyout Percentage) intentionally omitted from the FAA filing counterpart thereof as containing confidential information, is eligible for recordation under section 503(a) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Assistant Chief Counsel typically responds by permitting recordation with such omissions.

You argue that FAA's permitting the nondisclosure of such information is contrary to the public interest because the deleted information is essential in making fair and accurate assessments of a carrier's financial status, its safety and maintenance reserves and meaningful debt analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> You request FAA to immediately stop its policy of permitting recordation of incomplete document, or, in the alternative, to initiate formal rulemaking procedures allowing for public comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As your know, your letter was distributed as an attachment to FAA's letter of September 27, 1993, which requested advice from interested persons concerning the legal and policy issues. We received responses from 17 concerned parties including attorneys, airlines, appraisers, the Air Transport Association, and the editor of ``Commercial Aviation Report.'' Twelve responses favored continuation of the FAA policy of permitting omissions. Five responses opposed it. Their positions will be discussed herein. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on review of the comments and our reconsideration of the issues, we have decided to continue permitting the recordation of documents with limited omissions or redactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As set out in your letter of September 1, 1993, and letters from Rocklin D. Lyons and Associates; Jack B. Feir and Associates; Aircraft Information Services, Inc.; Avitas Aviation; and ``Commercial Aviation Report,'' principal arguments in support of FAA acceptance of only complete instruments are the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is urged that obtaining capital to finance transactions involving transport aircraft is highly competitive. In making decisions, lenders rely heavily on information concerning financial health of an airline, as well as the real market value of aircraft. The market value is frequently determined by appraisals which are based on recent comparable transactions. A principal source of information about comparables is found in the Registry's aircraft records. If financial and other information considered proprietary is permitted to be deleted, market value appraisals become more speculative. As a result, conservative investors are less likely to back transactions where the real value of the collateral is not reliable. It is urged that will hurt the aviation industry., <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, it is urged that the overall financial situation of an airline is often discernible from a review of recorded transactions. As an example, one commenter pointed out that although a particular airline, as a public company, had filed all documents required by the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Transportation (DOT), it was only through a thorough review of the Registry's aircraft record that the ``true extent of its financial woes'' became known. The resulting publication of the ``carrier's precarious condition'' allegedly resulted in financial institutions withdrawing from transactions with the airline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The same commenter pointed out that SEC and DOT do not provide current information and retain such information only for a limited time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to legality, an attorney suggests that a document with schedules deleted is not a ``conveyance'' because in defining a contract, Black's Law Dictionary says: the writing *&blank;*&blank;* contains the agreement of the parties with the terms and conditions*&blank;*&blank;*. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> He argues that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHAMBER PRESENTS ITS DOWNZONING PLAN;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: ADVOCATES OF THE ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY SAY IT WILL DAMAGE PROPERTY  VALUES LESS THAN THE CITY'S GROWTH-CONTROL PLAN.  </P> <P> The Glendale Chamber of Commerce said Tuesday that a six-month land survey by  more than 100 volunteers shows that the city can scale down development in a  way that will do less damage to property values than a city proposal would do.  </P> <P> Chamber officials said the study supports an alternative plan they presented  several months ago, which they said would give property owners an option to  increase the value of their land by making it part of a larger project built on  adjoining lots.  </P> <P> The chamber's study shows its plan still would accomplish the Glendale City  Council's goal of limiting construction to about 10,000 more apartments or  condominiums, chamber officials said.  </P> <P> To curb Glendale's population boom, the City Council is considering proposals  to change the zoning in areas earmarked for multiple-family buildings, so that  fewer new units can be built.  </P> <P> After hearing a summary of the study Tuesday, council members praised the  chamber's work but said they would not abandon their own strategy of reducing  growth by downzoning -- changing zoning regulations to permit fewer multifamily  residential units to be built.  </P> <P> Initially, the council considered a blanket downzoning plan to reduce housing  density citywide. In March, the council decided to tailor growth limits to  local conditions in 25 selected neighborhoods. That review will resume June 5.  </P> <P> "I think we still have to go neighborhood by neighborhood and see what the  result is," Mayor Larry Zarian said.  </P> <P> The council's downzoning plans have triggered an outcry from many property  owners, who say that allowing fewer units on their lots will dramatically  reduce the value of their land.  </P> <P> The primary difference between the chamber plan and the city's is that the  former would allow an increase in the number of apartments or condominiums on a  site if a builder added adjoining lots. That would increase the value of each  lot, chamber officials say.  </P> <P> For example, the city's plan might allow no more than two four-unit apartment  buildings on adjacent lots. But under the chamber's plan, a developer who  purchased both could build a single 12-unit complex.  </P> <P> "The question is, 'How is the council going to minimize the damage to the  property owners and at the same time manage growth in the city?' " said Hamo  Rostamian, a developer who heads the chamber's housing and urban development  committee. "We believe we have provided a viable solution to that."  </P> <P> He said volunteers from the real estate industry and other businesses spent the  past six months conducting a lot-by-lot visual inspection of Glendale's  neighborhoods zoned for multifamily housing. The volunteers counted 4,572 lots  where single-family houses, duplexes and triplexes could be replaced by larger  apartment or condominium complexes.  </P> <P> The volunteers also identified places where lots could be combined for the  higher-density projects allowed under the chamber plan. The study concluded  that the maximum number of new apartments or condominiums that could be built  in Glendale under the chamber's plan would be 10,208.  </P> <P> Those could house about 27,000 new residents under the chamber's calculations,  and up to 35,000 by the city's estimate.  </P> <P> Councilman Jerold Milner said he was pleased that the chamber agrees with the  council's goal of capping growth at about 10,000 more units. But he said he  objects to rewarding developers who can assemble a large project on adjoining  lots.  </P> <P> "Their proposal up front discriminates against single-lot owners," Milner said.  "It gives a significant economic advantage to a professional developer. I think  that's wrong."  </P> <P> He said the chamber's plan provides no relief to a person who owns a single lot  between two large apartment complexes, with no chance of using the land for a  combined-lot project. Milner said the council's neighborhood-by-neighborhood  review will look for ways to help such property owners.  </P> <P> The chamber's Rostamian said larger housing projects should be encouraged  because they are usually better managed and have more flexibility in design. He  said building one large project is less disruptive to a neighborhood than a  series of smaller ones.  </P> <P> Councilman Carl Raggio said he was pleased to see that the chamber's study  corroborated some of the growth predictions prepared independently by the  city's staff.  </P> <P> Now that there is wide agreement that the city should allow only about 10,000  new apartments and condominiums, the council must agree on a downzoning formula  to reach that goal, Raggio said.  </P> <P> He said some elements of the chamber's proposal could be incorporated into the  final plan adopted by the council.  </P> <P> The council has imposed a moratorium on new apartment and condominium  construction while the downzoning plan is being prepared. City Manager David H.  Ramsay predicted Tuesday that the council's review will last at least three  more months.  </P></p>

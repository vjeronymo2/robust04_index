			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NANNY SCHOOLS 'PUT THE POLISH' ON CHILD CARE  </P> <P> With the attentiveness of a mother, Jodi Roderick gently stroked the back of  6-month-old Elizabeth Cross, who lay on a quilt amid the suburban elegance of  The Claremont Club.  </P> <P> Roderick's blue smock, displaying an embroidered antique pram, testified to her  calling. She is a student at the American Nanny College, in Claremont and  Montclair. As part of the college's learning laboratory, she and 10 other  students care for the infants of parents who drop off their children before  swimming, playing tennis or exercising at the club.  </P> <P> By September, Roderick, a graduate of Redlands High School, will have completed  her three-month course. And then, she said, she hopes to become a full-time,  live-in nanny.  </P> <P> "All the girls here love children. This is just an opportunity to learn to love  them professionally," said Roderick, 19, as she baby-sat in the club's day-care  center.  </P> <P> Nanny schools across America are training women, and even a few men, to fill  the growing child-care needs of not only the wealthy, but of working  professionals.  </P> <P> "It's an anthropological experiment. We're bringing a British idea to America,  and it's an idea whose time has come," said Beverly P. Benjamin, who founded  the American Nanny College six years ago in Claremont, when only a handful of  nanny schools existed in the United States.  </P> <P> Now more than 50 educational institutions offer nanny training.  </P> <P> A company that runs bartender schools last year -- in an oddly American twist  -- bought a Beverly Hills nanny school, which has since relocated to Van Nuys.  Furthermore, Benjamin said, the operator of a truck-driving school has  expressed interest in getting into the booming business.  </P> <P> "There's a tremendous demand for in-home child care," said Sandra Lewis,  director of the Nanny Institute of Beverly Hills. "But it just hasn't been a  part of our American culture for people to go to school to learn how to care  for children in the home."  </P> <P> But acceptance of nanny training has grown, she said, and the American nanny  movement has matured in the process. Now, Lewis said, classes at her school  have expanded from 25 students a year to about 500 a year. Claremont's American  Nanny College has trained over 200 nannies and two mannies, the male  counterpart.  </P> <P> In California, there are also nanny schools in Huntington Beach and Sacramento.  </P> <P> Benjamin, a professor in child development at Chaffey College in Alta Loma, had  founded her nanny college with two partners: Deborah Davis, a colleague at  Chaffey, and British-trained nanny Diana Forne. Her two former partners have  developed the International Nanny Assn., a nonprofit clearinghouse for nannies  and nanny schools. Originally based in Pomona, it is now in Austin, Tex.  </P> <P> Lewis is writing a textbook for nanny training. And, as a way to standardize  training, the American Council of Nanny Schools wants to create a national  nanny exam and the designation of CPN, or Certified Professional Nanny,  Benjamin said. She said she is also considering ways to place temporary  nannies, who can care for children when they are sick and cannot go to school.  And she is investigating the possibility of training and employing homeless  women as nannies.  </P> <P> Benjamin said she isn't bothered that these ideas seem remote from the British  prim and proper nanny. "There is no stereotype of the American nanny," said  Benjamin.  </P> <P> The British nanny, she said, had to learn "to iron diapers with an iron heated  on a stove because she might be in Africa some day during a revolution . . . or  in India. A nanny would go and be a little bit of England in the remote areas  of the empire."  </P> <P> Yet the basic idea is the same whether in America or Britain. "The British  nanny was trained to raise the child whether the lord and lady were there or  not," she said.  </P> <P> Like their British counterparts, American nanny schools teach manners and  social graces. "We put the polish on the person who has the background in child  care," Benjamin said.  </P> <P> But the schools also deal with such topics as how to help children deal with  loss and grief, and "how to clean everything." Benjamin's students spend one  day in seminars with Magda Gerber, a Los Angeles educator whose theories of  letting children develop at their own pace have gained attention.  </P> <P> The students also visit art museums and hear lectures on music as a way to  elevate their awareness of the fine arts. "At one time we even had seven- and  nine-course meals," Benjamin said.  </P> <P> Students read books on childhood education and take courses in household  management and self-esteem. Fashion consultants work with them on developing  their image. All of this, Benjamin said, is designed to make the students more  professional and more marketable.  </P> <P> In America, it is not just the wealthy who take advantage of the newly trained  crop of nannies. Benjamin estimates that 50% of the families that now hire  nannies are two-career couples, with the rest evenly divided among the rich and  single parents, who often must struggle to pay nanny costs.  </P> <P> The nannies start off earning at least $200 a week, in addition to their room  and board.  </P> <P> For all the expense involved, Benjamin said, "parents really want somebody who  rides on a magic umbrella . . . a Mary Poppins."  </P> <P> But nanny students say this British image has little to do with attracting them  to the profession; their principal interest is the satisfaction gained from  one-on-one child care. "They aren't all looking for life among the country club  set," Benjamin said.  </P> <P> "As a matter of fact, I never saw Mary Poppins," said student Helen Benton, 57.  (The fictional character actually was not a nanny, but a governess, whose job  included educating older children.)  </P> <P> Working as a nanny, Benton said, is her way of countering what she sees as the  impersonal values today in American society, which "seems more concerned with  things instead of people."  </P> <P> For Benton, who worked for two years at a day-care center, being a nanny will  offer the opportunity to develop an intensely personal relationship with a  child. She is excited by the prospect.  </P> <P> "When children want love, they're not particular -- whether they get it from  their mother, their father or a nanny," she said.  </P></p>

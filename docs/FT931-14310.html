			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Brother Industries turns in full-year operating loss BROTHER Industries, the Japanese office equipment and sewing machine maker, yesterday reported a full-year operating loss of Y1.27bn (Dollars 10.8m), the first since its listing 31 years ago and a sign of the extreme pressure on the country's machinery makers. The company managed to register a pre-tax profit in the year to end-November of Y1.1bn, down 69 per cent, but said a 2.7 per cent fall in sales to Y160.8bn was responsible for the turnround from an operating profit of Y481m in the previous year. Having announced a restructuring plan last year, under which the product line is to be trimmed by 30 per cent and 10 per cent of workers are to be transferred to new ventures, Brother is under pressure to make deeper cuts. It said yesterday executives' bonuses would be halted, but its real problem was a shrinking sales base and increasing competition in the office equipment market, which had been targeted for sales growth. Sales have now fallen for three consecutive years, and the ambition to rely increasingly on sales of office equipment and other industrial machinery has been undermined by the sharp fall in capital spending by Japanese companies. Brother said domestic sales fell 8.5 per cent over the year, and while exports to the US increased, there was weaker demand from Europe. For the current year, sales are expected to decline by a further 2.3 per cent to Y157bn, while pre-tax profit is forecast to rise 64 per cent to Y1.8bn.</p>

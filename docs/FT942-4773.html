			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Water company gearing should be questioned Sir, Lex concludes (May 30) that the ability of water companies to meet the efficiency targets of Ofwat, the regulator, is what matters to shareholders. Not for him to inquire why an industry with the highest quality of earnings is so lowly geared? The combination of an indispensable product and captive customers cries out for the maximum of cheap debt finance and the minimum of expensive equity. Instead, we have the alchemy of water into gold, a regulated high-reward, albeit risk-free, industry. Today's customers are being doubly milked to provide shareholders with a generous dividend pay-out and, through substantial retained earnings, much of the equity for projects to improve water quality and the environment for the next generation of customers. Ofwat should derail this low risk/high reward gravy train by calculating its 'inflation minus x per cent' water charge formula on the assumption that most of the ring-fenced capital employed is financed with index-linked bonds. In order to minimise the need for interest cover, Ofwat should state the obvious - monopoly water suppliers do not go bankrupt and hence will always be allowed to meet their debt payments. Equity's role would be diminished to that of ensuring effective management. Ofwat would then be able to fine tune the water charge formula so as handsomely to reward shareholders of well-managed water companies at little cost to customers.

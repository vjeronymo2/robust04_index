			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Esteban Huertas G.] </F>   [Text] A recent investigation carried out by LA ESTRELLA DE  PANAMA disclosed that the Electoral Tribunal has determined that  the sale of all alcoholic beverages and the use of firearms will  be prohibited beginning 7 May. By mean of two decrees, the  Electoral Tribunal established that all bars, nightclubs, and  dance halls are to remain closed as of 1200 on Saturday, 7 May,  until 1200 on 9 May. The sale of wine, beer, and other fermented  beverages have also been banned during this 72-hour [as  published] period.    With respect to the use of firearms, the Electoral Tribunal  determined that private citizens are barred from carrying  firearms from 8 May until after 9 May, with the exception of the  police authorities who by virtue of their responsibilities are  required to carry arms. The decree warns that any person caught  violating these firearms restrictions will be penalized by  having the weapons confiscated and being given fines ranging  from 10 to 250 balboas. On the other hand, the Government and  Justice Ministry decided to prohibit the importation of all  hunting weapons between during the period 31 March and 31 May of  the current year.    Individuals violating these decrees will remain in the  custody of the National Police until 31 May 1994. These decrees  are aimed at ensuring citizen's harmony as well as respect and  order for the individual's constitutional rights during the 8  May election process.</p>

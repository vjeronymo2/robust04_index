			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 27 Feb -- The release of those responsible  for the October bloodshed in Moscow who have been given an  amnesty by the State Duma will only assist their return to  active politics. This opinion was set out in an interview  Mikhail Poltoranin, member of the "Russia's Choice" faction of  deputies and chairman of the Committee for Information Policy in  the State Duma, gave to an ITAR-TASS correspondent. In his  view, following the release of the "Lefortovo" inmates, "the  president must not slacken his grip on the reins of power,  otherwise the carriage of Russian statehood could go off the  rails."    For his part, the former KGB head, Vadim Bakatin, speaking  from political and professional experience, forecasts that "in  the present circumstances many of the Lefortovo inmates will  rush to whip up the crowd to act against the president." If  events turn out that way, he suggests, the force of the law will  have to be applied at once to political adventurists.</p>

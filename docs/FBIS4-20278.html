			<p>BFN     [Text] Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has stated  that Turkey wants a just, permanent, viable, and realistic  solution in Cyprus. After attending the meeting of the Islamic  Conference Organization's Bosnia-Herzegovina Contact Group in  New York, Cetin returned to Turkey.    In a statement he issued at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport on  his  return, Cetin said Turkey wants a Cyprus solution more than  anybody else. Cetin stressed, however, that a solution which  will result in reestablishing the pre-1974 hardships is not  possible. Indicating that the leaders of the two communities  meeting between themselves is a means toward a realistic  solution, Cetin stated that on this issue Turkey supports the  Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and will continue to do so.  Cetin further noted that there can be no question of applying  pressure regarding this issue.</p>

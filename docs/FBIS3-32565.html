			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Managua, 9 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- General Humberto  Ortega, chief of the Nicaraguan Army, announced today the  cessation of military operations against the so-called 3-80  Northern Front of the Nicaraguan "recontras" to allow the rebels  a "short period" to disarm. The announcement was made at the  end of a meeting attended by Gen. Ortega; Government Minister  Alfredo Mendieta; Sergio Caramagna, coordinator of the  International Support and Vertification Commission of the OAS  (CIAV-OAS); and Monsignor Eddy Montenegro, representative of the  Nicaraguan Catholic Church.    The decision to temporarily suspend the military offensive  is  designed to allow the peace commission, comprised of  representatives of the Catholic Church and the CIAV-OAS, to  contact the rebel leaders so that disarmament can begin quickly,  Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta explained.    The truce "only covers the operational area" of the 3-80  Northern Front led by former contra Jose Angel Talavera, alias  "Chacal," Ortega said, after noting that the order took effect  at 0001 (0501 GMT) Wednesday [9 February]. He added that in the  rest of the country, where some rearmed groups and common  criminals are active, military operations will continue to  preserve the "security" of the citizens. "If the negotiations  (for disarmament) fail, the offensive will continue," Ortega  said.    The "recontras" had announced a unilateral cease-fire  effective tomorrow, Thursday, as a "goodwill gesture" to seek  peace and a negotiated solution to the armed conflict in  northern Nicaragua.    Gen. Ortega, who did not indicate exactly what territory  will  be covered by the military truce, said this will allow the  evacuation of "recontras" wounded in the recent fighting who  have not yet received medical attention and have been caught in  the crossfire.    The armed group led by "Chacal" operates principally in the  mountains of Quilali Municipality in Nueva Segovia Department on  the Honduran border.    "This truce sets a reasonable term in which the date for  disarmament (of the `recontras') can be established, which we  hope will be done as quickly as possible," Mendieta added, after  noting that the government will guarantee the lives and security  of rebels who lay down their weapons and rejoin civilian life.  Mendieta insisted "there will be no political-type  negotiations" with leaders of the 3-80 Northern Front for the  disarmament and demobilization of the recontras and that the  government "is ready to start responding to their social  demands." "I believe this is the best chance we have of solving  the armed conflict and of peacefully resolving problems,"  Minister Mendieta said.    For his part, Sergio Caramagna, the CIAV-OAS coordinator in  Nicaragua, said that in the coming hours they will attempt to  contact "recontra" leaders to convey the government's proposal  in an effort to end the armed conflict in the north. Caramanga  also announced that he is taking a letter from Gen. Ortega to  the "recontras" in which the military chief explains the  facilities that will be extended for their disarmament in order  that the "tragedy" being experienced by people in that part of  the country may end soon.    According to the Army, the 3-80 Northern Front led by  "Chacal," one of the most belligerent armed groups, is made up  of 400 recontras, although a similar number of armed groups and  common criminals operate within the country.    The phenomenon of the "recontras" began in 1991, after the  government failed to provide several thousands of the 22,000  demobilized "contras" with the means for rejoining civilian life.</p>

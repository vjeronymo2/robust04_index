			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In June 1992, the ATA again requested that the FAA extend the May 26, 1994, DFDR compliance date for its members and similarly situated operators. In the alternative, the ATA requested that the FAA establish a delayed DFDR retrofit schedule that coincided with the State 3 transition interim compliance dates to avoid having to install new DFDR's on airplanes that were scheduled to be retired. The ATA asserted that the compliance deadline would require its members to install DFDR's on Stage 2 airplanes that would be retired within 51/2 years of the May 1994 compliance date to remain in compliance with the part 91 noise operating rule. The ATA asserted that this DFDR retrofit requirement for Stage 2 airplanes would impose substantial costs on them with little perceived benefit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ATA cited several factors in support of its petition, including the estimated cost of DFDR retrofit, the cost and lead time in accomplishing the engineering work to support the retrofit, the impact of retiring Stage 2 airplanes that were DFDR retrofitted, the required review of agency rules to insure that benefits are maximized, and the argument that flight data recorders do not enhance aircraft safety. The ATA concluded that the DFDR retrofit would no longer be viewed as cost beneficial because of the noted events and circumstances that have occurred since the rule was promulgated in 1987. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A summary of the petition was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on August 12, 1992. Two comments were received, both of which opposed the petitioner's request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A DFDR manufacturer opposed the exemption, citing the number of unsolved accidents, the extended life of commercial airplanes, and the possibility of further expenses associated with a delay in compliance with &sect;121.343(c) as its reasons for opposing the exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) opposed the exemption because (1) it would delay the safety benefits to be gained by the DFDR retrofit; (2) the need for and safety benefits of having 11-parameter recorders were well established; and (3) linking the DFDR requirement to the operating noise rules of part 91 could result in non-complying aircraft being flown beyond the year 2000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 29, 1993, after considering all the data presented by the ATA and the commenters, the FAA determined that a grant of exemption was justified and in the public interest. Exemption No. 5593 permits ATA members to operate certain Stage 2 airplanes equipped with DFDR's that have 6 rather than 11 operational parameters. Operation is allowed subject to certain conditions and limitations, including the requirement that air carriers submit a list of their Stage 2 aircraft that will be retired by December 31, 1998. The terms of the exemption allow non-ATA air carriers to apply for coverage under the exemption if they are similarly situated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 30, 1993, the FAA amended Exemption No. 5593 to clarify certain conditions that were being misinterpreted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Air Transport Association's Petition for Rulemaking <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 17, 1993, the ATA submitted a petition for rulemaking to amend &sect;121.343. The ATA states that the previously granted exemption does not provide the scope of relief necessary for its members and similarly situated air carriers, and that a change to the rule is necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ATA requests that &sect;121.343(c) be amended to reflect the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Installation of 11-parameter DFDR's be required only for those airplanes that will be in the fleet beyond December 31, 1999. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Installation of 11-parameter DFDR's in those airplanes (those that will remain in the fleet beyond December 31, 1999, including Stage 3 airplanes) would be accomplished on a phased compliance schedule with the option of retiring or retrofitting a percentage of the operator's fleet as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After December 31, 1994, at least 25 percent of the Operator's fleet on U.S. operations specifications that do not have the 11-parameter DFDR installed must be retired or have the 11-parameter DFDR installed; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After December 31, 1996, at least 50 percent must be retired or have the 11-parameter DFDR installed; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After December 31, 1998, at least 75 percent must be retired or have the 11-parameter DFDR installed; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After December 31, 1999, 100 percent must be retired or have the 11-parameter DFDR installed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As justification for this proposed change, the ATA states in its petition that, if 10 of its operators were to comply with the retrofit requirements of &sect;121.343(c) by May 28, 1994, the cost would exceed $29 million. The ATA petition does not specify how these costs were computed, or what portion applies to aircraft that would be retired. The ATA does state that if non-ATA-member carriers were considered, the cost estimate would be at least double. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

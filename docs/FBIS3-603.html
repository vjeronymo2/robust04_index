The SAAF member was detained on Tuesday in terms of the  military discipline code. He was giving his "full co-operation"  in the investigation, a statement said.    An SAAF spokesman would not be drawn on suggestions that at  least three SAAF members could soon be detained after the theft  of what the SAAF called "about 50 light weapons".    Police spokesman Evan Johnson said on Wednesday a "large  amount" of weapons seemed at this stage to be missing. The exact  figure was still being determined through stock checks.    All possible motives were being investigated and it was not  clear if the thest had a political connotation, Capt Johnson  said. A reward of up to R100,000 [rand] had been posted for  information leading to the arrest and conviction of those  responsible.    The African National Congress has expressed concern at the  regularity of raids on SADF [South African Defense Force] arms  depositories, especially in the light of the fact that South  African Communist Party General Secretary Chris Hani was  assassinated with a weapon stolen from the SADF.</p>

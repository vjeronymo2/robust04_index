			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CEAUSESCU'S EXECUTION  </P> <P> A story by Times staff writer Robert C. Toth (Part A, Dec. 23) concerning  deposed Romanian dictator Ceausescu poses a disturbing question about our  government's behavior now and in the past 100 years. "Ceausescu's fall,"  comments the writer, "is laden with irony.  </P> <P> Despite his brutally repressive domestic policies, he was long treated by  Washington as the darling of East European leaders because during his 24 years,  he refused to follow Moscow's foreign policy line."  </P> <P> We have long been good at cozying up to brutal and repressive rulers  (exchanging state visits, toasting the tyrants' devotion to "freedom," training  and equipping their "defense forces," and otherwise propping them up) so long  as they remain supportive of our own foreign policy objectives. Worse still,  the dictators have often been our own creation, imposed by the American Marines  or the CIA.  </P> <P> Witness Marcos in the Philippines, Somoza in Nicaragua, Batista in Cuba,  Pinochet in Chile, the Arena party with its death squads in El Salvador, to  name but a few. Our record in Latin America has been particularly  reprehensible.  </P> <P> As one who loves the United States as his native country, I devoutly hope and  pray for the day when devotion to human rights at home and abroad and respect  for the dignity and sovereignty of all nations will replace narrow  self-interest as the cornerstone of our country's foreign policy.  </P> <P> MELVIN E. SCHROER  </P> <P> Claremont  </P></p>

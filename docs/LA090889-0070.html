			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOW OFF 12.91 AS LATE STOCK RALLY FIZZLES  </P> <P> Stock prices fell Thursday, propelled by a late burst of computerized program  trading that extended the market's losing streak to three days.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, up about eight points in the early  going, was down 12.91 at 2,706.88 by the close.  </P> <P> That extended its loss over the last three sessions to 45.21 points.  </P> <P> Advancing issues and declines ran about even in nationwide trading of New York  Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 713 up, 714 down and 569 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume was 160.16 million shares, compared to 161.80 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> Analysts said the decline was further indication of the market's move to  consolidate its gains.  </P> <P> "If the market isn't ready for a correction now, it never will be," said George  Adler, Banc One Asset Management's head of portfolio management.  </P> <P> A number of forecasters have been predicting a correction after the recent  gains in the Dow index, which two weeks ago smashed a 2-year-old record. Last  Friday, the Dow rose 14.82 to again close at a record 2,752.09.  </P> <P> Adler said that stock prices were digesting their recent gains and that the  fundamentals of the market remained sound.  </P> <P> "People are still buying stocks. Money continues to flow into this market," he  said.  </P> <P> Kenneth Spence, director of Salomon Bros.' technical analysis group, said he  does not detect any broad-based selling by institutions.  </P> <P> "I think that after this brief consolidation, the market is going to attempt to  push higher. (But) it will be a very selective move to the upside," said  Spence.  </P> <P> But James Andrews, head of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott,  said he believes that the market may have reached the upper end of its trading  range.  </P> <P> "September and October is generally a consolidating period," Andrews said. "The  bias leans toward the sell side."  </P> <P> Allergan led the NYSE active list, down 3 3/4 at 20 3/4 on volume of more than  3.16 million shares. The company said its sales this year wouldn't grow as much  as it previously projected.  </P> <P> Tiffany jumped 6 1/8 to 60 3/8. Financier Donald J. Trump received regulatory  clearance to invest in the stock.  </P> <P> Losers among the blue chip industrials included Philip Morris, down 2 at 164  1/4; Procter &amp; Gamble, down 1 1/4 at 124 3/4; International Business  Machines, down 1/2 at 116 1/4, and General Electric, down 5/8 at 56 5/8.  </P> <P> Applied Biosystems tumbled 3 3/4 to 24 3/4 in the over-the-counter market. The  company said its earnings for the quarter ending Sept. 30 would fall short of  their level in the comparable period a year ago.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, a weaker yen and softer bond prices again rattled the stock market,  depressing stock prices. The 225-share Nikkei average lost 118.75 points to  close at 34,152.56.  </P> <P> On the London Stock Exchange, shares recovered strongly from the previous day's  steep fall. Dealers said the market was lifted by a batch of good corporate  results and an early modest rally on Wall Street, although this later ran out  of steam. The Financial Times 100-share index closed at 2,415.9, up 25.1.  </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> Bond prices were little changed in uneventful trading.  </P> <P> The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was unchanged from Wednesday, with  its yield remaining at 8.10%.  </P> <P> Analysts said there was little activity in the absence of market-moving  economic news. Traders are awaiting government data due to be released late  next week on August retail sales, inflation and merchandise trade.  </P> <P> "This is a thin market," said William Sullivan, director of money market  research for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government  issues were unchanged to 3/32 point higher, intermediate maturities slipped  1/32 point to 1/16 point, and long-term issues were unchanged, according to  Telerate Inc., a financial information service.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted late in the day at 8.938%, down from 9% late Wednesday.  </P></p>

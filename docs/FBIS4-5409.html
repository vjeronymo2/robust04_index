			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report by Sadaya Yokota from the Diet </F> building; from the "NHK News" program]    [Text] At 1100 on 10 April, representatives from the  ruling coalition parties held a meeting to discuss the choosing  of a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in an effort  to form a new cabinet this week.    At the meeting, they argued over remarks made on 9 April by  Masayoshi Takemura, Sakigake [Harbinger Party] representative  and chief cabinet secretary, and by Democratic Socialist Party  [DSP] Chairman Keigo Ouchi that the debate on selecting a  successor to Prime Minister Hosokawa should be shifted from the  current representative meeting to summit meetings of the  coalition parties. Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and chairman of the  representative meeting, stated: Now that a few coalition leaders  have stated so, there is no point in continuing discussions at  the representative meeting. Leaders of the coalition parties  need to put their views in order regarding what has to be done  at the representative meeting of the ruling coalition.    In this way, it has been decided that the leaders of the  coalition parties will coordinate their views on an appropriate  venue for discussing a possible successor to Prime Minister  Hosokawa. Following their coordination, the meeting of  coalition party representatives will be held again at 1500 [0600  GMT].    Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura's proposal for holding a  ruling party summit meeting is believed to be based on concern  that if the issue of choosing a successor to Prime Minister  Hosokawa is discussed at the coalition representative meeting,  at which Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito  Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa attend, both Shinseito and  Komeito may take the initiative in choosing the successor.  Because discussion over a possible successor to Prime Minister  Hosokawa is entangled with a struggle for leadership among the  coalition parties, it will still take time to coordinate views  on the issue.</p>

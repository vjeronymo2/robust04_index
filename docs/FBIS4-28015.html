			<p>BFN     [Text] A nationwide public opinion poll taken by YOMIURI  SHIMBUN from 21 to 22 May on the "central government  bureaucracy" showed that nearly 80 percent of the respondents  favored reforming the central government bureaucracy and a  majority of the respondents supported a plan for abolishment of  the so-called "government committee system" to let many  politicians take key posts in government ministries and  agencies, and bear the responsibility for politics. In this  way, the poll revealed that the people take a critical view of  the central government bureaucracy. Asked why the government  has come under the bureaucracy's control, many respondents cited  the "lack of able politicians" as a major reason, while others  cited the "unreliability of politicians" as the major reason.    Asked about their impression of bureaucrats in the central  government, 43 percent of the polled said, "They get jobs in  enterprises and government-invested corporations that they have  formerly overseen"; 34 percent said, "They have collusive ties  with politicians and businesses"; and 28 percent said, "They  have a kind of privileged mentality." Thus, many of the polled  had a bad impression of the bureaucrats working for the central  government. Only less than 20 percent of the surveyed had a good  impression of them. Twenty percent of the surveyed said, "They  are excellent"; 11 percent said, "They are diligent"; and 3  percent said, "They are fair and clean."    Asked who is taking the lead in the government's  decisionmaking process, 46 percent of the respondents answered,  "The bureaucrats take the lead"; 17 percent answered,  "Politicians take the lead"; and 30 percent answered, "We have  no position." In this way, nearly 50 percent of the people  thought that the government is under the "thumb of bureaucracy."  Asked to point out things for which the bureaucrats deserve to  be praised highly, 27 percent of the polled said, "They have  nothing to be praised highly for." Asked about things for which  the bureaucrats deserve to be criticized, 34 percent pointed to  "their collusive ties with politicians and businesses."    Asked why the bureaucrats have come to wield so great an  influence in running the government, 39 percent of the polled  indicated the "lack of politicians powerful enough to manage the  bureaucrats"; 34 percent pointed to "the lack of a mechanism  under which the people keep the bureaucrats in check"; and 33  percent of them said, "The budget compilation is impossible  without the bureaucrats." Thus, many of the respondents  indicated the politicians' incompetence.    Asked to comment on the plan for abolishing the so-called  "government committee system" proposed by Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa ), 54 percent of  the surveyed said, "We support the plan" and 20 percent of them  said, "We oppose the plan." As reasons for supporting the plan,  the respondents said: 1) The plan will make parliamentary  deliberations substantial and 2) the plan will make it possible  to keep the bureaucrats in check. As reasons for opposing the  plan, the respondents said: 1) The plan will further serve to  solidify the collusive ties between politicians and bureaucrats  and 2) the plan will lead politicians to intervene in  administrative authority.    Asked to comment on a desirable bureaucracy, nearly 80  percent of the respondents expressed hopes for reforming the  bureaucracy one way or another, claiming, "Measures must be  taken to reduce their power" or "measures must be taken to  lessen their jurisdiction mentality." Meanwhile, 10 percent of  the respondents said, "They are good and no measures need to be  taken" and 13 percent said, "We have no position." Asked  whether the Hata government will be able to reform the  bureaucracy, 11 percent of them said, "The Hata government will  be able to reform them" and 77 percent of them said, "it will be  unable to do that." In this way, the people's expectations of  the minority government were found to be slim.    Of the respondents, 53 percent said, "The bureaucracy should  not be allowed to take jobs in enterprises or  government-invested corporations that they have formerly  overseen."</p>

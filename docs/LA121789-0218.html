			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON VIEW: R.S.V.P.;  </P> <P> CANDLELIGHT BALL TURNS INTO A FAMILY AFFAIR  </P> <P> Sentiment is everything. Ball Chairwoman Susan Baggott influenced Juniors of  the Social Service Auxiliary to hold the Candlelight Ball at the Biltmore  because her husband proposed to her in the hotel's Rendezvous Court. Orchestra  leader Jerry Bruno got the nod because he played for her wedding reception.  Colleen Casey, who usually sings with Michael Carney's Orchestra, was honored  vocalist because she was Susan's Kappa Kappa Gamma sister at USC. Susan's uncle  Msgr. William Barry, recently honored by the Vatican, gave the invocation. Even  baby Lorna Baggott, 16 months, was in the arms of her mother during the  reception line with dad Bob and Juniors president Donna Melone and her husband  Martin.  </P> <P> Everyone's joyous. It looks as though the ball, a salute to philanthropist  Dorothy Leavey, will net more than $125,000 (up from $92,000 last year) for  Regis House community centers. And because of that Susan's parents, Lorna and  Jack Barry; Sister Petra Keller, director of the Sisters of Social Service, and  a committee including Linda Breen, Bridget Loftus, Sally Frawley, Mary McGraw  and Theresa Dunn are ecstatic.  </P> <P> TABLOID: Mix costumed carolers and Dickens' characters Fagin and Mr. Micawber  with garlands of greenery and bedecked trees. Spread mistletoe and holly on the  tables. Place the 75-voice USC Concert Choir with Rodney Eichenberger on the  balconies of the Crystal Room of the Biltmore.  </P> <P> Bring in the organ grinder and the vintage harmonium for 19th-Century parlor  readings. And position the grand piano on stage with Dudley Moore. That was the  rare fun of the USC Friends of Music, Dudley Moore and Dickens evening.  </P> <P> Decking the halls for music scholarships were Joyce Sprafka and Friends  president Lucy Hubbard and School of Music dean Larry Livingston. Honorary  chairwoman Flora Thornton gathered around Marion and George Scharffenberger and  Eric Small. More in the audience of 400 were former U. S. Atty. Gen. William  French Smith and his wife Jean; Lorna Reed; George and Mary Lou Boone and  Virginia and Simon Ramo.  </P> <P> PREVIEW: Jewels and 18th-Century tables will be under Christmas trees after the  Junior League of Los Angeles' preview of its 10th annual Antiques Show at the  Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. President Robin Nenninger and show chairwoman  Carole Gascou invited the first chairwoman Connie Lynch and her husband Terence  as well as past chairmen to attend the black-tie affair. And co-chairwomen  Gwendolyn Hatten Baker and Doris Lebo staged dining midst the antiques -- the  better to buy. The net is a hefty $100,000 for AIDS and cancer counseling hot  lines and guides for the handicapped.  </P> <P> FOOTLOOSE: Big news at The Bachelors of Los Angeles stag night was that New  York's Lester Lanin has been signed to fly in his orchestra for the 85th  anniversary Bachelors Ball next year. He played the party hosted by Queen  Elizabeth and Prince Philip to honor Prince Edward on his birthday.  </P> <P> THE SEASON: Red poinsettias flourished with the Pepperdine University Showcase  Singers for National Charity League Los Angeles chapter's Christmas luncheon  planned by Susan Howell, Gloria Arrasmith and Marilyn Dornan at the Beverly  Hills' Crystal Room . . .  </P> <P> Over at the Beverly Hilton, the acclaimed Citrus College Singers brought  emotion for the Delta Delta Delta Sleighbell luncheon, with president Judy  Jenkins and Suzanne Dillard hosting tables for the glittery Saks Fifth Avenue  fashion show to benefit cancer research at Childrens Hospital . . .  </P> <P> Angels Attic in Santa Monica celebrated its sixth Victorian Christmas with a  tea and the nostalgic opening of the popular Lauren's Santa's Workshop exhibit,  on display through January . . .  </P> <P> The CHIPS (Colleague Helpers in Philanthropic Service) chic crowd took over  Bice on Canon to host an Italian holiday party chaired by Nevada Cook, Victoria  Mouradian, Deborah Tellefsen and Nancy Wibbelsman . . .  </P> <P> Claire Shea, president of Loyola High School Mothers' Guild, was at the front  with Father Patrick Cahalan, president of Loyola, and Father Eugene Growney,  principal, for a Williamsburg-themed gala with Della Robbia wreaths.

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Government urged to press for curb on Brussels' power An influential think-tank today urges the government to press its case for a more decentralised European Union by proposing a radical plan to curb the powers of the European Commission. The European Policy Forum says the present powers of the commission should be divided between three new institutions: a commission for the single market; a treasury board responsible for all spending and revenue decisions; and a new external trade commission. The forum argues that this 'unbundling' of the commission's powers could be a central element in the reform of the union at the Intergovernmental Conference due in 1996. Alongside plans to transfer greater control over financial affairs and the single market to the council of ministers it would reverse the momentum towards the centralisation of decision-making in the EU. The forum is an independent group with cross-party support. But its latest paper, written by Mr Frank Vibert, the director, is likely to attract widespread support on the Tory backbenches. Its effect would be to repatriate to member governments much of the influence over the political and economic direction of the union by casting the commission in an essentially managerial role. Its involvement in the union's foreign and security policy and in home affairs would be transferred to the secretariat of the Council of Ministers. Mr Vibert argues that at present the commission gives too little prominence to the single market while its spending reflexes have always overwhelmed its sense of responsibility for financial discipline. A three-way division of its authority would restore the focus on ensuring European competitiveness. At the same time the forum suggests that the commission's quasi-judicial functions would be transferred to an independent competition authority modelled on Germany's Bundeskartellemt. The paper coincides with a call from the Institute of Community Studies, a sociological research group, for co-ordinated Europe-wide cuts in VAT as part of a package of policies to stop the EU 'imploding' under the weight of mounting unemployment. The study argues that record unemployment will permanently derail European integration without 'rigorous and co-ordinated action' from member states. The Future Role of the European Commission.

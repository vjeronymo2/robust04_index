			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OPERATION RESCUE MEMBERS CLAIM MOVEMENT IS MISUNDERSTOOD  </P> <P> During a "rescue" of the unborn, participants of the anti-abortion Operation  Rescue sometimes hold hands, pray, sing, and -- in the case of the Rev. Mick  McCoy -- cry.  </P> <P> At a demonstration held by Operation Rescue in Los Angeles in February, McCoy,  pastor of the Vineyard Christian Fellowship in El Cajon, said that, while  others prayed and sang, he was so moved that he "just stood there and cried."  </P> <P> Since its first demonstration in New York City on May 1, 1987, the nationwide  anti-abortion group has been severely criticized by pro-choice advocates, who  claim the participants are militants who will use physical and emotional abuse  to prevent women from getting abortions.  </P> <P> On Saturday, Project Rescue, San Diego's version of Operation Rescue, is  planning to shut down one or more clinics in demonstrations in the San Diego  area, but representatives of medical clinics said they will be prepared.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Injunction Bars Protesters  </P> <P> To discourage anti-abortion demonstrators from blocking entrances to clinics in  San Diego and elsewhere in the state, officials of the American Civil Liberties  Union said they have obtained a statewide preliminary injunction aimed at  barring protesters from medical clinics that perform abortions. The preliminary  injunction was granted verbally Monday by U. S. District Court Judge A. Wallace  Tashima in Los Angeles, and ACLU officials said they expect to have the actual  preliminary injunction before Saturday.  </P> <P> The preliminary injunction prevents trespassing on the property of medical  facilities that perform abortions and other family planning services; forming  blockades; conducting "sidewalk counseling" that waylays people and  demonstrating within 15 feet of any entrance or exit to facilities, ACLU  officials said. They said they will ask Tashima to levy fines up to $10,000 for  violations of the order.  </P> <P> Project Rescue participants have said that, in spite of the preliminary  injunction, they are still planning their demonstration. "Our position is still  the same, but the cost has just increased," McCoy said.  </P> <P> Members of Operation Rescue are more than willing to go to jail for their  cause, and many refuse to identify themselves to law enforcement officials.  About 22,000 participants have been arrested across the nation, Operation  Rescue officials said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Claims They're Misunderstood  </P> <P> But McCoy said in an interview that the Operation Rescue movement is a poorly  understood crusade that seeks to separate itself from anti-abortion militants.  He conceded, however, that stragglers latch onto their cause to promote their  own aggressive views.  </P> <P> "Many times, other people show up who are not a part of the rescue and use that  as their protest. They use picket signs and verbal abuse. We ask people not to  come and do that," McCoy said. "It's also totally untrue that we accuse or  abuse women. . . . We're trying to protect the children that are scheduled for  death and prevent women from being exploited in the abortion clinic."  </P> <P> The Operation Rescue movement has not bombed medical facilities that perform  abortions, McCoy said. "Violence just begets violence."  </P> <P> Will Lehman, 30, of Vista began Project Rescue in San Diego County in October  when, after worrying about breaking the law, he chained himself to the doors of  a medical office that performed abortions in North County.  </P> <P> "I had no information on Operation Rescue, but I had heard what happened in  Atlanta, that a group of pastors and clergy attempted to shut down a clinic  there in August, 1988," Lehman said in an interview. "At first, I debated over  whether civil disobedience was a Christian activity, but in the process of  arguing about it with a friend, it became clear to me that I was wrong. There  is scriptural basis for Christian disobedience."  </P> <P> Last October, Lehman chained himself to the doors of Dr. George Kung's medical  office in San Marcos. Lehman also said he was was among demonstrators who were  arrested Feb. 11 at an Operation Rescue in Sunnyvale, for which he was jailed  after refusing to identify himself.  </P> <P> Known only as "Baby John Doe No. 4," Lehman spent one month in jail in San  Jose, entered a plea of no contest, and was given three years' probation.  Lehman acknowledged that he was breaking the law but, he said, "As it's stated  in Acts, is it better to obey God or to obey man?"  </P> <P> Rescue demonstrations occur every weekend in the United States, Lehman aid, but  not all of them are "John Doe rescues." For the demonstration scheduled  Saturday, Lehman is encouraging abortion foes to bring identification.  </P> <P> Demonstrators will prepare for Saturday's protest with a Friday-night rally in  Mission Valley, where the "theology" and an action plan for the demonstrations  will be discussed. Project Rescue has declined to identify at which clinics  they plan to protest.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Concern for the Women'  </P> <P> Through nonviolent means, anti-abortionists at these demonstrations try to  prevent women from being emotionally and physically scarred, McCoy claims. "We  have just as much concern for the women as the children. Jesus said (of those  who killed him), 'Father, forgive them; they know not what they do.' And these  women don't really know what they're doing to their own child."  </P> <P> The demonstrations also offer an opportunity for anti-abortionists to "repent  of their own sins" for the 16-year history of abortion, McCoy said. In 1973,  the U. S. Supreme Court ruled that Texas resident Norma McCorvey, who filed  suit as "Jane Roe" in the landmark Roe vs. Wade case, had the right to an  abortion.  </P> <P> "We're there to repent because of our guilt in the area of silent consent . . .  . We're not there to point the finger. We're trying to prevent a murder, not to  prosecute. That's the thing that attracted me to it. It's an opportunity to  respond in a way that is not accusing someone else but shouldering their burden  of guilt," McCoy said.  </P></p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / UK Company News: Wimpey extends quarrying interests George Wimpey is to reinforce its position in UK quarrying with a move to full ownership of Wimpey Hobbs, its west country and Wales quarrying company. The move involves Wimpey's purchase for Pounds 7.5m of the remaining 20 per cent interest in Wimpey Hobbs held by Hobbs Properties, a family owned company. Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive, said full ownership improved the group's flexibility significantly. 'We will be able to complete the merger of our two UK businesses - Wimpey Hobbs in the south and Wimpey Asphalt in the north - giving increased opportunities for rationalisation and investment,' he said.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Landmark ruling on Canadian telecoms Canadian regulators will release a landmark ruling today which is expected to encourage greater competition in telecommunications, and to redefine the boundaries between telephone companies, broadcasters and cable-TV operators. The report by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) follows several months of hearings at which groups from all sectors of the telecommunications industry urged a radical overhaul of the regulatory framework. The CRTC began its review to accommodate the rapid evolution of telephone companies into providers of other services, and the increasingly blurred technologies of the telephone, cable-TV and computer industries. The phone companies, such as Bell Canada, dominate Canada's telecom markets. The long-distance telephone market was opened to competition in 1992, but the phone companies continue to have a monopoly on local services. Long-distance calls have in the past heavily subsidised local services. But growing competition in the long-distance market has spurred calls for an overhaul of local pricing and market entry. Cable-TV operators are gradually moving towards the local phone market with the installation of fibre-optic networks equipped with two-way switches. Canadian homes have one of the world's highest penetrations of cable-TV. On the other hand, the phone companies have pressed for greater freedom to enter the cable-TV and multimedia sectors. When it gave notice of the review in late 1992, the CRTC indicated it wanted to bring down barriers to competition. Separately, Rogers Communications, Canada's biggest cable-TV operator, said it planned to dispose of the non-Canadian publishing operations of Maclean Hunter, the communications group being acquired by Rogers.</p>

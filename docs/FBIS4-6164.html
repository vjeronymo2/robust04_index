			<p>CSO     [Text] Teleway Japan Considers 1 Billion Yen Purchase  of ATM Switching Systems Within Fiscal Year    New telegraph and telephone long-distance carrier Japan  Teleway, headquartered in Daito ward, Tokyo, and headed by  President Higashi, has initiated a detailed study to procure  asynchronous transmission mode (ATM) switching systems by the  end of the fiscal year. ATM switching systems represent core  equipment for high-speed communications digital networks such as  broad-band integrated services digital networks and enable the  offering of diversified services such as voice, character and  image transmissions and frame relay for high-speed transmission  of data. Japan Teleway will seek sophistication of  communications networks for responsiveness to multimedia needs  in connection with the completion of the nationwide  communications network in fiscal year 1994.    ATM switching systems to be purchased will comprise several  units and will represent an investment of about 1 billion yen.  ATM switching systems are made by domestic manufacturers, such  as Fujitsu, and have been jointly developed with Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Company (NTT). Executives of Japan  Teleway have said, "Our study will consider procurement from  overseas communications equipment manufacturers," because NTT is  a competitor of Japan Teleway in the high-speed communications  arena. Leading sources for such purchases include AT&amp;T of the  United States and Northern Telecom of Canada.    ATM switching systems are designed to meet multimedia  requirements such as the processing of voice, images, and  characters on an integrated basis. NTT initiated development  work on the systems in 1991, started test operations in 1992,  and plans to launch high-speed communications services based on  the system in selected areas in 1997.    Japan Teleway is the first of the three new telegraph and  telephone companies to initiate purchases of ATM switching  systems. President Higashi of Japan Teleway assumes, "The future  will render operations impractical without ATM switching systems  capable of processing images and characters.    Even those new telegraph and telephone companies which were  behind schedule in installing nationwide communications networks  plan to have such systems installed in the two remaining regions  of Hokkaido and Shikoku by the end of the fiscal year. Moreover,  increased interest in multimedia communications services has  been demonstrated by industry which is expected to purchase ATM  switching systems. It appears that other new telegraph and  telephone companies will also initiate procurement of ATM  switching systems.</p>

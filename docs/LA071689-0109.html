			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FROM PASADENA TO NEPTUNE;  </P> <P> JOURNEY INTO SPACE THE FIRST THREE DECADES OF SPACE EXPLORATION BY BRUCE MURRAY  (W. W. NORTON: $19.95; 354 PP.; ILLUSTRATED; 0-393-02675-2)  </P> <P> Pasadena's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is an uncommon organization, a place that  doubles as a part of Caltech and as an active NASA center. Over the years, some  of the space program's most imaginative and cost-effective work has emerged  from JPL, all involving unmanned exploration. JPL has brought us the planets --  sun-seared Mercury, the swirling clouds of Venus, the deserts of Mars, the  gaseous giant Jupiter, ringed Saturn, and obscure Uranus -- and next month,  after an incredible 12-year odyssey, a Voyager spacecraft will give us our  first close-up look at Neptune. No one else on Earth -- certainly not the  Soviets -- could do this. Today, 20 years after the first lunar landing, JPL  remains a national treasure.  </P> <P> Bruce Murray was the director of JPL from 1976 to 1982. He is also co-founder,  with Carl Sagan, of the 125,000-member Planetary Society. A geologist by  education and an explorer by nature, Murray packs 30 years of planetary science  into this readable but somewhat unbalanced account. His prose swings from that  of seasoned bureaucrat to that of enthralled scientist, depending on how close  he is to one of his beloved planets. Pondering the sorry state of NASA in the  aftermath of the Challenger explosion, for example, he explains somewhat  pompously that "the time had come for me to put into literary form that view  from within."  </P> <P> He is awe-struck, in contrast, when writing about the signals coming from  Voyager: "(Its) faint, wailing voice as it whispers back the secrets of  Neptune. For one marvelous moment, just as the last decade of this careening  century begins, an invisible resonance of precisely tuned radio waves will  vibrate across three billion miles. This sound box of the Solar System should  provide the greatest live video of our century."  </P> <P> This last quote encapsulates the book's major strength and weakness. Murray  loves his planets and assumes everyone else does too. He explains them very  well, and the lay reader certainly will be caught up in the beauty of these  remote places, but he goes overboard. Neptune most definitely will not "provide  the greatest live video of our century." I don't know what will, but Jupiter  won't come close to Armstrong's first step on the moon.  </P> <P> Given that this book's subtitle is "The First Three Decades of Space  Exploration," it is strange that Murray skips over some big chunks of history  and almost totally ignores manned space flight. The Gemini program is not  mentioned, for instance; a chart of significant events jumps from John Glenn's  Mercury to the Apollo fire that killed Grissom, White and Chaffee. Gemini was  essential in building the foundation that allowed Apollo to reach the moon  before John F. Kennedy's deadline of the end of the 1960s.  </P> <P> A more accurate subtitle would be "How I Hate the Shuttle." It is certainly  true that putting all of NASA's launch eggs in the shuttle basket was a  fundamental mistake. The decision was made in the early 1970s, and it siphoned  off money from the planetary program later in that decade and into the 1980s.  Even worse, it made sure that no expendable launch vehicles would be available  to compete with the shuttle. Then came the Challenger accident and the shuttle  was grounded. Hence there was a long dry spell during which JPL's wonderful  machines could not get off the launch pad.  </P> <P> Murray certainly needed to explain in this book how the shuttle crimped his  operation, but hardly a page goes by without a new diatribe, and it can get  tiresome. He writes of "NASA's obsession with the Shuttle . . . " " . . .  NASA's fixation on the Shuttle was such that it overrode any sense of  responsibility for future American space science and exploration." "The Shuttle  had always catered to the need for fantasy in us all. Now it served no other  purpose." "Once again NASA mortgaged America's future in space in a desperate  bid to retain the Shuttle as its means and the ill-conceived space station as  it ends." And so on.  </P> <P> For as long as I have known NASA, there has been a certain tension between its  manned and unmanned components. Some scientists, such as James Van Allen, are  just flat against manned exploration because a robot can generally get the job  done a lot cheaper. One counter argument (as a former astronaut, my prejudices  lie in this direction) is that the public's consistent support for the manned  program helps not only NASA, but components of it, such as JPL. Murray does not  refute this in the case of Apollo, pointing out that ". . . Viking, Voyager,  and the Mariners . . . became a reality decades earlier than they would have if  Apollo had not happened." But the shuttle is different, he says.  </P> <P> He may be right that the shuttle has blocked a lot of brilliant planetary  science, but what neither he nor anyone else can say is what would have  happened to NASA without a shuttle. Extra money might have gone to JPL, but I  doubt it. In my view Murray overestimates the public's fascination with  planetary science. For example, he writes that when Voyager flew by Jupiter in  1979 and photographed its gaudy atmosphere, "The swirling Red Spot became a  cultural symbol overnight." I don't remember that.  </P> <P> To the Soviets and their space program, Murray is generally kind. General  Secretary Gorbachev is depicted as listening attentively for hours and asking  intelligent questions of his space experts, while, over lunch, President Reagan  tells a few jokes and then startles his guests by remarking that "one can't  help but think about creationism" because no one has yet found life anywhere in  the universe. To me a strange omission was not mentioning the Soviet shuttle.  If our shuttle is such a mistake, and the Russian program as well thought out  as he says, how do you explain their shuttle? Perhaps the Buran had not yet  flown before Murray finished this book, but surely he knew it was coming.  </P> <P> In general, Murray is more adept at criticizing than offering solutions (other  than to give JPL more money), but he does have a strong suggestion to make  about NASA's future: "The first human landings on Mars beckon as the next great  milestone in human exploration, now that Earth orbit and the moon have been  visited." The author explains the exciting science he expects to be performed  on Mars, and why he chooses it rather than any other of the planets. Instead of  competing Apollo-style with the Soviets, "we can go to Mars together in a  resounding victory of human intelligence and spirit over runaway technology and  political change." Murray believes that there is ". . . a longing for the two  nations to do something together for a change, something on behalf of the human  species. Our powers are so great and our accomplishments so feeble."  </P> <P> In my view, Apollo was not a feeble accomplishment, but I won't quibble with  the sentiment behind Murray's words. I agree wholeheartedly that Mars should be  our next destination and NASA's focal point. No other space goal can revitalize  our space agency, or contribute so mightily to the political and economic  health of this country. The United Sates can go it alone or the two superpowers  can form a joint venture, but it seems preferable to mount an international  campaign and invite any country with the cash and the technology to join in.  </P> <P> Murray comes through as a prickly character who says what he thinks. Apparently  he didn't get along very well with the NASA administrators for whom he worked,  nor did he approve of our country's leadership, at least as far as space was  concerned. ("Jimmy Carter was too honest to mislead but too narrow to lead.")  But Murray understands why he was considered a maverick; and when one of his  NASA bosses tells him "I don't trust you, Bruce" he cheerfully explains to the  reader why not. Most writers would not include such a passage.  </P> <P> So it is an honest book and a very good one if you are fascinated by far-off  places with strange geology and wonderful names (Io, Europa, Ganymede,  Callisto). Or if you are interested in the sophisticated robotic machines that  visited these planets and moons, and the brilliant people at JPL who milked the  last drop of scientific information from them.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed "Roundup": "Sihanouk Pessimistic About Peace </F> in Cambodia"]    [Text] Phnom Penh, May 14 (XINHUA) -- King Norodom Sihanouk  is very pessimistic about the prospects for peace and  reconciliation in Cambodia following cool responses to his  latest peace plan from both the government and the Khmer Rouge.    He said Thursday [12 May] that he was abandoning his peace  efforts and leaving for medical treatment in a Beijing hospital  on May 18, two weeks earlier than scheduled.    As the civil war escalates in west and northwest Cambodia,  Sihanouk called for a round-table meeting between the royal  government and the democratic Kampuchea on April 22.    However, the meeting was not held because of wide  differences  between Phnom Penh and the Khmer Rouge.    The Khmer Rouge thought its delegation might be in danger if  the meeting were to be held in Phnom Penh and suggested a  neutral site instead.    But the government claimed that it could guarantee the Khmer  Rouge delegation safety 100 percent, and insisted that the  meeting be held in Cambodia.    Sihanouk, who attempted to negotiate an end to the Cambodian  war, on May 2 called for a total, immediate, unconditional and  standstill cease-fire in Cambodia, and suggested holding the  round-table meeting in the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea, but his efforts failed again.    Last weekend he suggested a new election, an idea which was  immediately supported by the Khmer Rouge. However, some local  newspapers and officials accused the king of "seeking power".    Despite the king's call, military conflicts are escalating,  spreading from Battambang to 7 provinces, including Siem Reap,  Kratie, Kompong Speu, Kompong Cham and Kampot.    As government troops fought to stave off a large-scale  offensive by Khmer Rouge guerrillas, a government military  spokesman said that 30 guerrillas had been killed and 30 injured.    The spokesman said that government forces had pushed the  Khmer Rouge further back along National Route No. 10 on Sunday  in Battambang, and had recaptured villages in Siem Reap and  Kompong Speu.    But according to Khmer Rouge radio monitored here today, the  Khmer Rouge, who are even threatening to take the city of  Battambang, have captured three villages in Sangker District,  east of Battambang and taken over a government stronghold 11  kilometers north of Battambang.    The radio said they have also captured 23 villages along  National Route No. 6 in Siem Reap Province, taken over four  counties in Kratie Province, and cut the communications over the  Mekong River this week.    Discouraged by his fruitless peace efforts, Sihanouk said  angrily "even with 100 round-tables, there will be no peace."    He said he did not understand "why Khmers want to destroy  their own country, want to destroy their own people."    King Sihanouk is now bringing his peace plan to Beijing and  Pyongyang. Observers here believe that an end to the civil war  is nowhere in sight.</p>

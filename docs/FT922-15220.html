			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Australian wool has sold at steady prices this week, but the previous easier tendency has not been replaced by a definitely firmer movement. A high proportion of auction offerings is still being withdrawn by farmers hoping for better prices later on. The lack of demand from the old Soviet Union areas, and patchy participation from Eastern Europe, continue to act as a major depressing influence. Other major wool-using countries were active buyers during February's price rise but are less keen after the recent market setback. The AWC market indicator rose 2 cents to 572 on April 1.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Army spokesperson Edith Vargas de Marroquin  announced that the new Military Recruitment Law under discussion  by Congress will prevent the abuses that have been committed  while recruiting volunteers for military service. The new Law  on Military Service will correct the deficiencies that elicited  protests from the people affected by this action.    In view of the various proposals presented by groups who  consider themselves to be affected by the law presented by the  Army, it is unlikely that the reforms will be discussed before  the next Congress is installed. According to the military  spokesperson, several sectors proposed reforms which actually  made recruitment more complicated instead of less  discriminatory, the intended objective. The new Law on Military  Service includes salaries and incentives for fulfilling this  constitutional duty to make it seem more like a social concept  than an obligation.    On another subject, the military spokesperson said the Army  is not protecting six civil patrolmen whose arrest has been  ordered for their alleged participation in the murder of  political leader Jorge Carpio Nicolle last year. The Army has  firmly stated that military personnel involved in criminal  actions must be tried.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Serious Money): A prodigal returns to the fold Share buy-backs are one of those rarities: a financial fashion that is also a thoroughly sensible idea. The regional electricity companies have been buying back their own shares in dribs and drabs for some time. This week, Boots and National Power joined the club. The general argument in favour of buy-backs is being muddied by specific discussion of the best way of doing them. A buy-back is just what it sounds like: a company uses its own spare cash to buy some of its own shares, just as it might use the money to buy shares in another company when plotting a take-over. Investment pundits such as Warren Buffett, the US guru, favour share buy-backs as strongly as they condemn hubristic bids. Expensive take-overs hurt shareholder value twice over. First, a bad acquisition damages the actual business of the predator. Then, it damages the share rating as investors see that loss of value and lose confidence in the management. By contrast, if a company buys back its own shares, it creates a virtuous circle. Provided the price is right, the move reduces the number of ordinary shares more sharply than the offsetting fall in investment income reduces earnings. So, earnings per share rise. An expensive bid often has the opposite effect: earnings per share fall. Thus, basic arithmetic suggests that a sensible buy-back is a better way of spending shareholders' money than expensive acquisitions. Shareholders' perception of this basic arithmetic prompts them to increase their estimates of the company's earnings power and the ability of its managers - and so the share price rises even further. It is particularly heart-warming to see Boots in the buy-back club. Welcome to a very prodigal son. Here is the parable in brief. In 1989, Boots won a fiercely contested Pounds 900m bid for Ward White despite fierce opposition from some of its own shareholders. Once recession bit, the only question was quite how badly Boots had overpaid. Now, Boots is selling its drugs business to a German company and has spent Pounds 500m buying back its own shares. The only worry is that the additional Pounds 350m Boots is due to get for the drugs business will soon be burning a hole in its pocket. MONDAY WAS A red-letter day for gambling buffs. The national lottery opened its doors and BSkyB published its pathfinder prospectus. Buying shares in a satellite television company which has yet to make any worth-while profits is essentially speculative. Applying for BSkyB shares is not quite such a leap in the dark as subscribing to the Eurotunnel launch or a new biotech company, but it has very little in common with investing in Marks and Spencer. To label it speculative is not necessarily to criticise. As the stampede for lottery tickets showed, many Brits love a good speculation. What is important is clear labelling. BSkyB (in which Pearson, owner of the FT, has a 17.5 per cent stake) is setting out to woo the personal investor. And the shares will be sold through share shops - Sid's old stamping ground. But when the government sold off the riskier privatisations, such as British Airways, it deliberately steered clear of Sids on the ground that the shares were not suitable for inexperienced investors. BSkyB can hardly afford to take such high moral ground. The satellite company has an obvious interest in having customers who double as shareholders. One of the biggest worries of television companions such as TeleWest and BSkyB is their 'churn rate' - lapsed subscribers. Customers who have a vested interest in the company's success may well prove more loyal in both their capacities. What is needed is a strong wealth warning: 'These shares are likely to be riskier than many others.' After all, it is unlikely to deter the punters. IT SOUNDS AN unbeatable offer from Bank of Scotland: a five-year bank deposit paying 5 per cent gross a year plus a bonus 'equivalent to the average percentage rise in the FT-SE 100 index' between December 1 1994 and December 1 1999. Yes, but what exactly does the bank mean by 'average percentage rise' ? What it does not mean is the actual rise over that period. For the small print explains that the bank's stock market index deposit calculates the 'average' by taking each of the 20 three-month periods between the start and finish dates, working out a rise between December 1 1994 and the end of each period - and then averaging. The bank's own example shows an actual stock market rise of more than 30 per cent translated into a bonus of only 15 per cent. And both income and bonus are subject to income tax. Tricky things, words.</p>

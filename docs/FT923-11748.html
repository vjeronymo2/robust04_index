			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Expamet shares fall on pay-out cut EXPAMET International, the building products and security group, yesterday announced that it will halve its interim 1992 dividend and will probably 'substantially' cut the final distribution. Mr Jeremy Beasley, chairman, has also brought forward his retirement from December and is replaced with immediate effect by Mr John Roberts, a non-executive director. The announcement was greeted by a 14p fall in the share price to 71p, some 83p below the level prior to the profits warning in June after the discovery that managers of Brema-Air, the Dutch subsidiary, had inflated profit figures. Mr Alex Orr, managing director, said gearing had leapt from 45 per cent to 140 per cent due to a Pounds 4m cash loss and similar reduction in shareholders' funds resulting from the recent sale of Brema-Air. The group's bankers have confirmed their support, but have extracted a commitment that debt will be reduced below Pounds 12m. The banks have secured their overdraft facilities with charges over Expamet's UK assets. Expamet said that, the ducting business apart, trading in the rest of the group remained 'reasonable.'

Expamet's debt now stands at Pounds 23m, on shareholders' funds of Pounds 16m. Before the Dutch problem, debt was budgeted to rise to Pounds 19m in June, before declining to Pounds 12m by the year-end. At the last full-year period, Expamet reported a 43 per cent fall in profits to Pounds 7.3m on sales of Pounds 141m. Nevertheless, it maintained its dividend by digging into reserves, justifying the payment on the grounds that the board believed that the recession would soon end. 'The extent and the depth of the recession continues to surprise,' Mr Orr said yesterday. 'We all know we must not go into recession with heavy debt.'</p>

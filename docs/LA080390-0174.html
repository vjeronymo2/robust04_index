			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> FLORIDA CALLS MEDFLY WAR OVER  </P> <P> Florida agricultural officials today declared an end to a 3 1/2-month Medfly  infestation -- with a slap at Southern California for taking so long to get rid  of its pests.  </P> <P> Helicopters sprayed up to 20 square miles of suburban Miami with malathion in  eight aerial treatments to kill Mediterranean fruit flies, considered the most  destructive farm pest because it can attack 250 different fruits and  vegetables.  </P> <P> Unlike in Southern California, the spraying went on with little fuss.  </P> <P> California's year-old infestation has spread to more than 900 square miles with  limited aerial pesticide spraying and has cost more than $38 million to fight  so far, said Florida Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner.  </P> <P> "It is absolutely vital to move quickly and aggressively, which is exactly what  we did," he said.  </P></p>

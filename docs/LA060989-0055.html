			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PREVIEW: GETTING WET ISN'T A THREAT -- IT'S A GUARANTEE  </P> <P> Magic Mountain's newest ride, Tidal Wave, lasts about 70 seconds. A  flat-bottomed boat filled with passengers travels up a steep incline, then  promptly turns and plunges into a man-made lagoon.  </P> <P> The resulting splash drenches everyone aboard, and the ride is over.  </P> <P> They might as well push you into a pool.  </P> <P> And if that's not enough, they've built a bridge over the lagoon where  bystanders can be battered by a 20-foot wall of water created by the plummeting  boat.  </P> <P> It's like having someone douse you with the garden hose.  </P> <P> "No matter what, you get soaked," said Juliet DeAndrade, 12, of Pasadena, who  attended the ride's opening last week. "It's fun because people like to get  wet."  </P> <P> At least, that's what Magic Mountain is banking on. The Valencia amusement park  is billing Tidal Wave as its top attraction this summer.  </P> <P> The amusement park refuses to release attendance figures, but an official said  the ride ran at near capacity in its first three days. Tidal Wave can soak  1,200 riders per hour, so as many as 38,000 customers emerged dripping wet June  2, Saturday and Sunday.  </P> <P> Water thrill rides are in vogue this season. Splash Mountain was supposed to  make its debut at Disneyland months ago, but Disney executives worried that  riders got too wet.  </P> <P> "The tradition at Disneyland is that nobody is ruled out," said Tony W. Baxter,  the ride's executive producer. "It's a negative if somebody says, 'You guys go.  I don't want to get all wet.' "  </P> <P> Thus, Disney delayed the opening until midsummer for some costly  re-engineering.  </P> <P> No such timidity at Magic Mountain, where the park's two other water rides are  among its most popular. Officials there have long contended that while Disney  must cater to out-of-state tourists, Magic Mountain specializes in pleasing  locals.  </P> <P> "Eighty percent of Magic Mountain's attendance comes from Southern California,"  said Courtney Simmons, a park spokeswoman. "We look at the Southern California  mentality. Our guests like getting wet because they feel they have  participated. "If our guests love to get wet," Simmons said, "we don't question  it."

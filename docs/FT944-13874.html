			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Mexico warning over California Mr Manuel Tello, Mexico's foreign minister, has warned that approval by the state of California of a proposal to curb illegal immigrants' access to education and healthcare would damage US-Mexican relations. Mr Manuel Tello urged that proposition 187 - known as save our state - be rejected when it comes up for vote in the state on November 8. He indicated Mexico would back a constitutional challenge to the proposition were it approved by Californian voters. The proposition, which appears from opinion polls to enjoy the support of a majority of Californians, would deny education and non-emergency healthcare to illegal immigrants and their families. It has caused a furore in Mexico, the main source of illegal immigration to the US. Some border cities have sought to boycott US goods in protest at the measure. Mr Tello said the proposition would 'contaminate' bi-lateral relations along the border. He said trying to deny basic services to the children of undocumented immigrants would create the figure of a 'big brother that is watching over you.' Mexico's ambassador to the US, Mr Jorge Montano, voiced similar concerns.</p>

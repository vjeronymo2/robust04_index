			<p>BFN     [Text] The leader of the Tajikistan's Political and  Economic Renovation Party (TPERP), Mukhtor Bobokhonov, told the  party's first official news conference in Dushanbe Friday that  no opposition to the government was acceptable in Tajikistan at  the moment. "It may cause an allergic reaction among the  people," he was quoted as saying. At present, the TPERP is the  first officially registered party in Tajikistan since January  1993 when all political parties and movements, except for the  Communists, were banned.    According to Bobokhonov, the TPERP basically encompassed  young entrepreneurs, scientists and economists. The party's  main goal is to promote the economic revival of Tajikistan and  the establishment of peace in the republic. To achieve this  goal, the new party will cooperate with all social and political  forces of the Republic, Bobokhonov said. Asked about the party's  economic program, Bobokhonov said its top priority was to create  a nongovernment pension fund to protect all layers of society.  He hoped the Tajik leadership would support this initiative.  Commenting on the presence of Russian troops in Tajikistan,  Bobokhonov said it was necessary at the moment to guarantee  peace and security in the region.</p>

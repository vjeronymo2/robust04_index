			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> HOT LINE TRIES TO ANSWER DRUG ADDICTS' CALLS FOR HELP  </P> <P> The calls come in every few minutes, cries for help from a torrent of desperate  people overwhelmed by drug abuse.  </P> <P> A homeless crack addict needs shelter and therapy. A man addicted to heroin for  seven years asks about rehabilitation programs. A cab driver with a nine-year  cocaine habit wants admission to an outpatient treatment facility.  </P> <P> Shattered by drugs, they have called a toll-free substance abuse hot line  headquartered in a ramshackle building in Manhattan's Washington Heights  neighborhood, an inner-city area that has been called "the crack capital of  America."  </P> <P> The confidential hot line, operated by the Community League of West 159th  Street, is a window onto the nation's war on drugs.  </P> <P> Spend a few hours listening to counselors talking on the hot line and you will  hear of addicts who have lost their families, their homes and their jobs.  </P> <P> You will learn of a social service system so overburdened that it simply cannot  cope.  </P> <P> And you will discover that even after the latest offensive in the war on drugs,  impoverished addicts who yearn for treatment are told that they will have to  wait up to a year to enter an inpatient rehabilitation program.  </P> <P> The stories told by a succession of callers send a disturbing message: Drug  addiction is entrenched in America's social fabric -- and the government has  barely put a dent in the problem.  </P> <P> "America has become -- it isn't becoming -- a drug-infested society," said  Lucille Bulger, the league's 77-year-old founder. "I think it's past epidemic  proportions. It's a national infestation."  </P> <P> "The problem has gotten worse, and we're not equipped to deal with it," said  hot-line coordinator Yvonne Stennet, 34. "There are so many people out there  who need our help and we just don't have the services to meet the problem."  </P> <P> In addition to the hot line, the league runs a number of programs in the  Washington Heights area, including after-school events and a nutrition center  for children and a housing management service to renovate city-owned buildings.  </P> <P> Funded by government grants, the league focuses on grass-roots activism to  reinvigorate the neighborhood, which is populated largely by blacks and Latinos  and recently has experienced an influx of immigrants from the Dominican  Republic.  </P> <P> Its hot line receives calls from throughout New York state and the Northeast.  </P> <P> The callers are not confined to the stereotypical inner-city junkie. Indeed,  experts say there has been an upsurge in middle-class use of drugs like crack,  and calls to the hot line reflect that rise.  </P> <P> Most of the 400 to 600 monthly calls to the hot line are from people seeking  help for heroin, crack and cocaine addiction. According to a spokesman at the  state division of Substance Abuse Services, in 1988, there were nearly 500,000  daily, heavy users of these "hard" drugs in New York City alone and that figure  is expected to jump for 1989 as the crack epidemic worsens.  </P> <P> Most callers to the hot line, which is staffed 16 hours a day, want to know  where they can find help. The counselors have a long list of organizations --  ranging from support groups to homeless shelters to rehabilitation programs --  to which they make referrals.  </P> <P> The callers' voices are usually tinged with fear and anxiety, for by the time  they decide to dial 1-800-LET-IT-GO, they have reached bottom.  </P> <P> "We've had people on the phone who have a knife in their hand and they're ready  to kill themselves," Stennet said, adding that it is not uncommon for addicts  to call when they are high on drugs or paranoid from the crash after a crack  binge.  </P> <P> On a recent weekday afternoon, counselor Red Cotto was talking in a soft,  friendly voice to Wayne, a 25-year-old crack addict who said he wanted to enter  a treatment facility.  </P> <P> "Are you on the crack, Wayne?" Cotto asked. "Are you high right now?"  </P> <P> Sounding distracted and stuttering as he talked, Wayne admitted he was high. He  was also homeless and without any money or medical insurance.  </P> <P> Cotto, 42, referred him to a city-run men's shelter and gave him the address  and phone number of a treatment facility that takes homeless addicts on a  priority basis.  </P> <P> Ironically, Wayne was lucky that he was homeless.  </P> <P> Addicts with shelter who cannot afford the high fees of private rehabilitation  centers can wait up to a year for inpatient treatment.  </P> <P> The delay is demoralizing for counselors who must tell addicts either to wait  or to seek an outpatient program, which is usually less effective in treating  drug abuse.  </P> <P> "It's a hell of a problem," Stennet said. "It's frustrating -- you get someone  on the phone, you know you can help them, but there's nothing available."  </P> <P> "If I've heard one outrageous call, I've heard hundreds," Cotto said. But he is  quick to point out that for every 20 people he counsels on the phone, 10 to 15  will call back a few days later and thank him, saying they have received help.  </P> <P> "At times, you can look at this as being a thankless job," Cotto said. "But  when you do get calls of that type, you think, 'Well, I've made a little dent,  I've made a difference.' "  </P> <P> Ask Bulger about the war on drugs and she will say that politicians have no  idea how bad the problem really is.  </P> <P> Bulger, who founded the league 37 years ago, has lived in Washington Heights  all her life. She has seen her neighborhood destroyed by drugs and has heard  legions of government officials announce they will win the war on drugs.  </P> <P> She has spent the last few decades urging the government to allocate more money  for treatment and education, stressing repeatedly that to defeat drugs in the  inner cities, poverty and ignorance must be attacked.  </P> <P> She is not optimistic.  </P></p>

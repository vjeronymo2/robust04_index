			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhao Wei [6392 0251], Wang Xianxiu [3076 6343 </F> 4423] et al. of the CAS Changchun Institute of Physics,  Changchun 130021: ``Integrated Optical Frequency Shifter for  Frequency-Modulation Fiber Optic Gyroscope''; MS received 29 Nov  93]    [Abstract] An integrated optical frequency shifter for  closed-loop, zero-phase frequency-modulation (FM) fiber optic  gyros has been developed. The device is fabricated on a 20mm x  60mm Y-cut Ti-in-diffused LiNb03 planar waveguide (single-mode  for 1.3-micron-wavelength laser), and consists of a pair of  spherical geodesic lenses and two surface acoustic wave (SAW)  acousto-optic modulators (AOMs). The SAW interdigital  transducer (IDT) is fabricated by conventional photolithography  on a 0.8-micron sputtered Al film; each IDT has six electrodes  with a length of 8mm and a period of 30 microns.  Frequency-shifting range is 10 MHz, AOM center frequency is 107  MHz, and AOM drive power is 200 mW.    Four figures, not reproduced, show the following: a  structural schematic of the frequency shifter, frequency  response of the AOM, three oscilloscope traces of secondary  Bragg deflection, and two graphs of optical intensity  distribution. There are no tables.  <H5>  References: </H5>   1. Davis, J.L. and Ezekiel, S., PROC. SPIE, 1978, 157:131.    2. Cahill, R.F. and Udd, E., OPTICS LETT., 1979, 4(3):93.    3.

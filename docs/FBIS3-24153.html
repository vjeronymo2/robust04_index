			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Dzhedzhula: "What Mirror Are We To Look </F> In?"]    [Text] Various public opinion surveys will certainly be  taken on the eve of the elections to the Supreme Council of  Ukraine; their results will frequently prompt voters to lean  toward particular political forces. Those who read newspapers  have already encountered repeatedly sociological statistics  which are made to fit the "image and likeness" of particular  parties or candidates and induce citizens to join the majority.  The psychologists and authors of the advertising texts are aware  of this.    On one occasion the Democratic Initiative research center  decided to conduct an interesting and, as it turned out,  instructive experiment. A party that did not figure in the  political landscape of Ukraine, but which the sociologists gave  a very tempting name, the Order and Justice Party, was included  on the list of parties that really exist. It was suggested that  those polled indicate which party they are leaning toward.    The audacious contrivance of the experimenters proved itself  all the way. In terms of its "popularity," the ghost party took  an honorable fifth (!) place, leaving many other parties behind,  including the Socialist and Communist Parties. What would you  think? Ten percent of those polled intended to vote in future  elections for a party that does not exist in political nature,  or, as many as for the Socialist and Communist Parties. A  strange triumvirate of political forces appeared in the  imagination of the people, which consisted of two existing  parties and one mythical party. There was something very  symbolic about this because the entire election campaign of the  Socialists and Communists has been built on myths and  half-truths.    The most ludicrous point was that some of the supporters of  the illusory party turned out to be closely familiar with its  political program, although such a program does not exist. To be  sure, such enthusiasts of "order and justice" were not  numerous--0.1 percent. However, the fact itself cannot fail to  astonish us as it is eloquent testimony to the level of  political thinking of a certain proportion of our fellow  citizens, whose political dreams are reduced to two  notions--"order" and "justice." As was to be expected, populists  and demagogues of all hues immediately took advantage of this  and began to juggle words in the ring of the political circus  which they themselves created. Naturally, the Ukrainian Justice  Party has sprung up like a jack-in-the-box; it is headed by  former military intelligence officer Mykhaylo Hrechko--this is a  profession that teaches one to collect the necessary information  and package it properly to one's benefit.    So, can surveys and other forms of the study of public  opinion be trusted? To what degree do their data correspond to  reality? Sociologists themselves find that only 6 to 8 percent  of those polled have clearly defined political convictions, and  10-14 percent try to approach the questions asked in a balanced  and sensible manner. The remainder are guided solely by  transient, superficial emotional feelings and do not even try to  penetrate the essence of the issue. But they are in the  majority! The results of the elections in Russia are a vivid  case in point.    So, what is the result? If statistics are a mirror of the  condition of society, are they a warped mirror?... Let us not  jump to conclusions because surveys, despite their imperfect  methodology, bear testimony to citizens' current sentiment.  Naturally we should approach surveys with extreme caution, but  it is not worthwhile ignoring and neglecting them, either.    We know without surveys that at present many people are  looking for their daily bread rather than spiritual sustenance.  As the December referendum indicated, two years ago an  overwhelming majority of citizens of Ukraine could not conceive  of themselves without independence and democracy, naturally  hoping for a better life. By now, the horizon of many people has  shrunk to the size of their stomach. The time of rallies has  gone, and even the most beautiful slogans no longer work. There  is little faith in words, just as Shakespeare wrote: "Words have  become so false that I loathe to speak the truth with them."    At this point a Zhirinovskiy comes along and says  confidently: "People, I will get you out of the abyss and I will  do it right away." He wins, and he leads them into the abyss. Is  the possibility of the appearance of such a Zhirinovskiy ruled  out in our country?    Undoubtedly, the elections themselves will be the most  authentic public opinion survey. Have elections not been already  tested in the Crimea to a certain degree? More than 1 million  residents of the Crimea have voted in favor of the "sweet life"  and "heavenly delights" that were generously promised by the  leader of the Republican Movement of the Crimea, Yu. Meshkov. He  skillfully convinced the citizens that once he was elected  president, the autonomous republic would automatically turn into  one big Bounty, the Black Sea would flow with milk and honey,  and the Crimean Mountains would become mountains of gold.  Meshkov did not rape the residents of the Crimea. He seduced  them with allusions to "my great potential [rendered in Russian  in the original]," without overly concealing that this  "potential" is obviously found in the safes of enterprises such  as MMM, which would "make yours a golden voucher [rendered in  Russian in the original]" (in Ukraine itself there are many such  Meshkovs who will also proclaim their "great potential [rendered  in Russian in the original]," expressively looking north and  advocating entry into the ruble zone).    Objectively, Nikolay Bagrov had no chance of winning. By  voting against him, the Crimea voted against the former  secretary of the oblast committee of the Communist Party of  Ukraine, whom everybody has gotten sick of, and against  post-Communist figures who, seizing power on the sunny  peninsula, displayed their complete inability to control complex  political and economic processes and yet displayed uncommon  sagacity in the domain of "grab-it-ization," which each resident  of the Crimea was well aware of. Thus, the choice in this  instance came down to a simple alternative: vote for what has  already been or for what might be. Since it cannot be any worse  than it is, the choice was made in favor of the person who  promised a Garden of Eden in the "muscatel-and-cypress republic."    However, the Crimea is relatively small. It is hard to hide  things there, or to hide oneself. Ukraine is large; it is  possible to hide out there. To be sure, the roots of our  troubles are hidden and secreted deeply, whereas their  originators--Communists "and their ilk"--are trying to convince  everyone that they have nothing to do with the troubles. The  calculation is simple: Many people still expect solely the state  rather than themselves to have to worry about their welfare. The  illusion mounts in society that a real hero will finally come,  and the next morning life will improve. Once again the  Communists are angling for this role, as if they were not the  ones to have already turned life into a frightening story. The  populist clamor of representatives of post-Communist and  Communist majority in the parliament demanding the establishment  of "social justice" of a Bolshevik type is geared primarily  toward retirees, who number up to 15 million in Ukraine.    According to sociological surveys (let us hope that they are  inaccurate), the once threatening student body is displaying  strange passivity. It also turns out that among citizens who are  active in various organizations, members of hobby clubs--i.e.  those who collect stamps, badges, and so on--rank first (2  percent). Only 0.6 percent of those polled belong to political  associations, and 0.8 percent belong to sociopolitical  associations. Women constitute the predominant proportion of  voters; it appears that they weep in unison over the artificial  and unceasing suffering of Maria on TV, finding moral comfort in  this after the shops and the lines. How will they vote? The  statistics are silent. As far as I know, no sociological surveys  devoted particularly to studying the views of women have been  carried out.    So, what are we common voters to do? Are we to wait for  sociologist-scientists to tell us about ourselves and suggest a  choice? I, for one, will trust my own experience, my own memory,  and my own choice.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> All HOPE I applicants' applications will be screened. A cross-check will be made against the HOPE I Planning grants and HOPE I Implementation grants, to assure compliance with section 20(f)(4) of the 1937 Act, which states: ``The Secretary may not provide financial assistance under this subsection to any resident management corporation or resident council with respect to which assistance for the development or formation of such entity is provided under title III.'' HOPE I Planning and Implementation grantees were required to propose plans to establish a RC, RMC, or cooperative association where one did not exist for the proposed homeownership site, including the development or formation of that entity. In addition, HOPE I Full Planning and Implementation grant applicants were expected to include in their applications all eligible activities necessary to make their proposed homeownership program feasible (even if some of the proposed activities were to be carried out with non-HOPE I funds, such as resident management funds). Consequently, in reviewing Tenant Opportunities Program grant applications, the following rules apply:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An applicant for TOP funds that has received a HOPE I Full Planning or Implementation grant (as a lead or joint applicant) may not also receive a TOP grant, unless the applicant proposed in its HOPE I application to use resident management funding to carry out those activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rule 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An applicant for TOP funds that has received a HOPE I Mini Planning grant (as a lead or joint applicant) may not receive a TOP grant for any activity proposed for funding in the HOPE I grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) All applicants will have an opportunity to correct technical deficiencies in this application submission as provided for in this NOFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted, $25 million is being made available on a competitive basis under this NOFA to resident grantees that submit timely applications and are selected for funding. Section 20 provides that not more than an aggregate of $100,000 may be approved with respect to any TOP project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the $25 million total current funds, $1 million will be awarded to National Resident Organizations (NROs), Statewide Resident Organizations (SROs), and Regional Resident Organizations (RROs) to provide technical assistance to public and Indian housing residents desiring either to establish an RC/RMC/RO where one does not exist or organize an inactive RC/RMC/RO. The awards will be competitive, using the Rating Factors in Section I.M of this NOFA, and applicants must meet eligibility requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the remainder of the available funding, the Department will be providing two kinds of grants: (1) Basic Grants; and (2) Additional Grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Basic Grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All resident grantees that are selected for funding (including additional funding grantees) will access the grant funds through a line of credit control system (LOCCS), based on the line items approved in the work plan/budget. To monitor and ensure the progress of the funded resident grantees this year, each resident grantee will be allowed to draw down up to 10% of the grant funds to begin implementing Tasks 1 and 2 of the workplan. If the resident grantee has reached the 10% limit and all activities set forth in Tasks 1 and 2 are not completed, the resident grantee will not be allowed to draw down any additional funds until all activities are completed. The local field office will monitor this progress through the semiannual progress reports that are required to be submitted by the resident grantees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> RCs/RMCs/ROs selected for funding in FYs 1988&hyph;1993 (including a mini-grant for start-up activities) that received less than a total of $100,000 may apply for an Additional Grant not to exceed (including previous grants) the total statutory maximum of $100,000. A RC/RMC/RO considered for additional funding will be asked to demonstrate progress based on its Work Plan previously approved by HUD. All additional grantees will be evaluated to determine if Tasks 1 and 2 of the workplan have been completed. If the tasks are not completed, the grantee will follow the same procedures as the Basic Grantees and, upon completion of the tasks, proceed to complete all other tasks listed in the workplan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This year applicants will not be disqualified for funding if all of the activities identified in the work plan are not completed. However, applicants applying for additional grants will receive a higher score if the RC/RMC/RO can demonstrate the accomplishment of all of the following activities:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Developed an active community organization that includes democratically elected officers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Issued by-laws governing the operation of the organization;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Developed an organizational structure that consists of one or more of the following: floor/block captains or residential community groups and program committees to carry out specific tasks;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Developed a basic financial management and accounting system that will provide effective control over and accountability for all grant funds, or acquired an accounting service to perform this function;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Identified community needs and interests for achieving resident management, and determined the level and degree of skills and community participation available to support program development;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Obtained a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the RC/RMC/RO and the HA that states the elements of their relationship and delineates what support the HA will provide to the resident organization (e.g., on-the-job training, technical assistance, equipment, space, etc.) and the activities to be conducted by the RC/RMC/RO;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Completed the first phase of the Board and Leadership Training provided by the consultant/trainer that is selected by the RC/RMC/RO; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Has formal recognition from the HA as the duly elected RC/RMC/RO to represent residents in meetings with the HA or other entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. TOP Technical Assistance Grant (TOP TAG)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Grant awards will be made through a TOP Technical Assistance Grant (TOP TAG), which defines the legal framework for the relationship between HUD and a resident grantee for the proposed activities approved for funding. The TAG will contain all applicable requirements, including administrative requirements such as progress reports, a final report, a final audit, and accessing the Line of Credit Control System (LOCCS) to draw down funds. All necessary materials regarding the TAG will be furnished at a later date to applicants that are selected to receive funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F.

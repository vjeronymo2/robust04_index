			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Debts of Labour councils attacked Mr David Curry, the local government minister, yesterday said debt-ridden Labour councils were a 'national disgrace' as the campaign for May's local elections continued to stress financial issues. Mr Curry said 18 of the 20 English councils with the highest debt were Labour-controlled. Brent, the only Conservative council on the list, had been Labour-controlled until 1990. The Conservatives printed a league table comparing Labour councils' debt with third-world countries. Manchester and Birmingham, with debts of Pounds 1.326bn and Pounds 1.233bn respectively, had higher external debts than Paraguay, Niger and Nepal. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's local government spokesman, described Mr Curry's claims as 'an embarrassing own-goal', saying that the UK's current borrowing  -Pounds 50bn in one year - was more than China had borrowed in 50 years. Mr Curry said local authority debt could not be compared with the public sector borrowing requirement because it did not have to perform 'macroeconomic policy'. He said local government finance should be directed at 'extremely well-defined statutory res-ponses'. Mr David Thomas, head of local government for the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, suggested that local authority debt did not necessarily reflect poor management. 'Local authority debt is really there because that authority has responded to need.' He added that it could only be accumulated for capital spending requirements, rather than day-to-day revenue expenditure. He added, however, that the 21 debt-free councils would have more flexibility to use capital receipts. According to Mr Curry's figures only one of these is Labour while 10 are Conservative and two are Liberal Democrat. Mr Curry announced that the government would make no further announcements on counties so far affected by the local government review until after the May elections.</p>

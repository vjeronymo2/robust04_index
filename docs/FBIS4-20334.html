			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by reporter Zhang Chaoyang (1728 2600 7122): </F> "Results of 1993 Unified Inspection of China's Phosphate  Fertilizer Shows: Quality Problem in Small Enterprises Is  Serious"]    [Text] There has been a fairly large rise in the general  quality level of China's phosphate fertilizer products, but the  quality problem in small enterprises is still fairly serious. Of  the 800 phosphate fertilizer-producing enterprises covered by a  national unified inspection, the sample qualified rate of small  enterprises was only 76.9 percent, 19.3 percentage points below  the sample average qualified rate (96.2 percent) of large- and  medium-sized enterprises. Of all of them, the 21  inferior-quality products were all produced by the small  enterprises; of the 93 samples with unqualified phosphate  content, the small enterprises accounted for 96.8 percent. An  official in the relevant part of the State Technology  Supervision Administration (STSA) has pleaded for a  strengthening of quality management in small phosphate  fertilizer enterprises.    The STSA recently organized a nationwide unified supervision  and inspection of the quality of two phosphate fertilizer  products: calcium magnesium phosphate and calcium  superphosphate. The results of inspection of 811 samples in 800  phosphate fertilizer-producing enterprises in 28 provinces  throughout China showed that 644 qualified, the sample average  qualification rate being 81.9 percent. Of them, of the 209  samples in 199 large- and medium-sized enterprises 201  qualified, the qualification rate being 96.2 percent, and in the  601 small enterprises inspected there were fairly many problems  in 602 samples. The main problem is that, because old and  obsolete methods of production continue to be used, the moisture  content is high, the effective phosphate content is low, and the  free acid content is overproof. For example, in the fourth-grade  calcium superphosphate produced by Shaanxi Province's Chenggu  Yuantian Chemical Plant, the moisture content was as high as  26.8 percent (the standard requirement is less than 15 percent),  and the effective phosphate content was only 3.7 percent (the  standard requirement is greater than or egual to 12.0 percent).  The Qiling-brand fourth-grade calcium superphosphate produced by  the Linzi Guoli Chemical Plant in Zibo City, Shandong Province,  went directly out of the factory without going through a  maturation process; the free acid content of its products was  15.5 percent (the standard requirement is less than or equal to  5.5 percent), exceeding the upper limit of the standard  requirement by nearly three times.    The STSA official concluded: The main causes of the quality  problem in small phosphate fertilizer enterprises are: the  consciousness of quality is poor and enterprise management is  slack; production conditions are poor and the technological  level is low; and products are turned out in large quantities  without regard for quality, shoddy work is done, and inferior  materials are used. The official demanded that the enterprises  that were found unqualified in the unified inspection supervise  and urge their relevant departments in charge to be responsible  for rectification and reform, and said that the original  producing firms must recall inferior-quality products and  reprocess them technically. With regard to enterprises that  intentionally turn out products in large quantities without  regard for quality and that cheat the consumers, he said that,  besides meting out severe punishment, cases in which the  circumstances are serious must be turned over to the judicial  organs for investigation into the responsibility for the crime.</p>

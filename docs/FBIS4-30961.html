			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, June 1 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan  Karadzic said Wednesday that his forces will withdraw from an  exclusion zone around Gorazde, paving the way for Bosnian Moslem  participation in peace talks here, UN officials said. A UN  Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] statement said Karadzic sent a  letter to UN envoy Yasushi Akashi during the day guaranteeing  the withdrawal from around the eastern Bosnian enclave, in line  with a NATO ultimatum.    "Dr. Karadzic wrote... that as of that day in accordance  with  his strictest orders there would be no Serb personnel of any  description... within the three kilometer zone in Gorazde," the  statement said. The Bosnian government has said it will not  take part in the ceasefire talks, due to open Thursday, unless  Serbs withdraw from a three-kilometer (two-mile) zone around the  eastern Bosnian enclave.    The issue has threatened to scupper the peace talks, to  which  political and military leaders of all warring factions have been  invited, along with all the major international mediators.    The UNPROFOR statement added that Akashi "considers that Dr.  Karadzic's letter, if implemented, provides a sufficient basis  for the opening of the meeting in Geneva."</p>

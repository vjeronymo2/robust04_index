			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Unified companies register announced A COMPANY REGISTER which should help to improve the quality of the government's economic statistics was announced yesterday by the Treasury. The Pounds 4.3m system will be financed by the Central Statistical Office and the Department of Employment, and should be ready next year. It will replace the two separate registers now held by the departments. The new business register will hold details about companies on computer, including the nature of their businesses and their annual sales figures. The information will help production of statistical surveys. Although a Commons committee suggested the creation of a single register 26 years ago, the two systems have continued separately. Discrepancies between the two registers are thought sometimes to lead to errors in official data. The CSO says the new register offers the prospect of a reduced burden on businesses. Theoretically, at least, fewer companies should have to provide information on sales and other matters.</p>

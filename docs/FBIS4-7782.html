			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mustafa Kurtovic from Gorazde] </F>   [Text] As we are sending this report, the hurricane  artillery attack that the aggressor launched this morning on the  defense lines on the right bank of the Drina River is being  extended on all lines of defense of the Gorazde defenders. In  this attack the Chetniks are using the most destructive  howitzer, mortar, and tank projectiles. The blood-soaked ground  of the free Gorazde territory is trembling.    Members of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina under the command  of the East Bosnian Operations Group and the units of the  Ministry of Internal Affairs from Gorazde are still firmly  holding their positions, expecting new attacks by the insane  Serbo-Montenegrin infantry.    At the same time the aggressor is bringing fresh forces from  the direction of Serbia and Herzegovina. Intelligence reports  state that the aggressor has carried out a large concentrated of  new armored-mechanized units in (?Premlje), and that it has a  large number of new mercenaries from the army of the  self-proclaimed Yugoslavia.    Fresh forces and hardware of the Herzegovina Corps are also  concentrating in the Foca area. All this indicates that, by  bringing fresh Chetniks, the aggressor intends to step up the  offensive attacks on Gorazde.    The announced arrival of General Michael Rose, chief  commander of the UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in Gorazde  should and must bring about positive results in stopping further  suffering of these people, and in the attitude of the  international community toward Gorazde as a protected zone. The  truth about Gorazde's suffering in the latest Chetnik offensive  can be and is being confirmed by UN military observers and UNHCR  representatives in Gorazde.    This is Mustafa Kurtovic reporting for the Radio and  Television of Bosnia-Herzegovina from the Press Center of the  Gorazde District.</p>

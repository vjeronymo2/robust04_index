			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Race gap narrows in Bar exams The pass rate among ethnic minority law students taking exams to practise at the Bar rose to 80 per cent this year, having been as low as 55 per cent in 1992. White students, however, were still significantly more likely to pass the Bar Vocational Course this year, with a pass rate of 90 per cent. In 1992 the failure rate by ethnic minorities of 44.7 per cent, compared with a failure rate of only 16 per cent for whites, prompted the appointment of an independent committee under Dame Jocelyn Barrow to investigate the disparity between the pass rates. Last year the ethnic-minority success rate rose to 70 per cent. Mr Graham Hamer, registrar of the Council of Legal Education, which runs the exams, said he was pleased with the improvement in performance by ethnic minority students but was asking Birkbeck College, London, to carry out a detailed analysis of the results to investigate the continuing disparity. Dame Jocelyn's inquiry found no evidence of direct or indirect discrimination against ethnic minority students, but said there was 'a significant link' between those who found traineeships and success in the Bar's final exams. It concluded that discrimination by barristers' chambers in selecting trainees was partly to blame for the racial disparity in success and failure rates in the exam. There were no marked differences between the marks for men and women in this year's final results. The pass rates for both were about 90 per cent. Mr Hamer attributed the increase in overall success rates from last year's 85 per cent to the additional academic support made available to students experiencing difficulties.</p>

			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Fraud is alleged in Algerian election ALGERIA'S constitutional court has received at least 300 claims from political parties alleging fraud in last week's first multi-party general elections. The claims affect 100 out of 430 constituencies. About half have been lodged by candidates of the ruling National Liberation Front (FLN). The FLN polled 1.5m votes, compared with more than 3m for their opponents in the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). But the FLN won only 15 seats, against 188 for the FIS. Reuter adds: A Moslem fundamentalist, Abdelkader Moghni, newly elected to parliament, said yesterday that democracy was atheism and Islam offered the only true freedom. He told Friday prayers: 'On December 26 the Algerian people said its last word. It was the victory of Islam and the defeat of democracy, which is pure atheism.'</p>

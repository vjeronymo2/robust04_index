			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar struts on empty stage THE dollar stole the limelight from a sleepy pound on Thursday as strong economic data gave the US currency an afternoon boost, writes Peggy Hollinger. The dollar closed at DM1.6650 in London, after hitting a high of DM1.6730, on a quiet day as traders prepared for the Easter holiday. Yesterday, in extremely thin, short-day trading in New York, the dollar finished at DM1.6685. On Thursday in London the US currency had opened stronger because of uncertainties surrounding Libya and Russia. It was further strengthened by surprisingly good trade figures which showed the merchandise deficit had fallen to the lowest level in almost nine years - from Dollars 5.2bn in March to Dollars 3.4bn in February. There was more good news for the dollar in the weekly jobless claims which fell by 18,000 to 415,000. A mere 2,000 drop had been expected. 'Both figures were interpreted as adding fuel to the recovery story,' said Dr Gerard Lyons of DKB International. He added, however, that the sum total of the figures out last week showed recovery would still be sluggish. 'It is nothing to get too excited about just yet.' The dollar strengthened against most currencies, barring the yen, where it weakened from Y133.45 to Y133.40. Leaks from Japan surrounding the forthcoming G7 meeting implied that the US would seek a relaxation of Japanese fiscal policy while, in return, Tokyo would maintain interest rates. Sterling fell against the US unit from Dollars 1.7560 to Dollars 1.7475 at Thursday's close. In New York yesterday it slipped to Dollars 1.7445. The Swiss franc weakened from SFr1.5345 to SFr1.5435 in London before the start of the holiday. The currency won some unwanted attention for its sharp decline against European currencies. The D-Mark took gains, climbing from 92.04 centimes to 92.56 centimes. This brought the D-Mark/Swiss franc to levels not reached in more than 10 years, said some traders. The Swiss National Bank did not intervene, although some traders speculated that further weakening could bring the central bank in next week. The D-Mark found a less ready reception elsewhere among European currencies, and fell to its lowest level in almost a year against the French franc, dropping from FFr3.3823 to FFr3.3800. Sterling continued to keep its head above DM2.91 in thin European trading. Dealers said there was still strong underlying demand for the pound and most looked for the currency to nudge the DM2.95 barrier soon.</p>

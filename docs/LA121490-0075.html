			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MENORAH MUST GO OR BE PLACED NEXT TO CHRISTMAS TREE;  </P> <P> COURTS: FEDERAL JUDGE'S DECISION IS BASED ON SUPREME COURT VIEW THAT SYMBOLS  COULD BE TOGETHER IN DISPLAY OF RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE. CANDELABRUM WAS PLACED IN  BEVERLY HILLS PUBLIC PARK.  </P> <P> A federal judge ordered the city of Beverly Hills Thursday to take down a  28-foot Hanukkah menorah or to see that it is displayed next to a comparably  sized Christmas tree.  </P> <P> The ruling by U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. came after the American  Jewish Congress, four Beverly Hills residents and the American Civil Liberties  Union asked that the Chabad organization of Hasidic Jews be required to remove  the nine-branched candelabrum from a public park diagonally across the street  from the Beverly Hills City Hall. The groups filed suit Monday to have the  menorah removed.  </P> <P> They argued that the display of the menorah on public property so close to the  seat of government violated the 1st Amendment ban on the establishment of  religion.  </P> <P> Hatter ruled Thursday on a request for a temporary restraining order. However,  the larger suit -- to decide on future displays -- is pending. A hearing is set  for Dec. 21.  </P> <P> In his ruling Thursday, Hatter relied heavily on a 1989 decision in which the  U.S. Supreme Court said that the Constitution would not be violated if symbols  of different religions are exhibited next to each other as a display of  religious tolerance.  </P> <P> Erected earlier this week for the eight-day Hanukkah holiday, which started  Tuesday night, the menorah now stands alone in a stretch of parkland along busy  Santa Monica Boulevard.  </P> <P> In order to meet the Supreme Court's standard, Hatter said, the menorah would  have to be moved next to an illuminated Christmas tree one block away, or a  Christmas tree would have to be erected next to it.  </P> <P> He also said that the lights of the Christmas tree and the menorah could only  be lit by city workers, in order to emphasize the secular nature of the  display, and that there could be no religious ceremonies at the site.  </P> <P> Chabad has scheduled a Hanukkah party there Sunday, but Rabbi Boruch Hecht, a  leader of the group, promised that no blessings would be recited over the  menorah.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills officials had no immediate response to the ruling.  </P> <P> Marshall B. Grossman, Chabad's attorney, said that he would be glad to pay for  the decorations required to set up a Christmas tree next to the menorah.  </P> <P> He called the plaintiffs' efforts "misguided" and said there will be one more  Christmas tree in the park.  </P> <P> Douglas Mirell, president of the Pacific Southwest Region of the American  Jewish Congress, said that it is up to the Beverly Hills City Council to decide  "whether to continue this ludicrous set of circumstances or to do what they  should have done in the first place to prevent the display of religious objects  on public property."  </P></p>

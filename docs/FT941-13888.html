			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Books: Thrilled to bits by new trends - JDF Jones finds today's private eyes have nothing whatsoever in common with Miss Marple Not all of us read Tolstoy every night of the week. Some of us need to take a break. My colleague William Weaver, for example, when he relaxes from his work translating fiendishly high-brow Italian novels, reads a crime story or two after supper. This is the area where the thriller - when it is not an ambitious foray into the art of fiction, as with Greene or Le Carre - has its principal, useful and decent function: to entertain. Usually there is little for reviewers to say about a new thriller because of most of the writers, including some of the most successful, work to a formula. When the new Gerald Seymour (The Fighting Man, HarperCollins Pounds 14.99) or Colin Forbes (The Power, Pan Pounds 14.99) appears in the bookshops the reader knows what to expect and critical comment is usually superfluous. But the genre has another fascination - the search for the unusual, the off-beat, the fresh talent, a new trend. Some of the best fun I have had this winter has come from Susan Wittig Albert, who has produced a genuinely new version of the American woman private eye, a breed which no longer seems as startling as she did when Sara Paretsky created VI Warshawski, when Liza Cody gave us Anna Lee, and before everyone else piled in with formidable heroines who have nothing whatsoever in common with Miss Marple. Ms Albert's first novel, Thyme Of Death (Pounds 7.99, 260 pages, in paperback-original) is published in the imaginative Mask Noir list of Serpent's Tail. Her heroine is China Bayles, a feisty feminist lawyer light years distant from the mean Chicago streets of Paretsky, who has thrown up her profession to open a herb shop in Pecan Springs, deep in the heart of Texas. China has her shop and her ex-cop boyfriend and her New Age neighbour and a relish for the simple charms of smalltown daily life. Then the murders start, the TV personality arrives in town, the lesbian intrigues multiply, the boyfriend wants a wife, not an independent woman friend. It is splendid entertainment and certainly makes a change after Anna Karenina. The only weaknesses are that the villain is inadequately developed and we (men) are told more than we want to know about cooking and clothes, but such blemishes can be forgiven - after all, we try to forget that VI Warshawski's second name is Iphigenia. * Another oddball discovery this season is Alan Davidson's Something Quite Big (Prospect Books Pounds 9.99, 286 pages). Davidson is the fish man - the British ex-ambassador who has written prize-winning books about fish and the cooking of them - and it is now revealed that, 20 years ago when he was a diplomat at NATO, he wrote what his publisher correctly describes as 'a romantic thriller'. The idiots at the Foreign Office forbade its publication, and no doubt vetoed his 'K' when he had it printed privately. At last it is available, and turns out to be an absolute delight, amateurish, non-violent, erudite, sentimental, and utterly unlike any other thriller that will be published this year. The plot has to do with the kidnapping of an entire Senior Political Committee of NATO diplomats by a gang of (before their time) environmentalists. It is very much an insider's joke about the profession of diplomacy (the abducted officials happily settle down to an exercise in drafting a communique) but the joke is accessible and the result can only be described as charming. It does not matter that the dialogue also reads like a communique. Perhaps it should be reviewed by our Diplomatic Correspondent. * Once upon a time Michael Dobbs, Mrs Thatcher's youthful aide, was also an amateur and apprentice thriller writer. That was how he created the villain of the decade, Francis Urquhart, in House of Cards (much helped by Ian Richardson's TV performances). Now Dobbs has become the professional, but he will need more than Richardson to rescue his latest, The Touch Of Innocents (HarperCollins Pounds 9.99, 271 pages). Again we are offered an allegedly insider-view. There is a dastardly and charismatic Defence Secretary ('A man, like a good malt, improving with age. And moist, pale blue eyes': who he?); a star woman television journalist; a contract for the Duster joint-venture fighter aircraft; a politician's daughter on drugs . . . But it is a curiously incoherent, ill-paced tale, not helped by an evident obligation to appeal to the American market: it turns out to be 'about' a woman's independence, motherhood, custody, which is all very fine except that this has to be inserted into the routine formulas of the 'political thriller'. Our Political Editor has sent it back to me. * Once upon a time Peter Driscoll wrote a good thriller, The Wilby Conspiracy, which was turned into an even better film with Nicol Williamson. His latest, Spoils Of War (Bantam Pounds 15.99, 318 pages) is routine stuff set in Iraq and Kuwait after the Gulf War and redeemed by the quality of the local detail. There are various Arab villains, a breaking marriage, sympathy for the Kurds, a rather pale hero. It deserves to be reviewed by our Middle East Editor. * Tim Sebastian is one of the TV reporters who have cashed in on their fragile fame to produce best-sellers purporting to tell the story behind the news. Special Relations (Orion Pounds 14.99, 308 pages) is based on the corniest idea of 1994, that the US President and the British prime minister (female) had a grand affair 30 years ago in Oxford and have had no contact with each other since then. Now they have to sort out a crisis about missile silos in the Ukraine. '(He) 'You feel just the same'. (She) 'There's more of me'. She turned towards him and ran her hand down his stomach. 'And there's less of you'. (He) 'That's not very flattering'. She giggled again. 'I didn't mean there. I meant your waist . . .'' Who on earth can these people be? I must ask our Defence Correspondent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 25 Jun--You have done a great deal for the  reconciliation between our nations and a great deal for one  Europe, President Lech Walesa said today at the Belweder while  presenting the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Polish  Republic to German President Richard von Weizsaecker.    Weizsaecker, whose visit to Poland is his last as president,  then presented Lech Walesa with the Grand Cross of the Order of  Merit, the highest German decoration.    Lech Walesa said: "In my country, you are considered a great  friend of Poland and the Poles. You have always supported  friendly relations, as well as understanding and neighborly  cooperation. You were one of the first to speak out in favor of  overcoming our difficult past and removing the barriers dividing  our states and nations. It was you who said: Let us learn to  live not against each other, but together. You said that at a  time when admitting friendly feelings toward Poland was  unpopular."    The president stressed that Richard von Weizsaecker is a  politician who "wanted to use traditional Christian values such  as truth, respect, love, and good as a measure for mutual  interstate relations." "You also wanted these values to become  a foundation of future Polish-German neighborliness. This has  made you a worthy successor of the Konrad Adenauer idea. You  believe, as he did, that the new Germany will become a good  neighbor of Poland," Walesa added.    Weizsaecker said that, during his entire political life,  relations between Poland and Germany "have been particularly  close to my heart." "I would like to thank you and your fellow  citizens for the leading role played by Poland under your  leadership in gaining freedom for Europe," he told Lech Walesa.  "While not forgetting the past, let us create the future  together," the German president said.    Richard von Weizsaecker will be a guest of a conference on  "A  New Germany in a New World," organized by the Stefan Batory  Foundation, the RESPUBLICA NOVA monthly, and the Robert Bosch  Foundation.</p>

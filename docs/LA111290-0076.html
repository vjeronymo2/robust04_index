			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: WESTCOUNTY;  </P> <P> COUNTY ISSUE AGRICULTURAL LAND  </P> <P> A citizens group has started a drive to place a ballot measure before voters to  stop development of agricultural land within Camarillo. Farmers say the measure  is unfair because it dictates what they can do with their land. Should the  remaining 1,600 acres of agricultural land located within the Camarillo city  limits be preserved?  </P> <P> Cynthia A. Schutt, Concerned citizen  </P> <P>  Yes, I do feel that the land should be preserved. I don't have the exact  figures, but agricultural land in the Camarillo area is rated, and on a scale  of one to 10 we're at about three. Which means we have some of the richest soil  within the whole United States. This is fertile soil needed for food in the  future. I really think that if we pave over or sell to business people, it will  be gone forever. In regard to the farmers, I understand this is a very heated  issue. However, most of the farmland in Camarillo is leased by the farmers and  therefore isn't owned directly by the farmer, which I think is a fact that most  citizens don't really know. As far as the farmers rights, I think that is an  issue we have to look into to a greater extent as citizens. I don't think it is  black and white. But once the land is destroyed we cannot regain it. Consider  our eucalyptus trees. So many decisions were made to destroy them. These trees  are monuments that can't be replaced. I think the fields provide tranquility in  the midst of traffic.  </P> <P> Fred C. Ferro, Farmer  </P> <P>  No. The land should not be preserved. It is a city and all the planning rules  and regulations are forcing the development within the city and not allowing  city-type improvements within agricultural areas. Besides they are just not  compatible. Try spreading some chicken manure out there on a couple of hundred  acres and see what local residents say. Also, there's the problem of theft. The  city population can do an awful lot of damage to an agriculture situation, and  by the same token the noise and the harvesting when you get a lot of people  working can disrupt the people living in their homes. If the land is within the  city limits, it should go with what the planning commission says and be  developed for city use. If the city or the residents want it green, they should  buy it. But everything that has gone on so far has been based on economics, and  it hasn't worked out that way. That's the way it is in the United States, and  it's a little hard to change now.  </P> <P> Rex S. Laird, Ventura County Farm Bureau executive director  </P> <P>  I don't know if I can respond with a simple yes or no. Our board has not  reviewed the ordinance. The concern that I have is that this appears, on the  surface, to be a method by which you can circumvent the General Plan process. I  do think it is inappropriate for land to be locked up without due process. This  is an extremely complex issue and cannot be dealt with in simplistic terms.  There are too many economic factors outside the jurisdiction and effect of the  city of Camarillo that make it difficult for the city to be able to guarantee  that a piece of property could remain economically viable. If the people want  this to be a quasi park, then rather than an ordinance maybe they should be  looking at an assessment district to purchase the land. Otherwise you have  acquisition without just compensation. In other words, they are telling people  we have decided that this is what is appropriate for your land and there is  nothing you can do about it.  </P> <P> Bill Torrence, Ventura County League of Homeowners president  </P> <P>  Avery sincere yes. This land is probably one of the few places in the world  where we have 40-foot topsoil, adequate water and one of the best climates for  farming in the world. Agriculture is one of the main commodities in Ventura  County and one of the largest income producers. It is far better to have farms  growing food to eat than blacktop to walk on. I think the time has come for  Camarillo and Ventura County to start looking for maintenance of what we have,  instead of addition. I don't think development is what is needed. I've been out  here for 16 years. It was a nice rural area with prosperous farmers. Now they  say they no longer can farm efficiently. The developers have created that  problem. They've taken away from me and my family and our grandchildren and for  many, many generations to come the dire need of agricultural land for future  generations. Incidentally, I did some research and found that the commercial  buildings in Ventura County have a 25% vacancy factor. The development I  wouldn't object to would be taking areas not farmable to develop affordable  homes for people.  </P> <P> Maggie H. Erickson, Ventura County supervisor  </P> <P>  When agriculture land is within the city limits it is generally expected that  at some point it will be developed, leaving the land outside the city limits to  stay as agricultural land. That's the General Plan of the county, and that's  the way the county has generally developed. In some cities like Ventura, they  have a plan which keeps some of their farmland in a holding plan and allows  development farther out, but still eventually it is expected that land will be  developed. Whereas the land outside a city limit is generally expected to stay  farmland for a long, long time. There are parts of the Oxnard plain which are  very, very rich. It is probably unfortunate that the early settlers in Ventura  County elected to begin their cities on some of the farmland. And when you look  at the maps of the best farmland in the county, a lot of it underlies existing  cities and the homes in which many of us live. I'd like very much to work with  the people who are concerned with saving the farmland in Camarillo so that we  can be effective in saving the best land in the county.  </P></p>

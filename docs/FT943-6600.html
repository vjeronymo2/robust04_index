			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Books: Politics and polemic with a limited shelf-life - These warmed-over essays should never have found their way between hard covers FRUSTRATE THEIR KNAVISH TRICKS by Ben Pimlott HarperCollins Pounds 20, 417 pages Publishing is said to be a rather dodgy business, with a lot of hit or miss. Something like 50 'misses', books that do not even earn their advance, to each big hit. Certainly if you go into any bookshop, the shelves are filled with stuff the demand for which it seems almost impossible to identify. Publishing must be one of the few commercial activities remaining where no real market research is ever conducted. The seed appears to be scattered at random in the hope that one or two may end up as 'demand led' beanstalks. Of course with HarperCollins this does not matter much. Its access to the subterranean tunnels of the Murdoch accounting system has allowed it to pay, by some accounts, more in (unearned) advances to Lady Thatcher and Jeffrey Archer than the total paid to all other authors, by all other publishers, in the whole of 1994. And so, I suppose, instead of charging Pounds 20 for this collection of warmed-over essays the book could have been distributed free. Even if it had been, though, I doubt whether it could have overtaken Sir Norman Fowler's epic, Ministers Decide - so far the loss-leader in the turkey stakes. The blurb, curiously complacent even by the particular standards allowed to this genre, warns the reader to look forward - inter alia - to a 'hitherto unpublished account of the Portuguese Revolution of 1970.' Gosh] '. . . the carnival months that followed the collapse of the old dictatorship . . .' Or should it be Aaah? Aaah, the seventies] The happy days of batty activists, beer-and-sandwiches at Number 10 and 'meaningful' little dinners among academics and 'opinion-formers' on the Left - before the wicked white witch appeared on the scene and sent them all packing. One of Mr Pimlott's problems - not his main problem, but one of them - is that he is simply out of date. There are a good number of gifted political essayists around. Matthew Parris and Frank Johnson still read well even years later. But it is absolutely no good binding between hard covers paragraphs with phrases like 'How happy Kinnock must feel,' or (a good way off) 'Kinnock should not believe that by stamping on Militant he has destroyed the Degsy phenomenon,' or 'the Macmillan era was one of tinsel (sic) prosperity . . . he . . . was an inept, elderly music-hall turn way past his best . . .' or (of Winston Churchill) 'To the public the wartime hero now looked like a domestic dinosaur.' This man is meant to be a professor. But however exalted his position, surely cliches such as these ought to have been edited out before the original newspapers - never mind the book - went to press. The high foothills of journalism, before one reaches the mountain range where serious scholars (though not, apparently, professors) dwell, are peopled by many writers of great talent. In this company - I select names at random - Andrew Marr is better informed, Lesley White more perceptive, Robert Harris (alas presently in suspense) more pleasing in vituperation, Barbara Amiel more persuasive in argument. The unfortunate Mr Pimlott is trite, derivative and, where his predictions ('I have a hunch that . . .' he often says) are capable of subsequent verification, wrong. He has no idea, really, what makes the Tory Party tick. 'Major's position (writing in July 1993) is worse that that of Chamberlain in 1940.' Nor much idea, it would seem, of what is happening to Labour: '. . . by widening the gap between itself and the Alliance Labour has removed the question-mark over its status as the main Opposition party, and much may flow from that.' He is irritatingly slack in his use of words. Regime can apply to diet, dictatorship, or fitness schedules. Only Dave Spart or lazy journalists use it to describe democratically elected administrations. In a short piece on Christopher Hitchens (containing the only joke - a personal one about the appearance of the author - that I could find in the book) Pimlott says that 'the test (of collection of essays written since the mid 1980's) is for the reader to be able to open it anywhere and be drawn into the argument.' Actually, now I come to look at it, I realise that even this undemanding sentence is barely literate. But anyway, no thanks. Twenty pounds may not be much for people who can send out at supper time for an 'amusing quiche' but my advice would be - spend it instead on seven gallons of (leaded) petrol and go for a drive.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Carclo agreed offer values Lee at Pounds 55m CARCLO Engineering Group yesterday made a recommended offer for Arthur Lee &amp; Sons, valuing the Sheffield-based manufacturer of steel and plastic products at Pounds 55m. Leeds-based Carclo, which already had a 29.9 per cent stake in Lee, said it now spoke for 49 per cent of the ordinary shares, after receiving acceptances from directors and other shareholders. Carclo is offering seven shares for every nine Lee. In addition, Lee shareholders will receive a special interim dividend of 4p. There is a cash alternative, fully underwritten by Fleming, of 151.7p for each Lee share. Separate cash offers will be made of 208p for Lee's A preference and 146p for the B preference. Carclo's shares, which had been suspended at 223p on Monday, yesterday closed 13p down at 210p, valuing its bid at 163.3p per share. Shares in Arthur Lee, which had been suspended at 142p, closed 16p higher at 158p. Mr John Ewart, Carclo chairman, said: 'I am delighted that a merger between our two new companies has been agreed on terms that we expect in due course will enhance the earnings per share for Carclo shareholders. 'The combined management expertise together with the broader range of businesses will provide shareholders in the enlarged group with an enhanced investment in a financially strong engineering business.' Mr Peter Lee, chairman of Arthur Lee, said: 'The terms of the merger give our shareholders good value for their shares, including an opportunity to participate in the growth of the enlarged group which I believe has excellent prospects.' Mr Ewart said considerable benefits would arise from the combination of the two companies' wire and wire rope businesses, and increased buying power. Carclo's head office in Leeds, which is coming to the end of its lease, will be combined with Arthur Lee's offices at Sheffield. Five Lee directors, two of whom are non-executive, will join the Carclo board with Mr Lee becoming deputy chairman. Mr Graham Logan Brown, currently Carclo's deputy chief executive, will become managing director. Carclo estimated that for the year to March 31, its pre-tax profits were not less than Pounds 8m and earnings per share were at least 13.6p. Lee said that its pre-tax profits for the six months to March 31 were not less than Pounds 2.1m and earnings per share at least 4p. Carclo is being advised by Flemings, while NM Rothschild is acting for Lee.</p>

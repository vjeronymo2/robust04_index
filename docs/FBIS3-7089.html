			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "FUNCINPEC is Thirteen Years Old"] </F>   [Text] The FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an  Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] Party  marked its 13th anniversary on 21 March by emphasizing that its  victory in the May 1993 elections is a historic achievement.    In fact, FUNCINPEC is not the most powerful party of the  tripartite coalition government, despite its speedy expansion  within a short period of time prior to the polls. However, this  quantitative growth has brought about many great difficulties  for the party to iron out.    On top of these problems, FUNCINPEC now faces scores of  diverse tendencies among its members. Analysts believe that the  tendency to regard the alliance between the Cambodian People's  Party [CPP] and the FUNCINPEC Party as a political ploy is a  dangerous way of thinking. Of late, the CPP seems to have shown  its utmost apprehension over this tendency; it has become more  vigilant than ever before.    Analysts maintain that there are indications now that this  alliance is facing problems and this is probably explained by a  series of secret visits to Beijing made by the two party leaders  recently.    Nevertheless, without talking about the CPP accusations  during the election last year, the FUNCINPEC Party's inability  to win a majority in the polls demands that it makes further  all-out efforts in the second legislative election to be held in  the next few years, though election results are unpredicatable.  The best way for the FUNCINPEC Party is that it should do its  utmost to bring different government plans and programs to  success. It is not wise at all for the party to strive to knock  down the CPP, its political partner.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 May (NA) -- Raul Granillo Ocampo,  the Argentine ambassador to the United States, has admitted that  bilateral relations are tense over the Pharmaceutical Patents  Law.    Granillo Ocampo pointed out: "Within the framework of good  relations, Argentina is seeking a solution that considers the  interests of both parties."    The ambassador to the United States, who has come to  Argentina to lecture to Cordoba and Entre Rios businessmen,  conceded: "There is pressure but Argentina has signed the GATT  agreement, which seeks to define standards of economic relations  and to guarantee fair and free trade between nations."    He explained that, by GATT standards, Argentina meets the  requirements of the international community "at a minimum  level." He made it clear that "if we want a special association  with the United States by way of NAFTA, a special efforts will  be required."    Regarding the possibility that Argentina may join NAFTA,  Granillo Ocampo noted: "It is a multi-party negotiation in which  we must weigh what we have to give against what we will receive  in order to see if it is beneficial for us."    In an interview published in the daily EL CRONISTA  COMERCIAL,  Granillo Ocampo underlined that "if the Pharmaceutical Patents  Law is enacted, we will have a better chance of joining NAFTA,  but our incorporation will not be automatic: Nor will we be  automatically excluded from it if we fail to pass the  aforementioned law."    The Argentine diplomat pointed out: "President Bill Clinton  is scheduled to submit a definite proposal to Congress on 1  July. One of the requirements [for joining NAFTA] will be the  patents law." He made it clear that "no country meets all the  requirements."    To conclude, Granillo Ocampo said: "As in any negotiation,  when one reaches the end of the line, one looses interest in  being a party to that agreement."</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : COALITION CALLS FOR SURVEY OF INDIAN SITE  </P> <P> An unlikely coalition of suburbanites and Indians appeared before the city  Building and Safety Commission Tuesday to demand that an archeological survey  precede construction of an office building near the site of the "Lost Village  of Encino," a major Ventura Boulevard dig discovered in 1984.  </P> <P> But when developer Maurice Cohen said he would voluntarily survey his property  to avoid delays, slow-growth activist Gerald Silver declined the offer and  called for a full environmental review -- drawing laughter from other builders  who contend Silver's goal is stopping development, not preserving Indian  relics.  </P> <P> After an hour of testimony, the commission continued its hearing for two weeks  to enable the city Planning Department's environmental review committee to  study the case and say whether an ecological survey is needed.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE LUNACY OF VENGEANCE  </P> <P> The Lebanon-based Islamic Jihad, which appears to exist only to engage in  murder, kidnaping and terrorism, says it was behind this week's bus tragedy in  Israel and hails as "heroic" that revolting act of homicidal lunacy. Newspapers  in a number of Arab countries have similarly rushed to salute the supposed  courage of the Palestinian Arab who forced the commuter bus off the Tel  Aviv-Jerusalem highway, killing 14 and injuring more than a score of others. In  Israel, meanwhile, in the aftermath of the crime, a few hundred followers  respond to Rabbi Meir Kahane's usual demagogic oratory with cries of "kill the  Arabs," while elsewhere in Israel Arabs come under random attack in a mindless  spasm of vengeance. And so the cycle of hatred and intolerance is freshly  renewed, and so the innocent die and suffer in a war that shows no signs of  abating.  </P> <P> Islamic Jihad may well be lying about its connection with the unnamed suspect  in the bus attack. But, taken together with the suspect's cry of "God is  great!" as he sized control of the vehicle and Kahane's notion that to drive  the Arabs from all of historic Palestine is to do God's will, its claim  dramatizes the inescapable religious component in the Arab-Israeli war. The  long and bitter battle waged over this small piece of the world is not only a  clash between competing nationalisms but a conflict involving religious  extremisms as well, adding greatly to the difficulties of resolving it.  </P> <P> Israeli papers report that the suspect in the bus attack wanted to avenge a  beating suffered by a relative at the hands of the Israeli army. The government  has so far said only that he is a Muslim fundamentalist from the occupied  territories, implying that he may have acted out of religious fervor.  Identifying the wellsprings of his behavior may have relevance for legal  purposes, but motivation is of course beside the point when considering the  appalling consequences of the crime. Not for the first time innocent people  were made to suffer horrible deaths. That it happened is bad enough. That there  are some who openly exult in it is infinitely worse.  </P></p>

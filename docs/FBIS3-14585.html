This will erode  the competitive edge that developing countries currently enjoy.  The prime minister raised this issue today during the plenary  session of the fourth G-15 summit meeting in New Delhi.    Briefing Malaysian journalists, Foreign Minister Datuk  Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said he regarded the prime minister's  statement as an early warning for developing countries so they  are not caught up in what is seemingly a very attractive scheme  to protect the interests of workers. He said Datuk Sri Dr.  Mahathir pointed out that such a scheme is not advantageous to  them. The economies of developing countries economies would be  destroyed. They would lose their competitive edge and  ultimately be confronted with a severe unemployment problem.  The only advantage that developing countries currently have is  cheap labor. This has enabled them to develop their economies  and produce goods at a much cheaper price. On the other hand,  the developed nations have numerous advantages, such as capital,  skilled manpower, and modern technology.    Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir told leaders at the session that if  they are forced to accept the global minimum wage scheme, their  economies will be continuously harmed. Although the scheme  looks good on the surface, it will not be beneficial because it  will ultimately lead to the closing of factories and bring about  unemployment. He also pointed out that the standard of living  is low in the developing countries and should therefore not be  compared with the developed nations. He considered the move to  impose a global minimum wage a protectionist policy against the  developing countries, regardless of whether such a policy is  linked to issues of democracy, the environment, or human rights.    Datuk Abdullah said the prime minister also welcomed the  issue raised by the Senegalese President Abdou Diouf with regard  to the Western media. The president believes the Western media  does not present an accurate picture of the nations of the  South, particularly the African states. The media only  highlights negative aspects. Malaysia truly understands the  sentiments expressed by the Senegalese leader.    The current leaders of the G-15 are holding an unofficial  meeting with representatives of leaders who are unable to attend  the summit.</p>

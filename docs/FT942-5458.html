			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / UK Company News: DMGT's Pounds 93m for Nottingham newspapers The Daily Mail and General Trust, owner of the Daily Mail, yesterday emerged as the victor in a controlled auction for T Bailey Forman, publisher of the Nottingham Evening Post. The group paid Pounds 92.9m cash for the Nottingham group and an associated printing company, and beat off challenges from Emap, the newspaper and magazine publisher, and the recently-floated Midland Independent Newspapers, publisher of the Birmingham Post and Mail. The auction, organised by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, produced a higher price than widely expected, with the sum, 29 times earnings, being in line with the valuation of a number of other regional newspaper groups coming out of recession. Two factors tended to push the price up - the fact that the company is one of the most significant regional evening newspaper groups still in private hands, and that DMGT has newspapers in the region in both Derby and Leicester. The completion of the sale is subject to the deal being cleared by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The aim is to make the business part of Northcliffe Newspapers, the regional newspaper business of DMGT. Mr Nicholas Forman Hardy, chairman of Forman Hardy Holdings, said yesterday that his family's association with the Nottingham Evening Post dated back to 1878. 'The decision to sell the business has been a particularly difficult one to make for me and my fellow shareholders', he added. Some close to the sale believe that Mr Forman Hardy may now be more interested in farming and land-owning than running a newspaper group. The fact that the Nottingham Evening Post was in the vanguard of the introduction of new technology in the 1970s probably means a degree of re-equipping is now needed. In the year to the end of 1993 the business made unaudited pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.8m on turnover of Pounds 24.8m.</p>

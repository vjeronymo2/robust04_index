			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MELEE OPENS TAIWAN ASSEMBLY SESSION;  </P> <P> POLITICS: SCREAMING AND KICKING PUNCTUATED THE SWEARING-IN OF DELEGATES, MANY  OF WHOM ARE ELDERLY.  </P> <P> Taiwan legislators kicked, punched and screamed their way into a new session  today as the opposition stepped up demands for the resignation of aging  members.  </P> <P> Opposition legislators fought with delegates appointed to represent overseas  Chinese communities, attempting to keep them from attending a swearing-in  ceremony.  </P> <P> The ceremony began while the legislators were still screaming and fighting.  </P> <P> An aide to one of the overseas Chinese representatives yelled at protesters:  "If I were in America now, I'd take my gun and shoot all of you."  </P> <P> During the singing of the national anthem, opposition member Wu Yung-hsiung  leaped onto the podium and started screaming abuse at the overseas Chinese  delegates.  </P> <P> Even after he was dragged down, Wu, wearing a bright orange costume festooned  with slogans, continued to scream as legislators raised their arms to be sworn  in.  </P> <P> Only 101 members of the legislature were selected on Taiwan.  </P> <P> The majority -- 162 -- represent the seats they were first elected to in China  before the ruling Nationalist Party fled to Taiwan from the Communist victory  on the mainland in 1949.  </P> <P> An additional 29 representatives are appointed to represent overseas Chinese.  </P> <P> Chaos was also the dominant theme during registration for the National  Assembly, a separate body which next month elects Taiwan's president and vice  president.  </P> <P> Opposition politicians forcibly tried to keep the members -- in their 80s and  90s -- who dominate the assembly from signing in, pushing at least one old man  to the ground and grabbing pens from members' hands.  </P> <P> "Don't touch me; my health is bad," one old assemblyman screamed. "If I die you  must answer for my murder."  </P> <P> Some relatives escorting the assemblymen pleaded with protesters to leave the  old people alone. "They have high blood pressure; you can't do this to them,"  one woman said.  </P> <P> The opposition politicians were unmoved.  </P> <P> "We want all the people to see how ridiculous our National Assembly is," said  Hung Chi-chang, an opposition legislator.  </P></p>

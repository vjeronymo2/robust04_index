			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleg Falichev: "Army Reforms Proceeding </F> According to Plan"]    [Text] Do the Army's reforms reflect reality? Are they  headed in the proper direction? What has been accomplished so  far and what is planned for the near future? These questions  have no simple answers. The questions were addressed at a press  conference held by the Information and Press Directorate, RF MO  [Russian Federation Ministry of Defense]. Participating in the  conference were Colonel General V. Zhurbenko, first deputy chief  of the General Staff, RF Armed Forces; Lieutenant General G.  Ivanov, chief, Military Construction and Reform, RF MO;  Lieutenant General G. Bochayev, first deputy chief, GOMU [Main  Organization-Mobilization Directorate], GSh [General Staff]; and  representatives of other directorates of the General Staff and  RF Ministry of Defense.    The press conference was held in response to a message  entitled "Strengthening the Russian State" sent to the Federal  Assembly by Russia's President. As reported, a part of the  message deals with the analysis and evaluation of reforms in  progress in the Army as well as the nature Russia's Armed Forces  will assume in the future.    "The Armed Forces are presently undergoing a most difficult  phase of their development," pointed out Colonel General  Zhurbenko. "At the same time, we must carry out measures for  creating the Russian Army and for withdrawing the troops from  Eastern Europe, Central Europe, and the Baltic countries as  well."    All the above factors cannot fail to affect to some degree  or  other the processes taking place in the Army. I believe that no  other army in the world has had to deal with such large-scale  and difficult tasks. And this in the short time since inception  of the reforms. Construction of Russia's Armed Forces started on  7 May 1992, when the President issued a decree calling for the  creation of the Russian Federation Armed Forces. In the ensuing  period, we have seen the formation of the Ministry of Defense;  conduct of an analysis of the actual state of the Armed Forces;  development and presidential approval of a concept of their  construction; writing of directives governing combat and  mobilizational readiness and operational-strategic planning; and  preparation of a number of legislative acts dealing with  military issues.    Nonetheless, as pointed out in the president's message, the  tasks levied have been accomplished in the Armed Forces. The  reforms are proceeding according to plan in the Armed Forces.  And if they were backed up by the necessary financing, I believe  that many problems would be resolved much more readily.    In conclusion, one more fact: Since 7 May 1992, the manpower  of the Armed Forces has been reduced by 457,000 men.</p>

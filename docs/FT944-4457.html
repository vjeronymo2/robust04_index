			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Arts: Three pianists of note - Music in London Last weekend we listened to two fast-rising pianists in their mid-20s playing keyboard warhorses, and between them the vaguely ageless Melvyn Tan gathering 19th-century rosebuds for his 1839 fortepiano. Heard in sequence, they invited provocative (and invidious) comparisons. With young Lars Vogt - second prizewinner at the 1990 Leeds Competition: I would have placed him first - came the bonus of an enterprising London Symphony programme; Richard Hickox conducted Malcolm Arnold's Fifth Symphony and a forgotten early Elgar cantata, The Black Knight. Glancing at Boris Berezovsky's Wigmore programme for Saturday, one's spirits sank a little. It is four years since he won the Tchaikovsky Competition, and thereupon began an international career, but here he was offering the standard Russian-virtuoso menu: Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition and Ravel's Gaspard de la nuit and La Valse. It was enlarged by the latter's gentler Valses nobles et sentimentales, and a raw, literal transcription of Rimsky's version of the former's Night on Bare Mountain. In fact Berezovsky excelled in that, translating the unpianistic writing into vividly plausible 'orchestral' colours and drama. His Pictures, however, were chiefly remarkable for their lack of any interesting ideas at all - unless you count taking the seminal Promenade so fast as to suggest that instead of promenading around the exhibition the composer was striding straight through it, looking neither to right nor left. All the other character-pieces were conventionally read, without an individual spark, though delivered with athletic efficiency and much noise. In Ravel's Gaspard, 'Ondine' had an indeterminate right hand, swollen dynamics and a perfunctory solo lament for the mermaid. Berezovsky seems to lack the knack for sustaining expectation and suspense: 'Le Gibet' and 'Scarbo' sagged limply in their hushed middles. The refined Valses needed more distinctive stamps, like the Pictures, and far more sensitive appreciation of Ravel's classical pudeur. La Valse was very loud from the start and increasingly inaccurate. This rather dashing pianist can surely do better. At the Barbican the next afternoon, Melvyn Tan gave us one of his inimitable exhibitions of pure (if slightly precious) character on a period instrument. He is shameless about his graces - here a suspension of breath, there an exquisitely drawn-out phrase - but he rollicks wholeheartedly in his music. Reduced to their original salon-scale, Mendelssohn's op. 67 Songs without Words and the four great Schubert Impromptus of D935 still sounded charming and vital. Tan revelled in bright effects that could not be reproduced on a 20th-century grand piano - and his artful innocence is always a tonic. Both Schubert's A major Sonata, D664, and Schumann's no. 2 in G minor contained similar illuminations, but one pined nevertheless for the sustaining power of the modern instrument. With the LSO that evening, Vogt gave the freshest, most searching and most brilliantly accomplished account of Rakhmaninov's 'Paganini' Rhapsody that I have heard in a long while. Sulphurous in all the right places (and cleanly articulate), positively elevated in the almost-kitsch 18th variation, pausing for pregnant thought between others: how many 24-year-old pianists combine such mature authority with the elan of youth? There, the LSO were not always spot-on. Probably their rehearsal-time went to Arnold and the unknown Elgar. Hickox conducted Arnold's Seventh immaculately, I thought; its wild juxtapositions of formal and popular, ingratiating and surly by turns, got full-blooded realisations and ultra-smooth gear-shifts. There is a kind of towering fury behind this strange symphony and we were made to feel it. Young Elgar's 1893 Black Knight, with the London Symphony Chorus, proved comparatively tame, though worth a one-off revival. It was not a precocious score, for he was already 36. A few pungently characteristic ideas; too much routinely heavy-duty Victorian orchestration, with tuba; a more than usually dreadful, mawkish Longfellow text (after Uhland), awkwardly set with many false emphases. One was grateful to have heard it, but felt no pressing need for deeper acquaintance.</p>

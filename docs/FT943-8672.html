			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: HSBC provides profit Buried among the big numbers in HSBC's interim results was a strikingly small one - the Pounds 7m provision for bad and doubtful debts at HongkongBank Group. For a bank with customer advances of Pounds 38bn and a significant exposure to the slowing Hong Kong property market, that is unsustainably low. Quite what a sustainable level would be is harder to judge. If Standard Chartered is right, and the average over a cycle for the region should be around 1 per cent of risk assets, the annual figure for HongkongBank would be nearer Pounds 400m. In the UK, talk is of a long-run level of around 0.7 per cent a year. Yet Midland's first-half provisions of Pounds 99m, excluding problem country debt, amounted to only 0.26 per cent of customer loans. Proportionately they were even lower than Barclays' which caused a few eyebrows to be raised last week. This would matter less if dealing profits were about to bounce back smartly. The Pounds 92m lost on proprietary trading in interest rate products brought back unhappy memories of the Pounds 119m Midland lost in 1989 betting against a rise in UK interest rates. HSBC does not want a repeat and has declared that it will not re-open positions until markets have 'stabilised'. Since it is difficult to make money in stable markets, last year's Pounds 711m of profits from non-foreign exchange dealing may never return. For bank investors the main attraction of HSBC is that it operates in growth markets. Yet even here the story is looking less convincing. It is still showing good volume growth in Hong Kong, unlike Standard Chartered, but margins are being squeezed and costs are under pressure. Should the trends continue investors will find it increasingly hard to ignore the political risks.</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Paper tiger roars his last after 47 years MR TOM WILDING, the chief executive of UK Paper is retiring after 47 years in the paper industry. He made a small fortune from buying the company out of Bowater Industries for Pounds 38m and then selling it three years later for almost eight times as much. He has been succeeded by Mr Monty August, another member of the buy-out team, who was previously managing director of UK Paper's Sittingbourne operations. The genial and diminutive Mr Wilding, said yesterday: 'I am 61 and I just felt myself that the company is now in a position for the younger men like Monty and his team to pick up and run with it. I can then relax and enjoy my retirement.' UK Paper, the UK's biggest producer of printing and writing papers, has had an eventful history in the past few years under Mr Wilding's direction. In 1986, Bowater UK Paper - as it was then called - staged a Pounds 38m management buy-out. Within 18 months the company was floated on the stock market with a value of Pounds 108m. Its offer-for-sale was subscribed 11 times. It did not survive for long as an independent company. Fletcher Challenge, New Zealand's largest company, snatched it for Pounds 299m at the end of 1989 after topping a Pounds 236m offer from Metsa-Serla, the Finnish forestry products group. But the hectic changes in the company's ownership have tended to conceal an almost equally frenetic development of UK Paper's business. 'When Fletcher Challenge bought us we were not the company that we bought from Bowater. We had spent an awful lot of money and changed the direction of the company,' Mr Wilding said. After the buy-out Pounds 60m was invested in developing the three manufacturing plants at Sittingbourne in Kent and Donside, near Aberdeen. A further Pounds 45m has been spent since the acquisition by Fletcher Challenge. The company's capacity has increased from 250,000 tons at the time of the buy-out to 400,000 today and is set to climb further as a new paper machine at Sittingbourne comes fully on-stream. Like most paper companies, UK Paper has been suffering from the downturn in the paper cycle but its financial performance is now something of a mystery to the outside world as it has been incorporated into Fletcher Challenge's vast pulp and paper interests. But it would be surprising if the company has been making much of a return given the current difficulties in the market and the early stage of its investment programme. Asked whether he was happy with the investment in UK Paper, Mr Garry Mace, chief executive officer of Fletcher Challenge's forest industries group, joked: 'We can always be made a lot happier.' But he added: 'We knew we were paying a full price but we were paying for potential.' Mr Wilding is certainly confident for the future of the company and for the UK industry as a whole. 'The British paper industry is in better shape now than at any time since the 1950s. Its revival has been a remarkable achievement. We can aggressively push forward and take more share of the market.' Mr Wilding will not sever all ties with the company. He remains as non-executive chairman but says: 'I intend to come in only when required.'</p>

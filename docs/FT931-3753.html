			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Markets: Down behind the U-bend, horror lurks - London Markets ON THURSDAY, disaster befell the London Stock Exchange's plans to overhaul its plumbing, and the plumber left abruptly, leaving a nasty-smelling mess behind. The hoped-for new plumbing was the exchange's Taurus scheme to abolish share certificates and computerise the process of transferring them from seller to buyer. The plumber was Peter Rawlins, the exchange's chief executive, who resigned. The dirty job of salvaging the situation will go to the Dyno-Rod team at the Bank of England, by now well used to peering into the City's dark corners in search of the unspeakable. The City reacted to all this much as you might expect the tenants of a ramshackle building to respond to distant rumblings in the pipes. They complained that London was the laughing-stock of Europe, they blamed each other, they said 'I told you so' - and they didn't let it make a blind bit of difference to everyday life. The market learnt the first tidings of Taurus's imminent demise on Wednesday; that day the FT-SE 100 rose 6.8 points to 2,956.7, less than a point away from the record close set on Monday. On Thursday, when the cancellation became official, the index dropped only 3.3 points. Almost all that loss was attributable to a further slide in the shares of Glaxo, until recently the City's darling. All glamour stocks get their come-uppance in time, and in principle there is nothing remarkable in Glaxo's fall from favour. In practice, though, there are two striking features. One is the sheer bulk that Glaxo has assumed in the UK's financial landscape. Last autumn, it was the second most valuable company in Europe, ranked by market capitalisation, and the most valuable purely UK company. (The top-ranked group was Royal Dutch/Shell, which is only 40 per cent British.) Though Glaxo has now slipped back behind British Telecom in market capitalisation terms, it is still worth around Pounds 20bn, making up 3.3 per cent of the FT-SE Actuaries 350, the stocks likely to be of interest to the typical institutional fund manager. When Glaxo sneezes, the market catches cold. The second striking feature about Glaxo is that, for the bluest of blue chips, it is a rather idiosyncratic company. For the last 13 years, it has been dominated by Sir Paul Girolami, its chairman, who has dragged it from obscurity to its present status as one of the two darlings of the world drug industry. (Merck of the US is the other.) Sir Paul, now 67, has already showed one chief executive the door, and this week he did it again, ushering Ernest Mario firmly out. Just as the management is dominated by one enormously powerful and talented individual, so the profits are dominated by one enormously successful product, the ulcer-drug Zantac. Both will soon be reaching the point at which their contribution to the company starts to taper off; investors are understandably nervous about the prospect. Mario's departure pushed the shares down by 6 per cent in the immediate aftermath of the announcement. They recovered much of that during that day, and moved sideways on Friday, closing the week at 665, up 5p. Any uncertainties about Glaxo's management were offset by the thought that the company would now scarcely be likely to make a rights issue to finance a big acquisition, one of the market's recent fears. Still, management succession is an issue; the transition from a powerful chairman is never easy. Look at BTR, another company associated in the public mind with a strong-minded and creative chairman. That man, Sir Owen Green, stepped down this week. The new chairman, Norman Ireland, is eminently qualified for the post, having just ended a successful spell as chairman of Bowater. So far, so smooth. Seen from another point of view, however, the transition is an incomplete one. Ireland is 65 years old, and is best known for the years he spent at Owen Green's side, as one of the triumvirate who ran BTR in its years of fastest growth. His appointment raises the suspicion Sir Owen was not yet ready to hand over full power to a younger generation. The stock market paid less attention to such thoughts, however, than to BTR's results, announced on the same day: an 18 per cent rise in profits to Pounds 1.09bn, and evidence that the acquisition of Hawker Siddeley in late 1991 had not affected the group's traditionally healthy trading margin. The shares ended the week at 610 1/2 p, up 26 1/2 p. Other results were less reassuring. SG Warburg's running assessment of how company results compare with its analysts' expectations shows a surprisingly poor figure - a drop in pre-tax profits by 20 per cent compared with the previous year, twice as bad as had been expected. For manufacturing companies, where expectations had been rosier, the disparity was greater. Investors appeared to be taking little notice of these figures, partly because - Barclays apart - there have been no real individual horror stories, and partly because much of the impact is ascribed to the switch to the new FRS3 accounting principles. Also at work was a traditional pre-Budget rally: BZW's Richard Kersley calculates that over the past five years, the FT-SE 100 has risen some 3 per cent in the month before the Budget, then dropped back exactly that amount in the month that follows. Still, on Friday the rumbling in the pipes grew louder: the drop in the Hong Kong stock market dragged down the FT-SE 100 though its impact on HSBC Holdings, the London holding company for Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation. HSBC shares fell 5.7 per cent, ending the week at 604p, down 12p. The index dropped 37.5 points, closing at 2915.9, a fall of 6.2 on the week. Has anyone seen the plunger?</p>

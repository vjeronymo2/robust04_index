			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / US seeks action on Haiti shipping THE US, in an attempt to tighten the screws on Haiti's military regime, is pressing for a Security Council resolution to intercept shipping to and from the Caribbean nation to prevent any sanctions-busting, a US official said yesterday, Reuter reports from New York. Ms Madeleine Albright, Washington's UN ambassador, had begun consultations with fellow diplomats and was pushing for adoption of the resolution later in the day. It would authorise UN members, individually or through regional organisations, to stop and search vessels suspected of carrying contraband. The Security Council first imposed sanctions against Haiti in June but suspended them in August when the country's army rulers appeared to be abiding by an agreement for the restoration on October 30 of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, overthrown in a September 1991 military coup. The council voted unanimously on Wednesday to reimpose the sanctions, involving an arms and oil embargo and the freezing of funds held abroad. The council acted after two days of violence by armed men in Port-au-Prince, the capital, prevented the disembarkation of some 250 US and Canadian troops sent as part of a UN mission to help with the restoration of democracy. The situation deteriorated further on Thursday when the justice minister in a recently-installed pro-Aristide government, Guy Malary, was assassinated along with two aides.

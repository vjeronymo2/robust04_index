			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Construction orders The UK environment department's monthly construction figures are invariably distorted by lumpy contracts and seasonal blips. But the underlying theme from May's figures appears to be that there is an encouraging spread of activity to the productive parts of the economy. There had been worries that last year's surge of activity had tailed off this spring. Fears abounded that public infrastructure spending would fall away before private sector investment took up the slack. But the latest figures suggest spending on private industrial contracts in the three months to end-May was 33 per cent up on the previous year while private commercial activity was 29 per cent higher. There are other grounds for optimism too. Most construction figures solely relate to new contracts but repair and maintenance work, which accounts for a fair chunk of output, also appears to be strong. An 8 per cent rise in cement sales this year and anecdotal reports from housebuilders suggesting there is a shortage of the posher types of bricks certainly point that way. So far, most of the benefits have accrued to the building materials suppliers. It will be more difficult for contractors to build margins while over-capacity and pricing pressures remain.</p>

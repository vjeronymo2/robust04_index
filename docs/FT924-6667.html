			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Polish enterprise zone plans could founder PLANS to set up Poland's first industrial enterprise zone at Mielec, site of a recession-hit aircraft factory, could founder on resistance from treasury officials to granting the necessary financial incentives. Samuel Montagu Financial Services say the initial cost of allowing tax concessions and paying unemployment benefit will reach Zloty 135bn (Pounds 5.5m) next year, with a small profit by 1995. The plan has been authorised by the industry ministry whose head, Mr Waclaw Niewiarowski, is to meet striking workers today. The aircraft works, which once employed 22,000 people, now has 9,850 on its payroll. A further 4,500 are to be dismissed within months. Workers are demanding restructuring proposals for the plant, suffering from collapse of the Soviet market.</p>

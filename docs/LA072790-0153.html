			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS SUE CITY TO BLOCK APARTMENTS  </P> <P> A group of Tustin residents sued the city Thursday in an effort to reverse a  City Council decision on a controversial apartment complex.  </P> <P> The 16 residents of Myrtle and Corla avenues represented by Tustin attorney  Stephen Johnson say the nearly completed, 2 1/2-story Pasadena Avenue apartment  complex towers over their homes and destroys their privacy.  </P> <P> In an attempt at compromise, the City Council recently decided that the top  story of the rear four units should be removed, but residents were not  appeased.  </P> <P> "I'm right in back of the apartments, and even if they take the top story off  the end, the first story would look into my back yard because it would actually  be a 1 1/2-story apartment with the garages underneath," Kathleen L. Arnold  said.  </P> <P> While Johnson claims the council did not make the findings necessary for its  conclusion, City Atty. James Rourke said officials considered everything and  made a "reasonable decision."  </P> <P> The dispute ignited last spring after neighbors complained about the project.  Staff members revoked the existing permit after discovering that 17 property  owners never received notice of a hearing last year when it was approved.  </P> <P> Although the Planning Commission unanimously voted to deny developer Feridoun  Rezai a new permit, the City Council voted 3 to 2, with Earl Prescott and Jim  Potts dissenting, to issue a new permit with several conditions.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the city may face a lawsuit from the developer as well. Beverly  Hills attorney Joel Ward said he is waiting to hear from the bank about the  financial feasibility of removing the top story from four units before deciding  on any legal action. But Ward said Rezai is losing about $1,000 a day. SHANNON  SANDS  </P></p>

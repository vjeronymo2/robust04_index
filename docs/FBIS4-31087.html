			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [CTK report: "Counterintelligence Has a New Director"] </F>   [Text] Prague--Defense Minister Antonin Baudys yesterday  appointed Jiri Ruzek (1952) to the post of director of the  Military Defense Intelligence Main Office. Until now, he had  been deputy director of the Interior Ministry's Office for  Foreign Relations and Information, which replaced our  intelligence service abroad. However, according to Interior  Ministry representatives, it does not conduct traditional  espionage, and its staff apparently is working officially at our  embassies.</p>

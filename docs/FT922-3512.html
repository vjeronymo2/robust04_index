			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Letter: Negative equity overstated Sir, The estimate of the number of borrowers with negative equity, which early drafts of a Phillips and Drew report suggest is between 1.5m and 2m - and which you reported on June 6 ('Homes that fail to hold their value') - ignores four crucial factors. The report assumes that anyone obtaining a mortgage of 90 per cent of the purchase price in, say, 1988 and who has since seen house prices fall by more than 10 per cent, now has negative equity. However, 750,000 council houses were sold at an average discount to market value of 50 per cent between 1987 and 1991. Sitting tenant council house purchasers would need to experience price reductions of at least 50 per cent before entering negative equity statistics. The report assumes no one who purchased between 1987 and 1991 has subsequently moved. This is an extreme assumption which clearly exaggerates the number of borrowers with negative equity. The report assumes that borrowers do not make any repayments. There has been a sharp increase in the flow of regular repayments, the figure for building societies alone rising from less than Pounds 2bn to more than Pounds 4.5bn between 1989 and 1991. The amount of lump sum repayments not associated with redemption has also more than doubled to more than Pounds 2bn over the same period. Some borrowers do have negative equity. However, concentration on the relationship between one asset (home) and one liability (mortgage) tells us nothing about the ability of borrowers to move home. In many cases, especially in northern England, the extent of negative equity can be measured in hundreds, rather than thousands of pounds. A major weakness of the report is its inability to quantify the cash sums involved. There are other technical comments that one might make on the report. Overall, however, the 1.5m estimate of borrowers with negative equity significantly over-estimates the true situation.

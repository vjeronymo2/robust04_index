			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> 76ER BARKLEY IN EARRING THRONG  </P> <P> Charles Barkley doesn't have an NBA championship ring on his finger, but he  does have a winning streak ring on his ear.  </P> <P> Barkley showed up in the Philadelphia 76ers locker room Wednesday night wearing  a diamond-studded earring on his left ear, similar to those worn by Mike  Gminski and Rick Mahorn as a result of a pact among several members on the team  to get their ears pierced if they won 10 straight games  </P> <P> They won 12 straight before losing two last week.  </P> <P> "I said when I was ready to do it, I'd do it," he said. "We made a pact, and  I'm going to stick to it. It's a permanent fixture."  </P> <P> According to Gminski, once the team accomplished the 10-game goal, Barkley had  talked Mahorn and Gminski into joining him on the earring promise.  </P> <P> "I think once he saw Rick and I had done it, he finally succumbed to peer-group  pressure," Gminski said. "He was, like, back there making the snowballs and we  were throwing them, and so he had to finally step up to the plate."  </P></p>

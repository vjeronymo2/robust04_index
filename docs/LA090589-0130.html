			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> TRAINER FINDS VICTORY HAIR-RAZING  </P> <P> Yankees trainer Gene Monahan, completing a promise he made just after the  All-Star break, shaved his head Monday after the team's season-high fifth  straight victory.  </P> <P> "Sometimes you have to sacrifice vanity for intensity," he said.  </P> <P> After the Yankees beat the California Angels 2-1, Monahan sat in the trainer's  room while five players attacked his mop of thick black hair. Jesse Barfield  started with a pair of scissors, doing "most of the damage," he said. Mel Hall  finished with a razor.  </P> <P> "He cooperated fully," Barfield said. "He really showed me something."  </P> <P> Monahan, a Yankees trainer for 17 years, made his promise during the New  York-Kansas City series in mid-July. At the time, the Yankees had won as many  as four straight only once -- in April.  </P></p>

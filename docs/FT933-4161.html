			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / SmithKline Beecham suffers US setback TWO US Food and Drug Administration advisory committees yesterday refused to recommend Tagamet, one of the best-selling products of SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American health care group, for use over the counter (OTC) without a prescription. The decision is a serious blow for the company. The US patents for Tagamet, an anti-ulcer product, expire next year after which the drug will be subject to fierce competition from generic non-patented rivals. Tagamet generated world-wide sales of more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) last year, an estimated 75 per cent in the US. The company had hoped to compensate for the loss of prescription sales after the patent expiry by selling the drug over the counter without a prescription for treatment of heartburn, acid indigestion, and upset stomach. The gastro-intestinal drugs advisory committee and the OTC drugs advisory committee, said they were not concerned about the safety of Tagamet over the counter. However, they believed further analysis was required to demonstrate efficacy. This does not cast doubt on the efficacy of Tagamet in its prescription form. The trials for OTC Tagamet involved doses of 100mg and 200mg. The prescription doses are 300mg, 400mg and 800mg. SmithKline Beecham said yesterday it might be possible to re-submit data from existing trials which had been re analysed rather than conduct completely new trials. SmithKline Beecham is the second pharmaceutical company to run into such difficulties this year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Roman Vegh: "Appreciation for the Slovak Unit"] </F>   [Text] Daruvar/Lipik--During the second day of the visit  to Croatia by Slovak Defense Minister P. Kanis and Army  Commander J. Humaj, our delegation met with L. Kolencik,  commander of the Slovak engineering battalion in the former  Yugoslavia, at its base in Daruvar, approximately 120 km east of  Zagreb.    Colonel Kolencik briefed the delegation on the battalion's  situation and on the work it has done and will do in the very  near future. He said that our unit has an important position  within the UN peacekeeping forces in view of its activities,  which consist mainly of constructing and repairing roads and  bridges as well as disarming mines. To date, Slovak engineers  have built eight new bridges, and, in the Lipik district and  Sarajevo, they have checked for mines over almost 30,000 square  meters of terrain, have completely repaired 96 km of roads, and  have built more than 30 watchtowers. In this context, he asked  Minister Kanis to expand the military hardware to include  several STRALOM-type tanks, which will make it easier to remove  mines. Kolencik also emphasized that, in the future, it will be  necessary to tighten up the criteria for selecting the command  corps for UN missions. The Slovak ambassador to Croatia, M.  Kucera, asked the military delegation to make available at least  one helicopter to the Slovak contingent's command in the former  Yugoslavia to allow for greater flexibility in supervising the  individual groups in this large area. The delegation was also  in Lipik, where the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] supreme  commander, General Bertrand de La Presle, on the occasion of the  first anniversary of the Slovak engineering battalion's  deployment in this part of Europe, presented a UN commemorative  medal to its 144 members for their involvement in the peace  mission. A further 210 members of the unit were awarded a  ribbon, second class. B. de La Presle highlighted the high  morale of the battalion, which a year ago was given the honor of  participating alongside another 30 armies in resolving the  Balkans conflict and thus entered into the consciousness of the  world community. He also added that this is one of the best  units that has served under his command. The commemoration,  which, apart from the UNPROFOR supreme commander, was also  attended by the commanders of other UN units, continued with a  parade of military hardware and a gala reception.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ewa K. Czaczkowska and Marcin Dominik Zdort: </F> "President Drives Coalition Politicians to Madness"]    [Text] "President Walesa wants to drive the governing  coalition politicians to madness, and he is being successful:  Aleksander Kwasniewski uses a ladder and a window to get out,  just like the count of Monte Cristo; the leader of the  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] should ask for an extended long  sick leave," claims Stefan Niesiolowski, when asked to comment  on recent activities by Lech Walesa--namely, the fight with the  governing coalition, his refusal to approve the nomination of  Dariusz Rosati, and the announcement of his plans to veto the  Budget Law.    According to the deputy president of the Christian-National  Union [ZChN], Walesa has all along been implementing the same  plan. He wants to be reelected for a second term. "Lech Walesa  wants to destabilize the situation. He wants to rock the  government coalition because...  <H5>  In a Stable System He Would Have No Chance of Winning </H5>   ...in the elections," believes Niesiolowski; he also  perceives the president's activities as an attempt to return to  their roots and to regain the popularity of the anticommunist  electorate. The ZChN leader believes that another move by the  president may be overthrowing the government and forming an  interim government, and, finally, a repeat of history: the  return of Walesa to save Poland from communism.    A diagnosis similar to this one was made by Janusz  Piechocinski of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. "To achieve his  strategic goal, the president must build a political camp, and  right now he is demonstrating that only he, with his  constitutional powers, is capable of stopping the center left.  He claims that the alternative to the September winners is not  the right wing, not the Democratic Union [UD] merging with the  liberals, but himself--Lech Walesa. In this manner, he gives the  Solidarity camp people to understand that, if they do not want  to be defeated once again, he must again lead this camp, and  only he himself is able to ensure efficiency and a victory for  it," says the PSL deputy, who also noted that, while thinking  about being reelected, the president is beginning to...  <H5>  Force His Opponents to the Floor </H5>   "He says: Look, in only six months, I made the victorious  Kwasniewski do such things as leave the Sejm premises with the  help of a ladder. He is showing that he is active, that he is  someone more than just the president. He confirms his  importance." This is how Piechocinski evaluated Walesa's  activities.    Zbigniew Siemiatkowski of the SLD is also convinced that all  of the president's moves and actions serve only one purpose:  reelection in the 1995 presidential election. "All of his  activities are dictated by the desire to gain better footing  before the presidential campaign; this is why he so determinedly  fought with the National Council of Radio and Television. When  it turned out that, contrary to his expectations, the council  became an independent body and even the people appointed by him  demonstrated considerable independence, there came a fierce  attack, criticism of the entire council; he did this just to  have television, a powerful weapon, at his disposal during the  presidential campaign," claims Siemiatkowski.    "The other platform of the president's activities consists  of criticizing his rivals. This is why...  <H5>  The Brunt of the Attack Was Directed at Aleksander </H5> Kwasniewski    "In my opinion, the activities that aim at weakening the  coalition are in fact caused by the desire to discredit the  politician who seems to be his most important rival," says the  SLD spokesman. He also says that the president is trying to win  over new supporters before the next campaign. "This was  supposed to be partially achieved by the people's constitutional  initiative, which gave various extraparliamentary milieus the  possibility of integration. Also, if the president does not  sign the budget, it will be another attempt to find elements  dissatisfied with the current economic policy; it will prove his  desire to take over some of the social dissatisfaction that has  been accompanying the economic reforms for years," believes  Zbigniew Siemiatkowski.    According to Piotr Nowina-Konopka of UD, Lech Walesa's next  term will depend on his ability to stabilize the political  situation in Poland. However, Nowina-Konopka can see that the  president's activities do not serve stabilization. "The  president is thinking about his reelection in terms of positive  developments in Poland. He is convinced that his reelection  will be for the good of Poland. However, I am now submitting  certain doubts whether...  <H5>  Such a Manner of Approaching the Presidency </H5>   ...serves the stability of the state," says the UD deputy.    Stanislaw Michalkiewicz, of the Union for Real Politics  [UPR], believes that the recent moves by Lech Walesa should not  be looked upon as attempts to destabilize the situation but,  rather, as part of the fight for the shape of the political  system in Poland. The UPR leader recalls that the left wing  supported the parliamentary-cabinet government system, whereas  Walesa believes that the balance of power should be respected.  "A constant element of Lech Walesa's game is the following:  When someone rises too high, Walesa draws up someone else from  political nonexistence. This is what happened with Bielecki and  then with Pawlak, who has come to the first division owing to  Walesa, and who is still there." This is how Stanislaw  Michalkiewicz tries to explain the president's intentions.    Krzysztof Krol of the Confederation for an Independent  Poland  believes that Lech Walesa, in all his activities, wants to  maintain balance in the political scene and, in line with his  constitutional powers, wants to represent the opinion of the  people, deceived by the present governing coalition. "We should  not look upon these activities as the presidential campaign."    "It is still too early for the campaign," adds Krol.  According to him, Walesa will either force the coalition to  implement the preelection programs of the SLD and the PSL, or it  will want to form and support a minority government headed by  Waldemar Pawlak.</p>

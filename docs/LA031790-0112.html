			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 CONVICTED OF BILKING INVESTORS OF $13  MILLION  </P> <P> A federal court jury Friday convicted a stockbroker and an investment manager  of bilking a group of unwary investors, including a group of nuns in South  Dakota and retired armed forces personnel throughout the nation, out of $13  million.  </P> <P> The jury convicted Daniel Burkhart of Camarillo and Gina Loren of Stateline,  Nev., on 20 criminal counts, including conspiracy, securities fraud, bank fraud  and wire fraud.  </P> <P> They face fines of up to $5 million and prison sentences of up to 100 years.  Assistant U.S. Atty. James R. Asperger said the two also could be ordered to  pay restitution of $4.1 million.

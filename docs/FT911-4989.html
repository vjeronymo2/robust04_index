			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / UN willing to keep register of arms sale THE United Nations would be prepared to take responsibility for co-ordinating a register of international arms sales, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar said yesterday. Addressing the European Parliament, the UN secretary general said a register would ensure transparency in the world arms trade and could help prevent a build-up of weapons, as happened before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The idea of a global arms register first emerged at last week's EC summit in Luxembourg, at which European leaders discussed the aftermath of the Gulf war. Mr Perez de Cuellar, attacked the 'search for quick profit' which lay behind western nations' arms-dealing: 'The size of the Iraqi arsenal amazed everybody but why were we so surprised? Hadn't we helped Iraq amass arms or made the necessary assistance available so they could produce them?' Mr Perez de Cuellar was last night due to meet Mr Jacques Poos, foreign minister of Luxembourg which holds the EC presidency, over a possible trial of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for war crimes.</p>

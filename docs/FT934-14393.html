			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: The open secrets of a top chef - US food star Cindy Pawlcyn talks to Nicholas Lander IT SNOWED so heavily during the winter of 1980 that Chicago lost one of its best chefs. Cindy Pawlcyn's car was buried under the snow for four and a half months, and after that she headed west, for warmer climes, with two friends, Bill Higgins and Bill Upson. Thirteen years later they are still friends and partners. They control the Real Restaurants Group which has six restaurants - Mustards and Tra Vigne in the Napa Valley, the Fog City Diner, Bistro Roti and Bix in San Francisco and the Buckeye Roadhouse in Mill Valley - a bakery (Painorama), 430 staff and an annual turnover of more than Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.80m). Pawlcyn came to London for a busy visit last week. She cooked lunch for 40 British chefs and restaurateurs and dinner for 300 at the American Ambassador's residence in Regent's Park and in between gave a demonstration at Le Cordon Bleu. In between all this I had 10 minutes to find out the reasons for her success. By the time we sat down I had one apercu into her distinctive approach to cooking. It was not just what we had eaten - lobster tamales with tomato salsa, smoked duck with 100 almond sauce, herb and spice-coated lamb chops and a stunning goat cheese tart with figs - but the fact that attached to each menu were the recipes and quantities, enough for 40. When I said that such details would be treated as trade secrets by British chefs she smiled and said that was not her approach. The first answer she gave me to explain her success modestly passed the credit back to her suppliers. She said the fertile Napa Valley was blessed with farmers, many organic, keen to grow, breed and pick to her specifications. Lambs were specially fed a heavy acorn diet to give the meat a nutty flavour and the ducks for her kitchens were raised two weeks longer than normal to reduce the fat content. Over the summer her chefs cooked with 15 different varieties of tomato including black, green grape, Marvel stripe and vine tomatoes. When she needs fresh grape juice she just calls up a neighbouring winery. And the 200 wineries in the Napa infuse the air so thickly with wild yeasts from the fermenting vats that there is never any problem with her bread dough fermenting. Fresh ingredients have to be skilfully transformed and California cuisine, drawing on an extensive source of culinary influences from Asia, Mexico and, increasingly, the rural US, requires a strong organisation behind the swing door. Pawlcyn leads by example as executive chef but corporate policy is to promote general managers and head chefs to become partners in each restaurant. Such attention to detail is vital because each restaurant handles an enormous daily volume of diners - numbers that would be the envy of European restaurateurs. The Fog City Diner seats 90 but serves 600 to 700 between 11.30 am and 11.30 pm; Mustards with 80 seats feeds 800 and Tra Vigne with 86 covers feeds 1,000, sometimes 1,500 a day at the weekend. Americans flock to Pawlcyn's restaurants because of the quality of the food and the value for money. But in the rather more relaxed California setting they are prepared to eat when they can get a booking and work the rest of the day around what appears to many in Europe as a late lunch or an early supper. Here is one of the restaurant's most popular dishes. RED CURRY MUSSEL STEW Serves six 2 1/2 lb small black mussels, 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, 2 large cloves garlic, minced, 1 tablespoon peeled and grated ginger, 2 oz peeled and diced tomato, 1 tablespoon Red Curry Paste (from Asian supermarkets) 4 cups canned coconut milk, 1 tablespoon chopped coriander, 6 sprigs coriander for garnish. Scrub the mussels well and trim off the beards. Melt the butter in a large saucepan and saute the garlic, ginger and tomato for 2 minutes. Add the curry paste and coconut milk, stirring until the paste dissolves. Add the mussels, cover and steam until open, 3-6 minutes (discard mussels that do not open). Add the chopped coriander; divide the mussels and broth between the bowls and garnish with the sprigs of coriander. The Fog City Diner Cookbook (Pounds 19.99, 240 pages) is available from Airlift Books (Tel: 071-607-5792).</p>

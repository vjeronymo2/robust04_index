			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE DORN'S SUPPORTERS RALLY  </P> <P> About 60 community leaders and residents from throughout Los Angeles County  vowed this week to organize a protest to return Los Angeles Superior Court  Judge Roosevelt Dorn to Inglewood Juvenile Court.  </P> <P> Dorn was transferred to the Criminal Courts in downtown Los Angeles by Superior  Court Presiding Judge Richard Byrne amid allegations that Dorn was favoring  certain court-appointed attorneys. Dorn has denied the charges.  </P> <P> Among Dorn's supporters at a community meeting Monday night in Los Angeles were  Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent, the Rev. Anthony Sanders of the Inglewood  Police-Clergy Council and Warren Valdey, president of 100 Black Men of Los  Angeles. Several parents said Dorn saved their children by intervening early  before they committed crimes.  </P> <P> Dorn has been both lauded and criticized for his use of a state law that allows  parents to petition the court to take charge of their unruly children even  though the children have broken no laws. Critics say he has put juveniles in  custody for the most minor infractions.  </P></p>

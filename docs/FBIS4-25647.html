			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Zhang Zhenguo (1728 2182 0948) and </F> XINHUA reporter Chen Baoshan (7115 1405 0810)]    [Text] Hefei, 10 Jun (XINHUA) -- In spite of the rain, Vice  Premier Zou Jiahua visited the Maanshan Iron and Steel Company  from 8 to 9 June. During his visit, he inspected the  2,500-cubic-meter blast furnace system project, including a  wharf, a warehouse, a sintering plant, and a disk mill, which  was recently put into operation. He warmly praised the  hard-working spirit displayed by the company's workers and staff  members who have increased the company's annual production  capacity from 2 million tonnes to 4 million tonnes.    Zou Jiahua also attended and spoke at a ceremony marking the  full operation of the blast furnace system project.    After his inspection, Jou Jiahua held an on-the-spot meeting  at the company. He listened carefully to the briefings  presented by all section chiefs of the company. He also asked  them about their experiences in running large and medium  enterprises. He said: As a large enterprise, the Maanshan Iron  and Steel Company has invigorated itself by seizing  opportunities, deepening reform, and changing the management  mechanism. Under the leadership of the Anhui Provincial CPC  Committee and Government, the company has achieved great results  in its work because its leading group is united and its workers  are capable. He expressed his hope that the company will  achieve greater results on the basis of its current achievements.    Jou Jiahua said: In carrying out the economic work, it is  necessary to keep the general goal in sight and to take the  daily tasks in hand. We should carry out our work step by step.  The steel industry is an important basic industry. Besides  building some more new steel plants, we should focus on  renovating existing steel enterprises because this is the best  way to achieve quick results with less money. The most  important way to run state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises is to become market-oriented, develop new products,  adopt new technologies, guarantee quality, reduce costs, and  enhance economic performance. He also urged all enterprises to  continue to pay attention to spiritual civilization construction.    Secretary Lu Rongjing and Governor Fu Xishou of Anhui  Province accompanied Jou Jiahua during his inspection. Other  people who accompanied Jou Jiahua were major leading cadres  including Ye Qing, vice minister of the State Planning  Commission; Liu Qi, minister of the metallurgical industry; Chen  Qingtai, vice minister of the State Economic and Trade  Commission; Tu Yourui, vice president of the State Development  Bank; Li Zaohang, vice president of the Construction Bank; Wu  Naiwen, deputy director of the General Administration of  Customs; and Lu Renfa, deputy director of the State General  Administration of Taxation.</p>

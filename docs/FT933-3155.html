The market price of the ordinary shares is 34p, with the zeros at 92p. Net asset value per share stands at 40.9p. The new shares are expected to have a gross dividend yield of 12 per cent, compared with the present 14 per cent. The new zeros will give a gross redemption yield of 8 per cent, compared with 7.3 per cent. Greig Middleton has already received irrevocable undertakings to accept the recommended offer from holders of 46.87 per cent of the ordinary. There is no cash alternative, but Gartmore Value Investments will continue to be run alongside the new trust until it is wound up as planned in January 1995. The new trust is expected to be wound up on April 30 2002.</p>

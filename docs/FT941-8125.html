			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: MAM's Pounds 5m for venture group Mercury Asset Management, the fund management arm of SG Warburg, has bought Grosvenor Ventures, the venture capital company featured in the 1992 BBC series 'The Adventurers'. The move is the first outright purchase by one venture capital group of another but confirms a trend towards a consolidation within the industry as the raising of funds has become increasingly difficult in the UK. MAM is understood to have paid about Pounds 5m for Grosvenor Ventures, which manages Grosvenor Development Capital and four limited partnerships and has investments of more than Pounds 50m. The Grosvenor team will remain in the Slough offices and will join MAM's development capital arm, which manages about Pounds 400m of venture and development capital investments. The sale has been expected within the industry since Grosvenor failed to raise a new fund from investors and the departure of chairman Mr Robert Drummond after a disagreement over the future direction of the company. MAM said Grosvenor's business was complementary and that the new owner would discuss over the coming months the injection of new funds for Grosvenor to manage. 'They (Grosvenor) have good access to a regional deal flow at the smaller end of the market for deals of Pounds 750,000 up to Pounds 2.5m which is what we want them to do,' said MAM's Ms Sandra O'Neill. 'MAM will concentrate on larger buy-outs from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 30m.' The announcement of the sale came as Grosvenor Development Capital, the listed invested trust, which is managed by Grosvenor Venture Managers, announced its best annual performance since it was listed in 1989. Net assets increased by 31 per cent to Pounds 15.5m, in the year to 31 December 1993, and assets per share rose to 192.3p.</p>

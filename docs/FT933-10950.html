			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Gunsmith over a barrel - A family company which has lost its market TIBOR Takats has a lethal workshop. It is a repository of ballistic hardware: the kind of place Serbian militiamen dream about. There are guns galore: bolt actions, pump actions, double barrels, pistols, stocks, grips and firing mechanisms by the boxful. Sitting amid the stockpile and wearing his spectacles and crumpled cardigan, Takats - a Hungarian war veteran - looks more like Gepetto, the benevolent wood carver in Pinocchio, than a firearms manufacturer. Unlike Gepetto, Takats' story is no fairy tale. As a teenager in Nazi-occupied Budapest, his apprenticeship at Skaba and Plokl, the city's leading gunsmith, was interrupted in 1944 when he was drafted to fight the advancing Russians. The craftsman says he only survived because he was hospitalised with shell shock. Captured and interned in 1945, he decided to flee Hungary after being forced to 'loot furniture for the glorious Red Army'. He escaped, only to be arrested in Austria by the British Army which was screening refugees in the search for war criminals. The detention camp near Klagenfurt proved to be Takats' gateway to business in Britain; he was recruited at the camp as a volunteer worker for the labour-starved UK. Since arriving in 1948, Takats has built up one of the country's most specialised gun shops. It relies on expertise gained in the back streets of Budapest and in the more refined atmosphere of Holland and Holland, the London gunsmith, where, in the 1950s, he repaired shotguns with pedigree names such as Cogswell and Harrison, Henry Atkin and Thomas Bland. Today, however, such weapons are not attracting buyers. Takats' own business  -set up with a Pounds 9,000 loan more than 30 years ago to refurbish .303 rifles for the armies of newly-independent Commonwealth states - has lost its firepower. Looking round his workshop in Ware, Hertfordshire, the war veteran points out a dusty print of a 19th Century hunting scene. It depicts a poacher caught in a trap and is captioned 'A painful discovery'. The words are a fitting verdict on many gunsmiths struggling to overcome the long recession. Takats dates the beginning of his downturn to August 20 1987. There were no interest rate rises or currency crises that Thursday; it was the afternoon Michael Ryan killed 14 people and wounded 15 others with a Kalashnikov automatic rifle and a pistol. The government quickly tightened firearms law, introducing new restrictions on sales and ownership. More importantly, perhaps, Britain's worst mass-shooting undermined demand for sporting weapons. For many people, shooting for fun had become socially questionable. 'The Hungerford massacre had a dramatic effect on demand,' says Takats. 'Our turnover had been growing every year until the late 1980s. At one time we sold 30 to 40 (shotguns) a month; it's now three to four a month.' Since the peak, the company's income has fallen by almost 50 per cent, from more than Pounds 130,000 to around Pounds 70,000. Borrowings, meanwhile, have risen. In a calculated gamble, Takats, together with his wife and co-director Connie and son Graham - who handles financial matters - decided to diversify into fishing equipment and country clothing in a bid to stem the losses on gun sales. They arranged a Pounds 36,000 secured loan to finance the move, but it has so far failed to generate substantial new business. The recession has persuaded cash-strapped members of the hunting and fishing fraternity to abandon brand labels in favour of cheaper alternatives. Hopes that customers would buy Barbour rather than M &amp; S have been frustrated. Rows of unsold waxed coats, bush hats by Woodrow and deer stalkers from Christy's testify to the malaise. 'There's been a change in social trends and fewer people are taking up shooting as a sport. The prospects are not good,' says Takats. The future of gunsmiths across Britain would be further jeopardised by any changes in gun control laws, he adds. 'Thirty years ago, you could sell a shotgun to a 12-year-old. It wasn't classified as a firearm until the killing of Ginger Marks in the late 1960s.' Marks, named by police as a gangland villain, was murdered with a shotgun - prompting clauses in the 1968 Firearms Act forcing shotgun- owners to license their weapons. 'Any further regulations would not help the business at all,' says Takats. This is not a plea from a businessmen seeking leniency from his lenders. Fortunately, says Takats, National Westminster Bank, which loaned him money at 9 per cent, has not yet turned hostile. Nevertheless, its patience has been stretched by the company's inability to repay any of the capital on its loan. Current turnover means it has the funds only to cover interest charges. 'The bank wants to see some change by the end of the year. We'd better have a good Christmas.' Anxious to placate his bank, Takats has reduced his stock 'to a bare minimum' and even refurbished old and rusted air rifles stored for years in the shop cellar. The discarded barrels lying on the workshop floor do not compare well with the engraved and intricately designed shotguns lining the walls. 'My skill is that I can make components from solid metal with just my hand-tools and my brain. That could die out. I will carry on for my son but if things get worse we might have to sell up. It's not a success story, is it?' Takats Master Gunsmith, 73 High Street, Ware, Herts SG12 9AD. Tel: 0920-462057.</p>

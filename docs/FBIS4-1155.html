			<p>BFN     [Text] This afternoon visiting Renamo [Mozambique National  Resistance] leader Afonso Dhlakama was confronted by reporters  with statements by Aldo Ajello, the UN special representative in  Mozambique, to the effect that, whereas so far Frelimo  [Mozambique Liberation Front] has demobilized some 15,000  troops, Renamo has only demobilized about 500. Dhlakama replied  that if that is the case, the blame does not lie with Renamo but  with the UN's lack of efficiency:    [Begin Dhlakama recording] If he said that, that is his  fault, because the Unomoz [United Nations Operation in  Mozambique] office has a list of over 1,000 Renamo names to be  demobilized. The process works on the basis of lists. We hand  in the lists of the people who are to be demobilized. If Unomoz  fails to set the date, if they fail to go ahead with the  demobilization, then maybe it is a question of incompetence on  Unomoz's part. It is not up to Renamo unilaterally to arrive at  an assembly point and say: Right, you are going home. We have  collected lists of our men and have handed them over to Unomoz.  It is up to Unomoz to carry out the demobilization. [end  recording]</p>

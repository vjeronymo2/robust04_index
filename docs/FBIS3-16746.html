Reliable sources told BASAPRESS that 160 million rubles were  embezzled from the credits granted by the "Gagauzcombanc" to the  economic entities and was later illegally invested in  transactions. The budget of Gagauz Republic for 1994 was a  problem of major dispute, because the localities densely  inhabited by Gagauzians do not want to take part in its  formation. The Gagauz government decided that the economic  entities in this region should make allocations to the budget  "within the necessary limits." Local observers say that the  Republic became almost insolvent; it does not have budget  sources.</p>

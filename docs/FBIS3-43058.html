Ibragimov, Institute of Experimental Plant  Biology, UzSSR Academy of Sciences, NPO Biolog, Tashkent; UDC  577.113:633.51]    [Abstract] In recent years, increasing attention has been  devoted to the study of the genetic system of chloroplasts and  mitochondria as a result of the possibility of the use of intact  organelles and their genetic elements in experiments involving  genetic and cell engineering. Particularly noteworthy is the  analysis of ARS fragments of DNA of cell organelles and plasmids  as a possible means of engineering potential plant vectors. The  work reported here represents the first time mitochondrial  plasmid-like DNA of cotton has ever been identified and  described. The mitochondrial DNA was isolated from etiolated  cotton shoots via differential and equilibrium ultracentrifuging  in a CsCl-Hoechst 33258 density gradient. Electron microscopy  and electrophoresis in agar gel showed that the mitochondria of  G. hirsutum L. (108-F) contain, in addition to the  principal high-molecular-mass DNA, two mini-ring DNA of 6.5 and  2.4 kbp. The plasmid-like DNA was found to contain no  appreciable traces of nuclear or plastid DNA. Figures 4,  references 12: 5 Russian, 7 Western.</p>

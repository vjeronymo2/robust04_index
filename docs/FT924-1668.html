			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Christopher top candidate for secretary of state WITH his economic 'summit' out of the way, President-elect Bill Clinton is expected to announce further cabinet appointments as early as today. Mr Warren Christopher is considered the most likely choice as secretary of state, while Mr Les Aspin, the Wisconsin congressman, is now rated the front-runner for the defence post. It is becoming increasingly obvious Mr Clinton himself is making the selections, using his own network of contacts and relying on one-on-one interviews, rather than following the recommendations of his transition team. The choice of Mr Christopher to run foreign policy would be no surprise, given his closeness to the president-elect and his experience as deputy secretary of state in the Carter administration. His expertise in the Middle East, sharpened by his leading diplomatic role in trying to free the US hostages from Iran, is of obvious value. Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey had also appeared to be a viable candidate for the position. General Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, reportedly hit it off with Mr Clinton when they met last month, but has said he is happy to stay in the military. His term in his present position expires next September. Inside the White House, Mr Anthony Lake, now a university professor but another long-time Clinton adviser and State Department veteran under Mr Carter, is said to have the inside track for national security adviser. Mr Aspin is a reigning congressional defence expert. Like Mr Clinton, he went to Oxford and opposed the Vietnam war but is more conservative than many Democrats over cutting the defence budget. Mr Mike Espy, the black congressman from Mississippi, now apparently leads the field to become secretary of agriculture. Mr Henry Cisneros, former mayor of San Antonio, has let it be known he will not compete for the Texas Senate seat vacated by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary-designate, presumably on the grounds that he is assured of the housing portfolio. Mr Tim Wirth, outgoing senator from Colorado, is still considered the likeliest energy secretary, with former Governor Bruce Babbitt of Arizona said to be in line for the interior job.</p>

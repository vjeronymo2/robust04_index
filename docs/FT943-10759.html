			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Airline cracks in the French financial facade I can write about France in the confident expectation that the French all went on their vacances last weekend and won't be reading this. I have memories of upsetting the Italians last autumn when I unkindly suggested that the pioneering Italian 30-year bond, then being launched into the heady climax of the global bull market in bonds, might not prove a very good investment. Indeed, the yield on the bonds has gone up from under 10 to 11 1/2 per cent. As the Italians have tottered from one crisis to another the French have staged an impressive financial revival. But is it sustainable? The extraordinary bail-out of Air France last week through the injection of FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) of government money demonstrated just how far the French still are from being comfortable European partners with some notion of what a level playing field might be. Nevertheless, in the past 10 years the French have rebuilt their financial reputation by tenaciously pursuing a relationship with Germany at the heart of the EU. The franc stayed glued to the D-Mark when sterling and the lira were blown away. It is still just within the old 2 1/4 per cent bands against the D-Mark. But the cost has been a rise in unemployment to nearly 13 per cent (against 9 per cent in Germany) and a serious deterioration in the country's finances. The socialist government last year crashed to electoral disaster. The unemployment issue is bound to figure much more prominently in next year's presidential election and is likely to increase political risks in the French bond market. Although the fiscal deficit of 6 per cent is not alarming by current European standards, it is also necessary to take into account (as with Italy) the unfunded liabilities of the bankrupt repartition pension schemes. The French authorities are heavily dependent upon foreign finance: foreigners own nearly 40 per cent of French government bonds. That may explain why a few weeks ago I was asked to take part in a strange telephone opinion poll commissioned by the French government. International opinion leaders (flattery will get you anywhere) were being asked to give their views on France's financial reputation. The dominance of dirigisme was suspect, I said. But you had to admire the ability of the French to cash in on agriculture, arms and subsidised aviation. The results of the survey might be published, I was told, if they were favourable. I never heard any more. But I pondered on some of the more silly questions, such as, which was the animal that most struck me as typically French in character? I chose a racehorse, on the grounds that it was stylish but could not always beat long odds. The 10-year French bond yield got down to parity with its bund equivalent last year, but this year the differential has widened again to about 45 basis points. Inflation is low. But the budget deficit has increased substantially and fiscal tightening will be required in September's budget. The financial ratios are spiralling out of reach of the Maastricht limits, and though temporary breaches may be solved through a Eurofudge it is hard to see that France can stay credibly on a convergence path for much longer. As for the subsidy issue, the point is not just that the Air France injection will distort the international airline industry but also that the French government will have to find the money. At the same time the ambitious privatisation programme could be disrupted by growing political uncertainty. As the German economic powerhouse begins to revive on a growing diet of exports, France will have to test its internal economic consensus to the limit. Back in London, I have been taken to task by the Bank of England for suggesting last week that the Bank had not taken advantage of last year's bull market to issue its own Italian-style long bond. Indeed, I had overlooked the issue on January 26 of a 16-year gilt yielding 6.4 per cent. The bond now returns 8.4 per cent so the Bank did well for British taxpayers, but perhaps a 30-year gilt would have exploited the conditions even better. The Italians win on points.

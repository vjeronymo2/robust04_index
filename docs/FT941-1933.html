			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Computer problems take toll on Dorling Dorling Kindersley Holdings, the publisher of highly illustrated reference books, reported a 17 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.51m and said computer problems at a distributor had affected sales growth and increased costs. Sales increased by 17 per cent to Pounds 45.13m in the six months to December 31. The publisher's shares, which more than doubled after being floated at 165p at the end of 1993, fell sharply in December after the group issued a profits warning. The shares yesterday closed 2p higher at 266p. Mr Peter Kindersley, chairman and chief executive, confirmed December's forecast that pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 were expected to be somewhat less than the Pounds 9.65m achieved previously. DK said it had experienced problems over distribution by Tiptree Book Services to bookshops and, in particular, to DK Family Library, which sells directly to homes and schools. Tiptree had been replaced as distributor for Family Library and its services to bookshops had improved, although DK continued to monitor the situation. Mr Kindersley said DK was pursuing a legal claim against Tiptree for loss of revenue and additional costs, but had been advised not to disclose its estimate of the financial impact to date. Tiptree, which is owned by Random House, the US publisher, said it refused to be made a scapegoat for the failure of DK to meet the expectations which its management had raised among shareholders. It would be misleading to suggest that any compensation which DK might obtain from Tiptree would have any significant impact on the bottom line of the company's performance. Another area of disappointment was DK Education, which supplies teaching packages to schools. Earnings per share fell to 3.3p (4.7p), but the interim dividend was held at 1.1p.</p>

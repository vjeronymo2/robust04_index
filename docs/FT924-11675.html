			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Cookery: Why it's time to get back to basics BRITISH summer time ends tonight and winter officially begins. As the days draw in our need for comfort foods grows stronger. Now is the time to go back to our roots and enjoy the best of British. My first recipe comes from Arabella Boxer's Book of English Food (Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 17.99), a captivating exploration and celebration of the flowering of English cooking in the 1920s and '30s. I rejoiced in this book when it was published last year. Just recently it has won Boxer, most deservedly, the Michael Smith Macallan award for fine writing about British food. My second recipe is taken from a book to be published in paperback next week, Jennifer Brennan's Curries and Bugles (Penguin Pounds 12.99). An affectionate portrait of lives and foods of the British Raj, this volume, like Boxer's, is a well written blend of history, anecdote and recipes. ROAST HAUNCH OF VENISON (serves 8) While young roe deer may not actually need marinading, in this recipe the marinade becomes part of the dish and forms the basis of the sauce. 5-6 lb haunch of roe (or fallow) deer; 6 tablespoons olive oil; about 1/4 pt chicken stock; 1 teaspoon flour stirred into  1/4 pt soured cream. For the marinade: 1 onion; 2 shallots; 2 garlic cloves; 1 large carrot; 1 celery stalk; 3 tablespoons olive oil; 1 bottle red wine; 3 large parsley sprigs; 8 black peppercorns; 8 juniper berries; 2 bay leaves. Slice the marinade vegetables and cook them in the oil for five minutes, stirring now and then. Add the remaining marinade ingredients plus half a tablespoon of sea salt. Simmer, covered, for 45 minutes, then cool. Pour the (unstrained) marinade over the venison. Leave for one to two days in a cool place, turning the meat twice a day. When ready, drain the haunch and dry it. Discard the marinade herbs and lay the sliced vegetables in the bottom of a roasting tin. Rub the haunch with 2 tablespoons olive oil and lay it on the vegetables. Roast for 20 minutes at 425 F (220 C) gas mark 7. Reduce oven temperature to 350 F (180 C) gas mark 4 and roast for 20 minutes per pound in all. Once the meat has gone into the oven, warm  1/4 pt of the strained marinade with 4 tablespoons olive oil. Once the oven heat has been reduced, start to baste the meat with this mixture. When the joint has finished cooking, transfer it to a serving dish, cover loosely with foil and a thick towel and let it rest for 20 minutes before carving. Now make the sauce. Process the vegetables from the roasting tin (except any that are burnt), adding the juices from the tin and some chicken stock - enough to make about   1/2 pt. Add the smoothly amalgamated sour cream mixture and process again. Strain and reheat, seasoning to taste and stirring constantly. Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes then pour the sauce into a heated jug, and serve with the venison and a puree of mixed root vegetables and some Brussels sprouts. BRAISED VEAL IN THE MOGUL MANNER (serves 8) For the marinade: a boned shoulder of veal weighing about 5 lb; 6 oz plain yoghurt; l large onion, chopped; 2 inch ginger root, chopped; 1 garlic clove, smashed; a pinch of saffron soaked in 2 tablespoons warm milk; the zest of half a lemon. For the stuffing and cooking: 4 tablespoons ghee or clarified butter; 6 oz long grain rice, washed and drained; 2 inch cinnamon stick; 4 cloves; 4 cardamom pods, crushed;  1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg; 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric; 8 fl oz chicken stock; 2 oz sultanas; 4 oz shelled pistachios; 8 baby white onions;  1/4 pt double cream; the juice of half a lemon; 2 tablespoons chopped parsley. Lay the veal flat and cut a deep, horizontal pocket into the inside surface of the meat. Process the yoghurt, onion, ginger and garlic until smooth. Mix in the saffron and its liquid, the lemon zest,  1/2 teaspoon salt and  1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Turn the veal in the mixture and leave to marinate for at least six hours or overnight. Meanwhile, prepare the stuffing. Saute the rice in 1 tablespoon ghee until the grains are white and opaque. Add the spices and stir for one minute. Add the stock, sultanas and half the nuts. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes or until all moisture is absorbed and the whole spices lie on the surface. Discard the cinnamon and cloves. Drain the veal, reserving the marinade, and stuff the pocket with the rice. Lay any surplus in the middle of the piece of meat. Roll up the veal tightly and secure with string. Lightly brown the joint in 2 tablespoons ghee in a flameproof casserole. Pour on the reserved marinade, cover and braise at 350 F (180 C) gas mark 4 for 2 1/2 hours, or 25-30 minutes per pound of meat. Twenty minutes before the veal is ready, place the onions round the meat. Cover and cook for 10 minutes. Remove the onions and keep warm. Cook the veal for a further 10 minutes without the lid. Lift the veal on to a serving platter and keep it hot in the switched-off oven. Place the casserole over moderate heat and reduce the gravy until quite thick, stirring to prevent burning. Add the cream and stir over low heat until the sauce is the consistency of thick custard. Add the lemon juice, season and pour the sauce over the veal. Crush the remaining pistachios. Saute them quickly in the last tablespoon of ghee and sprinkle them over the veal. Dip the onion tops in parsley to give them green caps. Set them round the meat and serve.</p>

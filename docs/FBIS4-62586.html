			<p>BFN     [Text] In the near future the research and production  association Hartron (Kharkov) will sign a contract with the  American Westinghouse company for the production of modernized  nuclear reactor protection systems for Ukrainian nuclear power  stations. This was disclosed to INTERFAX-Ukraine by the  marketing director of Hartron Alexander Bek.    On 17-19 May, American representatives are to visit Hartron  to work out the details of a business plan.    During the visit to the U.S.A. of a Ukrainian Government  delegation led by Vice-Premier Valeriy Shmarov an agreement was  signed on the American government offering five million dollars  for the project. It was the first bilateral agreement promoting  the conversion of the Ukrainian defence industry.    Hartron was named by Ukraine as a leading organization for  reconstructing control systems for nuclear power stations. It  is known in Ukraine as an experimental producer of control  systems used in missile and space programs.    According to Bek, the money offered by the American  Government should be spent on the purchase and installment of  new equipment, the organization of testing and the training of  personnel.    Bek said that according to unwritten rules the contribution  of Westinghouse is going to be four times greater than that of  the American Government.    As its own contribution to the project Hartron is offering  its production capacities, premises, staff and intellectual  potential.    In Bek's opinion, the contract with Westinghouse should be  long-term and not limited to this project.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Huaneng in China power deal Huaneng Power International, together with Southern Electric International (SEI) of the US, is to build a Dollars 1.1bn power plant in China's Jiangsu province. Huaneng will own 51.7 per cent of the plant to be built in Nanjing city, SEI about 30 per cent, and local government the rest. Construction of the two 600MW units is to start in 1996 and finish by 1999. 'Capital investment will account for 25 per cent of the total and the rest will be debt,' according to a manager in Huaneng's securities department. But the company has still to reach a profit agreement with local government before a contract can be signed. 'We hope they will accept Huaneng's current profit scheme approved by the ministry of power industry,' the manager said. In June, the ministry cleared a price policy for Huaneng based on a 15 per cent return on net assets.</p>

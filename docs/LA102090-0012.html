			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT AT FARMERS MARKET  </P> <P> Seldom have I read such an example of specious reasoning as that offered by  Hilty. Why, Henry, the first half of your article almost had me in tears.  </P> <P> Images of pioneer Great-Grandpa Gilmore hacking away at the soil in the 1870s,  your happiest childhood memories running up and down the aisles, how you mourn  the loss of our unique historic landmarks torn down by unscrupulous developers.  The rise in popularity of these appalling anonymous shopping malls that only  highlight the extraordinary special qualities of your very own Farmers Market  that you list in detail.  </P> <P> Then suddenly you lose me. You tell me that all these things you apparently  care about so much are not enough in today's competitive climate and you're  worrying about it! A word of advice, Henry. Relax. Everything's just fine as it  is. Forget the new construction. Ignore those advisers who tell you those acres  of surface parking are quaint reminders of the '50s, and your place isn't  special any more. It really is.  </P> <P> BRIAN EATWELL, Los Angeles  </P></p>

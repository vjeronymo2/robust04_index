			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Regal Hotel back in the black Regal Hotel Group, the acquisitive operator of 3-star provincial hotels, returned to profit in the year to January 2, aided by the deconsolidation of its Bramhope offshoot. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 573,000 included an exceptional credit of Pounds 1.24m related to Bramhope. This resulted from the subsidiary being controlled by the Royal Bank of Scotland and representing assets that were part of Regal prior to its reconstruction in December 1992. Turnover in the period under review amounted to Pounds 2.68m. The year to December 27 1992 suffered a Pounds 500,000 loss (restated under FRS 3) on sales of Pounds 2.95m. The group acquired three hotels last year and a further three have been purchased - one conditionally - so far this year. This means that its portfolio now comprises eight hotels, of which six are owned and two managed. The company, traded on the USM, said that the operating loss from continuing operations of Pounds 488,000 - excluding exceptional redundancy costs of Pounds 49,000 - was in line with its expectations. It was attributed to the head office overhead being in place before the build up of the hotel portfolio. It intends to accelerate its acquisition programme this year, while maintaining its focus on the commercially-driven provincial 3-star hotel market and a modest level of gearing. Regal noted that a steady improvement had been experienced in trading conditions since the last quarter of 1993.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 26 KYODO -- Japan's largest trade union  umbrella organization on Sunday [26 June] called for restoring  the framework of the coalition government of former Prime  Morihiro Hosokawa in forming a new government to replace Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata's administration.    The Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo) issued the  appeal at a hastily held meeting of its five top officials.    The Hosokawa cabinet, which resigned in April, comprised the  Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ -- of Japan], Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito (Clean Government Party], the  Japan New Party, the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), New Party  Sakigake [Harbinger] and the now-defunct united Social  Democratic Party.    The SDP withdrew from the coalition in late April in protest  at the formation of a parliamentary group by other coalition  partners excluding the SDP, forcing Hata to form the first  minority government in nearly four decades.    Rengo is the main support base for both the SDP and the DSP.    In the statement, Rengo urged Hata, SDP Chairman Tomiichi  Murayama, and if possible leaders of ruling coalition parties  and the head of New Party Sakigake to hold a meeting to find a  breakthrough to the political deadlock.</p>

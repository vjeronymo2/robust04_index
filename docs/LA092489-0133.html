			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 2ND TIME'S THE CHARM FOR CHANNEL SWIMMER  </P> <P> A determined Canadian marathon swimmer Saturday succeeded in her second attempt  to swim from Santa Catalina Island to the mainland for charity, arriving five  hours earlier than planned.  </P> <P> Vicki Keith was greeted by about 25 people when she waded ashore at Cabrillo  Beach about 4:30 p.m., spokeswoman Lori Pyne said.  </P> <P> "She's just doing great," Pyne said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Under 15 Hours  </P> <P> She made the swim in just under 15 hours. She had hoped to make it in less than  20 hours.  </P> <P> Keith cracked jokes about sharks and dodged ship traffic Saturday during her  marathon swim from the resort island to the mainland, using only the butterfly  stroke.  </P> <P> "I'm just watching the ships go by, actually," Keith shouted from the water  nine hours and 11 miles into her 22-mile swim.  </P> <P> Skies were overcast and the seas calm as Keith sought to become the first  person ever to make the crossing using the butterfly stroke.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Charity Events  </P> <P> Saturday's attempt was the last in a series of marathon swims to raise money  for Variety Children's Charities. Those swims included a 31-hour trek across  Lake Ontario on Sept. 4.  </P> <P> "It's a lot saltier and not as long," Keith quipped as she compared the channel  swim to her Lake Ontario crossing.  </P> <P> Keith left Santa Catalina Island at 1:33 a.m. and established a brisk pace of  29 strokes per minute. By 11 a.m., she was averaging 27 strokes, stopping every  two hours or so to take in food.  </P> <P> "It's amazing. She treads water long enough to drink some chocolate milk and  water and fruit cups, then shouts, 'Let's Go! Let's Go!' and the boat has to  catch up with her," said Bill Petrasich, a director of Variety Children's  Charities of Southern California.  </P> <P> Petrasich and the crew of the support vessel, "The Cold Spaghetti," expected  Keith to reach Cabrillo Beach under her original 20-hour estimate.  </P> <P> It was Keith's second attempt at the channel crossing.  </P> <P> On July 28, she called it quits about six miles from Cabrillo Beach after  gaining less than half a mile in eight hours in a powerful current. Keith, who  spent 19 hours in the water, had begun hallucinating.  </P> <P> Just two weeks later, she became the first person to swim the frigid waters of  the Juan de Fuca Strait in 33 years, organizers said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Swam Great Lakes  </P> <P> In 1988, the Canadian mastered all five of the Great Lakes to raise more than  $550,000 for a Toronto sports training and fitness center.  </P> <P> This summer she crossed the 42-mile-wide English Channel and swam 14 miles  across Australia's Sidney Harbor in marathons promoting children's charities.  </P> <P> Keith hoped to raise up to $30,000 with Saturday's swim to support the  pediatric AIDS Clinic at County-USC Medical Center and the UCLA Children's  Artificial Limb Bank, Petrasich said.  </P> <P> The Variety Children's Charities sponsors fund-raising events for children's  philanthropic programs in the Los Angeles area.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 11 May (EFE) -- The Brazilian Army today  deployed several tanks and trucks in the administrative zone of  Brasilia shortly after taking over the Federal Police [PF]  headquarters in Brasilia and Sao Paulo, at the request of  President Itamar Franco, to put an end to a 53-day police strike.    According to EFE reporters, after touring the Ministries  Esplanade area -- where Planalto Palace, congressional  buildings, and the Supreme Court building are located -- the  military vehicles were parked in the vicinity of the cathedral.    A military deployment like today's has not taken place in  Brasilia since the time of the military regime (1964-1985), when  the Army used to deploy its tanks to intimidate government  opponents.    The 7,000 PF personnel have been on strike to demand a  salary  increase, but their negotiations with the government have failed.    Union leader Jair Meneguelli -- president of the Sole  Workers  Center (CUT, leftist), to which the National Federation of  Police Unions is affiliated -- has demanded that the government  resume negotiations.    Meneguelli declined to comment on persistent rumors  circulating in Brasilia that Franco, who last night ordered the  military intervention in police headquarters, is promoting an  institutional coup similar to the one engineered by Peruvian  President Alberto Fujimori in 1992.</p>

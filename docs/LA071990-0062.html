			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLAND CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTING TO HIDE S&amp;L STAKE  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors Wednesday charged Los Angeles businessman Michael R. Goland  with conspiring to conceal the ownership of a Santa Monica thrift that he  acquired using money borrowed from state Sen. Alan E. Robbins (D-Van Nuys).  </P> <P> Goland, who was sentenced Monday in a separate case for making illegal campaign  contributions in the 1986 U.S. Senate campaign in California, is charged with  trying to hide his majority ownership of Viking Savings &amp; Loan Assn.  </P> <P> A 20-count indictment charges Goland, 43, and business partner Clifton A.  Sherwood, 46, of Castro Valley, Calif., with conspiring to secretly purchase  shares of the thrift for $1.5 million by enlisting 10 friends and business  associates to pose as independent investors.  </P> <P> Prosecutors contend that Robbins loaned Goland $900,000 to close the deal in  December, 1986, giving Goland 56.5% ownership of Viking. Robbins, who built  medical office buildings and apartment buildings before his election to the  state Senate in 1973, faces no charges in the indictment and "is not a target  of the investigation," said Assistant U.S. Atty. George B. Newhouse, who is  prosecuting the case. The indictment was filed in U.S. District Court in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Goland, Sherwood and their attorneys were unavailable for comment Wednesday.  </P> <P> Reached at his office Wednesday evening, Robbins confirmed that he loaned  Goland $900,000 but declined to describe the reasons for the transaction.  </P> <P> "If it was for any surreptitious activities with respect to the savings and  loan, that was certainly without my knowledge," said Robbins, who added that he  has worked with Goland in three partnerships developing apartment buildings and  is still a partner with Goland.  </P> <P> The indictment charges Goland and Sherwood, former chief executive of Goland's  Balboa Construction Co., with conspiracy and making false statements to the  now-defunct Federal Home Loan Bank Board and Federal Savings and Loan Insurance  Corp. The agencies at the time approved changes in ownership of thrifts.  </P> <P> Goland believed that regulators would reject an application to acquire Viking  that named him as a major shareholder, the indictment charges. Before the  purchase, Goland had expressed interest in purchasing at least three thrifts in  Texas, Pennsylvania and California, prosecutor Newhouse said.  </P> <P> Within two days of acquiring Viking in December, 1986, Goland installed a new  president and loaned Robbins $100,000, according to the indictment.  </P> <P> Viking, then a one-branch thrift on Wilshire Boulevard, was purchased in April,  1989, by Westside Bank of Southern California. Westside paid $370,130 for  Viking, which was designated by regulators the month before as a troubled  thrift.  </P> <P> Newhouse declined to speculate on Goland's motives for the purchase. The thrift  could have provided a vehicle for funneling political contributions, because  S&amp;Ls are subject to looser campaign financing rules.  </P> <P> A federal judge Monday sentenced Goland to three months in a "jail-like  facility" and ordered him to perform 1,000 hours of community service for  violating federal election laws.  </P></p>

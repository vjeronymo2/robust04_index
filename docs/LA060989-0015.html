			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHERNOBYL REACTOR BLEW UP LIKE A BOMB;  </P> <P> CAN'T HAPPEN HERE? IT HAPPENED THERE  </P> <P> Mikhail S. Gorbachev is reported this week to be visibly frustrated by the  uncanny series of natural, man-made and man-aggravated disasters that have  plagued his country during his regime.  </P> <P> Sadly, even as news arrives of the latest catastrophe -- a natural gas  explosion in which nearly 500 are dead or missing -- troubling evidence from  previous disasters continues to accumulate, posing more challenges to  Gorbachev's perestroika program. The latest findings about the Chernobyl  nuclear disaster strongly suggest that about 15 Chernobyl-type reactors in the  Soviet Union should be shut down.  </P> <P> Last year I started to investigate the Chernobyl disaster, inspired by some of  the procedures Caltech physicist Richard Feynman devised as a member of a  presidential commission looking into the Challenger accident. Shortly before  his death early last year, Feynman described how he had discovered, during a  visit to a NASA facility in Huntsville, Ala., that NASA engineers considered a  space shuttle catastrophe a near statistical certainty before the disaster  happened.  </P> <P> Editing a version of Feynman's account for a physics magazine, it occurred to  me that it might be interesting to ask the leading experts on Chernobyl in the  United States how likely they considered another Chernobyl-like accident.  During the next year I interviewed top people at the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission, the Department of Energy, their counterparts in Canada and  specialists in the academic world, industry and government laboratories. The  results were disconcerting.  </P> <P> The standard explanation for Chernobyl has been that a steam explosion  destroyed the reactor, suggesting that it was like a pot boiling over on your  stove or, at worst, a pressure-cooker mishap that put a mess of radioactive pea  soup on your ceiling. In fact, the reactor blew up like an atomic bomb. It of  course did not blow up with the full efficiency or force of an atomic bomb, but  the physical processes that blew up the reactor were the same forces that cause  a bomb to explode. Moreover, the corrective measures taken by the Soviets do  not preclude an equally severe accident and some of the measures may make an  accident more rather than less likely.  </P> <P> I first got an inkling of what happened at Chernobyl during an interview with  Richard Wilson, a reactor expert at Harvard who has visited Chernobyl twice.  When I asked Wilson to comment on a description of the accident as a "slow  nuclear explosion," expecting him to pooh-pooh the claim, he said: "To ever say  it was not a nuclear explosion is just plain wrong."  </P> <P> The Chernobyl reactors have the unfortunate defect of speeding up, under  certain conditions, rather than slowing down when water is lost. Compounding  this defect, the top of the reactor is poorly sealed, so that surprisingly  little excess pressure will rupture the lid. As a result, a loss of water could  cause nuclear reactions to go out of control, generating enough pressure to  blow up the reactor vessel and release large quantities of radioactive material  into the atmosphere.  </P> <P> Immediately before the accident on the night of April 25-26, 1986, the plant's  operators were preparing to do an unusual test, after which they planned to  shut the reactor down for annual maintenance and refueling. They took a series  of reckless measures that put the reactor into its most unstable state,  unleashing an uncontrolled and uncontrollable nuclear reaction. "Once power  began to rise rapidly," says Edward Purvis, head of the Department of Energy's  study team, "nothing could have been done to stop it."  </P> <P> In just a second or two, this first explosion sent the reactor's power soaring  from close to zero to between 50 and 100 times the plant's maximum normal  capacity. This was an enormously more violent event than had ever been  described or imagined in the voluminous U.S. literature on reactor safety.  </P> <P> Eyewitness accounts and Soviet computer analyses strongly suggest that there  was a second explosion, perhaps 10 times more violent than the first. While  interpretations vary, the most plausible is that the severely damaged core  collapsed on itself, formed a critical mass or several critical masses and blew  up like a bomb. This explosion "completed the destruction of Chernobyl Unit 4,"  Purvis says.  </P> <P> Harold Denton, the former Nuclear Regulatory Commission safety chief who  managed emergency operations at Three Mile Island in 1979, said that he and his  colleagues worried at that time that a nuclear explosion could take place. But  they brought in consultants who concluded that TMI's molten core could not form  a critical mass and explode.  </P> <P> Asked to assess the probability of another catastrophic accident at a  Chernobyl-type reactor, Denton said: "We would not license such a reactor  here."  </P> <P> For decades, spokesmen for the nuclear industry have insisted that reactors  cannot blow up like bombs. But the Chernobyl reactor did blow up like a bomb,  and a similar accident is remotely conceivable in Canada's reactors. Perhaps  industry spokesmen should have said that most reactors, or all reactors in the  United States, cannot blow up like bombs.  </P> <P> Peter Gale, the UCLA bone marrow specialist who flew to the Soviet Union to  help Chernobyl victims, has said he believes that Chernobyl was the catalytic  event that prompted Gorbachev to launch his bold arms-control initiatives. If  Chernobyl had been a mere steam explosion brought on mainly by operator error,  Gale's view of things would make little sense. But it makes good sense if  Gorbachev understood the accident to have been a nuclear explosion that  created, on a small scale, the devastated landscape that we would have on a  grand scale in the wake of an all-out nuclear war.  </P></p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / International Company News: Intel shares slide on competition fears INTEL'S stock price continued to fall sharply yesterday on concerns that the leading manufacturer of microprocessor chips will face new competition from Cyrix, a small Texas semiconductor company, that has launched its own version of Intel's 486 chip, a device used in high-performance personal computers. Intel shares lost 15 per cent of their value last week, stock and yesterday were trading at Dollars 53 1/2 , down from Friday's close of Dollars 55 1/4 . On Friday, Intel filed a patent infringement suit against Cyrix and also accused the company of 'patent laundering'. Intel officials acknowledged, however, that they have not seen the Cyrix chip, or specifications for the device. 'We do not believe that it is possible to produce a chip that is compatible with our 386 microprocessor without infringing our patents,' said Mr Thomas Dunlap, Intel general counsel. Intel is seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent Cyrix from selling its microprocessor chip. Cyrix denies any infringement. The Intel suit 'amounts to legal harassment,' said Mr Jerry Rogers, Cyrix president. Mr Rogers revealed that Cyrix had earlier filed suit against Intel asking the court for a declaratory judgment that its microprocessor chips do not violate any Intel patents because they are manufactured, on behalf of Cyrix, by SGS Thomson, a European chipmaker licensed to use patented Intel technology. Yesterday, Cyrix officially introduced its product, a microprocessor that offers performance close to that of Intel's 486 microprocessor while fitting into the much smaller socket used by Intel's earlier 386SX.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo up on patent ruling SHARES IN pharmaceuticals group Glaxo fought off the weakness of the stock market and the effect of going ex-dividend after investors responded to news that the company had won an important patent case in the US. The stock was the most actively traded in London yesterday and closed 13 higher at 642p xd after 13m share volume. Late on Friday night, UK time, it was announced that Glaxo had won a crucial lawsuit against Novopharm, of Canada, over US patents for Zantac, the world's best-selling medicine which, in the last financial year, generated sales of Pounds 2.17bn, equivalent to 44 per cent of group turnover. The legal victory increases Glaxo's chances of winning a second patent case against Genpharm, a Canadian generics company smaller than Novopharm, which is scheduled to challenge Glaxo's patents next May. Shares were marked sharply higher before dealing began in London yesterday, and at one stage the stock was more than 40p up. However, arbitraging between the UK shares and the American Depositary Receipts traded in New York whittled away some of London's gain.</p>

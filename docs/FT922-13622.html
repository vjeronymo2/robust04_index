			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC wants independent review of Canada's overfishing claim THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday called for an independent scientific review of Canada's claim that overfishing by European Community vessels just outside Canadian waters has cut the cod spawning biomass inside them by a half. Mr Manuel Marin, the EC fisheries commissioner, indignantly rejected this claim last week, stating that the main problem was overfishing by domestic and other non-EC vessels inside Canada's 200-mile limit, and the Ottawa government's political inability to face up to restructuring the Canadian fleet. The commission has made it clear that if EC vessels were found to be responsible for depleting severely the cod stock, they would be withdrawn from the area. Canada claims Spanish and Portuguese boats are overfishing the 'straddling stock' of cod on the 'Nose' and 'Tail' of the Grand Banks, off Newfoundland but outside the 200-mile limit. The EC says the stock that straddles the limit amounts to between 3 and 5 per cent of the total. Brussels contends that even if Canada is right that EC vessels took 20,000 tonnes of undeclared cod out of these international waters last year, the EC could not be responsible for the claimed collapse of the spawning biomass. The Commission wants the scientific committee of Nafo - the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, which administers the area adjoining Canada's waters - to examine the claims of Canadian government scientists. It asked Canada to agree to a Nafo meeting in March, but Ottawa refused, Mr Marin said. Brussels is now raising the pressure for a review, having won the backing of the EC fisheries ministers last Friday. It also announced yesterday it was willing to suspend part of the EC quota in the Nafo area causing the dispute, 'whilst pursuing the objective rational conservation and management of fish resources' that it expected Canada to participate in.</p>

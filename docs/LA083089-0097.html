			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DESERT-COASTAL FOOTBALL PREVIEW;  </P> <P> SEVERAL APPEAR WORTHY OF 1-A TITLE  </P> <P> Football coaches in the Desert-Coastal League are either modest or using  reverse psychology. But no one will admit that their team in the section's only  1-A football league is ready to claim the championship.  </P> <P> What it means is that there is no clear-cut favorite. Defending league champion  Marian and runner-up Holtville will undoubtedly be near the top. But the No. 3  and 4 teams are harder to predict.  </P> <P> Of Holtville, Marian, Army-Navy and Mountain Empire, Imperial Coach Mike  Swearingen says, "You could shake those four teams in a hat and pick one."  </P> <P> Others would include Imperial in the list, although Swearingen says this is a  rebuilding year for his Tigers, who have played in six league championship  games, winning three titles and sharing one, over the past 10 years.  </P> <P> At the end of last season, coaches and athletic directors discussed playing two  rounds of playoffs instead of one, and some coaches have said they expected two  to be played. But CIF Commissioner Kendall Webb said only one is scheduled.  </P> <P> THE RACE  </P> <P> Top contenders: Marian (1-A champions, 7-4), Holtville (9-1), Army-Navy (5-3).  </P> <P> Surprise potential: Imperial (4-6).  </P> <P> Hoping for improvement: Mountain Empire (2-8), Calipatria (0-10).  </P> <P> Game of the year: Holtville at Marian, Oct. 13. As the league opener for both  teams, and Marian's homecoming, this could set the tone for the season.  </P> <P> THE PLAYERS  </P> <P> The man: Holtville's strength is the arm of third-year starting quarterback  Alex Wells. Last year as a junior, Wells threw for 1,700 yards and 27  touchdowns, better than any returning quarterback in the state, and led  Holtville to the 1-A championship game against Marian. As a sophomore, Wells  threw for 1,400 yards.  </P> <P> "He's doing real well," Coach Sam Faulk said. "He's just where we want him."  </P> <P> Who will fill Tommy Provencia's shoes? Provencia, a wide receiver, was Wells'  favorite target last season and a key to his success.  </P> <P> "He was an outstanding ballplayer," Marian Coach John Pappas said. "We beat  Holtville (for the league title) because we were able to stop him. We geared  our defense around him."  </P> <P> Senior David Amavisca played halfback the past two years, but with the addition  of sophomore running back Mario Lizarraga (6-1, 175) and loss of Provencia,  Amavisca will move to split end.  </P> <P> Others to watch on offense: Imperial's third-year starter Leon Jackson, who has  rushed for 1,658 yards in his career, returns as one of the top running backs.  </P> <P> Others to watch on defense: Senior John Baumgartner (5-feet-11, 185) was an  all-league fullback last year but will also be a defensive key at starting  inside linebacker for Army-Navy. Baumgartner has attracted attention from  Brigham Young and San Diego State, Simmons said.  </P> <P> Marian defensive back Jamarr Brown is the player who, as a sophomore, stopped  Holtville's Provencia in the championship game. Senior teammate Raul Souza is a  returning all-league defensive lineman.  </P> <P> Imperial is blessed with sophomore Gerardo Castillo, "a legitimate Division I  punter," according to Swearingen. Castillo averaged punted 40.6 yards last  year.  </P> <P> THE INTANGIBLES  </P> <P> First Aid: When 2-A or 3-A programs have been ailing, the 1-A league has  sometimes acted as an infirmary. The unhealthy school limps into the 1-A,  builds up strength, then returns to its old league. Three out of the past four  years, the 1-A champion has been a former 2-A or 3-A school.  </P> <P> Defending champion Marian, new to the 1-A this past season, will move to the  newly formed 2-A Harbor League next year.  </P> <P> Coaches have mixed opinions on schools being able to invade their league, but  most agree it is to their teams' advantage.  </P> <P> "Most 1-A coaches don't like it. They come into our league, get fat and leave,"  Mountain Empire Coach Rick Abood said. "I look at it as we play a 2-A nonleague  schedule every year anyway, so it doesn't affect us as much as the 1-A schools  that play other league schools in their nonleague schedule."  </P> <P> Imperial's Swearingen said that he sees the imported teams as helping preserve  1-A competition, and since the schools have been honest about the reason they  are coming in -- "to rebuild" -- he doesn't mind.  </P> <P> "I think it enhances the league," Simmons said. "We played up to 2-A level. I  like the competition, and hopefully it pays dividends."  </P> <P> Pappas thinks the 1-A is the best place for his team because of Marian's  enrollment but said he is looking forward to the 2-A challenge and hopes he  doesn't regret the move.  </P> <P> No. 1 enemy -- depth: Mountain Empire and Imperial are in a bind as they try to  field a team. Abood must bring up 10 players from the junior varsity to fill  out Mountain Empire's varsity roster.  </P> <P> "You don't lose 10 kids and replace them," Abood said. "It's really going to  hurt us, and most of the kids have to go both ways. If we are really healthy,  we could surprise some people and be a factor, but after this year, watch out,  we'll be tough for a long time.  </P> <P> Imperial lost its offensive and defensive lines and linebacking.  </P> <P> "Of 22 kids, 13 are seniors, and of those seniors, a lot are inexperienced as  starters," Swearingen said. "There are a couple kids who haven't played since  Pop Warner."  </P> <P> Paybacks due: There was a three-way tie for the No. 2 league playoff spot last  year. A league ruling allowed the team that hadn't been to the playoffs in the  longest time to earn the spot. Imperial had gone the previous year and  Army-Navy in 1982, so Marian, the new kid on the block, made it.  </P> <P> Army-Navy Coach Steve Simmons, whose team defeated Marian and only lost to  Imperial by one point, says "paybacks are due".  </P> <P> "We don't forget year to year," Simmons said.  </P> <P> Kings of the hill: Holtville surprised a lot of people last year by climbing  out of the cellar and remaining undefeated until the championship game. Now,  Sam Faulk said, his team is in a position it's not used to.  </P> <P> "I'm stressing that we can't let up. Everyone is gunning for us. We have a  harder work ethic this year," Faulk said.  </P> <P> Marian, also a long shot last year, must also adjust to their new-found status.  </P> <P> "We have a small team, so I'm trying to get their mind set for the long road  ahead," Pappas said. "People tend to come looking for the team on top. My kids  are ready and have worked hard this summer."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> .. .AND WHEN THOSE PENNIES PILE UP  </P> <P> The song "Little Tin Box" is from the 1959 musical "Fiorello." Jerry Bock and  Iwrote the music and lyrics respectively. It satirized the testimony of various  corrupt officials in the administration of New York Mayor James J. Walker, in  the early 1930s. One man was asked where he got the money to pay for certain  things he could not possibly have afforded on his salary. His answer: "The  money came from a little tin box my wife kept on the kitchen shelf."  </P> <P> Any resemblance to Oliver L. North's recent testimony -- he said he was able to  buy a $7,000 horse for his daughter and an $8,000 car for himself from pocket  change he had collected in a "little tin box" -- is purely coincidental, and  absolutely fascinating.  </P> <P> JUDGE:  </P> <P> Mister "X," may we ask you a question?  </P> <P> It's amazing, is it not,  </P> <P> that the city pays you slightly less  </P> <P> than 50 bucks a week,  </P> <P> yet you've purchased a private yacht?  </P> <P> WITNESS:  </P> <P> I am positive Your Honor must be joking.  </P> <P> Any working man can do what I have  </P> <P> done.  </P> <P> For a month or two I simply gave up  </P> <P> smoking  </P> <P> and I put my extra pennies one by one  </P> <P> into a  </P> <P> Little Tin Box,  </P> <P> a Little Tin Box  </P> <P> that a little tin key unlocks.  </P> <P> There is nothing unorthodox  </P> <P> about a Little Tin Box.  </P> <P> In a Little Tin Box,  </P> <P> a Little Tin Box  </P> <P> that a little tin key unlocks,  </P> <P> there is honor and purity,  </P> <P> lots of security,  </P> <P> in a Little Tin Box.  </P> <P> JUDGE:  </P> <P> Mister "Y," we've been told  </P> <P> you don't feel well,  </P> <P> and we know you've lost your  </P> <P> voice,  </P> <P> but we wonder how you managed,  </P> <P> on the salary you make,  </P> <P> to acquire a new Rolls Royce.  </P> <P> WITNESS:  </P> <P> You're implying I'm a crook and I  </P> <P> say no sir!  </P> <P> There is nothing in my past I care  </P> <P> to hide.  </P> <P> I've been taking empty bottles to  </P> <P> the grocer,  </P> <P> and each nickel that I got was put aside  </P> <P> into a  </P> <P> Little Tin Box,  </P> <P> a Little Tin Box  </P> <P> that a little tin key unlocks.  </P> <P> There is nothing unorthodox  </P> <P> about a Little Tin Box.  </P> <P> In a Little Tin Box,  </P> <P> a Little Tin Box  </P> <P> there's a cushion for life's rude shocks.  </P> <P> There is faith, hope and charity,  </P> <P> hard-won prosperity,  </P> <P> in a Little Tin Box.  </P> <P> JUDGE:  </P> <P> Mister "Z," you're a junior official,  </P> <P> and your income's rather low  </P> <P> yet, you've kept a dozen women  </P> <P> in the very best hotels.  </P> <P> Would you kindly explain, how so?  </P> <P> WITNESS:  </P> <P> I can see Your Honor doesn't pull his  </P> <P> punches  </P> <P> and it looks a trifle fishy, I'll admit,  </P> <P> but for one whole week I went without my  </P> <P> lunches  </P> <P> and it mounted up, Your Honor, bit by bit.  </P> <P> It's just a  </P> <P> Little Tin Box,  </P> <P> a Little Tin Box  </P> <P> that a little tin key unlocks.  </P> <P> There is nothing unorthodox  </P> <P> about a Little Tin Box.  </P> <P> In a Little Tin Box,  </P> <P> a Little Tin Box  </P> <P> all a-glitter with blue-chip stocks,  </P> <P> there is something delectable,  </P> <P> almost respectable,  </P> <P> in a Little Tin Box!  </P></p>

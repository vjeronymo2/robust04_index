			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Bletchley rights to raise Pounds 2m BLETCHLEY MOTOR Group is raising Pounds 2.1m in a share issue to fund two dealership sites for Japanese cars. The placing and open offer, on a 1-for-2 basis, is priced at 150p a share. The market price closed 2p down at 168p yesterday. Bletchley also announced that it was moving from the USM to the main market. The two sites to be developed are one for Nissan at Letchworth, Hertfordshire, costing Pounds 560,000, and one for Toyota at Luton, Bedfordshire, costing Pounds 850,000. So far the group has held franchises for Rover, Ford, Vauxhall and Leyland DAF. Mr David Dunn, chairman, whose stake is being diluted from 47 to 31 per cent by the share issue, said the total investment in the two sites would amount to Pounds 2.1m, taking up all the issue proceeds. The group chose not to borrow more money as its gearing was running at 157 per cent. However, the bulk of the Pounds 9m net debt was related to the expanding contract hire fleet. Without it, gearing would fall to 54 per cent. Last year Bletchley reversed the decline in pre-tax profit, making Pounds 753,000 on turnover of Pounds 60.2m.</p>

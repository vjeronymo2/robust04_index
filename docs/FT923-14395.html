			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Miskin plans its reorganisation Miskin Group, the USM-quoted contractor, property development and plant hire group, is to prepare for the future in an 'organised and practical manner', according to Mr Jeffrey Goodman, chairman. It will continue to improve sales, reduce debt by selling off properties, and divest itself of less profitable businesses. That will maximise profits and reduce overheads by reverting to the profitable core business - building and plumbing contracting and plant hire  -of the principal subsidiary, leaving options open in respect of the future direction to be taken. Mr Goodman warned that substantial provision may be needed in the accounts for the year to July in respect of any discontinued trading activities or disposals. In the half year ended January 31 the group produced turnover of Pounds 6.2m (Pounds 4.94m) and pre-tax losses of Pounds 414,000 (Pounds 630,000). However, an extraordinary credit of Pounds 2.92m, following the financial restructuring last October, left a retained profit of Pounds 2.51m (loss Pounds 630,000). Comparatives were for the middle term of an 18 months period to July 31 1991, when losses reached Pounds 7.36m after exceptional charges of Pounds 4.62m.</p>

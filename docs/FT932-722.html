			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Travel: Calvados and Breton pipes - Chris Eales feasts on Celtic music and masses of Muscadet in Brittany MYSTERIOUSLY, the pedal of my bike snapped right outside Jean-Michel Veilion's cottage. He is a neighbour in Pluzunet, a tiny, lively village on Brittany's Cote d'Armor and one hour's drive south-east of Roscoff. He is also one of the finest flute players in the whole of this Celtic corner of France. As we sipped powerful calvados made from local apples, Jean-Michel mentioned a musical happening. He called it a boeuf, a free feast of Celtic music offered casually by local musicians who sit and play right through the night in the bar. But which bar and when? It was confirmed later by Olivier, the boulanger, whom I met as I pushed my disabled bike through the village square. The boeuf would be in Pluzunet itself, that very Saturday night. Oliver did not know which bar but there are only two and the respective landladies agree not to open at the same time. I ended up, some time after 10pm, in L'Eclipse, chez Francoise. You could stumble on a boeuf in any number of bars on the Cote d'Armor, indeed throughout the far western regions of Brittany. Ever since the British Celts arrived in the 5th century, the French influence has been clawing and creeping westward. But here, at a safe distance from Paris, the maestros perform a friendly Celtic combination, stopping only occasionally to down a demi. Lively fiddle, violin, biniou (a Breton bagpipe), clarinet and Irish drum blend with sweet, soothing melodies of flute and acoustic guitar. Often, Irish singers accompany Bretons and together they bring emotive rural tales of times past to life. Oddly, L'Eclipse was quiet when I arrived. I was not in the wrong place: Francoise told me that the musicians had been due an hour-and-a-half earlier. None of the regulars appeared bothered. A couple of ruddy-faced farmers were happily knocking back glasses of red and the man who is always there was there. He wore his normal glazed expression unbroken by curling smoke from a yellow Gitane wedged between his lips. No boeuf? I asked. 'Ah, peut - etre,' they said. I decided to linger. Conversation turned to Pluzunet's last musical event, a super fest-noz in the Salles des Fetes where 600 people had danced the night away a week earlier. A fest-noz - night festival - is a mesmerising experience. More than entertainment, it is in the soul of village life in western and central Brittany. Local papers and posters tell of at least one fest-noz in their area every week at any time of the year. People dance all night in huge circles, linked only by their hands, arms or little fingers, stepping intricate movements in perfect rhythm to rousing music. Breton professors think that the plinn, a simple round dance, was probably a pagan sun ritual. The incredible foot movements developed from the way in which neighbours helped flatten wheat and stamp smooth the earth floors of primitive stone houses. Now, as then, singers, of all ages, sometimes children, even farmers in their 80s, chant unaccompanied in Breton, an ancient language, tales of love, witchcraft and of sons gone to sea. Young musicians add spice by mixing funky electric guitar and bass with traditional Celtic instruments. Flushed dancers can buy cider, coreff (the local brew), wine and crepes until the early hours. In the summer, the fest-noz moves outside to the splendid grounds of ancient chateaux, chapel courtyards and village squares. In the middle of August last year I drove 15 minutes north from Pluzunet to the rugged coast at Tregastel, to a sailing spectacle where Breton jazz and rock groups played on the quay side. It is an annual event. People camp on the beach. Most let their hair down and dance to the music or consume vast amounts of inexpensive Muscadet and moules marinieres. Enthusiastic sailors compete in a test of endurance. The biggest Celtic music event in Brittany, at Lorient, in Finistere, on the south-west coast, is worth visiting. Thousands descend on the city between August 6-15 to indulge in an orgy of music and a feast of charcuterie, saucisson, soupe de poisson, galettes, crepes and moules. I had been right to linger with a demi in L'Elipse. At midnight, the bar was beginning to fill up and I had spotted Iffic Troadic, a local musician, at the bar. Suddenly he began to chant in Breton. The bar fell silent as he recounted a sobering tale of a son from the neighbouring village of Cavan who returned to his dying mother after years at sea. Then a flautist appeared, a guitarist and a drummer. The boeuf had begun. A summer school of traditional Breton and Irish dancing at Mantallot, 15km from the northern coast of Brittany, will arrange accommodation and food as well as dancing lessons, walks, and story-telling evenings.

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Technology: A caress for the customer - Software at Work / British Airways is using a 'workflow' computer system to respond to complaints. Claire Gooding continues a series on getting the most out of software The airline once pilloried for misusing computers to filch customers has changed its ways with the help of a new system to handle complaints. 'Caress' is a good name for the new British Airways system. Every employee in customer relations who logs on to the computer, ready for a day of reading angry letters and creating mollifying replies, is reminded of the strong business philosophy of customer loyalty. There was a time when an apposite name for the complaints system might have been 'Tough]', but that was before the arrival of Charles Weiser, appointed as head of the customer relations department in 1992. Weiser introduced the idea of customer loyalty to the department. Up to then his career at BA had been spent in implementing ideas to woo and keep customers. Experience with BA's Executive Club, Air Miles and the Frequent Flyer programmes had given Weiser a grasp of what mattered to whom. 'BA's customers are quality conscious, vocal and demanding in their views - highly diverse, not necessarily UK-based, but with the common thread that they demand quality,' he says. When Weiser arrived at customer relations, staff were accustomed to a defensive approach to the job. Callers were told to put complaints in writing. Letters could take weeks to answer and replies were often delayed by exhaustive inquiries about what went wrong and whether or not the company was bound to compensate. The approach was summed up by Weiser as investigate, adjudicate, and then compensate. 'We used to spend more on lawyers' fees than we did on compensation to our Executive Club members,' says Weiser. 'There were 13 steps to any inquiry, and it took until step 10 to reply to the customer.' Ranks of filing cabinets stored letters by the class of complainant (corporate, personal), and then by case number. The filing system made it impossible to link cases and often resulted in a paper-chase around the office, with one person looking for a particular file, unaware that someone else might be handling another aspect of the investigation. Weiser's rule book is a lot thinner than BAs' two-inch tome on what circumstances merit compensation, and to what degree. A complaint, he believes, indicates a customer who cares enough to write or telephone, and offers BA an opportunity to impress. His aim is to put the problem right, to impress the complainant with the speed and quality of response and, most importantly, to retain that person's good opinion and future custom. It costs five times as much to find a new customer as it does to keep an existing one, is a rule hallowed by retail and services companies, and never far from Weiser's mind. 'Somebody will tell a story about a bad experience to 10 or so different people. They will tell a further nine about a good response: that's going a long way to create the right impression.' Weiser's starting point is to work out how much a customer is worth 'in lifetime value' to the company in future custom; incoming complaints are ranked accordingly. Continuity of case-handling was impossible with the old, defensive system. It was, in any case, time for a computer update. No existing system on the market at the time embodied the new philosophy to Weiser's satisfaction. He wanted a system that would make it possible to respond swiftly, personalised to the degree that the complainant was not only given a proper answer, but in such a way that he or she was made to feel 'listened to' and even special. The department went through a process recognised elsewhere as 'change management' or business process re-engineering. It took a year to change the fundamental attitude, according to Weiser. 'Now we ask, 'what can we do to keep this customer with us?' An apology, a refund, a bouquet of flowers? It might even be a full refund. What people want is an apology, quickly, not in two or three months, and an assurance that it won't happen again.' Any system that could deliver this speedy, sympathetic service had to deal with a vast mailbag: an average of 400 letters a day, accompanied by various pieces of 'evidence' such as cheques or items of cutlery. It needed links, not only between the various service teams in the department, but to other parts of BA. Each complaint has to be followed through with thorough investigation and communication with the various departments accused of a shortfall in service. Cutting down on re-keying, and providing these links was an essential part of the system that evolved. IBM suggested a long-term business partner, Space Computer Systems, to undertake a bespoke system for BA, running on an IBM AS400. It provides each workstation with a pair of screens, one displaying the letter, another for tracking the workflow, creating the reply, checking the 'audit trail' of who had done what about a particular complaint. 'Our approach,' explains Vince Southcott of Space Computer Systems, 'was to bring all the information to the workstation, automate the key elements.' The Caress system has access to other BA systems (booking, flight information) from which information can be 'cut and pasted' into letters. The daily input of letters and any accompaniments is scanned in, then categorised by the duty supervisor as one of 23 types of complaint and for urgency of reply. From that point, every process is tracked, with supervisors checking the progress and case-load. The staff work in teams, taking it in turns to answer the telephone calls that are now positively encouraged. There are weekly report meetings and formal channels of feedback between customer services and the other areas such as catering, baggage handling, and the various terminals. Customer relations are now on-site and are a respected voice among other operations. 'If we have a problem, we can now analyse it,' says Helen Mann, systems co-ordinator. She rates highly the 'feel-good factor' staff are now able to deliver immediately, especially by telephone. 'Before, we had to look in the book, but this system allows us to drill down into immense detail.' Responses are not ready-made form letters, although there are strict rules about the wording. Clare Todd, a team leader, is taking her turn at correspondence, with 350 letters on the stack. 'There's a lot less frustration, you can see what's going on, and we can spend a lot more time both with the complainants, and with the team,' she says. The 12-week backlog, and its paper-chase, have disappeared. As if on cue, two men appear with barrows to wheel away the last remaining filing cabinets. What is embodied in the system is not the rule book, but a common-sense approach of 'own the customer, own the problem, own the response'. But it is obvious that Weiser knows the rules in minute depth. Only three customers in 1,000 complain. Only one in five is compensated, but there is evidence - some of it on the noticeboard - that complainants deeply appreciate the personal touch that the system has cultivated. 'The satisfaction rate is enormous,' says Weiser, convinced that the system is swiftly paying for itself. 'More than 60 to 70 per cent will fly BA again.' BUZZWORDS WORKFLOW is a term used to describe computer systems that track the progress of a job or process from one person and activity to another. The structure of the business process is built into the software. Document image processing and electronic mail and 'groupware' (defining particular work and message groups within the processes) are often a part of a workflow system.</p>

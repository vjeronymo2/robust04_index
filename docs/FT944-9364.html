			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Building societies' body urges rights for borrowers About 7m people who have mortgages with building societies would be given new rights to vote on issues affecting societies if proposals put forward by the sector's trade association are accepted by the government. The Building Societies Association, responding to a consultation paper from the Treasury which marked the second stage in its review of societies' powers, said that borrowers should have voting rights like investing members. But it dismissed two key suggestions made by the Treasury for making societies more accountable. These were the setting up of consultative committees of members and requiring societies to reserve some board places for candidates nominated by 'ordinary members'. As mutual institutions, societies are owned by their customers who are members, rather than being responsible to shareholders. The debate on what wider powers societies should be given to enable them to compete more effectively in the retail financial services sector has focused attention on how far in practice members can hold societies to account and whether this form of ownership gives them an unfair advantage. The association says that societies should give members more information, in an accessible form, about their role as members rather than simply as customers. To encourage this the association plans to issue guidance to societies and a leaflet for general distribution. It says that putting members in a better position to exercise their membership rights would balance giving societies the wider and more flexible powers it strongly supports.</p>

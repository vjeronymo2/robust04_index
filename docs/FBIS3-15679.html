Regardless of the  holiday, city residents filled the Miners' Palace of Culture to  almost full capacity. The ex-speaker declined to  straightforwardly answer questions from the audience of whether  his recent trips to Belarusian cities mark the beginning of his  presidential campaign. However, he did say that democratic  forces in the Republic should nominate a single candidate for  the upcoming elections to secure a greater probability of  victory. Stanislav Shushkevich also spoke positively of the  unification of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems, as  well as of the economic achievements of the Baltic countries.  Despite discontent with the policy of the government and  Supreme Soviet, the former Supreme Soviet chairman spoke against  a political strike with plant and factory stoppages.</p>

			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> OLYMPICS TOO BIG, PRINCESS ANNE SAYS  </P> <P> The Olympics have become too big for their own good, according to Princess  Anne, one of Britain's two International Olympic Committee members.  </P> <P> The princess, president of the British Olympic Assn. and the International  Equestrian Federation, said trimming the size of the Games presented the most  difficult decisions facing the IOC and other international sports bodies.  </P> <P> "The biggest danger to the movement is that it is getting too big in sheer  weight of numbers," she said. "Other sports will become more popular in terms  of numbers and everyone will want to be involved in the Olympics.  </P> <P> "Some very hard decision-making will happen very shortly."  </P></p>

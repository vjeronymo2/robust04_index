In his words, the date was changed from February 18 because  Boris Yeltsin has not completely recovered from his recent  illness and because representatives of the country's regions  think the message should be read on the eve of the expanded  government meeting which is scheduled for February 25.    The Council agreed with Filatov's arguments and left the  debate of the Constitutional Court bill out of the Duma's  February 17 agenda because the president's headquarters had to  discuss numerous provisions of the bill with its authors, the  Court.    Filatov also informed the State Duma Council on the  proposal,  made by the president's headquarters, on the housing of the  lower house. Two or three months after the repair in the  Russian Management Academy building is complete the Duma can  move into it and next fall, into the former Gosplan's building  in Okhotny Ryad. A decision was made that this proposal should  be discussed first by parliamentary groups and then by a plenary  session of the State Duma.    The lower house speaker Ivan Rybkin told the Council that  President Yeltsin had decided to let former people's deputies of  the USSR and Russia stay in their Moscow flats provided to them  by the government.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Pro-Mobutu troops defy Tshisekedi TROOPS and paramilitary police surrounded Zaire's parliament building with tanks and armoured cars yesterday stepping up their defiance of reformist Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi, Reuter reports from Kinshasa. The soldiers and gendarmes, under the command of President Mobutu Sese Seko, were apparently sent to protect a rebel session of Zaire's national assembly, which was dissolved six weeks ago by a pro-democracy conference. Witnesses said troops also surrounded the Finance Ministry and continued to guard Zaire's central bank, after taking up positions at the weekend to support its sacked governor. Defiant members of the pro-Mobutu parliament had scheduled a meeting for yesterday afternoon to draw up a definitive new constitution - a task the conference is supposed to perform.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Sony warns of Y20bn loss SONY, the Japanese electronics group, surprised the markets yesterday when it warned it would lose Y20bn (Pounds 89.3m) in the final quarter of its financial year which ends next month. Sony Corporation, the parent company, also expects to report a full-year operating loss of Y20bn, its first loss since listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1958. News of the forecast loss prompted widespread gloom on the Tokyo exchange, where prices retreated to the lowest level since October 1990 amid fears of a collapse in consumer spending in Japan. The Nikkei index fell by 253.73 to 20,618.30, while Sony shares closed Y160 lower at Y4,000. Many economists have been counting on continued strong consumer spending to keep the Japanese economy from falling into recession. However, Sony said sales of audio visual equipment in Japan had fallen by 20 per cent in January compared with a year ago. Sony's poor results are also a broader reflection of troubles facing the consumer electronics industry, which is suffering from a lack of new blockbuster products. Traditional audio visual markets where Sony has been strong have been saturated with electronic equipment, such as video recorders and stereo equipment. The decline of Japanese consumer electronics sales along with the continued strength of the yen on foreign exchange markets forced Sony to pare its estimates for consolidated operating profits for the year to Y165bn, 45 per cent below the result for 1990-91. In response, Sony planned next year to cut capital spending by Y160bn to Y280bn. The forecasts were made as Sony announced its third quarter results, in which consolidated pre-tax profits fell by 36 per cent to Y67.1bn. An extraordinary gain of Y62bn from the sale of shares in Sony Music Entertainment boosted after-tax profits in the quarter, up 94 per cent to Y97.2bn. Sony tried to put on a brave face, pointing out that worldwide sales remained strong, up 10 per cent in the quarter to Y1,125.4bn. But it was apparent that Sony was operating its production lines at full capacity and having to sell products at extremely low margins. The brightest news in the results was the turnaround of Sony Pictures Entertainment, formerly Columbia Pictures, which Sony purchased in 1989 for Y3.4bn. The release of several highly successful films pushed film revenues up by 65.4 per cent to Y112.6bn in the quarter. Operating profits in the entertainment business were Y32.69bn, compared with Y47.03bn in Sony's traditional electronic equipment business.

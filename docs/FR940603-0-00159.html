(Sometimes the credit union requires deposits from the dealer to be held by the credit union to better assure good faith performance by the vendor.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The credit union placing full reliance on the dealer for credit checks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Financing indirect loans that are out of the credit union's normal trade area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) The dealer adds costs to the purchase price, such as insurance, warranties, and taxes, thus leaving the borrower with no equity in the car, and the lender with an undercollateralized loan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Dealers generate a large volume of loans in an attempt to overwhelm credit union staff in hopes that the weaker loans will be approved. (There are instances where dealers resubmit previously denied loans during peak periods in attempts to get them approved.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) The dealer inflates the purchase price or the trade in values, resulting in undercollateralized loans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11) An increased potential for making loans to persons who are not eligible to be credit union members exists because of dealer involvement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (12) By allowing the dealer to negotiate the contract, including interest rates, there is a possibility of inequity among members. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In many instances, the prospective credit union member was pressured to solicit his employer for inclusion into the credit union's field of membership. In certain of these instances, the employer group had existing credit union affiliation with another credit union. In certain other instances, the vendor indicated the prospective member was affiliated with a legitimate group in the credit union's field of membership, when, in fact, the person was not employed by the group. The vendor failed to properly complete required documentation for loans and lease agreements. In some cases the vendor indicated excessively high annual mileage limits in lease agreements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Recommended Investigative Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before entering into an agreement with a vendor acting as the credit union's agent in soliciting membership, a federally insured credit union should thoroughly investigate the impact of this action on its financial operations and condition; determine its legal liabilities; clearly define its moral responsibilities; and assure proper control of these activities. The following steps are recommended: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Thoroughly investigate the financial condition of all corporations, partnerships or other entities involved in the activities. Obtain and review financial statements and credit reports, such as Dun and Bradstreet, on each entity. Consider the need for appropriate bonding by each company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Review the organizational structure and reputation of each entity. Included in the review should be a certification that each entity is authorized to do business in the state where the credit union is authorized to do business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Review and approve the contracts or policies to be offered. Since members may hold the credit union morally responsible for problems which may occur, the officials should consider the impact of each contract or policy on its public relations with members. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Determine through a written legal opinion that all forms, documents and procedures used by the credit union to obtain membership, payroll deductions or to transfer funds to a vendor are legal and protect the credit union. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Ascertain the credit union's liability under the Holder in Due Course rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Determine the type of recourse agreement (full recourse, limited recourse or without recourse) that the credit union will enter into with the vendor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Develop cash flow and budget projections showing the effect of increased membership on the credit union's financial condition and ability to serve new members. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Track by individual vendor, loans, loan delinquency and loan losses for each financing derived from the indirect lending relationship. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Develop procedures to monitor the activities of vendors as discussed below under Agreements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Develop brochures and handouts to be presented to potential members. Among these should be a disclaimer that the credit union does not endorse the products or services and that the vendor can make no commitments regarding membership approval or the granting of loans. Other materials to be presented are discretionary by the credit union. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Obtain written confirmation from surety that such activities are bondable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Ensure the individual in charge of indirect lending is experienced with indirect financing or contacts another credit union with experience in this type of lending. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Start slow, utilizing only one or two reputable new car dealerships. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Agreements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All arrangements with a vendor should be in writing and reviewed by credit union legal counsel. Such agreements should include, but not be limited to, the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Scope of the vendor's authority to contact sponsors, such as limits on sponsor's assets, number of employees/potential members, financial condition, organizational structure, geographical location, and sponsor stability in the area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Procedures for the vendor to follow in contacting sponsors. These should require the vendor to present any product or service as separate and distinct from credit union membership and to state that inclusion in the field of membership is subject to regulatory approval. There should be absolute indication that the credit union is not endorsing any product or services marketed by the vendor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Procedures for vendors to follow once a sponsor is included in the credit union's field of membership. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Procedures for automobile dealers to follow when shopping sales contracts to lenders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Understanding and agreements on fees or points paid to automobile dealers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Agreement that products or services to be offered and materials, brochures and handouts to be presented by the vendor are to be approved, in advance, by the credit union. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

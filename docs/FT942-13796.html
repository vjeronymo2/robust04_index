			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (7): Bureaucracy is a barrier - Gulf Arab investment now comes mainly from the private sector The scale and structure of Gulf Arab investments in Egypt have changed dramatically in the last decade and a half, away from Gulf governments' aid and cash disbursements amounting to billions of dollars a year, towards selective private sector investments involving only hundreds of millions. Before Egypt broke ranks with the rest of the Arab world to sign the 1978 and 1979 peace agreements with Israel, Gulf governments propped up the Egyptian economy through their various aid agencies as well as through state investments. Little is heard these days, however, about heady projects such as, say, the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation (AOI). A Dollars 2bn investment established in 1975, jointly owned by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar, it was to have been the Arab world's workshop for military hardware. At its height this single investment employed 17,000 people. But AOI, and all other aid and investments from Gulf governments, was abruptly halted after Egypt broke ranks. AOI still functions well under sole Egyptian ownership. It produces tanks and aircraft for Egypt's own use, as well as civil products such as optics, agricultural machinery and steel for sewerage systems. But apart from some cash pay-outs during and after the Gulf crisis of 1990-1991, Gulf governments have all but stopped investments on their former scale. For one thing, they no longer have the money they had in the late 1970s. On the other hand, private investors from Gulf countries do have the money. But their investments are based not on political but on purely financial considerations, and the amounts involved are much less. In aggregate, they do not amount to more than 70 per cent of Gulf governments' single investment in AOI. According to the Cairo branch of Jordan's Arab Bank, the total value of non-Egyptian Arab investment projects approved at the end of last June amounted to Dollars 1.42bn, of which Gulf Arab investors from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE made up Dollars 916m, some 65 per cent of the total. Saudi Arabia alone accounted for 41 per cent of outside Arab investments. But despite the relative scarcity of Gulf Arab investments  - and they probably do not include direct purchases of some real estate, such as second homes - the total is still marginally greater than private investments from the west. Gulf Arab investments are heavily concentrated in financial institutions - more than 60 per cent - with about 20 per cent of the total in industry and some 12 per cent in services such as hotels and tourism companies. One of the most significant Gulf companies is Gulf Arab Investment Company, Cairo-based, an Egyptian free-zone joint stock company with a paid-in capital and reserves (last June) of Dollars 46.5m and total assets of Dollars 51.3m. Owned by private investors from Bahrain and Saudi Arabia as well as from Egypt, GAIC operates on classical merchant banking lines - buying into companies, improving and selling them. The Saudis are becoming more deeply involved than other Gulf investors. Their interests in Egyptian industry range from cement to aluminium to edible oil plants. The Saudi Bugshan brothers have a 20 per cent interest with Pepsi-Cola - and with a local firm - in a joint venture which paid about Dollars 52m earlier this year for Egyptian Bottling (which bottles Pepsi). The precise extent of Gulf Arab direct investments in property - either personal homes or hotels - is almost impossible to quantify. Several hotels in Cairo and Heliopolis, including the Gezira Sheraton, the Meridien and the Al-Salaam Swiss hotel, are partly or wholly owned by Gulf nationals or institutions. Although this is a bad time for the tourist trade because of violent activity by Islamic activists - the typical volume of western tourism, according to one local banker, is down by as much as 80 per cent - the financial loss may only be as low as 50 per cent, because one Saudi or Gulf Arab family is reckoned to spend 15 times as much as a western package tourist. But Gulf-owned investments on the Red Sea and in Sinai, which rely almost entirely on western package tours, have been badly affected. There are formidable barriers to the growth of private sector Gulf Arab investments, common to all outside investors and to wealthy Egyptians whose money is abroad. The first is the bureaucratic barrier. 'There are 26,000 laws in Egypt,' says one Egyptian banker, who acknowledges that daily frustration gets the better of her patriotic ideals. 'Each new law is added to, rather than superseding, an old one. For any investor, there is always the risk of a bureaucrat plucking an old unused law off the shelf, blowing away the dust, and applying it today.' A second deterrent is the twin elements of government ineptitude and lack of commitment. One Egyptian banker in Cairo says: 'It is true that exchange controls have been eased, and in theory you can repatriate profits. But any foreign investor needs to be very careful. Get a good lawyer. The laws and their application are contradictory.' A third factor, perhaps more a potential deterrent than an actual one, is the economic recovery in Lebanon which causes Gulf Arabs to think twice before they make an investment in Egypt. A fourth reason is the amount of money which the Egyptian private sector itself is reputed to keep outside the country. Guesses as to how much vary to a startling degree. One western diplomat puts it at 'not less than Dollars 4bn, and it could be as high as Dollars 16bn.' Egyptian estimates vary between Dollars 20bn and 'not less than Dollars 100bn.' It is hardly surprising that many Gulf investors will not put their money where Egyptians themselves fear to tread.</p>

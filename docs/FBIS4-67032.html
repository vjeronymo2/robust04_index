			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Attention: The Constitutional Court declared  tonight that so-called personal drug doses are not illegal in  Colombia. For example, arrests such as that of Carlos Sosa, who  was taken into custody by police for possession of a marijuana  joint, will no longer occur. From now on, individuals may  legally possess the following amounts for personal consumption:  20 grams of marijuana, 1 gram of cocaine, 5 grams of hashish,  and 4 grams of methaqualone (metacualona).</p>

It will cover real  estate and land, information and telecommunications,  distribution, licensing and inspection standards and financial  services.    -- A comprehensive five-year deregulation program will be  completed in fiscal 1994.    -- The government will seek quick approval of a bill now in  the Diet to set up an independent body to monitor deregulation  and make recommendations, which the prime minister shall respect.  <H5>  Competition </H5>   -- Investigative staff at the Fair Trade Commission will be  increased by 9 percent with further increases in the future.    -- Foreign opinions will be sought, and their adoption  intended for the summer, on bid-tender guidelines to prevent  "dango" bid-rigging.    -- Guidelines on trade association activities and  regulations  on premiums will be reviewed.  <H5>  Import and Investment Promotion </H5>   -- The government will implement fiscal 1994 measures  enhancing the tax system and public financing to promote imports  and will expand foreign access zones, import cargo facilities  and customs systems and the business support center.    -- Tax incentives for direct investment and loan programs by  the Japan Development Bank will be expanded, and the Office of  the Trade and Investment Ombudsman and the Trade Council will be  actively used.  <H5>  Government Procurement </H5>   -- The government will increase openness, fairness and  competition before procurement procedures begin, to help  competitive domestic and foreign suppliers enter and to change  the mind-set of those involved with the procedures.    -- Operational guidelines will be adopted going beyond those  specified by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  Information will be made available before tender and comments  will be requested.  <H5>  Voluntary Steps in Japan-U.S. "Priority Areas" </H5>   -- Procedures will be improved in government procurement of  telecommunications and medical technology to facilitate the  entry of competitive foreign products and significantly increase  their sales, including nondiscriminatory access to information.    -- Insurance deregulation will proceed, clarifying and  making  more flexible approval procedures for product development and  premiums. A broker system will be introduced. Licensing and  approval standards will be clarified.    -- The government will facilitate, within its scope and  responsibility, increased imports of autos and auto parts and  purchases of local parts by Japanese plants overseas.

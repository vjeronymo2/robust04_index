			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OUR READERS WROTE LETTERS THROUGHOUT 1990 EXPRESSING THEIR VIEWPOINTS ON A  VARIETY OF ISSUES. HERE ARE CONDENSED VERSIONS OF SOME OF THOSE LETTERS TO HELP  US REMEMBER THE EVENTS THAT MATTERED TO ORANGE COUNTY READERS THIS PAST YEAR.  WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE READERS WHO TOOK THE TIME TO SHARE THEIR VIEWPOINTS  AND LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THEM AND OTHERS IN 1991.  </P> <P> HEA We Could Use a 'Mr. Smith' NowIn the 1939 movie "Mr. Smith Goes to  Washington," a young Jimmy Stewart faces congressional corruption and wins the  day with an avalanche of mail from ordinary citizens fed up with the status quo  of greed and back-room politics.  </P> <P> As I read in The Times, a Rev. Louis Sheldon now goes to Washington, both on an  entirely different pilgrimage with a distinctly odious agenda.  </P> <P> Whereas "Mr. Smith" fought for the rights of all Americans to fair and decent  government, Sheldon brings hostility, polarization and downright hatred to the  capital in his zealous crusade against homosexuals.  </P> <P> As a heterosexual married father of three wonderfully mature children, I find  Sheldon and his Traditional Values coalition offensive and certainly  nonrepresentative of my values.  </P> <P> My values include tolerance, understanding and compassion. Unlike Sheldon's,  they do not include bigotry, bias and self-aggrandizement. Washington deserves  any Mr. Smith and would be wise to shun the hatemongering Sheldons of this  world. Jimmy Stewart, where are you when so needed by the reasonable?  </P> <P> D.I. COULSON, Orange  </P></p>

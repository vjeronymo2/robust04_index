			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRW TO SHUT DOWN TEST SYSTEMS CENTER  </P> <P> TRW Inc. has announced that it is shutting down its Electronic Test Systems  Skills Center in Redondo Beach, a 160-person unit involved in testing  spacecraft instruments.  </P> <P> The company said 30 to 60 employees would be transferred to San Diego County as  part of an adjustment to "this era of defense spending restraints."  </P> <P> "TRW will make every effort to place the remaining employees in other jobs in  TRW operations in Redondo Beach or elsewhere," said spokeswoman Montye Male.  "We expect that other assignments will absorb a significant portion of them. It  is unnecessary for us to move all the people down there, because we have  people" in San Diego.  </P> <P> Male said the operations of the Redondo Beach unit will be merged with TRW's  Military Electronics and Avionics Division, which employs 800 people in Rancho  Carmel in San Diego County.  </P> <P> Both units are part of TRW's Space and Defense Sector, which has 18,000  employees in the South Bay.  </P> <P> The consolidation of similar units will save TRW money because the company  expects that "concentrations of skills in one area will decrease our costs,"  Male said.  </P></p>

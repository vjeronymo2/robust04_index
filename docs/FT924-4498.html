			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht debate dominated by treaty's critics MPS SETTLED into the marathon debate over the detailed provisions of the Maastricht treaty legislation in the Commons last night at a pace that will please the Euro-sceptics and confirm the worst fears of those seeking an early agreement. Insisting on painstaking attention to procedure and detail, the treaty's opponents dominated the floor from the outset, taking the first hour and 32 minutes entirely on points of order. But MPs were assured a relatively early finish on this first day of the committee stage, when the government chose not to force a trial of strength by moving that the debate continue beyond 10pm. When proceedings wound up on the stroke of ten, Mr Bill Cash, the arch Tory Euro-sceptic was still speaking, having risen nearly two-and-a-half hours earlier. A Conservative whip provoked mass hilarity by formally reporting 'the committee has made progress.' Of the 45 initial interventions, barely half a dozen were from supporters of the bill. Several prominent anti-Maastricht MPs - including Mr Bill Cash, Mr Tony Marlow, and Sir Teddy Taylor spoke three times. Mr Nicholas Budgen, a key critic of the treaty, topped the scoring with five interventions. Both Labour and Tory MPs repeatedly sought clarification from the chair as to how they could ensure that the Commons was given the right to debate whether a referendum might be held on the treaty. Arguing for a referendum amendment to be taken, Sir Teddy Taylor said: 'I fear that this bill has been drafted in such a way as to prevent members of the House of Commons in expressing a view.' Government claims to have isolated Britain from any federalist developments in the European Community were disputed by both supporters and opponents of the treaty. Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign office minister in charge of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill which seeks to embody some provisions of the treaty in UK domestic law, was caught in a withering crossfire from the government and opposition benches. Sir Russell Johnston, spokesman for the Liberal Democrats and an enthusiastic advocate of a federalist Europe, urged the government to drop its attempt to disguise the federal implications of the treaty. He moved an amendment seeking to include in the bill a provision of the treaty which the government had deliberately excluded. Mr Bernard Jenkin (C Colchester North) asked: 'Are you suggesting that the government is seeking to sell the treaty on a somewhat false prospectus?'. After a momentary hesitation Sir Russell replied: 'I can pretty nearly say yes.' He repudiated ministerial assertions that the inclusion of the so-called subsidiarity principle had strengthened the position of national governments and parliaments. Sir Russell insisted that the majority of Britain's community partners took a 'significantly' different view of subsidiarity believing it to be an instrument for use in a federalist structure. Euro-sceptics on the Tory backbenches agreed with Mr Tony Benn (Lab Chesterfield), a consistent opponent of Britain's membership of the EC, that by omitting some provisions of the treaty from the bill the government was hoping to prevent the British people knowing the 'enormity' of what was involved. Mr Garel-Jones maintained that the purpose of the bill was to bring into British law those elements of the Maastricht treaty not involving amendment of the Treaty of Rome under which the EC was established. He appealed to Sir Russell to withdraw his amendment.</p>

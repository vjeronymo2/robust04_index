			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRETZEL MAKER ROLLING IN DOUGH;  </P> <P> OAT BRAN FAD HELPS OLDEST BAKERY IN U.S. TO ITS BEST YEAR.  </P> <P> This picturesque and historic Lancaster County town, dotted with  pre-Revolutionary War homes, stores, churches and inns, is the birthplace of  America's pretzel industry.  </P> <P> The original pretzel factory -- still operating despite more than two centuries  of wear and tear -- costs $1 to visit. For the dollar, you get a pretzel, which  is your admission ticket; once in, you eat the ticket.  </P> <P> Julius Sturgis established the nation's first pretzel bakery in 1861,  converting the family's old general bakery, and it has remained in the family  since. The Sturgis Pretzel House is a quaint stone building -- built in 1774 as  a home with a connecting bakery -- now used as the company's headquarters and  bakery.  </P> <P> "For the first 87 years," said Clyde Tshudy, 51, who bought the company in  1972, "the huge brick ovens were used to bake bread. Then in 1861, Julius  Sturgis, a cousin -- we have a common grandfather going way back -- began the  first pretzel bakery in this country. He used the brick ovens built by my  great-great-great-grandfather."  </P> <P> He added that he is still using the gas-fired, 215-year-old brick and clay  ovens to bake soft pretzels.  </P> <P> The company makes a variety of pretzels, soft and hard, salted and unsalted  (called baldies), pretzels shaped like the horse and buggy rigs used by  Lancaster County's Amish people, tiny pretzels the size of a quarter,  giant-size pretzels, cheese pretzels, oat bran and whole-wheat pretzels,  left-handed pretzels (with the twist running in the opposite direction) and  many others.  </P> <P> "People have been going nuts lately for oat bran pretzels," Tshudy said. "We  can't make enough of them. Oat bran pretzels are a health kick fad."  </P> <P> Tshudy; his wife, Barbara; son, Michael; daughter-in-law, Holly, and a dozen  others work part time and full time at the pretzel factory, which produces  10,000 pounds of the snacks a day.  </P> <P> Last year's sales totaled $650,000, the biggest in the company's 128-year  history, Tshudy said, with mail orders and retail sales at the factory  representing 10% of the production. The rest was wholesaled to stores and other  outlets as far away as Miami.  </P> <P> The U.S. pretzel industry recorded an all-time high in sales last year -- $430  million -- according to Jane Wuerthner, spokeswoman for the Snack Food Assn.,  headquartered in Alexandria, Va. And that does not count sales by mom-and-pop  pretzel makers around the country.  </P> <P> The pretzel's traditional twisted design -- with its three holes in the middle  -- has been traced to a monastery in southern France in AD 1610 and is said to  represent arms folded in prayer.  </P> <P> Until the early 1950s, the twists and turns of Sturgis pretzels were all made  by hand. The company then employed 30 twisters and eight bakers, turning out  3,000 pounds of pretzels a day.  </P> <P> "Lewis Sturgis, one of Julius Sturgis' eight sons, had been running the company  for years," Clyde Tshudy recalled. "He was reluctant about converting to  pretzel-making machines and didn't think anyone would eat a pretzel made by a  machine. But he finally came around." And just recently the company installed a  new $400,000 machine to shape and bake its hard pretzels.  </P> <P> The old craft lives on, however. Each visitor to the plant -- about 50,000 each  year -- is shown how to twist pretzels by hand.  </P></p>

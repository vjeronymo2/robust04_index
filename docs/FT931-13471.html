			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Transport officials defend BR privatisation plan THE DEPARTMENT of Transport yesterday rejected accusations that the bill paving the way for the privatisation of British Rail, published yesterday, was a 'bureaucratic nightmare', pointing out that the document's 158 pages left it looking relatively flimsy next to the 419-page tome on selling the water industry which appeared in 1989. Even so, there is little doubting the complexity of the government's proposals. The chosen method of privatisation introduces three new quangos - a track-owning authority; a rail regulator to act as a watchdog; and a franchise director to franchise out the passenger services - and provides for a network of relationships between these and the private-sector train operators entering the rail market. As envisaged in the white paper published last July, the effect of the Railways Bill will be to split British Rail into two. Railtrack will own the tracks, and the other part will run the trains. The freight operations will be sold and the passenger services will be franchised. In addition, tracks will in principle be open to any private-sector operators wanting to run new freight or passenger train services in competition with existing ones. However, the government has shown signs of retreating from this in the face of hostility from would-be franchisees. The bill says subsidies will go on being paid to support lossmaking train services even after privatisation, so there will be no significant cuts in public spending in the short term. But it goes on to say: 'It is, however, anticipated that private-sector operation should, over time, allow railway services to be provided at lower cost to the Exchequer than would otherwise be the case'. The implication is that the private sector will be rather more efficient at operating trains than British Rail. The bill itself provides for the setting up of the regulator, the franchising director and the rail users' consultative committees - the new rail passengers' watchdogs - before going into the detail of how rail operators will be regulated. Companies wanting to run a train, station or maintenance depot will have to apply for a licence it says, and anyone wanting to object to the application will be able to do so. Every agreement between train operators and facility owners will have to be notified to the regulator for approval, with any subsequent changes. The regulator will be able to force companies to open their facilities to other train operators if they do not do so willingly. Some new information also emerges. For example: One clause provides for franchisees to take control of the tracks in the franchise area as well as the trains if the franchising authority thinks it appropriate. The rail regulator and the franchising director will have the power to fine operators who breach the conditions of their licences or of their franchises. All UK public-sector bodies - including British Rail, London Underground or local authorities - will be excluded from becoming franchisees, but there is no mention in the bill of public-sector bodies from other countries. The bill is expected to get its second reading early next month and to win Royal assent in October. Railways Bill. HMSO. Pounds 14.65. In for a bumpy ride, Page 6</p>

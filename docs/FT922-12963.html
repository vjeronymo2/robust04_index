			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / N Korea delirious for Great Leader: The 80th birthday of Kim Il Sung, cult dictator in a country weak with hunger AMONG gifts to mark his 80th birthday today, North Korean dictator, Kim Il Sung, the world's longest-reigning head of state, has landed yet another title to an impressive collection. The Great Leader, Beloved Leader and Ever Victorious Captain of the Korean People, is now also Generalissimo. His birthday presents include a quilt and sleeping mat stuffed with down from the necks of 700,000 sparrows slaughtered for the occasion, 400 tonnes of pork from China and a birthday visit from Chinese President Yang Shangkun, aged 84. China is North Korea's closest ally, one of the few remaining after the collapse of communism in Europe. The Chinese president had a rapturous, flower-strewn reception from waving crowds tens of thousands strong when he arrived in Pyongyang on Monday, the Xinhua news agency reported. (Foreign correspondents have largely been barred.) The drilled crowds lining the streets rhythmically chanting welcome slogans, and the dancing in Kim Il Sung Square, were shown prominently on Chinese television news, a reminder of how things used to be done in Beijing before Chinese communist mythmaking about the workers' paradise gave way to greater realism. Diplomats say the excesses of its increasingly anachronistic ally are something of an embarrassment to China which is endeavouring to encourage Kim to greater moderation, an end to isolationism and a strategy of economic reform. The Respected and Beloved Comrade, the Greatest Genius Humankind Has Ever Had, the Legendary Hero and Outstanding Leader of the Revolution, some of the epithets routinely applied to Kim by North Korea's media, has ruled the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with a rod of iron for nearly 44 years, coming to power in 1948 at the age of 36. Kim's elaborate personality cult, easily a match for the cult of Mao Zedong at its height, has littered the country with 35,000 Kim statues. Every house, office, school, shop and labour camp displays Kim portraits. His collected thoughts run to 37 volumes, republished in large editions to mark the birthday celebrations. Kim, a mild-faced, stocky, bespectacled figure with an unsightly goitre on his neck - he refuses to submit to the surgeon's knife  - is always portrayed a head taller than those who stand adoringly around him. Greater love hath no man than Kim. He 'embraces in his bosom . . . even those people who committed wrongdoings'. His 'revolutionary comradely love' is the 'pinnacle of human love'. American officials have warned that what they see as an unpredictable regime, megalomaniac, isolated and confronting economic collapse, is pushing to develop a nuclear weapons capability (though the country's parliament last week ratified an agreement signed in January with the International Atomic Energy Agency to open its nuclear facilities to inspection). A future government under Kim's anointed successor, his son Kim Jong-Il, may be equally unpredictable. The corpulent 50-year-old Dear Leader, described in foreign diplomatic circles as 'plump, pampered and psychotic', is becoming the subject of almost as much adulation as his father. He is even on occasion called Great Leader, a title once reserved exclusively for the elder Kim. Nepotism is not uncommon in communist regimes but this is the first time any communist leader has tried to devolve power directly to a member of his own family - it would create the world's first communist monarchy. For the 23m who live there, the reality of North Korea is a long way from the paradise of the relentless propaganda. The regime's response to food shortages is to warn of the harmful effects of over-eating. Pyongyang television recently reported, as a lesson to others, the case of a man who died when his stomach burst because he ate too much rice.</p>

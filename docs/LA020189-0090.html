			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOMECLUB ENLISTS NEW AD AGENCY;  </P> <P> DAVIS, BALL &amp; COLOMBATTO THE VICTOR IN STIFF COMPETITION  </P> <P> One of the most sought-after pieces of business in the Los Angeles advertising  market -- the $15-million HomeClub account -- has been won by a Los Angeles ad  agency, the companies said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Davis, Ball &amp; Colombatto, the firm that created the popular "Mac Tonight"  ad campaign for McDonald's, emerged the winner after a harrowing review that at  one time included more than 50 Los Angeles ad agencies vying for the business.  </P> <P> By early spring, TV viewers will no longer hear HomeClub's familiar ad slogan,  "Save on everything every day," said Sean Lee, president and chief executive of  the Fullerton-based HomeClub. Instead, the nation's second-largest home  improvement chain said it now plans to do battle with No. 1 Home Depot by  talking less about low prices and more about variety.  </P> <P> "We think that campaign was too one dimensional," Lee said. "There's more to  life than prices."  </P> <P> But Lee reluctantly conceded that HomeClub's current hard-hitting ad campaign  that compares its low prices to that of rival Home Depot has been extremely  successful. Indeed, that campaign was so successful that Home Depot recently  reacted by luring away the Los Angeles agency that created it, Admarketing.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, HomeClub's new agency also said that ads about low prices are  becoming old hat. "Advertising low prices is not unique to this category," said  Brad Ball, president of Davis, Ball &amp; Colombatto, which now plans to hire  six employees to handle the new business. "We're going to break out of the pack  and attack."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Can Scare Customers  </P> <P> Analysts who follow the big home improvement chain agree that ads bragging  about lower prices are beginning to sound like broken records. "These stores  have all identified themselves as having low prices," said Bo Cheadle, general  partner at the San Francisco-based investment firm Montgomery Securities.  "People need to hear some reason other than price to go there."  </P> <P> After all, the massive size of the stores -- and the large crowds that shop  there -- can often scare many potential customers away. "The guy who just wants  a hammer and nails to fix a broken fence sure isn't going to walk in to one of  these," Cheadle said.  </P> <P> Now, to help coax that customer into HomeClub, Lee said, his company is eyeing  an ad campaign that will instead focus on the convenience of getting everything  at one store -- and the wide assortment of goods.  </P> <P> But the real catalyst behind HomeClub's move was some recent actions by its  chief rival, Home Depot, and HomeClub's former Los Angeles advertising agency,  Admarketing.  </P> <P> Two months ago, Admarketing quit the $15-million HomeClub ad business to take  on the $25-million account of Home Depot, the Atlanta chain that is the  undisputed industry leader. The move not only forced HomeClub to seek out a new  ad firm, but also to rethink its marketing strategy. At the same time, HomeClub  filed suit to try to block Admarketing from creating ads for Home Depot for one  year. That suit has yet to be resolved.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Boom in Southland  </P> <P> Meanwhile, business continues to boom for retailers that service the nation's  estimated $90-billion home improvement sector. And giants such as Home Depot  and HomeClub are all vying for a bigger piece of it. After all, the major  chains still account for less than 15% of all home improvement sales -- most of  which are handled by hardware stores and small suppliers at strip centers.  </P> <P> The home improvement business is growing especially fast in Southern  California, where the escalating real estate market has persuaded many  homeowners to fix up their own homes instead of moving. Indeed, industry  experts say that Southern California homeowners spent an estimated $10 billion  on home improvements last year.  </P> <P> With 17 stores in Southern California and five more planned here over the next  year, HomeClub says it plans to bolster its local advertising. And while its  new ad agency certainly doesn't want to lay a brick with its first ad campaign  -- it might have to.  </P> <P> After all, bricks are HomeClub's best-selling item -- with sales of some 13  million bricks annually. "Don't be surprised," joked ad man Ball, "if that  doesn't end up in the theme line."  </P></p>

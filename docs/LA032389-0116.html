			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> N. Y. GOVERNING BOARD ILLEGAL, JUSTICES RULE  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the structure of the Board of  Estimate, New York City's unique central governing body, is unconstitutional.  </P> <P> In deciding that the board's voting procedures violate the "one person one  vote" provisions of the equal protection clause of the Constitution, the court  set the stage for a major governmental overhaul in the nation's largest city.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Major Challenge'  </P> <P> "It is clear we will have to make major changes," said Peter L. Zimroth, New  York's corporation counsel. ". . . It will be a major governmental challenge."  </P> <P> For the time being, it is expected the 88-year-old Board of Estimate will  operate as usual while a Charter Revision Commission proposes alternatives  either to be added to the ballot in this year's hotly contested mayoral  election or in a special election.  </P> <P> The eight-member Board of Estimate has far more influence than the 35-member  City Council. The board is made up of the mayor, the city comptroller and City  Council president, who have two votes, and all five borough presidents, who  have one vote each.  </P> <P> Among its key duties, the board approves contracts, determines the use of land,  grants franchises and takes part in a limited way in the budget-making process.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Touch Residents' Lives  </P> <P> Its powers widely touch the lives of New York's 7 million residents in such  matters as deciding whether to lease a city building as a homeless shelter,  establishing a drug counseling center in a neighborhood or voting whether a  block in Manhattan is suitable for a high rise apartment house.  </P> <P> The case was brought by a group of voters in Brooklyn, the borough with the  largest population in New York, who challenged the doctrine that other boroughs  with smaller populations should have equal representation on the board.  </P> <P> "The highest court in the land has spoken," said Brooklyn Borough President  Howard Golden. "Now, we all must work together to develop a system of weighted  voting for the Board of Estimate which better protects the rights of all our  people."  </P> <P> "The charter commission now has to move full speed ahead," said Mayor Edward I.  Koch after being informed of the court's decision.  </P> <P> Municipal lawyers said they believe federal courts will allow the Board of  Estimate to continue to operate as usual until a new structure is approved by  the voters.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Salim Salih Muhammad, Yemeni Socialist Party  [YSP] Presidential Council member, talked by phone from his  place of residence in London with brother Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy  of Butrus Butrus-Ghali, UN secretary general, who is currently  in Jeddah continuing his efforts to stop the fighting, prevent  Yemeni bloodshed, and implement the Security Council's  resolution.    During the contact, brother Salim Salih Muhammad explained  the recent developments, Sanaa's refusal to abide by the  cease-fire, and the imposition of a state of siege on Aden by  threatening to cut the water supplies, hit the economic and  civilian utilities and shell the popular quarters without  discrimination, a matter which led to the killing of hundreds of  women, children, and old men. He affirmed to him the importance  of speeding up the implementation of the Security Council's  resolution and sending international observers to supervise the  ceasefire and start the talks, or take deterrent measures  against the side which rejected these international resolutions.    Lakhdar Brahimi affirmed the importance of stopping the  fighting and implementing the Security Council's resolutions  immediately, and that he was about to meet 'Ali Salim al-Bid and  the other leaders in order to enable him to submit his report to  Butrus- Ghali, UN secretary general, who would in turn present  it to the UN Security Council to take additional resolutions  which would lead to the imposition of the state of stability and  peace in Yemen and the rest of the region.</p>

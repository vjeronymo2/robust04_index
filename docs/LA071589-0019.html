			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH'S SENTENCE IN IRAN-CONTRA FIASCO  </P> <P> As a simple Iranian who emigrated to this country and became an American  citizen, I find President Bush confused, Judge Gesell confused, and I myself  confused along with many others on the Iran-Contra affair.  </P> <P> The President seems confused as he damns the protective wrapping of Gregory  Johnson in the Constitution for desecrating the flag, while he pronounces North  a hero for wrapping himself in the flag and desecrating the Constitution.  </P> <P> By intending to "avoid hardening the lieutenant colonel's conviction by not  sending him to jail," Gesell has unknowingly opened the doors for potential  thieves, crooks and liars in positions of power in the government to commit  similar acts confident of judicial leniency. Gesell is seemingly confused as he  neglected the importance of deterrence.  </P> <P> This former Marine, on behalf of a small group, proudly sold armaments at an  inflated price to a group of lunatics in Iran for killing innocent people. He  took the profit and gave it to another group of warriors in another part of  world for killing purposes again. Hardly a single word was said about this  central moral issue in a country where human rights, human dignity and human  lives are highly revered. Shouldn't I be confused?  </P> <P> I always considered a hero an individual who has great strength, courage,  nobility and extraordinary positive achievements: an ideal or model. Those who  bestow heroism for lying, cheating or committing immoral acts are either  confused or are redefining the word.  </P> <P> FARHAD MOATAMED  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

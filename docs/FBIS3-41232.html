He declared: "This was done to continue the policy of  appointing professionals and experts in the battle against the  drug traffic to key posts in the Federal Judicial Police."    The changes are occurring three days after Jorge Carpizo  McGregor, the former attorney general, left his position to  occupy the Government Secretariat, in one of the shifts made by  President Carlos Salinas following the incidents in Chiapas.    The appointments made by Norona involve Serafin Cocone  Paredes, as new commander of the Chihuahua region; Carlos Llanas  Cuevas, assigned to the Hidalgo area of Parral; Jose Refugio  Rosas Brito, commander in Delicias; Jose Antonio Avila Garcia,  in Nuevo Casas Grandes; and Ernes Espinoza Cabera, in charge of  the Ojinaga headquarters.

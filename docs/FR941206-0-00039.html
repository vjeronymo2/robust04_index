The PBGC may refer a past-due, legally enforceable debt to the IRS for offset if: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The debt is a judgment debt, or the PBGC's right of action accrued not more than 10 years earlier (unless the debt is specifically exempt from this requirement); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The PBGC cannot currently collect the debt by salary offset (pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1)); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The debt is ineligible for administrative offset (by reason of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2)), or the PBGC cannot currently collect the debt by administrative offset (under 31 U.S.C. 3716 and subpart B of this part) against amounts payable by the debtor to the PBGC; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The PBGC has notified, or attempted to notify, the debtor of its intent to refer the debt, given the debtor an opportunity to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable, considered any evidence presented by the debtor in accordance with &sect;2609.33 of this part, and determined that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) If the debt is a consumer debt and exceeds $100, the PBGC has disclosed the debt to a consumer reporting agency (as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3711(f) and provided in &sect;2609.33 of this part), unless a consumer reporting agency would be prohibited from reporting information concerning the debt (by reason of 15 U.S.C. 1681c); and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) The debt is at least $25. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;2609.33 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Tax refund offset procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Before referring a debt for tax refund offset, the PBGC will complete the procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section and, if applicable, paragraph (c) of this section.

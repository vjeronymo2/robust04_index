			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: THE SAD NEWS IS NO NEWS  </P> <P> So, baseball players have been locked out of spring training, have they?  </P> <P> Good.  </P> <P> Spring training? We don't need no stinking spring training.  </P> <P> Spring training is bad for you. This has been proven beyond dispute, season  after season.  </P> <P> The single good thing about spring training is that it gives people from  Florida and Arizona something to do besides shake the sand out of their shoes.  </P> <P> Nothing good ever happens in spring training. The new commissioner of baseball  should do away with spring training. There ought to be a law against spring  training.  </P> <P> We already have 162 games for each team and as many as 14 postseason games.  That's enough.  </P> <P> Spring training is such a drag, Tom Lasorda's diet gets news coverage.  </P> <P> Maybe this year his players will bet Lasorda he can't eat 50 hard-boiled eggs  in an hour.  </P> <P> Spring training is the place where New York Mets who aren't in rehab centers  get into fistfights.  </P> <P> Spring training is the place where Pedro Guerrero slides into third base the  way the American Trader slid into Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Spring training is the place where Guerrero repeatedly shows up late with visa  problems, leading Mickey Hatcher to consider telling the Dodgers he's arriving  late because of MasterCard problems.  </P> <P> Spring training is the place where Marge Schott and Kal Daniels flip a coin to  decide whether he gets a $25,000 raise.  </P> <P> Spring training is the place where Kirk Gibson makes a federal case out of  Jesse Orosco playing a practical joke, and people rave about the incredible new  leadership Gibson has brought to the Dodgers.  </P> <P> Spring training is the place where the Milwaukee Brewers' boiler blows up.  </P> <P> Spring training is the place where Mark Fidrych steps into a gopher hole  shagging fly balls and ruins his career.  </P> <P> Spring training is the place where Rickey Henderson happens to mention that a  few of the Yankees knocked back a few too many beers the previous season,  whereupon a New York newspaper runs a giant headline that reads: "BRONX  BOOZERS."  </P> <P> Spring training is the place where Dave Kingman and Guillermo Hernandez dump  buckets of water over reporters' heads, but nobody mentions the incredible new  leadership they have brought to their clubs.  </P> <P> Spring training is the place where the Texas Rangers actually believe (ha, ha,  ha, ho, ho, ho, this is hilarious) this is going to be their year.  </P> <P> Spring training is the place where some of the (duh) experts blame the  management of the Angels for rushing Jim Abbott to the majors before he's  ready.  </P> <P> Spring training is the place where Jose Canseco plays pedestrian roulette.  </P> <P> Spring training is the place where Wade Boggs runs around, stretches, swings  and does his (wink) calisthenics.  </P> <P> Spring training is the place where some guy comes in to pitch wearing No. 97.  </P> <P> Spring training is the place where Commissioner Bowie Kuhn announces that the  returning Iran hostages are to be given lifetime major league passes, whereupon  TV football commentator Beano Cook asks: "Haven't they suffered enough?"  </P> <P> Spring training is the place where Pete Rose used to bring new meaning to the  term lay one down.  </P> <P> Spring training is the place where Bill Veeck is asked what his first act would  be if he were named commissioner, and his reply is: "Resign."  </P> <P> Spring training is the place where a Detroit photographer desperate for a new  angle asks Lance Parrish to pose with a live tiger -- and he does.  </P> <P> Spring training is the place where pitching screwball Larry Andersen thinks up  such lines as: "Is it a coincidence that Washington and Lincoln were both born  on holidays?"  </P> <P> Spring training is the place where Seattle Mariner fans realize that they are  always going to get more for their money at home games, because they are always  going to see a bottom of the ninth.  </P> <P> Spring training is the place where Willie Mays is asked by a fan to hit a home  run, and he replied: "What row?"  </P> <P> Spring training is the place where Bob Uecker says he experienced the greatest  thrill of his baseball career, walking with the bases loaded.  </P> <P> Spring training is the place where Birdie Tebbetts is asked what the difference  is between his rookie pitchers and his veterans, and he replies: "What's the  difference between carpenters and cabinetmakers?"  </P> <P> Spring training is the place where, as Spaceman Bill Lee summed it up, "You're  supposed to sit on your butt, spit on the ground and nod at stupid things."  </P> <P> Ah, come to think of it, I miss spring training terribly.  </P></p>

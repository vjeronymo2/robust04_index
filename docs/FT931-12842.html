			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Observer: Spark fired Instead of seeing British Airways heads rolling over the Virgin Atlantic affair, we now have Richard Branson and BA's Sir Colin Marshall looking forward to building a new, writ-free relationship on the back of this week's kiss-and-make-up session at Branson's Holland Park home. Even so, one innocent bystander has been forced to make the ultimate sacrifice. He is Roland Spark, the Sun's chief leader writer for the last 14 years, and one of the crispest pontificators in the press. His crime? Dissociating himself from some other author's Sun leader attacking British Airways's dirty tricks. Spark, now 63, thinks BA's 75-year-old chairman Lord King has been 'kicked around long enough' and wrote a letter of sympathy after a particularly vicious Sun attack. When Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie learned about it, he sacked him. If only the BA board were as ruthless. But then they might not be allowed to get away with it.</p>

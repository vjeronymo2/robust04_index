			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / US voters seek fresher faces / Analysis of the results in the congressional primaries WOMEN, non-incumbents and, probably, Mr Bill Clinton and the Democratic party emerged yesterday as the principal beneficiaries of the final round of congressional primaries held on Tuesday. The victory in the Washington state Democratic primary of Ms Patty Murray brings to 11 the number of women who will contest US Senate seats in November - 10 of them Democrats. This beats the old record of 10, set in 1984, and this time at least five of the women candidates start the home stretch favoured to win. Other primary results across the country brought to 86 the number of incumbents in the House of Representatives who will not be returning next year. Of these, 19 have been defeated, 65 have retired, in some cases to seek other offices, and two have died. Given the vulnerability of some other incumbents who will be on the November ballot, the probability is that next year's freshman class in the House will be larger than the 118 new members returned in 1948. Although 57 of the now vacant seats were held by Democrats, most of them will probably stay in the party's hands. In the Senate, with nine out of the 34 seats at stake in November vacated by incumbents, it is now thought that the Democrats will add to their current 57-43 majority by three or four seats. In some states, like California, Illinois and Pennsylvania, powerful local women candidates may help Mr Clinton. This week's polls, national and local, have brought good news for the Democratic candidate, offsetting the continuing controversy over his avoidance of military service 23 years ago. Both the Newsweek and Washington Post/ABC surveys have him back up to a 15 point lead. The New York Times/CBS poll out yesterday gave him a 49-37 per cent margin, up a little bit from its previous survey. The Los Angeles Times poll in California had him 21 points up at 57-36. Of the bigger states, only Florida, a Republican bastion, offered encouragement for President Bush with a poll out yesterday showing him 7 points ahead. The general message from all of them is Mr Clinton consolidating his lead, mostly because of the parlous state of the economy and the lack of confidence in Mr Bush's ability to fix it. Putting Mr Clinton on the defensive over the draft issue has produced some tactical victories for Mr Bush, but does not seem yet to have taken hold with the public. Nevertheless, the Washington Post reported yesterday that the Bush campaign had more or less decided to stop emphasising the positive. It will go for the Clinton jugular. 'We're not going to start moving (in the polls) until we rip the skin off the guy,' one official was quoted as saying. It was also announced yesterday that the first debate between the US presidential candidates, scheduled for East Lansing, Michigan, next Tuesday had been cancelled because the Bush campaign had failed to agree on the conditions under which it would be held. Further complicating matters was the latest in a long line of hints from Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire, that he might get back into the race if both candidates failed to address the problem of the budget deficit. But he also hinted in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that he might endorse Mr Clinton if he took a tough stand on cutting federal spending. Mr Marion Barry, the former mayor of Washington, DC, won election to the city council on Tuesday. He had been forced out of office two years ago, and subsequently into jail, on drugs charges.</p>

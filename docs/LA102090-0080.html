			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAURICE WILSON'S 75-YARD RUN SAVES BOLSA GRANDE VICTORY  </P> <P> Bolsa Grande Coach Bill Holst said it was homecoming that did it for the  Matadors, inspiring them to their second Garden Grove league victory, 13-10,  over Garden Grove High School.  </P> <P> "We've gone nuts all week long," he said.  </P> <P> "Our kids came ready to play. Our defense was superb. They watched (Garden  Grove) films all week, so they knew what to expect."  </P> <P> Bolsa Grande might not have expected to win after fumbling five times --  although it recovered three of them -- and throwing two interceptions.  </P> <P> Still, the Matadors won, thanks to Maurice Wilson's game-winning, 75-yard  touchdown run with 9:36 left. The extra-point attempt failed, but Bolsa Grande  (3-4, 2-2) held off Garden Grove (3-4, 2-2).  </P> <P> Bolsa Grande fell behind, 7-0, in the first quarter after Simon Fuentes hit  Jason Baca with a 35-yard touchdown pass.  </P> <P> The Matadors tied the score in the third quarter, when quarterback Bryan  Taylor's 44-yard run set up a three-yard touchdown run by Marcus Wilson.  </P> <P> Garden Grove's Adrian Ioja missed a 30-yard field goal attempt, but seemed to  redeem himself with a 26-yard kick with 10:11 left in the game before Maurice  Wilson's run turned the lead into a loss.

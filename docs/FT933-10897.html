			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / The ERM Crisis: Media fusillade puts alliance to test - France is ignoring its domestic difficulties, preferring instead to blame the markets PARIS is a mistress which Bonn can no longer afford to keep, the Die Welt am Sonntag newspaper suggested yesterday. The relationship endangered the stability of the German currency, it claimed. In a signed editorial under the headline 'Ritual', the conservative Hamburg-based Sunday newspaper warned Chancellor Helmut Kohl to resist any appeals from France for renewed solidarity or an acceleration towards a mini-monetary union centred on the franc and D-Mark. 'Acceptance of such or similar wishes from Paris by the chancellor would attack the Bundesbank from the rear,' it said. The German central bank well knew that a second currency union within five years would mean the end of the D-Mark's stability. In France, however, the press pointed the finger of blame for the latest ERM crisis at Germany - particularly the Bundesbank - and at 'Anglo-Saxon' speculators. The targets reflect a fraying of relations with France's closest ally and a belief that France differs from the UK and the US in its economic principles. The quality French newspapers were careful to draw the distinction between the German political and monetary authorities, acknowledging it was the decision by the Bundesbank not to cut its principal interest rate last week which brought about the ERM's most serious crisis. 'The members of the Bundesbank council are acting like provincial managers,' said Le Figaro. 'The EMS is built around the D-Mark, those who guard the key currency also have international responsibilities.' In the popular press, the distinction between Bonn and the Bundesbank is blurred and the criticism becomes sharper. 'By putting the interests of 'greater Germany' first, the Bonn government has isolated itself,' says Le Quotidien, the right-wing daily. 'It has already lost its friends and tomorrow the consequences of this Prussian obstinacy may seriously jeopardise its own prosperity.' Die Welt am Sonntag, meanwhile, said the grounds for Mr Jacques Delors' recent proclamation that the French franc could soon replace the D-Mark as the lead currency in the European monetary system could only be found by using psychiatric methodology. The editorial's author, Mr Harald Hotze, an old Brussels hand, referred to the 'trauma' in the early 1980s when Mr Delors, now president of the European Community and then French finance minister, sought three franc devaluations within 16 months. In Italy, a front-page editorial in Corriere della Sera said Germany had in effect given up its European leadership role when the Bundesbank put national interests before those of the EC and refused to cut its discount rate. 'The leadership of a system implies that a country is willing and able to take account of the interests of member states and subordinate its national interests to these.' In contrast, many German editorials underlined the enduring popular obsession in the country with monetary stability - a condition in which the Bundesbank consistently enjoys more popular credibility than the government or European union. The Sunday edition of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung went beyond the central bank's normally muted statements: a glance at German inflation and money supply figures would show further interest rate cuts were 'forbidden'. The French press believes UK and US attitudes towards currencies are also a factor behind the ERM's troubles. 'The war between the international speculators and the central banks is a shock between two cultures,' said Le Monde in an editorial. 'One is inspired by liberal Anglo-Saxon ideologies, the other by a more continental, dirigiste, ideal.' In the Anglo-Saxon view, says Le Monde, currencies are simply commodities. For the French, however, who subscribe to the 'continental' ideal, a currency is a measure of value within a nation and is not like other goods. Currencies must, in this view, be assured a certain stability. For Le Monde and other French newspapers this differing perception helps explain why international currency traders, dubbed 'Anglo-Saxon speculators', have attacked the European exchange rate mechanism. Hostile to a fixed currency system, the speculators have bet that the French economy cannot sustain the high level of interest rates which would be needed to fend off their assault. For Le Figaro, the motives of the speculators are deeper. 'The currency traders are in favour of universal free trade. They are hostile to a European protectionism concerning Gatt of which they suspect France of being a conspirator.' The attack was taken up later by Mr Roland Dumas, the former French foreign minister, who said in a radio interview: 'You have to look at who profits from the crime. 'I think there is, on the part of the Anglo-Saxons in particular, a determination to see European construction stopped.' Asked if he meant the British or US governments, he said: 'You know financial forces are a mixture. Governments, private forces, banks and interests are intertwined. In general, the construction of Europe and the reinforcement of the European Community offends some countries in the world.' Mr Dumas, a close adviser to President Francois Mitterrand, said the new French government had been hasty and imprudent in its monetary policy. 'Bringing interest rates down rapidly means making our currency more fragile,' he said. The new government cut interest rates ten times in as many weeks after taking office.</p>

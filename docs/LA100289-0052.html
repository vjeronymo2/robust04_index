			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH CROWD HAS A PLAN FOR BROAD TAX RETREAT;  </P> <P> BITE WILL BE ON MIDDLE AND LOWER CLASS  </P> <P> The Bush Administration's current drive to cut the tax on capital gains is part  of a larger economic policy agenda that, if enacted, will fundamentally change  the nation's tax system while swelling the federal budget deficit -- all at the  expense of middle- and lower-income Americans.  </P> <P> The Administration has persuaded the House (and now awaits a Senate vote) to  cut the capital-gains tax, at a net cost of $21 billion over 10 years. Bush  also wants "incentives" for savings, such as expanded Individual Retirement  Accounts (IRAs), arguing, against a mountain of contrary evidence, that this  will stimulate personal savings. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has  proposed a cornucopia of costly corporate tax breaks, including a deduction for  stock dividends that would cost $40 billion a year.  </P> <P> To deal with the budget-busting impact of these changes, the President's team  is likely to seek enactment of a regressive national sales tax similar to the  value-added taxes assessed in Europe.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, some key House and Senate members are receptive to these ideas.  The Democratic congressional leadership had already endorsed expanding tax  breaks for IRAs. And Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen has said  that "there'd be a good chance" for enacting a national sales tax if Bush gave  the plan his full support.  </P> <P> These proposals will all swell the deficit. They will all contribute to a  further shift of wealth from the middle class to the wealthy. None of them will  increase savings or reduce the cost of capital.  </P> <P> These proposals are on the table because the 1986 Tax Reform Act has been an  economic success but a political failure. Although tax sheltering is down and  both savings and investment are up since the tax bill was enacted, the public  has never been convinced that the Reagan Administration and Congress did the  right thing three years ago.  </P> <P> Public skepticism has left tax reform vulnerable to special-interest lobbyists  who want pre-1986 tax breaks restored in the name of helping business capital  formation.  </P> <P> Advocates of capital formation point with alarm to our high real-interest rates  and our low national-savings rate. Capital costs in the United States are  indeed higher than in Japan and West Germany. But the primary cause is  Washington's excessive borrowing -- to cover the debt run up by the supply-side  tax cuts of the early 1980s.  </P> <P> Moreover, Commerce Department data show that the personal savings rate is now  on an upswing, from a low of 2.3% of GNP in 1987 to 4.0% for the first two  quarters of 1989. This resurgence in personal savings has occurred despite the  limitations on IRA tax deductions enacted in 1986, whereby they were restricted  to families that make less than $50,000 or have no other private retirement  plan. Congress took the heat on IRAs in the 1986 tax reform act because it saw  that unrestricted IRAs were merely a tool used by high-income people to shift  existing savings into tax-advantaged accounts.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, since the 1986 reforms eliminated many of the costliest tax breaks  for business, corporate profitability has grown. Real capital spending has  grown at an annual rate of 6.1% since 1986, compared to an anemic 2.1% over the  previous five years.  </P> <P> The fact is that tax reform has worked and worked well but that the federal  deficit continues to hang like a millstone around the economy's neck. The Bush  agenda would reprise the early Reagan Administration program, which  then-President Ronald Reagan himself abandoned in 1986, and fund it with a  national sales tax, which will take a larger share of the disposable incomes of  lower-income people than of higher-income people.  </P> <P> Studies by the Congressional Budget Office show that between 1977 and 1988, the  richest 1% of Americans enjoyed a 74% jump in real after-tax incomes, while  real incomes for low- and middle-income families stagnated or declined.  </P> <P> And the lesson of the early Reagan years is that if you give the rich more  money, they don't save it -- they spend it. Between 1983 and 1986, for example,  U.S. sales of Jaguars went up 55%, Mercedes, 35%; Porsches, 40%, and BMWs, 63%,  while sales of U.S.-made cars grew by only 21%.  </P> <P> The Bush agenda would swell the deficit and then raise taxes on working people,  all in the name of helping business. The fact that business is doing just fine  now goes unnoticed. The fact that the deficit impedes business capital  formation is ignored. It's time for Congress to come to its senses and reject  the whole Bush agenda on this issue and get to work on our largest national  problem: the federal budget deficit.  </P></p>

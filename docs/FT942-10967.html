			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Markets: Democracy rears its head at Lloyd's - Serious Money Democracy at Lloyd's sounds like a contradiction in terms. But that does not make it any the less welcome. This week's plan to first enfranchise the Names, and then examine ways they can sell their membership rights, is long overdue (see page III). Previously, although the Names have put up the capital and shared the underwriting profits - or, more recently, losses - they have had none of the other rights of ownership. All the power has been with the agents who manage the underwriting syndicates. Some have notoriously abused this power. What is more, running an underwriting agency has created a valuable asset for the managers; participating in the actual underwriting syndicates has not. It is a rather neat inversion of the normal roles of capital and labour. The blueprint for change is designed to remedy this imbalance. The one obvious objection so far is that it comes too late to be of any help to the Names who have been ruined by their losses. Other niggly problems are bound to arise as more detailed proposals are hammered out. Names and managers alike will argue that they should have a bigger slice of the cake, whatever that total cake might prove to be worth. The Names will claim that it is their capital which is at risk. The managers will argue that it is their skill that keeps the business going. The fact that five syndicates already have sacked all their Names, while they still had the power to do so, is hardly an encouraging portent. Many individual Names are understandably embittered by now, and need reassuring that they are not going to be eased gently out of their syndicates in favour of corporate members, whom many agents prefer. That would leave them unable to take advantage of a better underwriting climate to earn back some of the money they lost in the bad times. The latest proposals should go a long way to assuage their fears. Members can appeal against being sacked by their syndicates and have pre-emptive rights to their share of any increase in business. Underwriting should also be a bit less hairy in future. The idea of weighting capital requirements according to the riskiness of a syndicate's business seems painfully elementary. The Financial Services Act has long demanded that advisers know their clients and do not put vulnerable people into unsuitably risky investments. Some Lloyd's agents appear to regard such scruples as wimpish, but risk ratings should do the job for them. If all goes well, being a Name at Lloyd's should be rather less of a white knuckle ride in future. But much of the interest in the new blueprint inevitably will focus on its suggestions for golden handshakes: selling membership rights. Some people are arguing already that this part of the proposal is just pie in the sky - a cynically unrealistic bait designed to keep recalcitrant Names aboard while they can be useful. But let us give Lloyd's the benefit of the doubt just one more time. What would membership be worth? The market's losses have been so monstrous, and its reputation is so tarnished, that it is hard to imagine memberships in even the more profitable and reputable syndicates fetching a price in line with the size of their business. And anyone in a poor syndicate will get only a pinchbeck handshake when he leaves. But the biggest bugbear is likely to be the very limited market in which members can sell their rights. Lloyd's itself says that it is unrealistic to expect the amount of transfer business to justify a proper market-maker and reckons that periodic auctions, in which all members get the same price, look the best bet. Not a very alluring prospect. But at least Lloyd's is heading in the right direction for a change. Any building society member who was dreaming of a C&amp;G bonanza from one of the other societies will have had a cold shower of reality this week. The Northern Rock/North of England merger looks set to bring North of England members an average of Pounds 50 apiece compared with the Pounds 650 they might have got if there had been an outside bid for the society. Northern Rock members get nothing. The proposal is a useful reminder of two things. First, not all building societies are equal - any more than all Lloyd's syndicates are equal. Efficient and profitable societies, such as C&amp;G, may be able to find suitors who will pay a handsome bride price. Less efficient, less profitable societies will not. C&amp;G's expense ratio is well below average at 26 per cent. North of England's is a lofty 54 per cent. Second, building society members are unlikely to get the best price unless their managements secure it for them. The idea of soliciting a bid does not seem to have occurred to the managers of Northern Rock or North of England. The two societies explain the deal as 'a traditional building society merger about traditional building society values.' True, many members do seem to value the societies' mutual status. But some would have sold their birthright happily so long as the mess of pottage was big enough. The concept of mutuality can no longer be taken for granted - except by building society and life company managers.</p>

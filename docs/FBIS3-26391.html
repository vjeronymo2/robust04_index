			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Li Renhu (2621 0088 5706) and SHANXI </F> RIBAO reporter Li Dongxi (2621 2639 0823)]    [Text] Taiyuan, 3 Feb (XINHUA) -- It was the dead of  winter at the end of the year. Chairman Jiang Zemin, general  secretary of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the  Central Military Commission, braved the severe cold and crossed  mountain after mountain to travel through Shanxi. He brought  with him the concern and warmth of the party Central Committee,  State Council, and Central Military Commission to grass-roots  units as well as to the hearts of the vast number of workers,  peasants, soldiers, and intellectuals. He pointed out: Showing  concern for the masses in all respects, relying on the masses in  every matter, and gearing all our work toward the interests of  the masses is the party's fundamental aim and working line as  well as the party's vivid characteristic and political edge.  Leading cadres and the vast number of party members should  firmly remember the historical truth that people are the real  heroes and origin of victory especially when times are more  advanced and our undertakings more developed, and work more  sincerely for the interests of the people. Our undertakings in  building socialism with Chinese characteristics will then  develop more vigorously.    Accompanied by Fu Quanyou, director of the General Logistics  Department; Hu Fuguo, secretary of the Shanxi provincial party  committee; Acting Shanxi Governor Sun Wensheng; and Li Laizhu,  commander of the Beijing Military Region, General Secretary  Jiang Zemin successively inspected Xinzhou, Luliang, Yuncheng,  Linfen, Taiyuan, and Jinzhong prefectures from 29 January to 3  February. He visited peasant families; schools; plants; mines;  and barracks; as well as peasants; workers; officers and men of  the People's Liberation Army; public security cadres and  policemen; officers and men of the armed police force; school  teachers and students; masses in old revolutionary and  poverty-stricken areas; and cadres working at the grass-roots  level. Wherever he went, he held intimate conversions with the  masses, asked about their welfare, listened to their opinions  and demands, and extended New Year greetings to them.    On 29 January, Luliang prefecture was covered with a layer  of  snow and the temperature was 20 degrees Celsius below zero.  Ignoring the severe cold and fatigue, Jiang Zemin went straight  to Xingxian county's Caijiaya in the old revolutionary area. He  visited the Jinsui Revolution Memorial Hall and called on  veteran heroes, veteran revolutionaries, and martyrs' family  members to convey his cordial greetings and take photographs  with them. He earnestly told the cadres and people: The state  power of the people's republic was established by  revolutionaries of the older generation, and the party and  government always remembers them. We must continue the martyrs'  unfulfilled will, carry forward the contributory spirit of the  people in old revolutionary areas, and work arduously to develop  Luliang prefecture.    General Secretary Jiang was worried about the people's lives  in poverty-stricken mountain regions. Throughout his trip, he  saw people busily buying goods for the Spring Festival, and was  particularly pleased to see the joyous atmosphere. At about  1600 on the afternoon of 29 January, Jiang Zemin traveled  through a 3-km long valley and came to Mingwanta village in  Linxian county, Shanxi's largest poor county. Jiang Zemin  walked briskly up the slope and entered the house of peasant Li  Sier. He held the Li couple's hands and asked about their  family, the size of their farm, grain production, and annual  income. The young couple was moved by the party's concern, and  they vowed to shake off their poverty to become well-off as soon  as possible. Later, Jiang Zemin entered a low earthen cave  dwelling, the home of poverty-stricken Liu Zhengyang. He held  the hands of Liu Zhengyang's 71-year-old mother and asked about  her welfare. He lifted the cooking pot cover and asked whether  they had enough food, and checked the fireplace. He repeatedly  reminded village cadres to look after poor households.  Meanwhile, the masses who heard about the visit rushed to the  scene. Standing on the undulating slope on top of the cave  dwellings, they clapped their hands to welcome General Secretary  Jiang. Jiang Zemin smilingly extended new year greetings to  them all. The people said simultaneously: "General Secretary  Jiang, you have worked hard. We hope you will come again." The  heart of the party's general secretary was linked to those of  the people, and the entire mountain village was submerged in a  joyous and encouraging mood.    Shanxi still has some poor areas. However, the arduous,  pioneering, and hardworking spirit of the people and cadres in  the poverty-stricken areas, as well as their firm belief in the  party and socialist undertakings, deeply impressed the general  secretary. Jiang Zemin said: If cadres of all levels always  showed their concern for poverty-stricken areas, shared the joys  and sorrows of the people, and upheld the guidance of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line, we would certainly  achieve advanced results and change the outlook of  poverty-stricken areas by adopting practical measures; promoting  aid work for the poor; and maintaining our arduous struggle. We  must be determined, adopt more good policies, and strive to  accomplish the great task of eliminating absolute poverty in the  entire country by the end of this century, to thoroughly solve  the issue of the survival rights of Chinese people, who make up  one-quarters of the world's population. This will not only be a  great event in the history of Chinese people but also a  magnificent feat in human history. He also stressed: The  development and stability of the rural areas is always crucial  to nationwide social development and stability. The tasks to  strengthen the role of agriculture as the foundation of the  national economy should not waver at anytime. We must not  slacken, in the slightest degree, in the production of principal  agricultural products such as grains, cotton, and edible oil.    In Linfen city's Qiaoli village, Jiang Zemin carefully  listened with great interest to what veteran party branch  secretary Wang Yunkang said. Wang Yunkang, who has been a  village cadre for 40 years, animatedly briefed Jiang Zemin on  how his party branch had led local masses to adhere to the  socialist course to achieve common prosperity, and on how he had  made efforts to build up his village party branch. He said: A  good party branch must be politically sensitive, ideologically  correct, democratic in work style, and economically clean. In  short, the party branch and the masses must stand together  through thick and thin, and they should share joys and sorrows.  After Wang Yunkang finished, the general secretary nodded and  said applaudingly: You have done a great job and what you just  said makes a lot of sense. Your experience shows the core of  grass-roots work in rural areas is to build a good party branch.  The primary reason why your village party branch has a unifying  force, rallying power, and combat capability is that you have  truly integrated the party's policy with your local reality, and  have truly transformed the party central committee's guidelines  into the masses' self-conscious act, thereby bringing economic  prosperity to the village and making progress in your work in  all areas. If village party branches across the country were  like your party branch, our rural work would be much easier.  Your experience also shows that once the rural areas' dual  management system that combines household with collective  operations, which is based on the establishment of the contract  responsibility system with remuneration linked to output, is  refined; once rural areas' agricultural, forestry, animal  husbandry, sideline production, and fishery industries are  developed; and once rural areas' collective economies have  become stronger, the prospects for building new and modern  socialist rural areas will be better and better. Jiang Zemin  also told leading cadres accompanying him: Not only should  rural areas work to consolidate their leading bodies, build up  work forces, and improve work style, but party committees and  governments at all levels should also insist on doing so. If we  have strong leading bodies, competent work forces, and a good  work style on all fronts, we will be able to stand the test of  all kinds of difficulties and crises, and we will win victory  after victory in our work.    Jiang Zemin also visited Linxian county's project employing  comprehensive measures to fight soil erosion; Yuncheng's project  to develop shoals in the Huang He and its project of diverting  the Huang He water for irrigation use; and the project to widen  the Hongdong section of the 309 State Highway, which is an  important road for the transportation of Shanxi's coal. He  fully approved Shanxi's efforts since the beginning of this  winter to mobilize office cadres, workers, school teachers and  students, and troops to do voluntary work -- repairing roads and  taking part in the construction of capital farming projects and  other key projects. He told Hu Fuguo, Sun Wensheng, and other  comrades that they had done a good job and hoped they would keep  up their good work. He pointed out insightfully: In the  construction of some public projects, it is necessary to call on  office cadres and people of all trades to do some voluntary  work. This has many benefits. It is one of our party's fine  traditions as well as a practical expression of our socialist  politics; it not only helps develop our material civilization  but also helps develop our spiritual civilization, to cement  solidarity among the masses, bring party-masses relations  closer, and improve our leading style.    Wherever he went, Jiang Zemin went deep down to inspect  local  factories and mining enterprises, and to extend his regards to  workers. He visited the Yuncheng Plate Making Plant, Yongji  Railway Electric Machinery and Devices Factory, Xishan Mining  Bureau's Guandi Mine, and Taiyuan Railway Sub-bureau, and called  on workers on the production forefront and their families.  Jiang Zemin pointed out to cadres and workers of state-owned  enterprises: Currently, state-owned enterprises are facing  numerous difficulties. The party and government understand this  very well and are always concerned about it. In developing the  socialist market economy, state-owned enterprises -- especially  large and medium enterprises that are closely related to the  country's economic development and the people's livelihood --  must enhance not weaken their capabilities and must effectively  prevent the loss of state assets, because these are a basic  criterion for measuring the results of the reform of our  economic system. All party members must have a very clear  understanding of this. To improve the performance of  state-owned enterprises, we must further transform the operating  mechanisms, adjust the organizational structure, and adopt a  modern enterprise management system. At the same time, these  enterprises need necessary support from the state. In  particular, workers of state- owned enterprises should work hand  in hand, and fully bring their enthusiasm and creativity into  play.    On 3 February, Jiang Zemin held a discussion meeting at the  Taiyuan Railway Subbureau, where he was briefed on rules  regarding all-around implementation of ideological and political  work. Workers and staff members throughout the subbureau have  followed the work rules for eight years, achieved good results,  and amassed considerable experience. During the discussion  meeting, the general secretary pointed out: You have carried  out meticulous and lively ideological and political work, during  various periods, in all areas for which the subbureau is  responsible, and in all fields of work carried out by the  subbureau; this is commendable. The more we deepen reform and  develop the economy, the more we should strengthen all aspects  of ideological and political work in all lines of work.    Jiang Zemin also held a discussion meeting with renowned  model workers in Shanxi Province at the Xishan Mining Bureau,  which was attended by model workers Li Shuangliang, Shen Jilan,  Guo Fenglian, Li Cheng, Hao Xiaoming, Fu Changwang, and Wang  Cuicui. They told the general secretary about their practical  experiences, made work proposals, and reflected the people's  wishes. Jiang Zemin said: You are honorable representatives who  have come to the fore from among workers, peasants, and  intellectuals. Your advanced deeds fully demonstrate the  necessity of wholeheartedly relying on the working class, the  worker-peasant alliance, and the masses at all times, whether  during revolution, construction, or reform. These are the  sources of our strength and the foundations of our success.  Respect for model workers and advanced characters means respect  for people's practical work and pioneering spirit. Not only did  we undergo rigorous tests during the revolutionary war but we  have also encountered many new trials during reform, opening up,  and modernization, some of which are very severe. If our  comrades do not maintain vigilance and strengthen study and  self-cultivation, they run the risk of being dismissed as  useless. I hope that model workers will be able to withstand  all kinds of tests at all times, including the test of their  honor, and will continue to perform meritorious services for the  party and people. I especially hope that our cadres will guard  against conceit and impetuosity, show honesty and  self-discipline, and fight a winning, not losing, battle against  all kinds of ordeals.    During the inspection, Jiang Zemin also paid personal visits  to military troops and barracks to find out about the learning,  training, and living conditions of commanders and fighters.  Upon seeing fighters on duty outside a certain grass-roots unit  at the National Defense Science, Technology, and Industry  Commission, the general secretary immediately got out of his  car, clasped their hands, felt their clothes, and asked them  whether they felt cold. At a certain tank regiment, Jiang Zemin  entered the dormitory for new recruits to the 4th Squad of the  1st Company and asked them whether they were homesick. He  smiled in relief when the fighters unanimously said they were  serving the military without any worries. He told the regiment's  commanders and fighters on a hopeful note: Cadres should cherish  fighters, veteran soldiers should help new recruits, and new  recruits should respect veteran soldiers. They should unite as  one, strengthen political studies, conduct military training  properly, and build troops into all-around militant collectives.  At a certain infantry regiment, Jiang Zemin inspected its  amenities service center, and visited cadres and fighters who  were undergoing training. He urged military cadres to strive to  acquire knowledge in new and high science and technology to meet  the demands of the new situation and tasks.    Jiang Zemin expressed great concern for schooling and  education for children in rural areas, especially those in  mountainous regions. Whenever he arrived in a village, he would  insist on inspecting kindergartens, and primary and middle  schools. He praised Shanxi for implementing Project Hope and  building schools to solve education problems for children in  poor areas. He repeatedly pointed out: In the final analysis,  economic development and social progress are determined by the  improvement of the people's quality, and of scientific and  cultural levels in all sectors of society. It takes 100 years  to cultivate people, and education is the foundation.  Neglecting education is a short-sighted and dangerous act. In  carrying out education in rural areas, we must consider local  realities, readjust the school structure, and train more  personnel of the junior middle school level that are badly  needed for local development.    Also accompanying General Secretary Jiang Zemin during his  inspection and visits to the people were responsible persons  from relevant central departments, such as Zeng Qinghong, Ye  Qing, Liu Jiang, Han Zhubin, Zhang Youcai, Teng Wensheng, and  Yang Yongzhe.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL;  </P> <P> CAMARILLO GETS A BIGGS LIFT TO 2-1 VICTORY  </P> <P> Steve Biggs decided to take matters into his own hands Friday, driving home the  winning run and pitching a five-hitter to help Camarillo High hand Newbury Park  its first Marmonte League loss of the season, a 2-1 decision at Newbury Park.  </P> <P> Biggs, a senior right-hander who signed with Cal, struck out three and raised  his record to 5-1. It was Biggs' bat, however, that gave Camarillo the victory.  </P> <P> With one out in the top of the sixth and Camarillo trailing, 1-0, Mike Muncy  and Matt Tackett hit consecutive singles. Chris Johnson then scored Muncy with  a base hit. Biggs then singled to score Tackett, who narrowly beat the tag by  Panther catcher Danny Madsen. The at-bat was the first of the game for Biggs.  Designated hitter Jason McAtee struck out twice in both previous at-bats.  </P> <P> "It makes you look good when those guys come through for you," Camarillo Coach  Ken Wagner said.  </P> <P> Chris Johnson was two for three for Camarillo (11-8, 4-2 in league play), which  is in third place. Newbury Park (14-2-3, 5-1) dropped into a first-place tie  with Simi Valley.  </P> <P> Newbury Park's Jeremy Dewey (5-1) pitched a complete game with six strikeouts  and two walks. Newbury Park's run came on a solo home run by Wayne Cook, his  second of the year.  </P> <P> In other Marmonte League games:  </P> <P> Simi Valley 12, Thousand Oaks 1 -- Mike Jenkins pitched a one-hitter and struck  out 15 and the Pioneers hit four home runs at Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> Jenkins, who struck out eight of the final nine batters and the last six in a  row, improved to 4-0. The only ball to leave the infield was Mike McNellis'  double to center in the fifth inning.  </P> <P> Jesse Anguiano led Simi Valley (16-2, 5-1) with two home runs. Greg Santos and  Kenny Hood hit Thousand Oaks starter Scott Barkman's first two pitches of the  second inning for home runs. Anguiano, the Pioneers' leadoff batter, leads the  team with four homers.  </P> <P> Andy Hodgins and Hood had three hits each and Terry Hill had two hits and three  RBIs.  </P> <P> Westlake 7, Royal 3 -- Steve Susko's two-run single in the fifth inning broke a  2-2 tie for the Warriors at Royal.  </P> <P> Susko had two hits and Mike Lieberthal had three and scored two runs. Rob Neal,  a sophomore playing in his second game since being promoted from the junior  varsity, was two for four and scored three runs.  </P> <P> Mike Eby pitched a four-hitter to improve to 4-4 for Westlake (8-10, 2-4).  </P> <P> Jason Jones hit a solo homer in the second for Royal (8-11, 2-4).  </P> <P> SAN FERNANDO VALLEY LEAGUE  </P> <P> La Salle 1, Notre Dame 0 -- Two La Salle pitchers limited Notre Dame to three  hits and the Lancers scored a run in the first inning to beat the Knights at  Notre Dame.  </P> <P> The loss broke Notre Dame's seven-game winning streak. The Knights (14-2, 1-1)  had also won their first seven games of the season before losing.  </P> <P> "They played real sound baseball," Notre Dame Coach Bob Mandeville said of La  Salle, which improved to 2-0 in league. "They were ready for us and they were  excited, I tell you."  </P> <P> Luis Solis started for the Lancers and gave way to Brian Esquival in the sixth.  The Knights, who threatened in the sixth when they left the bases loaded, and  the seventh, stranded 12 baserunners. With Notre Dame runners on first and  second and one out in the seventh, La Salle turned a double play to end the  game.  </P> <P> Chaminade 7, Harvard 2 -- Chris DeCristo drove in three runs, two with a  third-inning home run, to support the combined three-hit pitching of Greg  Galloway and Greg Baumgartner at Chaminade.  </P> <P> Galloway (2-3) allowed three hits and two unearned runs in six innings for  Chaminade (6-10, 1-1).  </P> <P> Marty Holly's sixth-inning double drove in both runs for Harvard (6-10, 0-2).  </P> <P> St. Genevieve 8, Bell-Jeff 0 -- St. Genevieve pitcher Herman Merchan (1-2)  pitched a five-hit shutout with three strikeouts and knocked in five runs to  led the Valiants at St. Genevieve (8-5, 2-0).

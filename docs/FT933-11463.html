			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Rabin condemned for shelling: Clinton appeals to all parties to halt conflict in southern Lebanon ISRAEL'S prime minister Yitzhak Rabin faced heavy criticism last night both from his closest allies abroad and within his cabinet at home for the four-day bombardment of southern Lebanon which has forced nearly 250,000 civilians to flee their homes. The US, stepping up its efforts to end the fighting, criticised Israel for targeting civilians and urged Syria to do more to stop the conflict, while Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general, condemned Israel's attack. As Mr Rabin's Labour-led administration appeared increasingly isolated internationally, a political crisis was looming in Israel as two parties backing the coalition government strongly opposed continuing the offensive. Two cabinet ministers, speaking on television on behalf of the left-wing Meretz party which has 12 MPs, called for the shelling to cease immediately and said they opposed Mr Rabin's objective of driving villagers out of southern Lebanon. Unruly scenes also erupted in parliament, and an Arab MP, who repeatedly harangued Mr Rabin, was expelled from the Knesset. The five-strong Arab group of MPs was considering its future support for Mr Rabin. Mr Rabin pledged, however, to continue the offensive until Israel's security interests were achieved, and said refugees fleeing the Israeli bombardment of their villages would not be allowed to return home until rocket attacks by pro-Iranian Hizbollah fighters ceased. Yesterday marked the first direct criticism from the US. President Bill Clinton called on Hizbollah to stop rocket attacks on Israel, but also demanded that Israel stop its blitz of villages in southern Lebanon which has left more than 100 people dead. The president also urged Syria 'to go from showing restraint to being an active participant to try to stop the fighting'. US State Department officials were unusually severe in their criticism. 'It's clear that there have been attacks directed against civilians,' said Mr Mike McCurry, the State Department spokesman. He called the flood of refugees 'deeply disturbing'. But he acknowledged there had also been attacks directed against civilians in northern Israel. The crushing bombardment and air attacks on the region continued for a fourth day, as Israel directed its heavy artillery fire to the area south of Tyre and shelled further north to broaden the area it effectively controls. In Nabatiyeh, a town which has been under sustained attack, remaining residents were trapped without transport and with dwindling food supplies. Mr Rabin yesterday called on Syria to use its influence to curb the Islamic fighters and said a dialogue with Damascus would open when Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, visits the region at the weekend. Mr Rabin refused to say how long the operation would last. 'We are steadfast in our decision to continue to act to achieve our aims,' he said. Syria called for international pressure to force Israel to stop its attacks, which official newspapers described as barbaric and a threat to regional peace. President Elias Hrawi of Lebanon said the country was united against the Israeli occupation. An Israeli army spokesman in the border town of Metulla said that by yesterday evening more than 14,500 shells had been fired into southern Lebanon. Hizbollah fighters, massively overwhelmed by superior Israeli firepower, continued to harass Israeli forces, launching 28 Katyusha rockets.

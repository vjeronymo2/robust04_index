			<p>BFN     [Text] Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's  alternate special representative in Cyprus, held a meeting with  Rauf Denktas in the occupied areas this afternoon. A statement  Mr. Feissel made after the meeting indicated that again today  Denktas did not give a positive reply on the implementation of  the confidence-building measures. Mr. Feissel said that he and  Denktas reviewed the Vienna meetings as well as the current  state of affairs in the Cyprus issue.    Mr. Feissel further noted: I told Mr. Denktas that the  preparation of the UN secretary general's report is in progress.  He also said that he has sent material that will help the  secretary general to prepare the report which, as Mr. Feissel  noted, should be issued in mid-April. Mr. Feissel added that he  will keep in touch with Rauf Dentkas. Responding to a question,  he said that he is not going to send any more material to New  York on the current situation.    Asked whether there was progress in Vienna--as Denktas,  Ulucevik, and Madden had maintained in their statements--Mr.  Feissel said: What is important is not progress or whether  progress was made in Vienna but achieving agreement on the  confidence-building measures package. This is what we worked  for and this is our goal, because we will either reach an  agreement or fail. Responding to another question, he said that  again today there was no agreement, adding that today they and  Rauf Denktas discussed many aspects of the packet, which he  described as useful. He further noted that the secretary  general's report will be ready by next week. He said that  Denktas asked that they keep in touch, and added that until the  secretary general issues his report Denktas has an opportunity  to give a positive reply.</p>

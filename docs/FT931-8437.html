			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Kodak to build Pounds 16m factory KODAK, the US-based photo-graphic and office equipment supplier, is investing Pounds 16m in a new factory on Merseyside after deciding against alternative sites in France and Germany, Alan Cane writes. The factory is expected to create 40 jobs in the area and will make toner, the fine black powder used to produce photocopied images, for customers throughout Europe. At present, Kodak manufactures toner in the US and ships it to Europe. The new plant will be located on Kodak's existing 37-acre site at Knowsley Industrial Park, where it has been manufacturing photographic chemicals since 1949. Construction will begin in the spring. The Department of Trade and Industry helped to secure a regional development grant of Pounds 700,000 towards the cost of the project.</p>

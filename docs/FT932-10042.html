			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Continental customers balk at paying UK company bills BRITISH companies are finding it increasingly difficult to persuade Continental European customers to pay their bills on time - or at all. One in five UK companies lost money as a result of non-payment by an EC customer in the year ended March, compared with one in eight in the 12 months ended March 1989, according to a survey published yesterday by NCM, a credit insurance company. UK exporters must be cautious about seizing export opportunities in the EC because of the growing risk of default or late payment, NCM warned. The position in Germany has worsened markedly and even blue-chip companies in some sectors face severe difficulties in making payments, said Ms Conni Randall, NCM business strategy director. News of the growing risk of doing business with other EC countries came the day after a study by Manchester Business School for National Westminster Bank showed that UK companies had difficulties obtaining payment from domestic customers. Customers in all the main EC countries were more likely to default on payment than previously, the NCM survey showed. One in 11 companies supplying customers in France experienced non-payment compared with one in 14 four years earlier. One in 25 companies experienced a default in Germany compared with one in 35 previously. Payments delayed significantly longer than was normal in individual industry sectors rose by 63 per cent to an all-time high of Pounds 90m in 1992-93 against Pounds 54m previously. Delayed payments from Germany rose by 136 per cent and from Italy by 115 per cent. In contrast with the gloomy conclusions of the NCM and NatWest surveys, payment delays in the UK are declining, according to the latest quarterly review by the Association of British Factors and Discounters. The average time taken to collect debts dropped to 57 days at the end of March from 62 days at the beginning of the year.

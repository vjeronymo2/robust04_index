			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Chancellor gets back to basics: The reasons behind yesterday's base rate cut and its implications for economic policy It was an interest rate cut that caught the City by surprise. Just before 10 o'clock yesterday morning, the Bank of England was forced into the unusual position of declaring a minimum lending rate of 6 per cent because discount houses were not anticipating cheaper borrowing costs in their dealings with the Bank. But the Bank's move, which immediately triggered cuts in clearing bank base rates from 7 per cent to 6 per cent, should have come as no shock. Since the beginning of the year, economists and commentators in Britain had been calling increasingly for a decisive lowering of UK base rates amid faltering signs of economic recovery and news of sharply rising unemployment. In the event, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, went half-way to meeting the more radical of those calls: for a cut in base rates to 5 per cent. There was some puzzlement yesterday as to why Mr Lamont had not cut rates last week after Thursday's news of a jump in unemployment in December, or the previous week when the government reported that the annual rate of retail price inflation had fallen to 2.6 per cent last month. It seems likely that the chancellor waited for signs that the foreign exchange markets would accept a new rate cut without unceremoniously dumping sterling. In other respects, his move, decided in principle last week in talks with Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank of England governor, and in consultation with Mr John Major, the prime minister, is a calculated gamble. The government is hoping that the latest cut - the fourth one-point reduction since Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism in September - will give consumers the confidence to spend and businesses encouragement to invest while keeping underlying inflation below its 4 per cent target ceiling. By cutting rates a full percentage point to their lowest level since 1977, the government has almost certainly ruled out any further easing of monetary policy before the Budget on March 16. Whether a further reduction is announced around the time of the Budget will depend partly on monetary conditions at the time but more on the fiscal stance that the government adopts. With independent forecasters now pointing to a public sector borrowing requirement of more than Pounds 50bn in 1993-94, some analysts suggested that yesterday's move may be part of a rebalancing of policy in which the government might start cutting its fiscal deficits in the coming financial year rather than in the second of this year's Budgets in December. While the fiscal counterpart to yesterday's monetary easing remains obscure, it was clear that the authorities feel they have more leeway regarding inflation than they could have hoped for at the time of the last interest rate cut in November. At the same time, concern has grown about the gap between capacity and output in the economy and the near certainty that unemployment will top the 3m level this month. The December jobless statistics were shocking not only for the seasonally adjusted 60,800 increase in the numbers of unemployed claiming benefit but also for the fact that the average monthly change, whether measured over three or six months, is rising after nearly three years of recession. In his statement yesterday justifying the rate cut, Mr Lamont showed that he is paying far more attention to what is actually happening in the economy than to confidence indicators. As reasons for the move, he cited: Monday's reports of slow growth in bank and building society lending and a fall in broad money in December, which brought growth in M4, the government's chosen broad money measure, below its 4 to 8 per cent monitoring range for this year. The 0.7 per cent fall in seasonally adjusted retail sales last month. Falling pay settlements in the autumn and the drop in manufacturers' unit wage costs to 0.5 per cent annual rate of growth in November. Continuing falls in house prices over the past two months. Weak price rises at the factory gate, with producer output inflation (excluding food, drink and tobacco) of 2.4 per cent in November and December  -its lowest level since April 1969. Although manufacturers' input prices rose by a seasonally adjusted 7 per cent between August and November, they fell marginally in December. The chancellor ignored anecdotal and survey evidence that had persuaded some observers that a rate cut was not in the offing until the Budget. Although officials have welcomed recent reports of increased business optimism from the British Chambers of Commerce and the Confederation of British Industry and the latest Gallup poll pointing to some recovery in consumer confidence, these indicators have signalled false dawns in the past. They are no longer considered a reliable basis for policy change. There was, however, some debate between the Treasury and the Bank about whether the cut should have been limited to 0.5 percentage points and so in line with practice before Black (or White) Wednesday. One argument in favour of a more cautious cut was the rise in December of underlying inflation, as measured by the retail prices index minus mortgage interest payments, to 3.7 per cent from 3.6 per cent and therefore close to the top of the 1 to 4 per cent target band announced by Mr Lamont last October. Officials admit that the underlying inflation measure is likely to 'flirt' with the 4 per cent target limit over the coming year. But it is hoped that a steeper than expected downward trend in domestic cost pressures should prevent underlying inflation breaching the barrier in spite of higher imported goods costs following devaluation. The low growth in unit wage costs and the recent decline in wage settlements to just over 3 per cent are hopeful signs that inflationary pressures are so low as to justify the full one-point rate cut. But if the government is to meet its longer-term objective of price stability - defined as zero to 2 per cent underlying inflation - wage settlements will have to be lower still and unit labour costs falling. There is a reasonable chance of wage inflation continuing to ease as negotiators focus on the headline rate of retail price inflation, which is likely to continue downwards from December's 2.6 per cent as yesterday's mortgage rate cuts and those that took effect earlier this month feed into the index. However, the debate over a 0.5 per cent cut suggests that the authorities will be increasingly cautious about reducing interest rates further from current levels, and that credence should be given to yesterday's health warning that rates will rise again if inflationary pressures reappear. What remains uncertain is the impact that the latest rate cuts will have on activity. Opposition politicians were predictably sceptical yesterday. Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor, said the government would 'have to do far more on employment and industry to ensure substantial recovery'. Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman, argued that 'only government-led investment leading to real contracts is likely to get industry moving'. The Treasury calculates that the latest rate cut should lower industry's interest burden by about Pounds 1.25bn this year and brings to about Pounds 11bn per year the reduction on interest costs of successive rate cuts since October 1990. Monthly payments on an average Pounds 33,000 mortgage should fall by about Pounds 15, leaving the householder Pounds 160 a month better off than 27 months ago. The government hopes that by putting such funds at the disposal of companies and households, it can break through the vicious circle of rising unemployment, weak demand, falling activity, increased business failures and still higher unemployment. Another aim is to inject some life into a housing market crippled by falling prices, repossessions and negative equity. There are already some encouraging signs, including a rise in inquiries at estate agents, reports of retail sales growth this month and strong growth of cash and bank notes in circulation. Interest rates of 6 per cent should be good for activity. But after so many false dawns, only the brave would predict the end of Britain's longest post-war recession.</p>

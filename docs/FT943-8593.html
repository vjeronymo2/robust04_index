			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei records its lowest volume in three months Tokyo Share prices closed off early highs on a round of late selling as volume dropped to its lowest level in three months with many investors remaining on holiday, agencies report from Tokyo. Analysts added that activity was also dulled ahead of today's US Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The Nikkei 225 average finished at the session's low with a decline of 37.50 at 20,626.33 after a day's high of 20,747.45. Volume amounted to 152m shares, the smallest since May 2 when 132m were traded. The Topix index of all first section stocks was finally 0.60 up at 1,652.38, while the Nikkei 300 lost 0.05 at 300.15. Advancing issues led declines by 462 to 438, with 235 stocks unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 1.50 at 1,337.95. Investors were also awaiting the auction of shares in Japan Tobacco which begins today. The Finance Ministry is inviting bids for 230,000 JT shares between today and Thursday. The stock is due to be listed on October 27. Analysts hoped that the listing of Japan Tobacco would revitalise stock market activity, although some institutional investors were less enthusiastic, while brokers remarked that few foreign investors seemed to be interested in the issue at all. The main advancing sectors were airlines, steels, non-life insurance, banks and communications. Steel shares were firmer on small-lot buying: Kobe Steel, which attracted the day's second highest volume, appreciated Y6 to Y320, while NKK added Y3 at Y285, Kawasaki Steel Y4 at Y418 and Nippon Steel Y1 at Y372. Chemicals issues rose on overseas buying and expectations of increasing demand for the products. Ube Industries gained Y12 at Y419 and Sumitomo Chemical Y4 at Y554. Roundup Elections, or the prospect of them, weighed on New Zealand and Sri Lanka, while other markets in the region awaited today's US FOMC meeting. WELLINGTON held on to its morning gains to close 1.24 per cent up as the market celebrated the government's by-election victory on Saturday. The NZSE-40 index put on 25.7 at 2,097.64, just under the day's peak of 2,102.41. With the election out of the way, analysts now expect shares to rally in the coming months, but they add that the continuing political uncertainty, and the change to a proportional representation voting system, could hinder progress. Telecom rose 10 cents to NZDollars 5.00, but Goodman Fielder fell 9 cents to NZDollars 1.66 after the US-based food group Phillip Morris announced that it had no plans to buy Goodman. COLOMBO ended marginally lower as investors awaited today's general election. The all-share index shed 2.73 to 1,015.03 in turnover of SLRs100m, against Friday's SLRs124m. Trading is to be restricted today to one 90-minute session. SYDNEY was slightly firmer as investors braced themselves for a rise in official interest rates. The All Ordinaries index edged up 3.8 to 2,055.7 in modest turnover of 121.8m shares. BHP put on 10 cents at ADollars 19.44. HONG KONG saw low activity as investors awaited half-year results from HSBC Holdings, which were released after the close of business. The Hang Seng index was up 21.57 at 9,488.57 after touching 9,544.47. Turnover fell to HKDollars 2.18bn from Friday's HKDollars 3.35bn. HSBC, which ended 50 cents firmer at HKDollars 92, reported a 24 per cent increase in half-year pre-tax profits, at the upper end of analysts' expectations. The H share index, made up of Chinese incorporated companies, went against the trend, falling 15.22 to 1,336.89. BANGKOK rallied in heavy trade on institutional buying of blue chips. The SET index rose 27.92, nearly 2 per cent, to 1,453.41 in Bt13.5bn turnover. Some analysts reported that institutional interest had been spurred by good second-quarter results, particularly from the communications sector. Shinawatra jumped Bt48 to Bt768 after revealing a 91 per cent leap in first-half profits to Bt1.21bn. KUALA LUMPUR dipped on profit-taking, the composite index shedding 12.49 to 1,092.80. Volume shrank to 267m shares from 556m. Falls led rises by 296 to 140. Linatex moved ahead MDollars 1.40 to MDollars 15.90 after the Securities Commission approved its purchase of two banks and a securities firm. SINGAPORE fell back as profit-taking in over-the-counter stocks spilled over into the broader market. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 16.04 down at 2,301.75 in turnover of SDollars 518m. Brokers said that OTC shares, which mainly comprise Malaysian companies, had led the market higher in recent sessions and were pulled back following losses yesterday on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange. Among the main movers, Singapore Press Holdings lost 40 cents at SDollars 16.60. TAIPEI weakened on a late round of selling which eroded earlier gains. The weighted index fell 20.34 to 6,543.57, off an intraday high of 6,614.11. Turnover was TDollars 50.76bn. KARACHI finished lower in thin, cautious trading ahead of today's settlement day. The KSE index fell 27.16 to 2,271.25, a loss of 1.2 per cent. MANILA ended 1.41 down at 3,005 after profit-taking cut short an early climb.</p>

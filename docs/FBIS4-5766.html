			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN survey, 68  percent of lower house Diet members believe that politicians,  rather than bureaucrats, should make decisions on policies. The  results of the survey of all lower house Diet members regarding  the Japanese bureaucratic system indicates that politicians are  unhappy about the current relationship between themselves and  bureaucrats. In a similar survey on bureaucrats which NIHON  KEIZAI SHIMBUN conducted last November, 66 percent of  bureaucrats said that they approved of the practice of  bureaucrats making policy decisions. Thus, the results of the  two surveys clearly indicate that politicians and bureaucrats  hold different views.    As for the balance of power between politicians and  bureaucrats after the inauguration of the coalition government,  51 percent of lower house members said that "bureaucrats have  become stronger." In last November's survey, only 22 percent of  bureaucrats gave the same answer. This indicates that  politicians are more conscious than bureaucrats of bureaucratic  domination. As for why they feel bureaucrats have become  stronger, 45 percent of lower house members said "Diet members  from the ruling coalition parties are inexperienced," while 29  percent said that "the coalition government has a weak  foundation." Thus, its seems that a majority of them believe  the problem lies in the lack of political leadership.    As for bureaucrats' current profile, 77 percent of lower  house members said that they feel either "dissatisfied" or  "slightly dissatisfied." In this regard, many politicians say  that "changes should be made so that politicians can make policy  decisions."    On the other hand, 42 percent of bureaucrats say "nothing  can  be done about bureaucratic initiative," and 24 percent say that  "the current system under which bureaucrats make policy  decisions is more effective."    Asked which government ministry or agency has become more  powerful since the establishment of the coalition government, a  significant number of politicians cited the Ministry of Finance.    As for a plan proposed by Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] secretary general, to designate Diet members as  vice ministers and administrative vice ministers for each  government ministry and agency, 62 percent of lower house  members approved of the idea. However, while a majority of  lower house members from Ozawa's very own Shinseito completely  endorse this idea, many members from the Social Democratic Party  of Japan and Komeito [Clean Government Party] are cautious about  it. Thus, there are mixed views among the ruling coalition  parties regarding this idea.    As to which government ministries or agencies were  considered  to be unnecessary, the Hokkaido Development Agency landed at the  top of the list. The Okinawa Development Agency ranked second,  followed by the National Land Agency. Fourth on the list was  the Economic Planning Agency, which has lost face because of its  poor showing in making economic forecasts and which has been  criticized as being excessively influenced by the Finance  Ministry.    Asked what they felt was lacking among politicians, nearly  half of the lower house members cited "knowledge regarding  policies and a willingness to study the subject."    As to what they felt was lacking among bureaucrats, many  politicians cited "a broad perspective" and "flexibility."</p>

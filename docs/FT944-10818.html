			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Recruitment: Time to spread the jam more evenly - Doubts linger over merit of executive share options as incentive or performance yardstick Are UK companies justified in persisting with Inland Revenue approved executive share option schemes when the argument for their retention as an incentive has grown progressively weaker during the past 10 years? At the time they were introduced in the 1984 budget, Nigel Lawson, then Chancellor of the Exchequer said he was convinced of the 'need to attract top calibre company management and to increase the incentives and motivations of existing executives and key personnel by linking their reward to performance.' With the top marginal income tax rate of 60 per cent and 30 per cent capital gains tax that existed at the time, there was considerable attraction among boardrooms in introducing such schemes. They converted income into a capital gain and the cost of them was borne by shareholders in diluted equity and did not impact on the company's profit and loss account. Without hesitating to consider whether or not what they were doing was fair, both to shareholders and to other employees who did not - although the rules would have allowed it - benefit from such schemes, companies clamoured to introduce them to such an extent that now some 90 per cent of publicly listed UK companies have Revenue-approved share option schemes, mainly for directors and senior executives. Today, with the top marginal tax rate at 40 per cent, the same rate as capital gains tax, the tax advantage is less important. That has done little, however to stem enthusiasm for renewing schemes as many come to the end of their 10 year life. A newly published study of executive share options, by Incomes Data Services Management Pay Review, suggests that probably the most important reason for renewing schemes is that companies dare not retreat from what has become the market norm. 'Any company knows that it would be out of line with market practice if it jettisoned its option scheme, even if it was replaced with an alternative long term incentive,' says IDS. It quotes a conclusion by the board of Inchcape that failure to renew its scheme would have hindered its ability to recruit outside executives. The Labour Party says it will end income tax relief on options, but it seems doubtful whether that in itself will be enough to end the practice of paying them. Whether it would be applied on options already issued but not exercised is still unclear. While Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor has estimated that an extra Pounds 200m a year will be collected in tax revenue, it represents only 1.3 per cent of the Pounds 15bn that Labour suggests is the annual value of shares taken in options. That figure, however, is disputed. Some put it at less than half that amount. The main effect of ending income tax relief would be to make income tax due when the shares are exercised rather than CGT when they are sold. Given that only five per cent of executives have continued to hold their options beyond the three-year minimum period, the biggest significance of this would probably be the loss of the annual Pounds 5,800 tax free allowance for CGT. Perhaps the greatest unfairness to all other employees who did not benefit from the award of share options is that the options were introduced on top of salaries and not instead of some portion of existing executive reward. They were an unearned bonus that carried no risk whatsoever. It was like winning the football pools without having to fill in the coupon. Neither were they related to the performance of companies. Only if the company did badly was there no point in exercising options. IDS says: 'Executives could make large sums even if the share price rise had more to do with inflation and a general rise in the stock market than with their personal contribution. In some instances, poor company performance could lead to takeover speculation and share price growth, thereby giving a reward for bad results.' The volatility of share prices has made options at times something of a lottery. It was possible, for example, for a chief executive to be awarded options to buy shares when the market was high and yet for a less senior manager to enter the company and obtain options when the market was comparatively low, thus benefitting more than the company boss. Tarmac is one company which experienced unintended consequences. In its letter to shareholders in May, it observed that many of the options granted to its executives under the existing approved scheme provided no effective incentive to management because the exercise prices were fixed at a high level in a different economic climate. 'Further, their existence discriminates against longer-serving executives who have played a key role in the recent turnaround in the fortunes of the group,' said the company. In most cases, however, options have resulted in substantial gains. The IDS calculates that the median profit from options exercised in the last three years has varied from between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 60,000. Among the highest profits under the UK arrangements found in the study were Pounds 2m and Pounds 1.7m made respectively by two directors of Glaxo Holdings in 1991, and Pounds 1.3m and Pounds 1.1m made by two directors of Smith New Court in 1993. In the same year, Clive Thompson, chief executive of Rentokil, made Pounds 2.8m from exercising options. Sir John Egan, the chief executive of BAA, last year netted Pounds 1.6m from share options. That is dwarfed, however, by the sums paid out in the US, home of the share or stock option. Michael Eisner, Walt Disney's chairman and chief executive officer, realised Dollars 203m, equivalent to the gross national product of Grenada, when he exercised stock options in 1993. The intrinsic invalidity of such schemes has begun to be accepted in some companies. Reuters, Courtaulds and GEC have discarded their option schemes in the past year and replaced them with alternative long-term incentive arrangements. Sir Christopher Hogg, the chairman of Reuters, has called the assumption of a tight linkage between management performance and share price 'fallacious'. Under pressure from institutional investors' organisations, most renewed schemes have introduced performance conditions which must be met before options can be exercised, the most common of which is that growth in earnings per share should be two per cent above inflation each year over three years. Another trend is to phase options in with smaller annual grants. Very few companies have made schemes more equitable among all employees. Wellcome and ALPHA Airports Group, have introduced all-employee share option schemes that qualify under the same tax rules as the typical executive share option plan. The Inland Revenue does not specify that the schemes should be limited to executives. It is arguable that such schemes, in addition to being fairer, have greater tax merits for less highly paid employees. While all can take advantage of the annual Capital Gains Tax exemption, senior executives might be expected to have greater overall capital gains, making the exemption proportionally less meaningful to them. As Sir Bryan Nicholson, the president of the Confederation of British Industry, this week joined in the criticism of large boardroom pay rises, arguing that business leaders have a 'clear responsibility, moral and political, to set an example on pay discipline,' it is perhaps time for companies to address honestly a fundamental question about share options: what purpose do they serve?

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Civil servant's exit sparks sharp reaction THERE WAS sharp reaction yesterday to the news that Sir Peter Kemp, the top civil servant spearheading the government's Civil Service reforms, had been forced into early retirement. Sir Peter, permanent secretary at the Office of Public Service and Science, is to retire in September, two years before the normal Civil Service retirement age of 60. He is leaving after being told that there was no longer a job for him to do. The Association of First Division Civil Servants (FDA) said yesterday that many members would be 'astounded' at the news. His work in establishing 75 executive agencies in which more than half the Civil Service now worked had been 'an unprecedented achievement'. Mr Giles Radice, the senior Labour member of the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee, said Sir Peter's departure was the result of 'outrageous manoeuvring'. 'This is clearly a case of Peter Kemp's face not fitting,' he said. 'To boot out this highly capable and energetic civil servant in this manner is very shabby treatment.' Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister who is responsible for the Civil Service, is understood to want a new head for his department, which was created after the general election. The department is in charge of the Citizen's Charter, along with the programme of contracting out Civil Service work and the creation of executive agencies to deliver government services. Mr Radice said that the announcement of Sir Peter's departure had been delayed until the parliamentary recess to avoid questioning by MPs. He intended to question Mr Waldegrave about the matter when the minister appeared before the select committee in the autumn. Sir Peter's successor as head of the OPSS is to be Mr Richard Mottram, the deputy secretary at the Ministry of Defence. Mr Mottram, who is 47, has been in charge of the 'options for change' programme to cut the UK armed forces. He was private secretary to both Sir John Nott and Mr Michael Heseltine when they were at the Defence Ministry. Also announced yesterday was the appointment of Sir Geoffrey Holland as permanent secretary at the Education Department when Sir John Caines retires in January 1993. Sir Geoffrey, at present permanent secretary at the Employment Department, was director of the Manpower Services Commission between 1981 and 1988. The new head of the Employment Department will be Mr Nick Monck, second permanent secretary at the Treasury. Mr Andrew Turnbull, principal private secretary to Mrs Thatcher and Mr Major, will succeed Mr Monck. Observer, Page 17</p>

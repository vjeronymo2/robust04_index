			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Drinks active With the results season about to get under way, the drinks sector attracted plenty of speculative buying but little overall volume. NatWest Securities attempted to pre-empt proceedings, reiterating its positive stance on Allied-Lyons, ahead 11 at 583p, and Scottish &amp; Newcastle, up 9 at 530p. Another NatWest favourite, Grand Metropolitan, was once again the subject of speculation over the fate of its Inntrepreneur pub subsidiary, run as a joint venture with Courage. Suggestions that GrandMet will use its results on Thursday to announce that Inntrepreneur may be broken up, or even floated, were not believed by all analysts. GrandMet jumped 16 to 483p. Guinness, subject to persistent activity on inter-dealer broking screens, was in focus with a big order in the options market. The stock edged up 2 1/2 to 484p. Market gossip circulated around Wembley, the indebted stadium group, with talk of a predator waiting in the wings. Speculation that the company would be willing to sell its Wembley stadium showpiece was denied by the company. The shares added 1 1/2 at 12p. Rank Organisation was one name linked to Wembley. The shares slid 9 to 408p, with Hoare Govett said to be making negative noises. There was disappointment over the share reorganisation at Associated British Foods, where some in the market had hoped for either a share buyback or a big acquisition to put the company's large cash pile to work. Instead, the company is offering a special dividend of 10p to shareholders. The stock retreated 15 to 584p. Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo was easier in early trade on speculation in the Sunday press that it was poised to take a stake in or buy McKesson, a US drugs wholesaler. The shares rallied later to close a penny off at 562p. Both companies refused to comment on the rumours, fuelled by the latest deal between SmithKline Beecham and DPS, of the US. SmithKline, which filed a suit against a US group, saying it would violate trademark laws with a launch planned for next week of a form of Tagamet, the ulcer drug, put on 3 at 397p. Healthcare company Smith &amp; Nephew held firm at 147 1/2 p after announcing a US joint venture deal. British Gas rallied to end the session 1 1/2 firmer at 285p after the joint report on gas pricing prepared by the Department of Trade and Industry was published yesterday. Oil shares made strong progress, buoyed by recent gains in crude oil prices and ahead of expected good results from Royal Dutch/Shell tomorrow. BP touched a record 412p before closing 6 1/2 up at 409 1/2 p. Shell added 7 at 739p and Enterprise Oil 13 at 444p. Courtaulds fell 16 to 533p as one leading securities house issued a sell note. A broker's recommendation boosted Avon Rubber ahead of tomorrow's interim figures. The shares rose 8 to 637p, with Panmure Gordon urging investors to buy the stock. Bus company Go-Ahead made an impressive market debut. The shares were issued at 120p, opened at 126p and closed at 125p. Weekend press reports suggesting Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel is planning to build another tunnel through which travellers will be able to drive cars hit the shares and they tumbled 28 to 422p. Coats Viyella saw heavy turnover of 4.3m shares in the run-up to an auction of around Pounds 11m of scrip dividend shares by BZW. The stock eased a penny to 228p. USM-quoted Phonelink, the computing services company, fell 46 to 384p on profit taking.</p>

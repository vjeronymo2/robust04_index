			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / UK Company News: BET profits may be slashed under accounting guidelines PRE-TAX profits at BET, the business services group, could have been almost wiped out by exceptional charges when the group reports its annual figures on Monday. Profit are expected to have fallen from Pounds 215m in the year to March 1991 to about Pounds 110m before exceptional charges which the highest market estimates place at about Pounds 50m. Due to changes in accounting treatment introduced by Mr Robert Mackenzie, the new finance director, exceptional charges could be almost double this figure. The market is already expecting a halved total dividend, which will barely be covered by earnings, following a tough year in joinery, personnel and plant hire. Mr Mackenzie joined BET in December and is understood to have chosen to make substantial write-downs in the value of net assets such as plant and buildings above the line. The majority of the exceptional items are believed to be non-cash items. BET is one of the first sizeable companies to report using new guidelines suggested by the Urgent Issues task force of the Accounting Standards Board. As a result it is likely to be reporting extremely large extraordinary charges relating to goodwill previously written off on acquisition of businesses which now has to be passed back through the profit an loss account when those businesses are subsequently sold. This treatment is designed to demonstrate the true profit or loss on sales of businesses. Since Mr Nicholas Wills resigned as chief executive in April 1991, Mr John Clark, his replacement, and the new team have been trying to reverse the errors that led BET in 1991 to its first earnings decline in a decade.</p>

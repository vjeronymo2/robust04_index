			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of Madeira (5): Relocating costs Labour costs in Madeira vary according to industry, but they are generally low by European Union standards. Annual wages for unskilled labour are in the region of Es500,000 (Pounds 2,000), and roughly double for skilled workers. Most workers are covered by employer-union labour agreements, but this is not a legal requirement. Social costs are high. The employer's contribution is 24.5 per cent of basic salary, while the employee pays 11 per cent, but there are concessions during training periods and for younger workers. Overtime is usually payable at a rate of 150 per cent for the first hour, and 175 per cent thereafter. Overtime worked during rest days is double the basic salary. There are some few variations on vacation periods, but employees generally are entitled to one month's holiday a year, plus some 14 additional days covering statutory holidays. Residence permits for non-Portuguese employees are easily obtained, provided they come from other European Union countries, or are nationals of countries with which Portugal has close relations. These include the US, Brazil and Sweden. Office rents: rates in Funchal range from Es15,000 to Es30,000 a square metre per annum, depending on location. House rents: these again depend on location, monthly charges varying between Es100,000 and Es150,000. A large apartment in a prime site could run to Es200,000. Buying a house: a four-bedroom apartment in a good location in Funchal could cost Es30m or more.</p>

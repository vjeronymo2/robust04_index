			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Arts: Sibelius symphony cycle - Concert If the music of the North is an art borne of isolation in defiance of the hostile elements of wind and cold, then Sibelius is its prime creator. No other composer from the Northernmost reaches of Europe has equalled his standing and there must be some measure of satisfaction in Britain that his early international reputation was to a large degree won here. The 'Tender is the North' festival, devoted to Scandinavian arts, conveniently stretches its boundaries to include Finland as well. It is difficult to imagine the musical side of it without Sibelius. The Finnish composer's seven symphonies are the most significant single corpus of work to have come from the North and a complete cycle of them, by Colin Davis and the London Symphony Orchestra, is a major feature of the festival. The best of the symphonies are concise in form, concentrated in thought. Yet all the vast expanses of Finland's forests and lakes seem to be there. Thomas Beecham, who was one of the foremost early interpreters of Sibelius's music, grasped this essence of their style as if it was second nature and was able to inflect every smallest detail without taking away from the broader design. Davis is more of a landscape Sibelian, although that should not be taken to mean that his performances lack intensity. In the opening concert of the cycle at the Barbican on Thursday, both the symphonies on the programme - Nos 3 and 1 in that order - had drive. Davis really digs into the rhythms, giving us a tough and determined Sibelius, unafraid of underlining the music emphatically. Even the slighter Third Symphony had a weightier mass than usual, while the skies in both loomed dark and lowering - a commendably atmospheric start to the cycle, aided by above average playing from the LSO. The most intimate contact with Sibelius, however, was made elsewhere. In between the symphonies Karita Mattila sang a beautiful and heartfelt performance of Luonnotar. This tone-poem for soprano and orchestra is ostensibly about the world's creation, as viewed by the Finnish national epic (the Kalevala), but in it Sibelius is surely plumbing the depths of his inspiration to say what it is that made him and his music the very voice of Finland. In a festival of this kind the lesser-known pieces are always the most valuable. Another concert two days earlier had thrown up a couple of interesting smaller items. The Clarinet Concerto by the Danish Carl Nielsen is never music of place in the way that makes Sibelius so easy to visualise in terms of nationality, climate, temperament, but its neo-classical manners can be pleasing enough if played with as much spirit as here by Emma Johnson. Paavo Berglund and the English Chamber Orchestra had also opened the concert with a recent (1986) piece by Aulis Sallinen, his Chamber Music III, sub-titled The Nocturnal Dances of Don Juanquixote. This is a fairly light entertainment for cello solo, taken by Arto Noras, and string orchestra, in which various places mingle: American jazz, Spanish dances, chilly Northern textures. A Finnish composer in the late 20th century is an international figure. Concerts sponsored by Union Bank of Finland and Ernst &amp; Young</p>

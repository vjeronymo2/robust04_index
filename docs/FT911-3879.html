			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Discrimination decline is seen in Ulster employment NORTHERN Ireland's new fair-employment laws are beginning to reduce religious discrimination in the workplace, Mr Bob Cooper, chairman of the province's Fair Employment Commission, said yesterday. Mr Cooper's comments followed publication of the commission's first broad religious profile of the Ulster workforce, based on information from all public and private-sector companies employing more than 25 workers. The data cover almost 350,000 people - about two thirds of the province's workforce. The breakdown showed that 61 per cent of those employed were Protestant and 33 per cent Roman Catholic. A further 6 per cent were described by the commission as 'non-determined'. The commission estimates the total working population to be about 62 per cent Protestant and 38 per cent Roman Catholic. Although the figures generally suggest the numbers of Roman Catholics in jobs are almost in line with those available for work, the small percentage variation has a significant difference on unemployment rates. Male Roman Catholics remain twice as likely as Protestants to be unemployed with under-representation and are particularly under-represented in senior positions. Roman Catholics are also under-represented in the public sector, where their they are reluctant to apply for jobs with the security forces. Profile of the Workforce.

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Fatal weakness in the Irish body politic: In a crisis, a minister is almost certain to fall As the scale of Ireland's political crisis this week began to sink in, Irish commentators were yesterday leafing through their files trying to make sense of the mess. Was it really on a scale with the beef sales scandal, the 1990 presidential election bugging affair or the 1970s Haughey arms scandal, as the newspapers suggested? Or is Ireland simply afflicted with an inability to make coalition government work? To the outsider, the break-up of the third coalition in as many years is all the more surprising given what has been a commendable record on the economy, an apparently harmonious approach to difficult social policy reforms and a key breakthrough in Northern Ireland, where the outgoing prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, was largely instrumental in helping to secure an IRA ceasefire. In the pandemonium that gripped the Dail, the Irish parliament, this week, there was something of an inevitability that the Chinese whispers wafting from the chamber would lead to the government's break-up. As more and more emerged of the row that was sparked by Mr Reynolds' appointment of his attorney-general, Mr Harry Whelehan, as president of the High Court, a move bitterly criticised by his Labour party coalition partner, the question was not if but when it would happen. What did it in the end was the resignation as deputy prime minister of Mr Dick Spring, the Labour party leader, on Wednesday. Mr Spring accused Mr Reynolds of misleading him and the Dail about the failure of Mr Whelehan's department to act for seven months on a request from British-ruled Northern Ireland for the extradition of a priest who was later convicted of child sex-abuse. But it was more than that issue alone. With a population of 3.5m people, about that of a medium-sized European city, Ireland has politics with a special type of intimacy. The Charlies and Alberts who run the country's political parties are household names in a way quite different from much of Europe's politicians. Ireland also has a relatively small civil service. It is not so easy for a politician to hide behind his official, though Mr Reynold as a last resort, in perhaps his most tragic pose, did his best. What is perhaps more important is that in the neighbouring UK for instance, a row like this would more than likely have been absorbed somewhere within the bureaucracy, by the creation of an inquiry or commission or by the removal of a minor official. In Ireland, when a crisis breaks, it seems almost a given that a government minister will fall. Part of the problem lies with the character of the Fianna Fail leadership. The party, which for almost 40 years until 1973 ruled with a series of majority governments, has since had to contemplate the need for coalitions - an experience which, as recent events underline, has been far from easy. The imperatives of accommodation and compromise have been difficult to reconcile with Fianna Fail's corporatist can-do image and its back-room dealing. The reasons go to the heart of its identity. For Fianna Fail is not so much a party as a political movement. The comparison often made is with Gaullism in France. Traditionally, the party has been a broad church, an alliance of interest groups, including business and labour, underpinned by a strong republican ideology. But today, with the rural vote base eroded as people move off the land, so the electorate has become more difficult to please. The large number of parties in Ireland - six of some size are now represented in the Dail - underscores the breakdown of the old political loyalties and the dramatic social and demographic changes that have taken place in the last two decades. Mr Reynolds is the last of the old school of Fianna Fail leaders. His successor - Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, last night seemed the favourite to win if the parliamentary party's poll goes ahead tomorrow as planned - will be under increasing pressure to show that the party can live by its coalition undertakings. Yesterday there was some bitterness in Fianna Fail circles that Mr Spring had openly schemed for the prime minister's downfall. Such is the breakdown in trust between Fianna Fail and the other parties that many of its MPs last night seemed prepared for a period in opposition. Mr Reynolds had made clear to the house, in his defence on Tuesday, that 'good government must be decisive'. His error was not to have made the decision to appoint the attorney general, as he then argued, but to proceed without having brought Labour on board. The facts are still a little hazy. Even at the last hour, as Mr Spring made clear, the government could have been saved. In the end it was a morning telephone conversation with the new attorney general, which revealed that the prime minister had misled the Dail, which sealed the coalition's fate. As P J Mara, a well known voice in Irish politics and one-time adviser of Mr Haughey, said: 'I'm deeply saddened. A generic sadness.'</p>

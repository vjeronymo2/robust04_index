			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Linda Choy] </F>   [Text] The management of ATV yesterday backed down from  its refusal to screen a documentary on the Beijing massacre,  after journalists resigned over the station's self-censorship.  Executives pledged to "return" to the News and Public Affairs  Department the power to decide whether the film would be shown  as planned on Saturday night, the fifth anniversary of the  military crushing of the pro-democracy movement. Chief  Executive Officer Mark Lee Po-on told the journalists who had  resigned that the news team were to "have the final say" on the  matter.    But the six -- all holding key positions in the department  --  have yet to decide whether to withdraw their resignations. They  will meet the management again today to discuss questions  related to the independence of the News Division. Deputy Chief  Executive Clarence Chang Ching-po, who has overall control of  the News Division, will probably be absent from the meeting. Mr  Chang flew to Taiwan on a business trip on Monday afternoon.  His announcement last Friday morning that the film should not  be screened triggered an outcry within and outside the station  about media self-censorship in matters sensitive to China.    The 40-minute Spanish production contains about seven  minutes  of footage of the situation in Tiananmen Square between 4 am and  7 am on June 4, 1989. The film, shot from the Monument to the  People's Heroes, is the first visual record to show what  happened in the square during the three-hour news ban. It  supports the long-held version from Chinese officials that there  was no killing in the square.    The management reportedly was of the view that there was  nothing special in the film, and that it failed to show the  "overall situation" in Tiananmen Square. They also apparently  held that it would do no good to Hong Kong to discuss the issue  again. Yesterday, however, the management insisted the incident  in the newsroom had arisen from communication problems.    Mr Lee said the management and the News Division had  different views on when the Spanish production should be  scheduled. The News Division intended to screen it on the  current affairs programme News Magazine while the management  preferred it be shown in One Day, a programme looking back at  historical events. "Management has now decided to let the News  Division have the final say in this matter, by leaving it to  those in charge of the programme to decide when and how it  should best be presented," Mr Lee said.    Assistant Controller of ATV's Public Relations and Publicity  Department Lu Fung claimed that it was the management's  intention to preserve the independence of the News Division.  She insisted that the company had still been in the course of  discussion with the journalists regarding the programme when the  resignations were submitted. It had been decided to"return to  the department the rights of decision", she said. But Ms Lu did  not explain why a promotional segment of the programme had been  withheld late last Thursday.    Assistant News Controller Selina Li Yuk-lin, one of those  who  resigned on Monday, rejected the management's explanation that  the whole incident was due to a misunderstanding. "My  understanding is that at one point, a decision was made to ban  the programme," she said. Executive editor Lo Wing-hung said Mr  Chang had told the news team that the management would not  change its mind, despite the resignations. The management  offered the alternative screening in One Day only on Monday,  after she and Acting News Controller Poon Fu-yin indicated they  would resign, Ms Li said. "But the point is that it should be  up to us to decide when and how to screen programmes," she said.    Mr Poon said the news team would stick to the original plan  and run the programme at 10.30 on Saturday night, almost the  exact time the military began their crackdown five years ago.    The television station's initial decision to suspend the  programme came under fire from a number of social groups. Ten  people, including pro-democracy activist Lau Shan-ching, staged  a protest at the ATV building in Broadcast Drive, Kowloon Tong.  They shouted slogans to condemn ATV management for tampering  with the freedom of the press. Spokesman for the Hong Kong  Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in  China, Cheung Man-kwong, also criticised the move. He said the  screening would give a clearer picture of the situation in  Tiananmen Square and should not be banned for commercial or  administrative reasons.</p>

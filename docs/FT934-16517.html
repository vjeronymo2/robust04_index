			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Home starts jump by 13% BUILDERS taking advantage of the improvement in the housing market started work on 13 per cent more new homes during the first eight months of this year than in the same period last year. Figures published yesterday by the Environment Department show that work had begun on 125,600 homes by the end of August compared with 111,500 last year. The rise outstripped the improvement in the rest of the housing market which has been more sluggish. Conveyancing transactions recorded by the Inland Revenue during the first eight months rose by just 2.3 per cent to a total of 744,000. Builders have continued to offer a range of sales incentives to boost turn-over, which has meant that profit margins have remained low. Spring sales rose sharply, only to fall back over the summer. The department said starts on new homes by builders fell by 4 per cent during the three months to the end of August compared with the previous three months. However, they were 10 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year. The department's figures have been adjusted to take account of seasonal variations. Builders are hoping sales will pick up after the summer holidays. They say that comparisons with last autumn should be good because sales almost halted during the sterling crisis. Figures for August starts on new homes were 14,900 compared with 12,500 the previous August.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLOTHESLINES  </P> <P> Question: My husband works in Manhattan and is due for a new coat. He wants to  buy a Chesterfield, and I feel that style is too dressy for a lawyer with a lot  of conservative clients. Please comment. -- R.R.O.  </P> <P> Answer: Chesterfields are the comeback coat of the season in menswear. Perhaps  your husband will find this advice from the coat's namesake, 19th-Century Earl  of Chesterfield, as valid today as when it was written in 1840: "Take great  care always to be dressed like the reasonable people of your own age; in the  place where you are; whose dress is never spoken of one way or another as  either too negligent or too much studied."  </P> <P> The Chesterfield with its slight shaping and velvet collar is available in  traditional gray and navy herringbones as well as such unexpected colors as  taupe and olive.  </P> <P>  Luther, a Times syndicated columnist, welcomes questions from readers.  </P></p>

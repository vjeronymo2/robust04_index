			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Government beat Labour charge by 52 majority THE government last night secured a majority of 52 (335-283) to defeat a Labour charge that it had failed to adopt economic policies to promote industrial and commercial investment, and improve education and training. Winding up the six-day debate on the Queen's Speech, Mr Tony Newton, leader of the House, promised full consultation about procedural changes in 'the most radical shake-up to our working practices for many decades'. The government's majority soared to 314 when, with Labour MPs abstaining, a Liberal Democrat attempt to condemn the omission from the Queen's Speech of a commitment to take Sterling into the narrow band of the Exchange Rate Mechanism was defeated by 332 votes to 18.</p>

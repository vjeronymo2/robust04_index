			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHOPPING A BOTHERSOME, BEAUTIFUL TREE  </P> <P> I am writing this letter to the sound of a chain saw hacking away at a  beautiful 35-foot palm tree that only moments ago was chopped and then fell to  the ground with a deadening bang.  </P> <P> You see, the lady next door was "bothered" by this 40-something-year-old beauty  in her front yard. It had, in fact, bothered her for a long time, and so she  finally ordered it to be chopped down, hacked up and removed. She had this  done, by the way, at 9 on Sunday morning -- a day when most neighbors enjoy  sleeping in, a day free from work, free from the noise of traffic and  construction. . . . But today, many of us were awakened in horror and watched  in amazement as this tree was destroyed.  </P> <P> I wonder why it's so easy for a person to "take a contract out" on a tree,  simply because it bothered them? This tree represented no danger to any person,  home or telephone line. Does my neighbor not realize that trees allow us to  breathe purer air, a point of concern of any Los Angeles residents?  </P> <P> When a person orders a tree to be cut down, isn't there an organization that  should intervene and determine if there is indeed a sound reason for that  removal, and if not, prevent this from happening? We expect large corporations  to replant the trees they take for industry. Should this not be enforced on a  individual scale as well?  </P> <P> Yes, the tree was on her property, but it seems to me that this planet is all  of our "property" and we should be held responsible for its health, yes, even  in the case of one tree on Tujunga.  </P> <P> I am a reasonably concerned environmentalist, not a fanatic. But this morning  as I witnessed a defenseless, majestic tree lying in the middle of the road  while its trunk and limbs were being severed, I felt pained and hurt. Thanks to  my neighbor, I am becoming a fanatic.  </P> <P> SUSAN ANGELO  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH LAUDS GOVERNORS ON SCHOOLS  </P> <P> President Bush thanked the nation's governors for a bipartisan "constructive  relationship" on education Monday, even as Democrats stepped up their protest  against the Administration's latest tax proposal.  </P> <P> Bush addressed the governors at their National Governors' Assn. annual summer  conference, speaking by telephone from Washington.  </P> <P> He pledged continued support for the education reform goals he and the  governors agreed on last year, and endorsed their revised plans for a national  oversight panel that will grade the states and federal government on progress  in meeting the goals. Democrats had insisted on the changes to deny Republicans  control of the panel.  </P> <P> "I think it is essential there be some definitive way of measuring progress  toward these education goals during the '90s, and this decision . . . makes  good sense," Bush said. "I want to thank everyone there for the constructive  relationship that we've developed."  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1 MILLION MOURNERS FLOCK TO KHOMEINI'S GRAVE  </P> <P> Two Iranians died and thousands fainted as huge crowds flocked to the grave of  the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Sunday for a memorial service marking a week  since his death.  </P> <P> Iran's most powerful leaders were among the more than 1 million mourners at  Behesht-e Zahra cemetery, 10 miles south of Tehran, according to Iranian press  reports monitored in Nicosia.  </P> <P> "Soon this site will become a shrine to attract the Muslims of the world," said  Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, who broke into tears during his speech.  "This is a center which radiates heavenly light."  </P> <P> In Islam, the seventh and 40th days after death are considered a time for  special mourning rites. Free food and drink were distributed around the grave.  </P> <P> Iran's state-run television showed mourners beating their heads and chests with  clenched fists in the Shiite Muslim expression of grief and chanting,  "Khomeini, Khomeini, why did you leave us?"  </P> <P> But the atmosphere appeared calmer than during Tuesday's burial, which was  delayed for six hours after some in the hysterical crowd of 2 million tore  pieces from Khomeini's white shroud and toppled the body out of its coffin.  </P> <P> The 86-year-old patriarch died June 3 after suffering a heart attack. There  were eight deaths and 11,000 injuries in the subsequent three days of mourning.  </P> <P> On Sunday, one man died of a heart attack and another died after falling from a  cargo container used as a stand for television cameras, according to press  reports.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fainting One a Second  </P> <P> The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the mourners were so densely  packed during the afternoon ceremony that, on average, one person fainted every  second in temperatures around 96 degrees.  </P> <P> The ailing were passed hand over hand to one of 23 mobile medical units  stationed around the site, and more than 1,000 doctors and medical workers were  on duty, the news agency reported. More serious injuries were rushed to nearby  hospitals in one of 250 ambulances.  </P> <P> The television showed a protective barrier made from four metal cargo  containers to keep crowds away from the grave site.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shrine Built Overnight  </P> <P> Working through the night, young men from the Reconstruction Crusade had  hastily had lain cream-colored marble slabs, and a three-tiered shrine had  sprouted, topped by a huge golden dome and a fluttering black flag.  </P> <P> The dome over Khomeini's grave, already called the Haram-e Sharif after the  tomb of the Muslim Prophet Mohammed, is based on the famous Dome of the Rock  mosque in Jerusalem.  </P> <P> The actual grave is marked by a small, blank marble slab.  </P> <P> A permanent structure is planned to replace the temporary one erected within  days of Khomeini's death.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Weeping Mourners  </P> <P> The television showed weeping mourners gripping a metal grille built around the  structure, trying to touch and kiss the shrine, which they already consider  sacred.  </P> <P> Those unable to reach it threw clothes and other articles to the guards  standing on top of the containers. The guards touched them to the shrine and  threw them back.  </P> <P> "It would take a stone heart to stay composed at such a time," Rafsanjani said  in his speech. Khomeini's 44-year-old son, Ahmed, was reported too overcome to  speak.  </P> <P> A crop-dusting plane sprayed rosewater on the mourners, and helicopters circled  overhead, showering the crowds with flowers.  </P> <P> The agency said crowds began collecting at the grave site Saturday night and  grew to a throng almost two miles wide. There were unprecedented traffic jams  on the expressway leading to the cemetery.  </P></p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Observer: Ho ho avenue Ho Chi Minh still lives - on the streets of Calcutta. Though probably not for much longer. West Bengal state, long a bastion of Indian communism, is trying to shed its hard-line image in an effort to attract private capital. The authorities have therefore invited companies based in an electronics park to have local streets named after their founders. Siemens - which helped instal the first telegraph connection between Calcutta and London 126 years ago - was approached first. One of the few cities left in the world that still celebrates the anniversary of the Russian October revolution with posters of Marx and Lenin, Calcutta is now to have a new street - Werner von Siemens. Names of communist worthies adorning other streets are so far intact; Jyoti Basu, the veteran chief minister, must tread carefully.</p>

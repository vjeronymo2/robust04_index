			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Saving with Sipps - Planning your Pension / Schemes for company partners NIGEL LAWSON, the former chancellor, did not introduce a new type of personal pension scheme when he unveiled Self-Invested Personal Pensions (Sipps) in his 1989 Budget. He merely reinvented a concept which has been available in various forms since the 1980s. But while Sipps (and their pre-1989 variants) are unlikely to be cost effective for the man in the street, they can produce substantial cost savings for groups of individuals, such as partners in the same firm. The cost efficiency of Sipps compared with conventional policies is illustrated in the table* which shows the impact of charges using a Reduction in Premium (RIP) comparison. The RIP expresses the total charges as a percentage reduction in every premium paid. A large part of the charging structure of a conventional policy is related to the commission paid to the salesman and the RIP has therefore been calculated both on 'normal' policy terms and on nil-commission terms, using for illustration the charging structure of Standard Life's retirement annuity pension contract, ie their pre-July 1, 1988 policy. The RIP also has an impact on maturity proceeds. For example, a policy with a RIP of 14 per cent will have a maturity value of only 86 per cent of the maximum notional fund available at the selected retirement age, ie the fund which would be available if the policy was entirely free of charges. Let us suppose that partners A, B and C all effect 20 year pension policies on the same date for an annual contribution of Pounds 20,000. Partner A effects his policy with Standard Life via his insurance broker on normal commission terms, Partner B effects the same policy via a firm of consulting actuaries on nil-commission terms and Partner C effects a policy linked to his partnership Sipp. If each partner's policy achieves a rate of return before charges of 13 per cent per annum, Partner A's policy will be worth Pounds 1,612,000 and Partner C's Pounds 1,785,000. Partner C's policy has the highest value because it suffers the lowest charges. Many people will rightly suspect that one key feature of this analysis is the impact of commission on maturity proceeds. For example, the difference between the value of Partner A's policy and Partner B's is Pounds 156,000. This difference is the direct result of the commission structure. Surprisingly, the difference between Partner B's policy and Partner C's, Pounds 173,000, is even larger, indicating the substantial additional costs borne by Partners A and B as the result of the insurer's own expenses. Commission is, therefore, not the only handicap on the maturity of proceeds of conventional policies. Many pension advisers and investment managers dismiss the importance of charges and point instead to the superior investment performance of the product they are selling. This argument is realistic only when comparing 'like with like', for example, a Standard Life policy set up on normal terms compared with a Scottish Widows' policy established on the same basis. In such a case the difference in charges is likely to be slight and relatively modest differences in investment performance will tend to 'lose' these differences over time. However, the argument for ignoring charges loses weight when comparing the charges of conventional policies with Sipps. For example, in order for Partners A and B to achieve the same (or better) policy maturity proceeds than Partner C their policies must outperform Partner C's by around 1 1/2 per cent per annum and 1 per cent per annum, respectively. Over a 20-year period this is very unlikely. It is also possible to turn the outperformance argument on its head. One of the advantages of a Sipp is that it does not necessarily have to produce the best investment performance to outperform other policies. For example, in the case set out above, Partner C's policy could underperform by 1 1/2 per cent per annum and his policy's maturity proceeds would still be the same as Partner A's. Finally, on the subject of cost-efficiency, there are only two factors which will influence the return achieved on a partner's pension contributions; the rate of investment return and the level of charges incurred. Only the last of these can be predicted with any certainty and every effort should be made to keep them as low as possible. Apart from the cost, the other great advantage of a Sipp is that the partners appoint and control the investment manager. If the manager fails to perform satisfactorily he can be sacked and replaced without penalty. Contrast this to the position if partners hold conventional policies. If the performance is poor, partners will have little sanction but to direct their future contributions to another policy. They might also try to transfer out of the poor performing policy but this is unlikely to be achieved without a high penalty. So why do relatively few partnerships have Sipps (or one of the pre-1989 variants)? The answer lies in a combination of the following points. Most pension advisers are remunerated by commission. The best self-administered schemes are set up on nil-commission terms so recommending them is not usually in the interests of the adviser. Sipps require partners to act collectively. This is hard to achieve in practice and represents a 'difficult sale'. Most advisers will take the line of least resistance and recommend conventional policies. Partners tend to treat their financial affairs as private and separate from those of their partners. Unfortunately, this unavoidably moves them towards conventional, individual policies. Setting up a Sipp requires skills which are not usually associated with the commission end of the pensions industry. Sipp skills tend only to be found in those advisers whose principal activity is advising occupational group schemes. Such advisers only operate on a fee paying basis and their services may only prove worthwhile if they are appointed by the firm as a whole rather than individual partners. Therefore, if more partners are to benefit from the type of policy arranged for Partner C their firms need to recognise the need for fee-paying professional advice. Until then, sadly, most partners in professional firms will continue, quite unnecessarily, to lose substantial parts of the pension funds in the form of commissions and other expenses. *Figures in the table are calculated assuming annual contributions of Pounds 20,000 and an annual rate of investment return of 13 per cent. It is assumed that 15 partners participate in the Sipp, each contributing Pounds 20,000 per annum. Andrew Warwick-Thompson is head of the partnership pensions section at consulting actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PENSION COSTS                    Percentage reduction in premium (RIP)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Policy type                            10 yrs   20 yrs   30 yrs  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Normal policy terms (Standard Life)      14       20       27 Nil-commission terms (Standard Life)      6       12       18 SIPP                                      1        2        4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

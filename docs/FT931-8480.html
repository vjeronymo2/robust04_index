			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Envoy affirms US support THE new US envoy to the Bosnian peace talks, Mr Reginald Bartholomew, said yesterday the US did not want to replace the Vance-Owen efforts to broker a settlement, but to contribute to a solution. He gave this assurance after his first meeting with Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the international mediators on the former Yugoslavia. He spent two hours in intensive discussions on the Vance-Owen plan for dividing Bosnia into 10 largely autonomous provinces. 'We are not here to supplant the process,' Mr Bartholomew said afterwards. His remarks confirmed the impression given by Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, when he announced Washington's new policy on Bosnia last week, that the US did not have a ready-made alternative to the Vance-Owen plan, in spite of its reservations about certain of its provisions. Mr Bartholomew had talks last week in Moscow, during which Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, underlined his support for the Vance-Owen plan. The US envoy is not expected to propose any major modifications in their plan. But it is probable he will join them in proposing some modest changes to their proposed map, so as to make the provincial boundaries more acceptable to the Bosnian Moslems. Mr Vitaly Churkin, the new Russian envoy to the Bosnian peace talks, was due to meet the international mediators, including Mr Bartholomew, later in the day. But there was no sign that representatives of the warring parties, except Mr Mate Boban, the Bosnian Croat leader, were ready to resume the talks, which were in abeyance pending last week's US policy announcement. Bosnia's Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic is due to visit Washington at the weekend but has not announced firm plans to go to New York. It is understood that US officials will try to persuade him to resume his participation in the peace talks as soon as possible. Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, has declined to rejoin the talks in the absence of Mr Izetbegovic.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A former commanding officer of the police's  Vlakplaas counterinsurgency unit, Lieutenant Colonel Eugene de  Kock, and two unnamed men have been arrested.    Their arrests are linked to a recent report by Mr. Justice  Richard Goldstone, implicating Colonel de Kock and other senior  policemen in third force activities. The Department of Justice  has confirmed that the men are being held. They are expected to  appear in court tomorrow.    Lieutenant Colonel de Kock succeeded Captain Dirk Coetsee as  commander of the Vlakplaas unit. Captain Coetsee was  responsible for exposing Vlakplaas and security police  activities in 1989. De Kock has previously been linked to the  assassination of various anti-apartheid activists. His name was  linked to an assassination attempt on Captain Coetsee in 1993.    Colonel de Kock received a 1 million rand package when he  left the police last year.</p>

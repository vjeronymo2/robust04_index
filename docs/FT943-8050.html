			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Cheques that may bounce back: The travel finance business is heading for an unknown destination People in the traveller's cheque business love telling stories of how their products get lost. One traveller had her cheques eaten by baboons in an east African safari park. Another stored hers in the oven of her Spanish holiday apartment. She cooked them. Best of all was the Royal Marine who lost his Thomas Cook traveller's cheques while fighting in the Falklands war. Despite being taken prisoner, he managed to telephone Thomas Cook in New York. A clerk there demanded to know why he had not reported his loss to the police. But he got his refund. The promise to return lost traveller's cheques has been central to the success of the business ever since it was started 103 years ago by American Express. After impressive growth until the beginning of the 1990s, however, traveller's cheque sales have begun to slow in the face of competition from plastic cards and cashpoint machines. In response to the slowdown, the travel and financial services group Thomas Cook last week acquired Interpayment Services, Barclays Bank's traveller's cheque subsidiary, for an undisclosed consideration. Mr Graham Rider, Thomas Cook's managing director of financial services, says the way to improve profits in a sluggish market is through better distribution and more efficient processing. The key to making money in this business, he says, is how much time elapses between a traveller buying a cheque and cashing it, allowing the issuer to invest the payment in the meantime. Some people hold on to the cheques for a long time. Thomas Cook this month cashed some traveller's cheques from the 1930s. Mr Rider says this is not typical, however. Most cheques are cashed within 30 days, although US and Scandinavian travellers cash their cheques more quickly. If money is held for short periods, only the largest issuers can make the business pay, relying on their large volume of sales to generate profits. Acquiring the Barclays business raised Thomas Cook's share of the worldwide traveller's cheque market from 17 to 30 per cent. American Express is still the market leader with 44 per cent. Citicorp, the only other issuer of any size, has 12 per cent. Barclays, which had been issuing traveller's cheques for 60 years, was losing money on the business, although it is not clear how much. Neither American Express nor Thomas Cook will disclose the profit performance of its traveller's cheque business. Mr Rider says, however, that the Thomas Cook business is profitable. He hopes to make money from the Barclays subsidiary once it has been integrated into the Thomas Cook network. Neither of the two large issuers expects an easy return to growth over the next few years. The problems facing them are easily formulated. A more financially sophisticated generation of travellers pays its hotel and restaurant bills and buys its gifts using plastic cards. Mr Rider says the banks which process traveller's cheques do not like doing so. Paper-based products are expensive to handle and banks demand commission from Thomas Cook as well as from customers to do so. The proliferation of cashpoint machines has led to a fall of sales in the US. In the past, a large proportion of the traveller's cheques sold in the US were for trips within the country. Sales in western Europe have been static over the past few years as recession dissuaded people from travelling. The extent of the slowdown in international growth in the traveller's cheque market is difficult to evaluate because of an absence of authoritative figures. Thomas Cook puts worldwide 1993 sales at Dollars 54bn; American Express says Dollars 60bn. Thomas Cook says it has constructed estimates of international sales from a variety of sources. It believes worldwide sales doubled in the 1980s, rising from Dollars 25bn in 1980 to Dollars 51.5bn in 1989. They rose further to Dollars 58bn in 1992, before falling to Dollars 54bn last year, Thomas Cook estimates. The company says it expects worldwide growth this year to be 2 per cent, although American Express says its own sales in the first six months of 1994 were up 5 per cent over the same period last year. Nevertheless, the large issuers insist the business still has a future. Mr John Petersen, head of external affairs at American Express, says: 'The traveller's cheque has been written off more times than most products, but it keeps bouncing back.' The advantages of the traveller's cheque are its familiarity, acceptability and security. The product has been around since before even the oldest travellers were born. American Express set itself the task in 1891 of devising a substitute for letters of credit, which travellers found useless when they were a long way from a large bank. Marcellus Fleming Berry, a senior American Express employee, came up with the idea of a cheque which travellers would sign on purchase and then counter-sign when they cashed it. Having devised the traveller's cheque, American Express had to persuade banks, hotels, railway companies and shipping concerns around the world to accept it. A key to acceptability was successfully persuading Thomas Cook to take the cheques at its 150 offices around the world. Thomas Cook began to develop its own cheques too, experimenting with several variations of the American Express product before accepting the merit of the signature and counter-signature in 1928. Champions of the traveller's cheque argue that it is still more widely accepted around the world than the alternatives. Some travellers still experience problems having their credit cards accepted outside their own countries. There is still no universal network of cashpoint machines which would enable travellers to be sure they could with-draw money wherever they were. Above all, there is the issuers' guarantee that they will replace any cheques that are lost. Mr Petersen says American Express settled 50,000 refund claims in Europe last year. The traveller's cheque companies comfort themselves that demand is still growing in Latin America and Asia, where the number of travellers is increasing. In some countries, he says, people buy traveller's cheques in strong currencies to protect themselves against the depreciation of their domestic currency. Even in western Europe, holidaymakers still carry traveller's cheques, even if business travellers do not, Mr Petersen says. He argues that holidaymakers use traveller's cheques as a way of controlling their spending. They regard their wad of traveller's cheques as their holiday budget. They can see how much they have spent and how many unused cheques they still have. There are threats to the two large issuers, but they are not an immediate worry. The first would be greater compatibility between cashpoint systems in different parts of the world, providing travellers with the confidence that they can count on drawing money anywhere. Mr Rider believes this is at least 10 years away. A second potential threat is the possible development of a single European currency. While this would not reduce purchases by people travelling into or out of Europe, it would reduce demand from the many northern Europeans who take their holidays on the Mediterranean. Neither large traveller's cheque supplier expects to have to worry about this for some time. Both have tried selling Ecu cheques, without success. Few travellers seem to want them. American Express has found one use for Ecu traveller's cheques - Mr Petersen keeps a framed one on his office wall.</p>

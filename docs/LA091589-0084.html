			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Mother Teresa was reported in serious condition in an intensive care unit in  Calcutta, where doctors used external cardiac massage to help the 79-year-old  Nobel laureate after she suffered a mild heart attack. The frail nun has been  in Woodlands Nursing Home for 10 days with a heart problem, for which she has  been under medication since 1983. Ashim Bardhan, head of the medical team  treating her, said she had been improving until Wednesday evening, when she  suffered a mild coronary seizure. He said an external pacemaker was sending  small currents of electricity to stimulate her heart muscles and regularize her  erratic heartbeat.  </P></p>

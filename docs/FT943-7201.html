			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong opening on Wall Street lifts UK equities - Market Report A strong rally in the dollar after prolonged weakness provided a much-needed boost to international bond markets and helped resuscitate a UK equity market suffering from an acute dose of inactivity. The FT-SE 100 index ended a difficult session a net 3.8 higher at 3,171.3 and there was a feeling around the City's trading desks that a good closing performance by Wall Street could see the UK equity market launch another attempt on the 3,200 level. There was encouragement for that view after London closed with the Dow-Jones Average up more than 26 points more than two hours after trading finished in the UK. The FT-SE Mid 250 index moved in tandem with the senior FT-SE index, ending the day 3.6 up at 3,753.4 and was given a substantial push by another strong performance from the utilities areas of the market where there were persistent rumours that a predatory move against one of the regional electricity stocks might materialise sooner rather than later. The main driving force for share prices in London came from the gilts market where long-dated stocks, which were down almost half a point early in the session, rallied to end the day fractionally higher on balance. The dollar's improvement, which drew an instant response across international financial centres, came as markets were said to have adopted an early bullish view of the current series of bond auctions. Yesterday saw the auction of over Dollars 17bn worth of two-year bonds while today brings the sale of Dollars 11bn of five-year debt. Traders also said that the dollar had been oversold and was due a rally. Many dealers remained unconvinced that the market was about to move ahead, pointing to the recent low turnover levels in what is traditionally once of the quietest trading periods of the year. Turnover in equities yesterday was 556.5m shares, with non FT-SE 100 stocks accounting for just short of 60 per cent of the total. Sentiment at the close was in marked contrast with the early part of the trading session. An early attempt to mark stock prices higher succeeded only briefly as both the FT-SE future and the long gilt future were hit by flurries of substantial selling pressure. The FT-SE 100 which posted a gain of around two points minutes after the opening subsequently ran back to show a double-figure decline in mid-morning. Thereafter, prices began to stabilise, recognising the gradual improvement in the dollar, and subsequently improved to close at the day's best levels. Late trading was featured by a series of big individual trades, including the purchase of a block of 2.2m Vodafone, the UK's leading cellular phones group. The FT-SE 100's best individual performance came from Prudential where one institution was said to have paid 318p a share for a block of 1.6m shares. Insurance shares are among the market's worst performers this year, dealers said. Financials also provided two good performers in Barclays, which shrugged off recent switching into NatWest and responded instead to a bullish circular, and Bank of Scotland, which continued to respond to a recent upgrade. Guinness, the brewing and distilling group, was also heavily traded as the session drew to a close. Worries about developments in milk marketing continued to affect the market's two big dairy produce groups, Northern Foods and Unigate. NFC, the transport group, was the FT-SE 100's worst performer, slipping back in the wake of the resignation of the chief executive and a profits warning. NFC is now regarded as the prime candidate to drop out of the prestigious FT-SE 100 list when the constituents list is next reviewed.</p>

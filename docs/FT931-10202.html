			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Now Zambia points way to fiscal rectitude in adversity: A hoped-for economic example to follow a multi-party political one HAVING provided a rare African example of successful transition from one-party rule to multi-party politics, Zambia may be offering another important pointer for the continent: how to balance the budget in adversity. Describing the country's inflation record - 207 per cent in the year to December - as 'totally unsatisfactory', Mr Emmanuel Kasonde, finance minister, last week unveiled a disinflationary, balanced budget. If he can make it stick, it will go a long way towards promoting sustained recovery in an economy sapped by mismanagement and weak prices for its main export, copper. Failure, however, will reinforce the view that, without additional resources, economic recovery is beyond the reach of even the best-intentioned African governments. It will also undermine the government of President Frederick Chiluba, which swept to victory in the elections in October 1991. The year has not started well. After severe drought last year, maize production should recover strongly from the 1992 crop of only 5.2m bags (of 90 kg), compared to 12.2m in 1991. But the mid-January dry spell has raised fears of another mediocre season. Meanwhile, the copper price, which averaged 103.5 US cents a lb last year, seems set to stagnate for much of 1993. Since the mineral accounts for around 90 per cent of export earnings, this suggests that any improvement in the balance of payments from last year's Dollars 94m current account deficit is dependent on reduced food imports and lower debt-service payments. Mr Kasonde's target of an annual inflation rate of 10 per cent by December looks out of reach, with inflation still running at an annualised 200 per cent in the final quarter of 1992 - though well down on the annualised 350 per cent recorded in the first quarter. Money supply also doubled during 1992, with government borrowing from the Bank of Zambia and the commercial banks, up by 81 per cent, accounting for 56 per cent of the increase in bank lending. If Mr Kasonde gets his way this will change drastically during 1993. 'The budget,' he told MPs, 'has been framed so that financing comes first; expenditure is the residual.' The Bank of Zambia will simply say no when government ministries seek to overspend. Extra revenues that might arise from 'higher than programmed inflation' will not be spent. Treasury bill borrowings will be used to roll over existing debt, while government plans to repay 'much of its outstanding' domestic commercial bank debt. The Zambian track record suggests that they mean what they say. Last year, despite a 2.8 per cent fall in real GDP, a 39.3 per cent decline in farm output and inflation of more than 200 per cent, the government was able to cut the budget deficit from the 7.4 per cent of GDP inherited from the Kaunda administration in 1991, to only 2.2 per cent, or 0.3 per cent if drought-related spending is omitted. This year, the spending target will rise 80 per cent to K231bn (Dollars 630m). A debt-relief agreement last July with the Paris Club of official creditors, whereby debt-service costs were reduced by some Dollars 270m a year in the three years to 1995, will contribute substantially towards budgetary savings. But some bitter political battles are looming. Mr Kasonde has a fight on his hands on public spending, on wage increases, and over civil service retrenchment - with some analysts suggesting that 50,000 people, or half the civil service, will have to be laid off. He hopes that effective tax cuts, achieved by raising thresholds substantially and broadening the three income tax bands (of 15 per cent, 25 per cent and an unchanged top rate of 35 per cent), will alleviate pressure for wage rises. This too is optimistic. However, a reduced rate of corporate tax, the promised abolition of exchange controls, inherited at independence 29 years ago, and the assertion that government no longer has a role to play in fixing the exchange rate, are all grist to the private enterprise mill. Some perspective can be gained too from a comparison with Zambia's far more industrialised and prosperous neighbour Zimbabwe, which like Zambia suffered from severe drought in 1991-1992 and which is also undergoing structural reform, albeit in a far more leisurely manner. But these impressive achievements and worthy intentions will prove inadequate to the task of rebuilding the economy unless private sector investment recovers strongly. That is not going to happen without substantial public sector investment in the infrastructure, especially transport, education and training. These are long-haul strategies which means that the Zambian recovery, when it comes, will be slow.  ----------------------------------------------------------    ZAMBIA: KEY INDICATORS COMPARED WITH ZIMBABWE (1992)  ----------------------------------------------------------                                          Percentage pa                                      Zambia       Zimbabwe  ---------------------------------------------------------- Real GDP growth                      -2.8            -9 Decline in agricultural output      -39.0           -35 Inflation                           207.0            49 Money supply growth                  99.0            19 Budget deficit (% of GDP)             2.2            11  ----------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Holliday Chemical gets Pounds 150m price tag HOLLIDAY Chemical Holdings is to raise about Pounds 70m through the largest flotation yet this year, valuing the synthetic dyestuffs and speciality chemicals company at about Pounds 150m. Mr Michael Peagram, founder, chairman and largest single shareholder, said the company decided to increase by Pounds 5m to Pounds 35m the amount it will raise to reduce debt. This followed some concerns in the City that the company would be saddling itself with a balance sheet that was unnecessarily highly geared. Raising this amount of capital would lead to gearing of about 34 per cent, on a pro-forma basis at the end of 1992, and interest nine times covered by operating profits. Holliday is coming to the market through a firm placing of 75 per cent of the shares; the balance will be available through public offer. The issue will be priced on March 25; applications will be accepted until April 1 and dealing will begin on April 14. The venture capitalists who backed the original buy-out of Holliday from Holliday Dyes and Chemicals in 1987, will be selling about half of their overall shareholding. Holliday's earnings per share have increased from 4.4p in 1988 to 9.7p last year. Sales last year rose by Pounds 26.2m to Pounds 97m and operating profit by Pounds 5m to Pounds 14m. Mr Peagram said he was comfortable with the higher level of gearing - he had been used to running a company financed largely by venture capital when interest cover was as low as three times. The balance of comment from the City had, however, been 'why not raise Pounds 5m more' to reduce pro-forma gearing from about 46 per cent, the company said. Mr Peagram said the group was intent on growing organically but that in the medium term there would be further cash calls to fund acquisitions.</p>

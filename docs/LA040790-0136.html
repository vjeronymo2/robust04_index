			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FILES REVEAL ARENA FIGHTS IN ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> URBAN AFFAIRS: THE CITY COMPLAINS ABOUT RISING COSTS AND WORK FAILURES BY THE  DEVELOPER, WHICH THREATENS TO SUE. BUT SANTA ANA HAS SMOOTH SAILING ON ITS  PARALLEL PLAN.  </P> <P> Although they continue negotiating their differences, the city and the  developer of its indoor sports arena have argued bitterly in recent months  about the lack of progress on the proposed $94-million facility and what to do  about it.  </P> <P> The city has complained about rising costs and developer Ogden Corp.'s failure  to carry out required work. Ogden has countered by threatening to sue.  </P> <P> The disputes are detailed in city documents obtained by The Times this week  under a California Public Records Act request. Anaheim officials say many of  the disputes have been resolved, but serious questions remain at issue before  the arena can be built.  </P> <P> The friction between Anaheim and its developer stems partly from lawsuits filed  by neighbors of the proposed 20,000-seat arena, temporarily blocking  construction.  </P> <P> "No professional franchise will agree to relocate to a proposed arena when  newspaper articles appear almost daily stating that litigation is likely to  indefinitely delay the project," Maria Monet, president of Ogden Financial  Services, the firm's financing subsidiary, wrote in a Jan. 19 letter to  Anaheim's chief negotiator, Assistant City Manager James Ruth.  </P> <P> Monet's letter was in response to a letter from Ruth. In that Jan. 11 letter,  Ruth said the city was "not aware of any progress in connection with obtaining  a team."  </P> <P> Ruth also complained to Monet about the lack of progress on the arena and gave  the firm 30 days to "live up to its obligations" or Anaheim "will not consider  itself bound to deal exclusively with Ogden."  </P> <P> In response, Monet warned that Anaheim would be "liable for all our expenses,  more than $1.1 million," if Ogden is replaced with another developer.  </P> <P> Moreover, Monet said, if a new developer is brought in, Anaheim "would be  subject to a lawsuit for inducing . . . breach of contract."  </P> <P> But according to Ruth, Ogden officials conceded later in private meetings that  Anaheim is no longer bound to its exclusive agreement with their firm because  construction bids exceeded the original $85-million estimate.  </P> <P> "We have the right to negotiate with whoever we want," Ruth said in an  interview Thursday. "She (Monet) is entitled to her opinion, and we're entitled  to ours. . . . We don't feel we are legally vulnerable at this stage."  </P> <P> Monet and other Ogden officials did not return telephone calls from The Times  last week.  </P> <P> After construction costs increased $9 million over the original $85-million  estimate, Anaheim officials spoke publicly about replacing Ogden.  </P> <P> "When the bids came in at 94 million bucks, the city was free to do whatever it  wants," Ruth said.  </P> <P> According to Anaheim officials, Ogden wants the city to help with the increased  costs. But city officials said Ogden's $94-million figure is too high.  </P> <P> The cost dispute is the most recent sign of what may be a growing rift between  Anaheim and Ogden.  </P> <P> In January Ruth complained that Ogden had not yet hired attorneys to defend the  city in the environmental lawsuits, which were filed in December. Ruth said  Ogden bears responsibility for "indemnification of Anaheim and for any damages  and costs" stemming from the suits.  </P> <P> In her letter, Monet responded that "Ogden has not agreed to indemnify the  city."  </P> <P> On Thursday, Ruth repeated that Anaheim wants "indemnification if (Ogden) is  going to move ahead. The city wants to be indemnified against any future  lawsuits if we are going to proceed."  </P> <P> Many of Anaheim's concerns have been addressed by Ogden, Ruth said.  </P> <P> "There was a period of time where we didn't feel comfortable," he said. "Since  that (Jan. 11) letter, they have made some progress on several of these  issues."  </P> <P> One remaining point of contention, however, is Ogden's desire to get a  lucrative contract operating the food, beverage and novelty concessions at  nearby Anaheim Stadium as a hedge against losses on the indoor arena.  </P> <P> According to another letter -- dated Nov. 8, 1989, from Ruth to Ogden officials  -- the City Council opposes granting Ogden the concessions contract without the  approval of Major League Baseball's California Angels and the National Football  League's Los Angeles Rams, who share concessions profits.  </P> <P> "Our concern is, if you are unable to acquire the necessary approvals. . . ,  the entire timing and approval of the arena project will be jeopardized, unless  this (concession contract) is withdrawn from further arena negotiations," Ruth  wrote.  </P> <P> He said Thursday that Ogden remains interested in the stadium concessions but  has still not obtained approval of the Rams or Angels.  </P> <P> "We also have been advised by the Angels' organization that it is prepared to  file an action against the city if the city enters into any concession  agreement which will provide less to it than the" current arrangement, Ruth  wrote Jan. 11.  </P> <P> Since then, ARA Leisure Services, the Philadelphia firm that holds the Anaheim  Stadium concession contract, has offered Anaheim $5 million for a five-year  extension when the contract expires Dec. 31, 1990, other city documents show.  </P> <P> An Angels spokesman said Thursday that the team has never been approached by  Ogden about the concessions contract.  </P> <P> Approval from the Angels may be difficult for Ogden to obtain. In a November,  1989, draft of a letter to Angels owners Gene and Jackie Autry, Ruth noted that  the baseball club has also expressed interest in operating the concessions  itself after the contract with ARA expires.  </P> <P> While these difficulties have arisen between Ogden and Anaheim, Santa Ana  officials have quietly moved ahead with plans for a nearly identical, privately  owned and operated, 20,000-seat indoor arena to be built there. Most observers  do not believe that two such arenas can succeed in Orange County and that one  will be scrapped if the other is built first.  </P> <P> Environmental approval of the Santa Ana arena has been granted, and there have  been no legal challenges to the project, which is a private joint venture of  Spectacor Management Group, MCA Entertainment Inc. and King-Guanci Development  Co. Inc. of Newport Beach.  </P></p>

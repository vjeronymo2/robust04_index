			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / US shares slide after Fed pushes up interest rates Share prices plummeted in New York yesterday after the Federal Reserve announced the first tightening in US monetary policy in five years, pushing short-term interest rates higher. When markets closed on Wall Street last night, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 96.24at 3,871.42, a fall of 2.4 per cent, in spite of a ban on computerised program trading introduced when the decline had exceeded 50 points. It was the largest one-day fall in the Dow for more than two years. Losses were particularly heavy in stocks of companies where earnings are sensitive to interest rate movements, such as banks, utilities and securities houses. Investors sold stocks after Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, issued a statement, saying the central bank's open market committee had unanimously voted for 'a less accommodative stance in monetary policy in order to sustain and enhance the economic expansion'. The statement broke the Fed's practice of staying silent on policy changes. In congressional testimony earlier this week, Mr Greenspan had foreshadowed a tightening but left timing in doubt. His statement yesterday was issued 'so as to avoid any misunderstanding of the committee's purposes, given the fact that this is the first firming of reserve market conditions by the committee since early 1989'. Mr Lyle Gramley, a former governor at the Fed and now chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, said that the Fed seemed to have adopted 'a new policy' of openness. The fall in share prices reflectedinvestor concern that rising interest rates would slow the economy and possiblybring to an end the long bull run in equity markets. The timing of the interest rate increase surprised world financial markets. It is not expected, however, that European interest rates will move higher in the wake of the Fed's move. In London last night, where share prices were also hit in late trading by the Fed's statement, some analysts were still holding out hope of an earlycut in bank base rates from 5.5 per cent. The US Treasury market also reacted badly to the rate rise, which the Fed achieved through a modest increase in pressure on banking reserve positions. This increased the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks lend to each other, by a quarter point to 3 1/4 per cent. The benchmark 30-year government bond finished down  17/32 at 98 21/32 , yielding 6.346 per cent. On the foreign exchange markets, the dollar strengthened in the expectation that higher US interest rates would attract money into dollar assets. In late trading in New York, the US currency had risen almost 2 pfennigs against the D-Mark to DM1.760, and more than a yen to Y109.30. Unlikethe markets, Wall Street economists were pleased at the action. Mr John Lipsky,chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said: 'They have underscored their seriousness about controlling inflationary pressures by acting in advance of market expectations.' The Clinton administration took a relaxed view of the move. Ms Laura Tyson, head of the president's council of economic advisers, said that a modest increase in short-term rates was consistent with a projected 3 per cent economic growth for this year. The administration has been pressing other industrialised nations to relax monetary policy so as to stimulate economic growth. There was no immediate expectation in Washington of a policy change in the light of the Fed's modest tightening, which still leaves US short-term rates low by international standards.

			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A group of 46 wounded Salvadoran rebels, who had staged a monthlong sit-in at  the San Salvador Cathedral, have moved to the Mexican Embassy in hopes of  gaining passage out of the country. The war wounded, many missing limbs,  boarded buses chartered by family members and traveled without incident across  San Salvador to the embassy. Embassy officials were not immediately available  for comment, and the embassy was closed to the public after the arrival of the  rebels. Mexico has served as an intermediary between the government and rebels  of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front in evacuations of wounded  guerrillas during the administration of former President Jose Napoleon Duarte.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BANKRUPT SOVIET CIRCUS DEPARTS  </P> <P> Performers in a Soviet circus troupe whose dreams of fame in America vanished  as debts mounted and animals were seized were headed home today after being  stranded here since May.  </P> <P> Thirty-nine members of the bankrupt Great Circus Bim Bom, whose two-year U.S.  tour was cut short just after it began, were due to fly to Leningrad from New  York this afternoon, said the New York promoter for a rival Soviet circus who  is financing the trip.  </P> <P> "It's ended. Our trip, our journey is ended. All our hopes are broken. I hope  next time will be better," lamented Great Circus Bim Bom Music Director Boris  Rivchun.  </P> <P> Two dozen circus staff plan to stay in Atlanta temporarily to seek release of  the troupe's animals and equipment to return them to the Soviet Union, said  Artistic Director Yuri Turkin.  </P> <P> He said a few performers had found work in Canada and Chicago and another group  returned to the Soviet Union from Las Vegas several weeks ago.  </P></p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Mining official named as Ukraine's prime minister Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk appointed a conservative mining official, Yefim Zvyagilsky, as acting prime minister yesterday, a presidential spokesman said, Reuter reports from Kiev. Mr Zvyagilsky, a proponent of increased state involvement in the economy, was appointed by presidential decree a day after parliament accepted the resignation of his predecessor, Leonid Kuchma. Mr Kravchuk had hinted during parliamentary debate this week that he could name an acting premier, as President Boris Yeltsin did in Russia last year, to help speed introduction of economic reforms. 'This is not a final decision. Everything will depend on how events develop, especially on the date of new elections which parliament is to determine,' presidential spokesman Volodymyr Shlyaposhnykov said. Mr Zvyagilsky, 60, was a first deputy prime minister in Kuchma's outgoing government and a strong supporter of closer economic links with Russia. He was appointed to that post in June to satisfy the demands of striking coal miners. NEWS IN BRIEF</p>

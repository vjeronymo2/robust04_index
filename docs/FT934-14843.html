			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Rights issue from Austrian railway group VOEST Alpine Eisenbahn-systeme (VAE), the partially privatised Austrian maker of points (switches) and other specialised railway equipment, is raising Sch300m (Dollars 27m) in a one-for-six rights issue. The funds will be used to help finance the group's expansion plans at factories in the US, Canada and probably China. Its capital budget for this year is Sch190m and for the 1994-96 period Sch540m. The group's controlling shareholder, the state industrial holding company Austrian Industries (AI), is not taking up its rights and is selling 248,000 of its existing shares to reduce its stake from 51 per cent to a blocking 26 per cent.</p>

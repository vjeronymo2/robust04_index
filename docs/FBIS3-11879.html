			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports from regional sources on reaction from various Latin  American officials and politicians to the 27 March election of  Colombian President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo as OAS secretary  general.  <H5>  Colombia </H5>   Several Colombian presidential candidates have commented on  President Cesar Gaviria's election to the post of OAS secretary  general. AD/M-19 (19 April Movement Democratic Alliance)  presidential candidate Antonio Navarro Wolff said he hopes  Gaviria will act "independently and will actually serve as an  OAS secretary instead of U.S. State Department secretary."  Meanwhile, presidential candidate Enrique Parejo noted that the  president's responsibility as head of the nation's foreign  policy was inconsistent with his role of promoting his own  candidacy as OAS secretary general. Presidential hopeful Miguel  Maza Marquez congratulated Gaviria on his election victory, but  he warned that regional "pro-integration policy" could be  adveresly affected by Gaviria's election. (Santa Fe de Bogota  Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 1800 GMT 27 Mar 94)    Ernesto Samper, Liberal Party presidential candidate, today  said in Santa Fe de Bogota that the OAS member-states' support  for President Gaviria could help rid Colombia of an image  tainted by violence and drug trafficking. Samper explained:  "With this election, the countries have recognized Colombia's  ability to lead on a hemispheric level." Samper noted Gaviria  "will do an excellent job to strengthen the OAS." Meanwhile,  Conservative Party Presidential Candidate Andres Pastrana Arango  said the results of the OAS election represent "a recognition of  Colombia's value within regional political processes." (Mexico  City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1836 GMT 27 Mar 94)  <H5>  El Salvador </H5>   Salvadoran leftist and rightist groups today called the  election of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria as OAS secretary  general "positive." Joaquin Villalobos, one of the main leaders  of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), said  the election of the Colombian president "is a positive sign."  He said Gaviria's election "established the need for Central  America to continue moving down the path of intergration to  defend its interests as a united region." Meanwhile, ARENA  (National Republican Alliance) Deputy Rene Figueroa told NOTIMEX  that Gaviria's election will bring "new brilliance and dynamism  to the OAS." He predicted that, under a Gaviria administration,  relations with the United States will be more cordial. (Mexico  City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2237 GMT 27 Mar 94)  <H5>  Guatemala </H5>   Jose Luis Chea, secretary general of Guatemala's Democratic  Union, today said the election of Colombian President Cesar  Gaviria as OAS secretary general demonstrates that large  countries, such as the United States, continue to impose their  will on the OAS. Chea, former president of the Group of 77,  told ACAN-EFE that Gaviria's election demonstrates that "only  large countries are permitted to hold the post of OAS secretary  general." He concluded by saying the election only proves the  United States is maintaining its influence over the OAS.  (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1646 GMT 27 Mar 94)  <H5>  Nicaragua </H5>   Nicaraguan Deputy Foreign Minister Jose Pallais said Central  America has once again had its hopes of guiding the OAS dashed.  He said, "We are very pleased with the outcome, although  Central America will continue to aspire to this post, despite  the fact that this end could not be accomplished at this time."  Meanwhile, Sandinist Carlos Tunnermann, Nicaragua's former  ambassador to the OAS, told ACAN-EFE that Cesar Gaviria "will  inject" dynamism, prestige, and experience into the OAS.  Commenting on the defeat of Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd  Niehaus, Tunnerman said, "the time will come" when Central  America "will have a candidate that will receive the support" of  the other countries in the hemisphere. (Panama City ACAN in  Spanish 1855 GMT 27 Mar 94)  <H5>  Central America </H5>   Commenting on the election of Colombian President Cesar  Gaviria as OAS secretary general, Danilo Roca, member of the  Political Commission of the Central American Parliament, has  declared that the United States supported Gaviria to pay him  back for killing Pablo Escobar and waging a successful war on  drugs. Roca also contended that Costa Rican Foreign Minister  Bernd Niehaus' defeat resulted from Costa Rica wavering in its  integrationist policy. Meanwhile, the Labor and Popular Action  Union of Guatemala called on the OAS to become a mechanism that  will contribute to creating a new international community based  on peace, solidarity, and development. Former Guatemalan  President Vinicio Cerezo expressed his "satisfaction" with  Gaviria's election. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2250 GMT 27  Mar 94)</p>

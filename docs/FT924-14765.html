			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Leading Article: An unelected president ONE PARAGRAPH in Mr Chris Patten's speech yesterday to the Hong Kong Legislative Council (LegCo) was clearly directed at editorial writers in the UK. The pace of democratisation in Hong Kong, he said, was constrained by international agreements and 'the implacable realities of history, geography and economics'; and this fact was better understood within the territory than by 'those who would like the people of Hong Kong to be the heroic pawns of their own doubtless well-meaning preconceptions'. What this means is that, since Britain is committed to returning Hong Kong to China in 1997, there is no point in setting up a model democracy there between now and then, only to see it dismantled, with much acrimony and perhaps even bloodshed, thereafter. Everything that is done in these last five years has to be done with an eye to its likely consequences in the years beyond. So much is common sense. But on that observation can be founded two radically different policies. One, favoured by Mr Martin Lee's United Democrats (UDHK) who won most of the directly elected seats in last year's LegCo elections, is to introduce as much democracy as possible, in the hope that China will shrink from the odium of dismantling it when it comes to the point. The other, favoured until now by the British government, is to try and persuade China that more democracy would be a good idea, but refrain from implementing any changes China does not approve. Middle way In yesterday's speech Mr Patten attempted to chart a middle way between those two approaches. On relations between LegCo and the Executive Council (ExCo) he announced measures to be adopted now, without reference to China. But on the method of electing the next LegCo in 1995 he made 'proposals', which 'will require serious discussion with Peking'. Judging by the prompt and unfavourable reaction of the New China News Agency, the discussion will certainly be difficult. Whether it will be serious on the Chinese side remains to be seen. Mr Patten knows well that the Chinese will reject, once again, Britain's proposal to increase the number of directly elected seats beyond the 20 (out of 60) so far agreed. But he has devised an alternative which seeks to reach a similar result by a more convoluted route, respecting the letter of Beijing's Basic Law. This is to broaden the franchise for the 'functional' constituencies so that they embrace the entire working population, and to ensure that the 'election committee' (which under the Basic Law will elect 10 LegCo members) is itself composed of elected people. Future tense But what does he do if China rejects this package? Taken at face value, his speech offers no fallback position. Yet the proposals for the new constituencies are spelt out in considerable detail in an 'illustrative pamphlet', with copious use of the future tense. And at his press conference Mr Patten let fall the remark that 'if China wants to change it back, then it won't lose anything in its own terms'. That suggests he is ready to override a Chinese veto if necessary. If so, his approach is much nearer to that of Mr Lee than appears at first sight. Meanwhile, he has angered Mr Lee's supporters by refusing them seats on ExCo, which they hoped to turn into a quasi-cabinet drawn from LegCo and reflecting last year's election results. Mr Patten rejected this, insisting on the separation of powers. He himself is handing over the chairmanship of LegCo to an elected president, and promises in future to be 'answerable to' LegCo as head of the executive. He is even instituting a kind of 'governor's question time'. The role he defines for himself is thus half way between that of a British prime minister and a US president. Yet he is neither elected by the people nor removable by any representative body. That will also be true of his Chinese-appointed successor in 1997. Evidently he believes there is no chance China would accept an elected executive, but some chance it can be persuaded to work with a democratic legislature if he, and the Hong Kong politicians, can get such a system up and running over the next five years. It is a long shot, but a bold and imaginative one, which deserves to succeed.</p>

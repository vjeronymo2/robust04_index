			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 6 (AFP) -- French defence officials  approved Wednesday [6 April] a military procurement budget for  the next six years of 613 billion francs (107.5 billion  dollars), equivalent to a 0.5 percent annual increase in real  terms.    The 1995-2000 budget prepared by the Defence Council,  chaired  by President Francois Mitterrand, meant that some projects still  in the research or development stage might be delayed, a defence  official said.    But programmes relating to the nuclear-powered aircraft  carrier Charles de Gaulle, the Rafale fighter aircraft and the  Leclerc tank would be maintained, officials said. Some  projects however were to be delayed or see their credits  staggered over time, notably the NH-90 transport helicopter and  the M5 nuclear ballistic missile.    The four-nations NH-90 helicopter, developed jointly with  Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, is to be maintained though  its cost will have to be cut by 20 to 30 percent, the officials  said.    In addition to a second nuclear-powered aircraft carrier  planned for after 1998, the Horizon frigate programme, developed  jointly with Britain and Italy, could go ahead as early as next  year.    The draft budget is to be approved by parliament early next  year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of  Kosova, held a news conference in Prishtina today. Here is a  telephone report by our correspondent, Leke Musolli:    [Musolli] At the beginning of today's news conference, the  president of the republic of Kosova, Dr. Ibrahim Rugova,  welcomed the visit of Albanian President Dr. Sali Berisha to  Great Britain and considered it as very important, as it focused  on the situation in the region and particularly on the grave  situation in Kosova. Our political project on Kosova, which is  supported by all the Albanian political parties, is clear and  derives from the 1991 plebiscite on Kosova as independent and  neutral state.    Rugova said that despite attempts to prevent the  internationalization of the Kosova question, even this week  Kosova was at the center of attention of the international  community and forums. On this occasion, he greeted the report  of Amnesty International, which objectively describes the  torture and recent imprisonments in Kosova and will help the  world to understand the repressive and police situation in  Kosova.    Rugova also greeted the report of the Helsinki Committee of  the U.S. Congress on human rights and the bill presented by U.S.  Congressmen Angle and Molinari, which seeks a solution for  Kosova, precisely to stop the repression in Kosova.    Rugova also welcomed all the rallies of Albanians all over  Europe, which helped to sensitize people to the Albanian  question.    At today's news conference, Rugova informed reporters about  the police repression that the Serbian authorities has recently  been causing in Kosova.    Asked whether there are any indications of an Albanian-Serb  dialogue, Rugova stressed that for the moment there are no such  initiatives, but added that the Albanian side is ready for  unconditional dialogue, internationally supervised.    Another reporter asked Rugova how he would comment on the  threats by a parliamentary group from the Russian Duma, members  of Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party, who visited Kosova a  few days ago. Rugova said that he considered such threats as a  manifestation of Russian extremism but expressed his conviction  that it did not present any serious problem. On the contrary,  such forces are distressing for Yeltsin's power itself.    At today's news conference, the president of Kosova welcomed  the agreement on the cease-fire between the representatives of  Knin and the Croatian authorities. However, no parallel can be  made between the problem of Knin and the Kosova question, the  president of the republic of Kosova, Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, said at  the end of today's news conference.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Wim Brummelman report: "Serious Threat of Major Crisis in </F> EU"]    [Text] Brussels -- Theodore Pangalos (55), the Greek  minister of European affairs, is currently heading up the  revolving presidency of the European Union. Day after day and  night after night, he carries on an endless series of dialogues  in Brussels, making every effort to convince his interlocutors  with reasonable arguments. As president of the negotiations, he  had to tolerate how his impatient German colleague, Klaus  Kinkel, took over the reins and, sometimes rudely, put pressure  on those who would obstruct taking on board Norway, Sweden,  Finland, and Austria as new EU member states.    Now, however, it looks as if the planned enlargement of the  European Union by 1 January 1995 is a big mistake and a big  misunderstanding. Pangalos himself thinks that this is the  case. The EU would have been better off with an internal  reorganization aimed at making mutual cooperation stronger, and  not taking on any new members until the end of the decade, the  minister said this week, just after returning to Greek soil.    Has Pangalos gone crazy? Or is he right? The intended  enlargement to include Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria had  already caused deep splits in the EU, even before the European  Parliament had received all the texts of the agreements. Great  Britain and Spain are mercilessly threatening to explode an  institutional time bomb with their refusal to give up any of  their voting weight in an enlarged Union. [British Prime  Minister] Major can hardly make a move, hunted as he is by the  Euroskeptics in his own rank and file and the media, which never  stops recalling the glory days of former Prime Minister  Thatcher, who, all on her own, had the rest of Europe on its  knees in the debate on reimbursing EC contributions.    On the continent itself, the reliable Franco-German axis has  shown signs of overheating, following the controversial  statements made by the French ambassador in Bonn concerning the  all too assertive role which Germany wants to play in Europe.  Elsewhere, too, distrust is raising its head. "Germany wants  to complete the enlargement of the EU as soon as possible so  that it can seize its opportunities in Central and East Europe."  That is how Netherlands Foreign Minister Kooijmans interpreted  Kinkel's enthusiasm in Brussels.    So what happens now with the enlargement? Diplomats in  Brussels have no idea how the impasse over the "blocking  minority" during the decisionmaking process -- i.e., should it  be 23 or 27 votes in the EU? -- can be resolved by next Tuesday  when the foreign ministers of the 12 EU member states meet  again. Various formulas are making the rounds whereby the  decisionmaking process would be interrupted for, say, two months  in order to reach a consensus, but so far this looks like it has  little chance of succeeding.    This means that there is a real threat of an enormous  crisis,  and this seems to prove Pangalos even more correct. It would  have been better if the EU had given itself more time to  "digest" the Maastricht Treaty. The European Commission also  felt that first there should have been talks on "deepening" and  then enlarging the Union, but the European heads of government  decided otherwise at their summit in Lisbon in the summer of  1992, recalled a Commission spokesman suddenly when asked for a  reaction to Pangalos' statements.    That decision in Lisbon can be attributed to the amazing  outcome of the first Danish referendum in spring 1992.  President Delors' plans to produce "a political, intellectual,  and institutional shock" with his report on the impact of the EU  enlargement were quickly consigned to oblivion. Nobody needed a  shock. So instead, Great Britain got all the support for  recommending that enlargement negotiations should begin as soon  as possible, without first discussing the institutional  adjustments. London feels that the larger the Union, the more  noncommittal the cooperation.    The remarkable thing is that Great Britain is now provoking  an institutional discussion through demanding more  decisionmaking weight as a large member state, and thus is  threatening to block the enlargement. This is precisely the  reason why Germany is keeping its powder dry and wants to wait  until the intergovernmental conference in 1996 before tabling  its claim for more weight in the European Council of Ministers.  Bonn first wants to ensure that the enlargement is secure, and  then lean back and advance the thesis that 10 votes for 80  million inhabitants is not very much, compared to the 10 votes  which, say, France and England, each have for around 58 million  inhabitants in their countries.    Pangalos -- the man who made the wrong decision - still has  the task of finding a way out of the impasse next week, with the  help, of course, of the always obliging Kinkel.</p>

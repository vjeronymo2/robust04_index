			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Minister admits to Sinn Fein meetings The government last night admitted to meetings between ministers and Sinn Fein representatives and said it periodically received intelligence from individuals who may have been in touch with the IRA's political wing. In the government's most detailed summary of its contacts with Sinn Fein, Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister, said the meetings were with council delegations including a Sinn Fein councillor. They had been to discuss local constituency matters. Responding to a parliamentary written question by Mr Jeremy Corbyn, Labour MP for Islington North, Mr Ancram said the government's main sources of information about Sinn Fein's views were 'public ones such as written documents and reports of interviews'. The question of the government's contacts with Sinn Fein became an issue earlier this month after Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said the party had been in 'protracted contact and dialogue' with the government.</p>

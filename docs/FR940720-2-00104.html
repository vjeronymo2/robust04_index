			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Implementation of the proposed S/G tube IPC criteria does not introduce any significant changes to the plant design basis. Use of the criteria does not provide a mechanism that could result in an accident outside of the region of the TSP elevations; no ODSCC is occurring outside the thickness of the TSP. Neither a single or multiple tube rupture event would be expected in a S/G in which the plugging criteria have been applied (during all plant conditions).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TVA will implement a maximum leakage rate limit of 150 gpd per S/G to help preclude the potential for excessive leakage during all plant conditions. The SQN TS limits on primary-to-secondary leakage at operating conditions are to be a maximum of 0.42 gpm (600 gpd) for all S/Gs, or, a maximum of 150 gpd for any one S/G. The RG 1.121 criterion for establishing operational leakage rate limits that require plant shutdown is based upon leak-before-break considerations to detect a free-span crack before potential tube rupture during faulted plant conditions. The 150-gpd limit should provide for leakage detection and plant shutdown in the event of the occurrence of an unexpected single crack resulting in leakage that is associated with the longest permissible crack length. RG 1.121 acceptance criteria for establishing operating leakage limits are based on leak-before-break considerations such that plant shutdown is initiated if the leakage associated with the longest permissible crack is exceeded. The longest permissible crack is the length that provides a factor of safety of 1.43 against bursting at faulted conditions maximum pressure differential. A voltage amplitude of 8.82 volts for typical ODSCC corresponds to meeting this tube burst requirement at a lower 95 percent prediction limit on the burst correlation coupled with 95/95 lower tolerance limit material properties. Alternate crack morphologies can correspond to 8.82 volts so that a unique crack length is not defined by the burst pressure versus voltage correlation. Consequently, typical burst pressure versus through-wall crack length correlations are used below to define the ``longest permissible crack'' for evaluating operating leakage limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The single through-wall crack lengths that result in tube burst at 1.42 times the SLB pressure differential and the SLB pressure differential alone are approximately 0.57 inch and 0.84 inch, respectively. A leak rate of 150 gpd will provide for detection of 0.4-inch-long cracks at nominal leak rates and 0.6-inch-long cracks at the lower 95 percent confidence level leak rates. Since tube burst is precluded during normal operation because of the proximity of the TSP to the tube and the potential exists for the crevice to become uncovered during SLB conditions, the leakage from the maximum permissible crack must preclude tube burst at SLB conditions. Thus, the 150-gpd limit provides for plant shutdown before reaching critical crack lengths for SLB conditions. Additionally, this leak-before-break evaluation assumes that the entire crevice area is uncovered during blowdown. Partial uncover will provide benefit to the burst capacity of the intersection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As S/G tube integrity upon implementation of the 2.0-volt IPC continues to be maintained through in-service inspection and primary-to-secondary leakage monitoring, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated is not created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The use of the voltage based bobbin probe interim TSP elevation plugging criteria at SQN is demonstrated to maintain S/G tube integrity commensurate with the criteria of RG 1.121. RG 1.121 describes a method acceptable to the NRC staff for meeting General Design Criteria (GDC) 14, 15, 31, and 32 by reducing the probability or the consequences of S/G tube rupture. This is accomplished by determining the limiting conditions of degradation of S/G tubing, as established by in-service inspection, for which tubes with unacceptable cracking should be removed from service. Upon implementation of the criteria, even under the worst-case conditions, the occurrence of ODSCC at the TSP elevations is not expected to lead to a S/G tube rupture event during normal or faulted plant conditions. The EOC distribution of crack indications at the TSP elevations will be confirmed to result in acceptable primary-to-secondary leakage during all plant conditions and that radiological consequences are not adversely impacted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addressing the combined effects of loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA), plus safe shutdown earthquake (SSE) on the S/G component (as required by GDC 2), it has been determined that tube collapse may occur in the S/Gs at some plants. This is the case as the TSP may become deformed as a result of lateral loads at the wedge supports at the periphery of the plate because of the combined effects of the LOCA rarefraction wave and SSE loadings. Then, the resulting pressure differential on the deformed tubes may cause some of the tubes to collapse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are two issues associated with S/G tube collapse. First, the collapse of S/G tubing reduces the RCS flow area through the tubes. The reduction in flow area increases the resistance to flow of steam from the core during a LOCA, which in turn, may potentially increase the peak clad temperature (PCT). Second, there is a potential that partial through-wall cracks in tubes could progress to through-wall cracks during tube deformation or collapse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, since the leak-before-break methodology is applicable to the SQN reactor coolant loop piping, the probability of breaks in the primary loop piping is sufficiently low that they need not be considered in the structural design of the plant. The limiting LOCA event becomes either the accumulator line break or the pressurizer surge line break. LOCA loads for the primary pipe breaks were used to bound the conditions at SQN for smaller breaks. The results of the analysis using the larger break inputs show that the LOCA loads were found to be of insufficient magnitude to result in S/G tube collapse or significant deformation. The LOCA, plus SSE tube collapse evaluation performed for another plant with Series 51 S/Gs using bounding input conditions (large-break loadings), is considered applicable to SQN.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Addressing RG 1.83 considerations, implementation of the bobbin probe voltage based interim tube plugging criteria of 2.0 volt is supplemented by: (1) enhanced eddy current inspection guidelines to provide consistency in voltage normalization, (2) a 100 percent eddy current inspection sample size at the TSP elevations, and (3) RPC inspection requirements for the larger indications left in service to characterize the principal degradation as ODSCC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted previously, implementation of the TSP elevation plugging criteria will decrease the number of tubes that must be repaired. The installation of S/G tube plugs reduces the RCS flow margin. Thus, implementation of the alternate plugging criteria will maintain the margin of flow that would otherwise be reduced in the event of increased tube plugging.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above, it is concluded that the proposed license amendment request does not result in a significant reduction in margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Chattanooga-Hamilton County Library, 1101 Broad Street, Chattanooga, Tennessee 37402. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Attorney for licensee:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> General Counsel, Tennessee Valley Authority, 400 West Summit Hill Drive, ET 11H, Knoxville, Tennessee 37902. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRC Project Director:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Frederick J.

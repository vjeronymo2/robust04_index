			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Babcock warns of difficult trading BABCOCK International, the engineering group, yesterday cut its interim dividend and warned that difficult trading conditions in all its markets would depress future profits. The group brought forward the announcement by four weeks because of concern over the volatility of its share price and market rumours about the trading outlook. The shares, which have fallen steeply from May's peak of 69p, yesterday closed  1/2 p lower at 29 1/2 p. Pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 fell from Pounds 23.7m to Pounds 16.6m on turnover down from Pounds 415.3m to Pounds 399.7m. The group blamed the drop in profits on the late impact of recession and the need to make provisions for certain under-performing contracts. The biggest related to costs of Pounds 5m associated with difficulties at the combined-cycle power station at Killingholme, Humberside, although the group said its other combined-cycle contracts were proceeding to programme. Lord King, chairman, said the board's realistic assessment of current trading conditions was that results for the second half were at best likely to be only marginally better than the first half. The last full-year figure was Pounds 50.1m. In view of the importance of conserving cash, the interim dividend is reduced from 1.25p to 1p, payable from earnings of 2.02p (3.32p) per share. The Ministry of Defence has confirmed that the group's shared contract to run the Rosyth Naval Dockyard in Scotland will be extended by at least a year until April 1995, and probably a year thereafter. Babcock was also awaiting a government decision, expected by the year-end, on whether it can complete new docks for Trident nuclear submarines at Rosyth, which employs 4,000 people. The group said the London Underground contract for the refurbishment of coaches, being undertaken at Rosyth, had involved higher initial costs than anticipated, but encouraging performance levels were now being achieved and prospects were encouraging. Babcock Energy suffered from a shortfall in orders, exacerbated by the deferment of a Pounds 100m Hampshire waste-to-water plant. However, the group said a number of sizeable export projects were expected to be finalised in the next few months. In the construction and process plant division, order books had been under pressure and turnover was down. However, the group said there were increasing opportunities outside the UK and contracts in the oil and gas sector had been secured in Malaysia and the Middle East, with further opportunities still likely to be secured. COMMENT There is no doubt that Babcock has gone through a very rough patch - the harder question to answer is whether the market's recent reaction has been too extreme. Sceptics say that when things start going wrong in the contracting business, they tend to continue going wrong - and, being late in the cycle, Babcock is likely to have it tough for at least another couple of years. The counter-argument points to the high quality of the management, who seemed anxious to make full provision for the recent pain, and the likely impact of devaluation in securing much needed export orders. Forecast full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 34m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 7.4 - a 48 per cent discount to the market. Assuming a full-year dividend of 2p, they are on an 85 per cent yield premium. For once, the gloom may have been overdone.</p>

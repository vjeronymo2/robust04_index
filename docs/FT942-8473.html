			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Treasury panel puts growth at 3% The Treasury's panel of independent forecasters yesterday painted a relatively upbeat picture of the British economy during 1994 and 1995. Economic growth and underlying inflation will each be just under 3 per cent this year and next, according to the average of the forecasts published in the panel's latest report. All panel members expect unemployment to continue to fall, although at varying speeds. The six members of the panel are Mr Andrew Britton of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research; Mr Tim Congdon of Lombard Street Research; Mr David Currie of the London Business School; Mr Gavyn Davies of Goldman Sachs International; Mr Wynne Godley of King's College, Cambridge; and Mr Patrick Minford of Liverpool University and Cardiff Business School. The panel divided four to two on the question of cutting interest rates. The majority - comprising Mr Britton, Mr Congdon, Mr Currie and Mr Davies - saw 'little reason to change interest rates from their present level'. The four argued that 'a further cut now, unjustified by economic news, runs the risk of sacrificing credibility in the financial markets and could again result in a tightening, rather than a loosening, of monetary policy by an adverse movement in long rates'. The dissenters - Mr Minford and Mr Godley - argue for a substantial cut in interest rates and Mr Minford is forecasting that such a reduction will actually take place. He expects short-term rates to fall to 4.3 per cent by the fourth quarter of this year. Four of the panel are forecasting an increase in interest rates by the fourth quarter of this year, albeit by only a quarter of a percentage point to 5.5 per cent. In 1995, further increases in interest rates are expected.</p>

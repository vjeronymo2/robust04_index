			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / BA in talks with Boeing on 600-seat airliner BRITISH Airways is discussing with Boeing the possibility of introducing into its fleet a new 600-seat jumbo airliner by the turn of the century. Mr Robert Albrecht, a Boeing executive vice-president, confirmed yesterday that Boeing had held talks with BA and other Boeing 747 jumbo operators on developing an ultra-large commercial aircraft. But the timing of such a project was uncertain and depended on market demand. Boeing has formed a special unit to study developing a 600-seater aircraft and recently invited executives from potential customer airlines to discuss the super jumbo project. The European Airbus consortium is also studying the possibility of building a 600-seat ultra-large aircraft. BA said yesterday it had set up a study group to evaluate with airframe and engine makers the airline's future requirement for a super jumbo. It would envisage using such an airliner on long-distance routes. It sees the cost of a super-jumbo as about Dollars 175m (Pounds 100m), against Dollars 125m for a 400-seater Boeing 747-400. BA suggested the new ultra-large aircraft could include a gymnasium, a central lounge, sleeping quarters as on-board facilities. Makers expect strong demand for a super-jumbo from airlines in the Asia-Pacific region where air traffic is expected to expand in the next decade. Boeing and Airbus are also seeking to interest Japanese aerospace companies in sharing in their respective super jumbo projects.</p>

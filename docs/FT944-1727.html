			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Media Futures: New-age Britannica gets foot in the door - Martin Mulligan explains how the encyclopaedia company is meeting the challenge of new technologies He is etched in urban legend: the smiling yet implacable doorstep salesman of encyclopaedias. You might think him a member of a threatened profession, trading on borrowed time in an increasingly high-tech, information-rich world. But you would be mistaken. If the leaders in the field are to be trusted, the future of the doorstep encyclopaedia salesman is assured. In fact, his prospects have never seemed more alluring. Which is strange. After all, aren't books themselves said to be living on borrowed time, perhaps already superseded by CD-Rom, interactive and multimedia products? Joseph J Esposito, north American president of Encyclopaedia Britannica, sees things differently. At ease in his book-lined office, a short walk beyond the stone lions that guard Chicago's Art Institute, Esposito describes himself as 'an English professor manque'. He combines a keen sense of mission with an eye for what is really happening in the global information market. A self-confessed bookaholic, Esposito quotes T S Eliot and Voltaire in the same breath as he outlines the cyclical pattern of sales since Encyclopaedia Britannica, now in its 15th edition, was founded by three Scots in Edinburgh in 1768. His mission is that of self-appointed protector of particular values. 'As long as the Enlightenment spirit exists in the world, there will be a Britannica,' he declares. Stuffy he is not. Today's Britannica comes in four 'flavours'. There is the printed version we all know and love, Britannica CD-Rom, and, most recently, Britannica Online, in a local area network version and a World Wide Web version. The latter two are available at present only to universities and colleges (the first UK institutions have bought licences very recently). Britannica is making big efforts to enable libraries, schools, companies and home users to gain access to its World Wide Web version. It does not know how quickly that is likely to happen, but even within Chicago's bastion of enlightenment, the Internet is seen as holding the most exciting possibilities. Today's flood of information, Esposito argues, has made Britannica, in all its forms, more valuable than ever. An environment in which the questions have multiplied is tremendous news for a man in the business of giving answers. But the issues run much deeper. More than ever before, knowledge is endangered by wave upon wave of information. A knowledgeable person is now one who understands just how much of this information can be ignored. What that person needs is a versatile, navigable, intellectual ark to carry the inquiring mind from place to place on the back of the flood. And the various versions of Britannica are just such arks. As Esposito has said: 'What is essential for the future of knowledge is filters and classifiers, information tools that cut out the noise and give us pieces of the universe in knowable units.' All well and good. But how does that square with the 32-volume, hand-tooled, leather-bound monolith on the bookshelf - that alternative universe of print and colour plates in which an imaginative child could lose itself for hours. Has that special experience gone for ever, replaced for today's and subsequent generations by CD-Rom or on-line versions of Britannica? Perhaps not. Globally there is little hard evidence that sales of electronic products are at the expense of book sales. There may even be a small positive impact on book sales. Britannica's experience to date tends to support this. Its traditional printed version still comes in seven different bindings - to match room decorations. 'Most people buy the CD-Rom and print versions together, making up fully 40 per cent of our sales. Virtually no-one is buying CD-Rom without the print version,' says Esposito. It may be, after all, that print and electronic media do not have to fight each other. Against all expectations, they may be able to enjoy a symbiotic relationship. CD-Rom is an 'interim technology', according to Esposito and his colleagues. But nobody can say how long the interim will last. The single-disc Britannica CD contains a dictionary, a thesaurus, and the 65,000 articles and 44m words of the traditional Britannica. But they are the right words, as distinct from mere information. Britannica CD is described as fully interactive but not multimedia. It is claimed to be the most interactive encyclopaedia going, because it has the 'best search engine on the market'. A typical encyclopaedia contains 7m to 10m words. At 44m, Britannica is thus the big boy on the block. Its competitors in print include Collier, Grolier and World Books, but it says that its market share in print in the last few years has grown. Esposito nominates Grolier and Microsoft as its most successful electronic competitors. Its strategy has been to invest in continually updating its database and developing powerful search-and-retrieval functions, rather than adding the random snippets of sound and video that characterise most CD-Rom encyclopaedias. Esposito admits that only 10 per cent of the print version's illustrations have translated into the CD-Rom format. Could it be that Britannica's interest in CD-Rom is fuelled by the gnawing suspicion that many of its prospective younger readers are losing themselves in the branching networks of, say, Compton's Interactive Encyclopedia, a screen-based 'reading experience' which is perhaps as memorable and exciting for today's school-age children as their parents' first encounter with the traditional Britannica? Esposito praises the competition, then quietly observes that 'it is probably unfortunate that Britannica and its competitors share the name of encyclopaedia.' It is a harsh fact of life that quality publishers tend to lose money. Is Britannica defying that trend? Esposito does not evade the question, but his reply is carefully constructed. Britannica is owned by the William Benton Foundation, a non-profit corporation in Illinois, founded by the former senator which supports the University of Chicago. 'Historically,' says Esposito, 'we are in a very cyclical business, and this has been true of (our) US sales for the entire century. We felt the 1991 recession. In terms of total company revenue, lately international has been greater than domestic. But the economy has begun to turn, and there is a great sense of optimism.' He is aware that 'complacency kills companies, and the future does not necessarily belong to us', but takes heart from the fact that 'the more affluent consumer market is showing a preference for our product.' But what of Britannica Online, the jewel in the crown if the word of information scientists is to be accepted? How does it differ from the printed Britannica? Esposito reckons that 'a truly electronic encyclopaedia will no more resemble a print encyclopaedia than a horseless carriage resembles a horse.' Britannica Online certainly offers a hint of what that might mean. In addition to the 44m-word database, it carries celebrated articles from past editions, new articles not included in the printed Britannica, essential graphics and illustrations, and - crucially - references to other Internet resources that can be easily accessed by clicking on an icon. That last feature is pivotal. By clicking on 'hotlinks' within articles, users can access, for example, the Soviet Archives Exhibition provided by the Library of Congress or the Art and Culture of Mexico exhibition at the University of Guadalajara. Here is a real hint of how an Internet encyclopaedia may soon form a gateway to the world's knowledge.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Interview with Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan by  Boris Gandel; place and date not given: "So That They Do Not  Beat Us for What Is Not Our Fault"]    [Text] Following the recent appointment of the new  government, the Slovak Republic already has its third foreign  minister since its emergence. After Milan Knazko and Jozef  Moravcik, the post of the head of Slovak diplomacy has been  assumed by Eduard Kukan. He is a man with 30 years of  diplomatic experience. He worked at several diplomatic missions  abroad, most recently as Slovak ambassador to the United  Nations. SMENA asked Kukan for an interview in connection with  his appointment.    [Gandel] Minister, what are the priority issues for Slovak  foreign policy?    [Kukan] The highest priority in Slovak foreign policy  continues to be integration into Europe, the gradual  incorporation and assimilation into European political,  economic, and security structures. That is the main task on  which we must concentrate. At this time, another priority is  the reinforcement of good relations with neighboring countries.  It is the duty of every state to maintain good relations with  all countries and with its neighbors, in particular. We do not  choose them; they are here. If neighbors are interested in  living in a good relationship and peace, they should both be  interested in maintaining the quality of relations. I see yet  another priority in the need to help the economic development of  Slovakia. A functioning economy is the main task of our new  society, and, in this respect, our foreign service should help  solve the economic questions. An orientation is also necessary  toward the image of Slovakia that--I do not wish to go into  details--is not always the best. The reasons for this situation  are rather complex, and our foreign policy wants to be more  active in the direction of making this image--I do not want to  say favorable, but perhaps objective, so that they do not beat  us for what is not our fault. This roughly sums up my  priorities.    [Gandel] How do you intend to implement them?    [Kukan] Regarding integration into Europe, we cannot wait.  It is a truly urgent issue. We signed the association  agreement with the European Union and want it to be ratified by  all of the Twelve before the end of the year. I say Twelve  because, if we do not manage to get it done before the end of  the year, there might be not 12 but 16 of them, and it would  take that much longer. Hence, we are interested in seeing this  agreement go into effect. In this context, I would like to  bring up the issue of the stability pact in Europe. This is a  very topical issue, and I am convinced that the development will  show the need for Slovakia to pay great attention to this issue.    Regarding relations with neighbors, I would like to  emphasize  that Slovakia is interested in the development of good relations  with Hungary. We want to create an atmosphere that would be  propitious for a dialogue--that is, a discourse between the two  partners. Both partners must be willing to conduct it. It must  be emphasized that it should be relaxed, composed, and free of  emotions so that we can discuss how to solve the problems. I am  convinced that such an atmosphere will eventually lead to  results. The same applies to the relations with the Czech  Republic, Poland, Austria, and Ukraine.    As far as the economic profile of our foreign policy goes,  the question of the efficiency of cooperation with the Slovak  Economics Ministry will have to be solved. At our embassies  abroad, we also have employees of the Economics Ministry whose  work is not always sufficiently specified. We will endeavor  finally to find a conceptual solution to these questions so that  their activity is oriented toward specific tasks that would help  the Slovak economy.    [Gandel] You spoke about our relations, and, in this  context, I would like to ask something. Your Budapest  counterpart, Geza Jeszenszky, said on Hungarian Radio on its  Sunday [20 September] program that the statements made by new  Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik are encouraging, and he  expressed the opinion that a historic Slovak-Hungarian  settlement could now take place. How do you understand his  pronouncement?    [Kukan] That is such a vocal, eloquent expression--a  Slovak-Hungarian settlement. In my perception, it is more on  the pragmatic level. I have no idea what Mr. Jeszenszky meant  by Slovak-Hungarian settlement, but apparently it was the return  of Slovak-Hungarian relations to a constructive plane without  the extreme politicizing of some issues. I see it rather more  realistically. Our new government is interested in dealing with  and solving specific problems in relations with our neighbors.  I would prefer a path of gradual steps, from simple to more  complex ones, because I believe that some problems could be  solved quickly without any real difficulties. That could bring  us to further, more substantial issues. I repeat, this requires  willingness and an accommodating attitude from both partners.    [Gandel] Which country do you believe you should visit  first and why?    [Kukan] You know, I inherited the foreign affairs sector,  and certain trips and foreign political activities have already  been arranged. It is in the interest of my credibility that I  comply with these obligations of the Slovak Republic. The first  trip should be to Poland on 8 April. It is a previously  arranged affair. I should meet my Polish counterpart there. I  am not certain, however, whether developments will bring  something else before then. So, to your question why, I reply  that it was discussed and agreed upon earlier. I believe we  have really good preconditions for maintaining good cooperation  with Poland. No doubt, goodwill is not lacking on either side.    [Gandel] During the government of Vladimir Meciar, criticism  was heard that Slovakia is too East-oriented. Which direction  would you like to emphasize?    [Kukan] I believe that this issue is blown up abroad in the  West European and U.S. media. The orientation of Slovakia is  quite clear. As I mentioned earlier, we are interested in  integration into the European security, political, and economic  structures. That speaks for itself. Of course, we are  interested in developing our relations with Ukraine and other  partners in the East. It is normal and natural. I believe that  we can very well "score points" economically there.    When I said that these issues are sometimes blown out of  proportion, I could give an example from my experience in New  York, where our contacts with Russia and Ukraine were used as  follows--ah, just look, Slovakia wants to return to the old  times, etc. In this respect, the actual situation must be  explained. In my opinion, any thinking person must understand  that it is advantageous to have a neighbor in the East who  offers good conditions for the export of our goods and  represents a large market on which we can establish ourselves.  No additional speculation is needed. It is completely  unnecessary.... Our orientation is obvious--toward Europe,  toward the European Union, and, at the same time, using the  opportunities offered by cooperation with other countries as  well.    [Gandel] Which of the problems of the Slovak Republic were  most obvious to your partners in the United Nations?    [Kukan] They were the things that were also most discussed  at home: the problems of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia, its  status, what the Slovak Government is doing to solve this issue  in accordance with international norms. These were the questions  that most often popped up in conversation. There was also  freedom of the press--that was observed very carefully. I will  also give you an example, however, of how the U.S. media treated  the case of Trnava University, particularly the beginning of the  affair. The U.S. reader has never learned that the problem has  been solved. Therefore, we have argued and contended that the  U.S. media, which claim to be objective and fair, should always  bring their work to the end. Our colleagues have also carefully  followed the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros issue, in which they are well  versed. These were the three main areas that were most  discussed.    [Gandel] Among the most burning problems of Slovak diplomacy  are certainly the vacant ambassadorial posts. Your predecessor,  current Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik, once said that they would  be filled by the end of March of this year. Several weeks ago,  State Secretary Jan Lisuch spoke about the end of June. A  consensus of three entities is needed for the approval of  ambassadorial appointments--the Foreign Ministry, the  government, and the president. In this context, when leaving  the post of the head of diplomacy, Jozef Moravcik declared that  it was a long way from the ministry to the presidency. Now the  situation should be better in this respect. When do you believe  it realistically possible for the ambassadorial posts to be  finally filled?    [Kukan] Personally, I believe that the filling of the  ambassadorial posts is a very important issue. The absence of  ambassador to Washington for 14 months--that was not good, to  say the least, and I am not going to go into details. Every  country perceives its partner through the prism of whether there  is an accredited ambassador in that country. On the basis of  whether there is an ambassador, they judge the amount of  interest in mutual cooperation. You mentioned some dates. I  would prefer not to speak in a definite time frame. I know that  my predecessor and the state secretary share with me the opinion  that the ambassadorial posts must be filled. For practical  reasons, however, a precise date cannot be set. You actually  said that the authorization of appointments takes a while. I  assume that it will be faster now and that it will be settled.  Nevertheless, you know that we ask the country to which we are  sending the ambassador for agreement. This sometimes takes  three or four weeks, sometimes even longer. Therefore, I believe  that it would not be proper to speak about specific dates. I  can confirm, however, that I have spoken about it with Prime  Minister Moravcik, who agrees that these questions must be  solved immediately, regardless of the six-month term of office  of the new government. We do not want to solve it at any cost.  We want the ambassadors to be people who will represent  Slovakia well.    [Gandel] In this context, I would ask: Would you let us know  the name of your successor in New York?    [Kukan] I do not know. For the time being, my deputy, Peter  Tomka, who has the rank of ambassador, has taken over the  position. It is not a permanent solution because he is the  Slovak Government's commissioner for the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros  case at the International Court in The Hague. I left New York  in a hurry, so I have not yet thought about who will get the  post of ambassador to the United Nations. It is desirable,  however, that he be there in September, when the General  Assembly starts.    [Gandel] It is known that Eva Mitrova is to become Slovak  ambassador to Budapest. To date, she has worked as ambassador  to the Council of Europe. Do you believe it is appropriate for  an ambassador to leave the post where he or she worked only  briefly, just long enough to establish contacts, and transfer to  a new place to start again practically from scratch, and may I  also ask who is to replace Mrs. Mitrova in Strasbourg?    [Kukan] Of course, if the situation permits, it is in the  best interest of the government for an ambassador who has  established himself or herself somewhere, set up contacts, and  begun to be productive for the government to stay there as long  as possible. Life is not a straightforward affair, however, and  it can happen that an ambassador who has good contacts at one  location is needed elsewhere. I believe that this is so in the  case of Mrs. Mitrova. Relations with Hungary are so important in  our foreign policy that not having an ambassador there would be  rather harmful to our objectives, particularly if we speak about  the peaceful matter-of-fact dialogue we want to conduct with the  Hungarian side. Hence, we really need an ambassador in Budapest.  Regarding the successor to Mrs. Mitrova--we are a little  further along there than we are in New York--we have some names,  but it is not yet at such a stage that I can give them to you.    [Gandel] How would you assess--I would term it--the sincere  message of greetings sent by U.S. President Bill Clinton to the  new Government of the Slovak Republic?    [Kukan] I believe that the message is quite clear and  favorable, and that it expresses full trust in the new  government and a willingness to cooperate constructively and in  a matter-of-fact way with this government. I have also received  a letter of greeting from my U.S. counterpart, Warren  Christopher, and I can say that it was not just a diplomatic  message but a very personal one. Warren Christopher wrote that  he knows what I have been doing and assures me of very effective  cooperation. I must tell you that it felt good and that it  encouraged me tremendously. I have received similar  messages--from Klaus Kinkel, for instance--that were also not of  the commonplace type that are sent in traditional diplomacy,  those two or three phrases that one can say even if awakened at  midnight. They were real messages, which took into account the  Slovak situation and the specific person; they were messages  actually addressed to me, Eduard Kukan. I must admit that it  truly encouraged me very much.</p>

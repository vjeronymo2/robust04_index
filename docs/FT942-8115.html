			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Sport: Ryder Cup brings pain in Spain - Golf The Spanish venue for the 1997 Ryder Cup will be announced at the Volvo PGA Championship at Wentworth on Wednesday. This was to have been the greatest day in Spanish golf history, the culmination of a heavily romantic story that began in 1976 when Severiano Ballesteros charmed us all with his performance in the Open Championship at Royal Birkdale. But sadly, the great day approaches with Spanish golf in turmoil. Seven clubs have applied to stage the Ryder Cup but Valderrama, near Gibraltar, is widely expected to win. But Ballesteros, Spain's leading golfing ambassador, has fallen out with Valderrama: last week he accused the club of offering him a bribe to support their case, a claim he later retracted. Ballesteros will not speak to the Spanish Golf Federation either - he has accused it of being a cancer on the game. Ballesteros is widely expected to be the 1997 Ryder Cup captain, but here again there are wounds to be healed. Last month he resigned from the Ryder Cup committee in a fit of pique when it became obvious that his nomination, Novo Sancti Petri, near Cadiz, had no chance. And last week, he raised the question of whether the committee, which decides on who is to be captain, had been offered inducements by Valderrama or any of the other venues. 'If he said that to my face I'd punch him on the nose,' said committee member David Huish. Ballesteros said this week he did not mean to imply the committee had acted dishonourably. Adding to the elements of farce is the fact that the Ryder Cup will do little for golf in Spain. Parallels with taking football's World Cup to America are striking. The Spanish do not care for golf. Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has done nothing to help Ballesteros in his long-standing desire to bring the game to the masses. Notoriously, Gonzalez declared 10 years ago that golf was a 'rich man's game' and, of course, by providing no money to help build municipal courses he has perpetuated his own theory. It is an especially sorry situation given that for almost 20 years the game's best loved and most charismatic figure has been a Spaniard. More than any other golfer, Ballesteros has been responsible for the recent explosion of interest in the sport, but in his own backyard there has been no reaction. Even now, when golf courses have appeared all over Europe, Spain has just one 18-hole public course, and to get on that you have to be in the know. To be fair, the Spanish Golf Federation does have a number of schemes, including the Escorial School in Madrid, to help those who are not from wealthy backgrounds to play the game. However, little help is forthcoming from the sports ministry and with no available courses, it faces an almost impossible task. Here is an example of the impact golf currently has on Spanish sporting life: in Jerez in February, when Ballesteros made his comeback to the game after a four-month break, the news promoted a small army of golf correspondents and sports feature writers to travel from Britain. The story took up half of page 40 in each of the two 48-page tabloid Spanish sports dailies. On that comeback day, Ballesteros played with Jack Nicklaus, the game's greatest name, and Miguel Jiminez, who comes from Jerez. The number of spectators following the trio reached a grand total of 42. 'Passion for Golf', said a sign by the 18th, belonging to the Spanish tourist board . . .but little was in evidence. So why is the Ryder Cup going to Spain? Ireland, as golf-obsessed a country as it is possible to find, has never hosted the contest. Spain was chosen because of the support the country has given to the European Tour since 1971. But the golf there is played by ex-patriots, tourists and the Spanish elite. As for sponsorship, the Spanish tourist board almost single-handedly sponsored the early part of this year's tour. Acutely aware of the importance of golf to tourism in many Spanish regions, the board sponsored events in all the holiday areas, such as Andalucia, the Costa del Sol and the islands, Majorca and Tenerife. This has brought accusations that the Ryder Cup has become a crutch to prop up the European Tour's schedule. Regardless of who gets the nomination, what is to be fervently hoped is that in the 40 or so months that remain before the contest, some dramatic strides forward are made in the infrastructure of the game in Spain. The glory of the matches is the impact they have in getting people interested in the sport. But that will be lost if average sports-minded Spaniards, intrigued as they undoubtedly will be by the Ryder Cup, seek out a place to play the game themselves only to find none available.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If EPA decided to exercise its authority under this special provision, EPA would allow an appropriate time for completion of the prescribed tests. For instance, if ancillary tests to Tier 2 were prescribed for a registered F/FA, the usual three-year timeframe for completing Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements would no longer apply. Instead, EPA would allow additional time for completion of the alternative testing program (i.e., Tier 2 as well as the ancillary tests prescribed under this provision) in this special case. Similar compliance allowances would be made if different tests (e.g., chronic tests) were prescribed in lieu of the standard Tier 2 screening tests. For registered F/FAs, EPA would notify the manufacturer (or group) by certified mail letter, within eighteen months of promulgation of the final rule, of the specific tests to be done in lieu of the standard Tier 2 regimen, along with a schedule for compliance and submittal of test results. A  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice would also be published to give the public opportunity to comment on the intended testing regimen. A public hearing would not be held, however. The responsible manufacturer (or group of manufacturers) would have 60 days to comment on the prescribed tests and timing requirements. If the responsible manufacturer did not provide any comments, EPA would assume that the manufacturer had consented in full with the prescribed testing program. Similar notification arrangements would apply to manufacturers of currently unregistered F/FAs. In this instance, EPA would notify the new applicant (by certified mail letter) of the nonstandard requirements within eighteen months of EPA's learning of the manufacturer's intent to register a product. EPA welcomes comments on the proposed notification and comment procedures for this special provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, EPA considers the normal Tier 2 testing regimen to be applicable, appropriate, and valuable for the health effects evaluation of F/FA emissions, even if higher-level testing is later required under the provisions of Tier 3. Thus, EPA would exercise the special authority to prescribe other testing requirements in addition to or in lieu of the standard Tier 2 regimen only in exceptional cases. The exercise of this authority would be done wholly at EPA's discretion. F/FA manufacturers would be specifically discouraged from submitting applications or requests to EPA for Tier 2 substitutions, and EPA would be under no obligation to consider or respond to any such requests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Technical Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. General Emission Generation Methodology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM proposed that F/FA manufacturers would be required to conduct a detailed characterization of the emissions of their products, as well as biological tests in which animals are exposed to these emissions. The use of applicable portions of the standard Federal Test Procedure (FTP) was proposed for generating exhaust emissions for these purposes. For biological testing of products predominantly used in light-duty vehicle applications, EPA proposed the use of one light-duty vehicle operating over continuous, repeated Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) cycles (i.e., a transient speed driving sequence used to simulate typical urban driving) performed on a chassis dynamometer. An engine dynamometer operated on the Engine Dynamometer Schedule (EDS) was presented as an option. The EDS is a transient engine speed versus torque time sequence commonly used in heavy-duty engine evaluation. It was proposed that the EDS would be used to generate emissions in heavy-duty applications. EPA also proposed that all test vehicles and engines should possess all of the emission control equipment normally recommended by the manufacturer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In their comments on the NPRM, the regulated industry questioned the appropriateness of using the FTP to generate emissions for biological testing, given the inherent variable nature of FTP-generated emissions. In response to these comments, EPA is considering several alternative approaches as discussed below. EPA asks for comments on the suitability of these proposals and on alternative methods suitable for the generation of emissions to be used in the biological testing of F/FAs. To be most useful, such comments should include a detailed discussion on the recommended methodology, including advantages and disadvantages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Non-Transient Methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is considering the use of non-transient methods as an alternative approach to FTP or other transient cycles to reduce the potential variability in the emission stream. The rationale behind this approach is discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

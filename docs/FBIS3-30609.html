Good evening.    [Tomic] Good evening.    [Jovic] Everyone who has watched the Serbian Assembly  broadcasts is aware of this, but we will nevertheless remind  viewers that in your capacity as head of a deputy caucus, you  addressed the deputies and very clearly explained the Socialist  Party of Serbia's [SPS] platform.    [Tomic] And not only the SPS's platform, but primarily  President Milosevic's request that Serbian political forces join  forces in a policy of peace, economic prosperity, and  crime-fighting. I think this is the backbone and essence of the  whole thing, and the views expressed in the parliament have  confirmed this.    [Jovic] What could be seen from the broadcasts is that you  have been given a good reception as new Serbian Assembly  chairman; what we still do not know, but are sure to learn on  Tuesday when the Assembly meets again, concerns the  negotiations. This request actually marked the end of the  previous session. The negotiations with the head of deputy  caucuses, how are they going?    [Tomic] Well, the negotiations and talks will continue  during this break. On Tuesday [8 February] we will probably be  completely ready to continue our work; we primarily need to  elect a deputy assembly chairman, then working bodies, then we  have the election of the secretary general, and finally, we  should elect the deputies to the Chamber of Republics in the  Federal Assembly. These tasks will mark an end to constituting  the republican Assembly, which will be prepared in such a way  that it will be capable of carrying on with the important part  of the tasks in its domain, and with what the people of this  republic, the people of Serbia, expect.    [Jovic] For the time being, are all the heads, all the  deputy caucuses, participating in the negotiations?    [Tomic] Well, you know, the talks are collective, they are  discussing things among themselves, in the opposition bloc,  among the representatives of the SPS, and so forth.  Consultations are underway. We expect that Monday [7 February]  will be particularly busy, and that in the course of the day we  will conclude most of these talks, negotiations, and  preparations for the session that will then begin.    [Jovic] So everything can be reviewed at the session on  Tuesday, while it is still hot, so to speak?    [Tomic] Yes. Of course, we still have a few things to do on  Tuesday morning, but you know how these things are; these  activities take time, they will probably continue through  Tuesday, depending on the number and type of proposals, whether  all these proposals are to be coordinated, agreed upon, whether  all of them will be on the agenda, and so forth.    [Jovic] Thank you very much. It is important that we have  started rolling.    [Tomic] Absolutely.    [Jovic] Thank you.</p>

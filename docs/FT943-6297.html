			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Taking an interest can be the best option - A change in the banks' attitude to debt-for-equity swaps Debt-for-equity swaps have always been a last resort for British lenders, representing a fleeting hope of some future pay-back, when the alternative is probably nothing. However, the recovery of WPP Group, the advertising company, under its debt-relieved structure has enabled its backers to take a Pounds 100m profit from their shares, and has reminded banks of the potential benefits of equity participation in an improving economic environment. As Mr Richard Lovell, president of the Association of Property Bankers, argues: 'The banks' attitude towards debt-for-equity swaps has been that they are more likely to get their money out first in debt than in equity. It's down to a business culture. They don't see themselves as the right people to hold equity.' Bankers claim, however, that this is already changing. Substantial debt-for-equity swaps are being examined for Queen's Moat Hotels, Wembley, Stanhope and Tiphook, for example, and the performance of WPP can only provide encouragement. There are a number of reasons for the change. The last-ditch alternative, receivership, is an expensive option, and it can damage the value of potentially saleable assets. By comparison, a rising stock market, improving property valuations and low interest rates, have meant that many corporate near fatalities have been given the ability to survive. Mr Derek Sachs, director of specialised lending services at Royal Bank of Scotland, says: 'The first thing to do is see if they have a viable business, regardless of the debt structure.' The Royal Bank has set up a special unit to handle bad loans, and this has spearheaded a large increase in the number of equity swaps undertaken by the bank. In 1992 it instigated 420 receiverships, but following the introduction of its new bad debt division, this fell to 150 in 1993 and should drop to 100 this year, as it has looks for alternative solutions, such as swaps. Mr Sachs says: 'Traditionally, the UK clearing banks have been reluctant to convert debt into equity. We take the view that, more and more, we are looking at the overall financing of the company.' There are downsides. By initiating the swap, a bank is generally forced to make balance sheet provisions, since the value of the equity is unlikely to match that of the debt. As a shareholder, the bank's call upon the assets of the company is substantially reduced, so if the company does not survive, it is unlikely to get anything back. In addition, the size of the banking syndicates can complicate negotiations. Many continental European banks have historically been more relaxed about equity, but it has proved difficult for such disparate interest groups to reach agreement. In the case of WPP, the response to the efforts of Mr Martin Sorrell, its chief executive, for a restructuring, was far from unanimous from its 28-member banking syndicate. The Japanese banks were strongly against the debt-for-equity package. There have been a number of cases where such scepticism may have been justified. One of last year's larger debt-for-equity swaps, for distressed fuels group Anglo United, has left banks owning half the shares of a shrinking group. The consortium swapped Pounds 45.9m of debt into 459.3m new shares at 10p each, when the share price was only 5 1/2 p. HSBC, the main lender, was left with a 40 per cent stake. A further Pounds 74.9m of debt was swapped into convertible stock, with a 10p conversion price, and no interest, although the conversion price will be reduced to assume 10 per cent compound interest a year. The pricing of the new shares demonstrated the severity of Anglo United's corporate ailments in February 1993, and the banks would have made large provisions against their exposure to the company. The situation has since deteriorated. The Pounds 120m of restructured debt is worth a fraction of the original loan, as the share price has dropped to 1.34p, giving the entire company a market value of Pounds 16m. Even in such a case, however, the banks can still gain some recompense through the notoriously high fees for a restructuring. In the case of Anglo United, advisers and bankers took Pounds 8.9m in fees, while WPP's restructuring cost the company Pounds 13m, of which Pounds 9m went to the banks for providing new loan facilities. The decision often comes down to a lack of choice. The recession left many borrowers with more debt than they could ever expect to repay. Property companies, with negative net assets, have been a prime target for swaps, since property values have been rising far more rapidly than rents and the related ability to pay interest. Dares Estates, UK Land and Raglan Property Trust were all kept afloat through swaps which should deliver some return to bankers, where liquidation would have probably brought nothing. One corporate financier claimed the banks had already been too slow to react to change. 'They want to take equity now that values have gone up enormously', he said. 'But two years ago, when they have could have benefited substantially, they were just not interested.' Given the profits achieved by WPP's bankers, however, they may be encouraged to change their minds.</p>

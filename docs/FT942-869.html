			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: Support levels become a moving target - London When one of the most noted bears in London assures us that 'the markets are not going to crash', the bulls must indeed be having a bad time; Mr Nicholas Knight, international equity strategist at Nomura Research, added, however, that markets will merely 'trade to lower levels in true bear-market fashion', which offered only scant comfort to investors. That was written before the central banks made their concerted intervention to defend the dollar on Friday. The banks' move inspired a powerful bounce at the long end of the gilt-edged market and a determined rally to the Footsie 2,900 mark. This morning, the stock market will be watching to see if currency intervention alone can preserve the dollar. If, as the stock market believes, only action on interest rates can save the day, then share prices will again be at risk. 'Support levels' in the stock market have become something of a moving target, with the Footsie 2,920 no longer sacrosanct. For the record, the chartists fear that any further sell-off would leave the Footsie vulnerable right down to 2,800. Mr Knight believes that the dollar will remain under pressure until US short rates are materially higher. Until the problems of the US dollar are convincingly addressed, runs the market argument, bargain hunters in UK equities had best equip themselves with long spoons. On the brighter side, however, selling of equities remains fairly moderate and international broking houses maintain that there are heavy institutional buying orders waiting to go into UK equities as soon as the outlook becomes more settled. Views on UK equity market valuations remain favourable, although these are moving targets while bond market yields continue to threaten the 9 per cent level. Even at these levels, Strauss Turnbull sees an equity dividend yield of almost 4 per cent as indicating that shares are not expensive relative to conventional gilts. Like many others, Strauss Turnbull warns that the relative against index-linked gilts, now close to a multiple of one, gives no such support. For 'yield buyers', this is the time to buy UK equities. If bond markets are overshooting wildly in their fear of inflation, then prospective yields of 5 per cent on equities next year imply, according to S. G. Warburg, that equities would be able to hold the line even against yields of 10 per cent on long gilts.</p>

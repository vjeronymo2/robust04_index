			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISION REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'ORIGINAL SIN' IS A 'GODFATHER' CLONE  </P> <P> NBC hauls out the big guns tonight with Charlton Heston as an old world crime  lord in a "Godfather" clone called "Original Sin," airing at 9 p.m. on Channels  4, 36 and 39.  </P> <P> Nobody is safe in this one, not even the viewer. Ann Jillian plays Sharon  Richards, whose idyllic suburban life is disrupted when her small son is  kidnaped. Husband John (Robert Desiderio) is acting a little oddly; could he  have an idea who's responsible?  </P> <P> It turns out John isn't the orphan Sharon thought -- his dad is an aging king  of crime called Louis Mancini (Heston) and he just might be involved, directly  or indirectly, in the kidnaping.  </P> <P> It's been 10 years since he's been there, but John decides he can, after all,  go home again -- to get his son back. Naturally he won't get involved in the  family business.  </P> <P> Writer Philip F. Messina and director Ron Satlof don't believe in letting a  psychological motivation pass us by, nor do they miss a cliche, from loving  shots of guns being loaded for action, squealing car chases and slo-mo bloody  violence to climactic music before each commercial break.  </P> <P> Jillian, in her role as spunky, concerned Mom, is strong, and her emotions ring  true, but no one else comes close. Instead, intent is telegraphed with  significant looks and stock dialogue. In the end, it may be sheer inertia and a  faulty remote control that keeps viewers from seeing what the other networks  have going in this week's "sweeps-stakes" race. LYNNE HEFFLEY  </P></p>

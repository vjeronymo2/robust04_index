			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Italy's season of indignation: The April 5 election could see an exceptionally strong protest vote Like the opening of the shooting season in Italy, when hunters take to the field and shoot at almost anything that moves, the campaign for parliamentary elections on April 5 has begun with shots being fired in all directions. The campaign promises to be dirty. This is not surprising. For a number of reasons - the changes in the international climate, the growth of regional sentiment, widespread disenchantment with the political system, and the challenges facing Italy's economy in Europe - these are unusually important elections. In purely domestic terms, the elections will determine whether the ruling Christian Democrats can retain the hegemony they have enjoyed since 1946, the longest any party has held power in post-war Europe. The vote will also test the strength of the left following the collapse of communism in eastern Europe and the metamorphosis of the Italian Communist party, once the strongest in Europe, into the Party of the Democratic Left. In addition, the emergence of the populist Lombard League movement in northern Italy threatens to fragment the political arena and accentuate the divide between the rich north and the poor south. Internationally, the elections will determine whether Rome can provide a government with sufficient unity and purpose to bring the country into line with its chief partners in the EC. During the next two years Italy needs to reform public finances, reorganise public administration and strengthen industry if it is to comply with the EC convergence criteria agreed at the Maastricht summit in December. Mr Gianni de Michelis, the outgoing foreign minister, rightly claims that the main achievement of his government has been to commit Italy irrevocably to European union. Thus, the electoral agenda is largely being set by a combination of the dictates of Brussels and the consequences of the collapse of communism. Although Italy has enjoyed a vibrant democracy over the past four decades, with arguably a broader range of political parties and opinion than anywhere in western Europe, the electoral process has always been profoundly conditioned by east-west tensions. The uninterrupted rule of the Christian Democrats in 50 governments has ultimately depended on a fear of the Communist party's taking power through the ballot box. The removal of communism from eastern Europe, and the formal winding up of the Italian Communist party last year, have eliminated this constraint. The implicit, and sometimes explicit, backing of Washington for the Christian Democrats has evaporated and their traditional ally, the church, has begun to distance itself from a party which has tolerated corruption. The business community too has moved away from the party, and in the north is threatening to embrace the calls of the Lombard League for clean government. 'The country has the hope and the will for a big change,' says Mr Giorgio la Malfa, leader of the small opposition Republican party. Italy's system of proportional representation has produced 45 governments since 1948. In only 15 of these have the Christian Democrats ruled alone. The rest of the time, the party has depended on a revolving series of four coalition partners - the Socialists, the Republicans, the Liberals, and the Social Democrats. Already Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, has announced he would accept an invitation to form a government with the Christian Democrats on the understanding it would be the Socialists' turn to control the premiership. Such a carve-up of power between rivals may occur; but the system, which favours weak coalition governments, has reached the limits of usefulness. President Francesco Cossiga almost never ceases to call for change. The main parties have put forward ideas for electoral reform whose common thread is the search for a means to produce majority governments, stronger coalitions and the elimination from parliament of groups which obtain less than 5 per cent of the vote. Such proposals merely respond to a profound desire for change among the electorate and alone are unlikely to attract votes. Opinion polls show that what voters most want are improvements in public services, and solutions to problems such as traffic, pollution and crime. The ingredients exist for a strong protest vote. For the first time, polls have revealed that most voters - 40-45 per cent - are uncommitted. The record of the outgoing four-party coalition has contributed to this big floating vote. Mr Giulio Andreotti, the prime minister, leaves a public sector deficit equivalent to 10.5 per cent of gross domestic product, a near-worthless 1992 budget due to last year's overspending and a string of incomplete reforms. The 73-year-old Mr Andreotti, who has been prime minister seven times, epitomises the current impasse. Nobody would deny his consummate skills as a survivor able to navigate the channels of factional power and bureaucratic intrigue. But these are the skills of a discredited political class which regards government as a system of finely-balanced favours, rather than as a process that responds to citizens' needs and rights. What is almost palpable is popular frustration with constantly changing governments which recycle the same faces without addressing fundamental issues. These frustrations were underlined last June, when 27m voters, despite the hostility of the main political parties, endorsed a referendum ending the system of multi-preference votes in parliamentary elections. The innovation, to be tested in April, is designed to limit the power of party bureaucracies over the choice of candidates. The referendum has come to be seen as the most effective means of forcing change on an ossified parliament. No fewer than 10 referendums could be presented to Italian voters next year, on subjects ranging from the introduction of a first-past-the-post voting system for the Senate to the abolition of the Ministry for State Share-holdings. A central figure in the referendum movement is Mr Mario Segni, son of a former president and one of the rare new faces to emerge within the Christian Democrats. Until now the surge of opposition support has grouped round the Green and Radical parties, minority interest groups (such as pensioners) and small regional blocs, such as the one active in Sardinia. Above all, the protest vote has been galvanised by the eruption of the Lombard League in northern Italy, inspired by the fiery senator, Mr Umberto Bossi. He aspires to win more than 10 per cent of the vote nationwide, making the League the fourth-largest party in parliament. Mr Bossi has found a receptive audience for his outspoken criticism of corrupt central government which favours a 'decadent south' at the expense of the 'industrious north'. He has thrown down the gauntlet in his stronghold, Bergamo, saying: 'The mafiosi politicians know that if, by 1995, there is no change in the rules of the game, we will establish a Cisalpine constituent assembly at Pontida (near Bergamo).' This threat to establish an assembly for northern Italy alone may be no more than political blackmail, but it pleases his audience. In local elections in the north, the League has already proved it can split the Christian Democrats' vote. To keep its share of the vote above 30 per cent, the Christian Democrats are appealing to the electorate's fear of the unknown. They are also relying on their powers of patronage in the Rome area, and in the south. The Socialists too are on the defensive. Never having obtained more than 14 per cent of the vote, their strength has depended on a willingness to co-habit with the Christian Democrats. The one-year-old Party of the Democratic Left is struggling to establish an identity round an uncertain form of social democracy. Mr Achille Occhetto, its leader, has failed to convince the Socialists that his party is a worthy electoral ally. The party's strength remains the former communist heartland round Bologna and Florence. But a hardline communist rump has regrouped under the banner of Reconstituted Communism (Rifundazione Communista) and could absorb 10 per cent of the Democratic Left's vote. 'Above all else, the elections are going to be a huge opinion poll which will allow everyone to take stock,' says Mr Giuseppe Roma, deputy director of Censis, an independent research institute. Once politicians see how the pieces fall, they may realise that the party picture has become even more fractured than it is now, and that fresh elections with the promise of real reforms offer the only solution.</p>

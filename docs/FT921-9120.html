			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Observer: Beaming up If people are flying about more, is the recession over? BAA's monthly airport traffic figures do not have anywhere near the same impact as changes in US railroad box-car loadings once had on Wall Street sentiment, but they do suggest something is happening out there. A year ago everyone was on hold because of the Gulf War, so last month's 13 per cent jump is a distortion. Nevertheless January was the fourth month in a row to show a year-on-year increase and traffic on the Edinburgh- London route, regarded as a barometer of the domestic economy, has risen for the past two months and is up on January 1990 levels.</p>

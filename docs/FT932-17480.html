			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Lamont defends plans for sharp tax increases MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, yesterday defended his plans to increase taxes sharply in 1994-95 against charges that they will hit industrial and consumer confidence this year. Appearing before the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee, he said he wanted to make it 'crystal clear' that to leave the UK's high public sector borrowing requirement uncorrected would be to take an unacceptable risk with the medium-term prosperity of Britain. He said his Budget plan to tackle the deficit by raising revenues by 1 per cent of gross domestic product in 1994-95 and 1.4 per cent the following financial year was the best way of achieving sustained economic recovery. In his Budget, the chancellor forecast that the PSBR would reach Pounds 50bn in 1993-94 after Pounds 35bn in 1992-93. Earlier the committee had heard Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, declare that 'in all probability' the recession was over. Although Mr Leigh-Pemberton expressed concern about the prospect of unemployment continuing at its present high level of around 3m, he made clear that he did not favour a further cut in bank base rates from their current 6 per cent level. The Bank governor pleaded instead for a period of stable interest rates. He said he was sceptical whether further cuts would be passed on to borrowers by banks and building societies and whether they would help recovery further. Reacting to hostile questioning from Labour members of the cross-party committee who said he should have done more for the unemployed, the chancellor said that a return to growth and action on the deficit were the way to combat unemployment. Mr Lamont, who answered questions without notes or assistance from his officials for about 1 3/4 hours, made clear, however, that the main innovation of this year's Budget - the announcement of specific tax increases for future financial years - was unlikely to be a permanent feature of British fiscal policy. It was devised to handle the dilemma posed by a high and widening public sector deficit when confidence in economic recovery was fragile. A sharp tax rise beyond the Pounds 490m planned in the Budget for the 1993-94 financial year would have had a significant impact on confidence. Both Mr Leigh-Pemberton and Mr Lamont expressed some concern about the UK's high current account balance of payments deficit, which the Treasury expects to reach Pounds 17.5bn this year. However, the chancellor assured MPs that it would easily be financed. Both the governor and chancellor insisted that the UK was notpursuing a policy of competitive devaluation of sterling, in spite of the misgivings expressed by some of Britain's European Community partners. Both men spoke in favour of a stronger pound. In his testimony, Mr Leigh-Pemberton told the committee Britain might be 'living beyond its means' in spending too much on social security at a time of a growing government deficit. He said the high level of government spending on welfare benefits was a 'serious element' to the concern about the UK's large borrowing requirement. It was 'not impossible' that to reduce the deficit, the Treasury might have to increase taxes by more than the Pounds 16bn already promised in the next three years. UK government bonds surged by more than a point on news that the Bank of England's Pounds 3bn auction of 20-year gilts - the biggest auction of UK government stock - had been well-received. The Bank also announced a further Pounds 600m of 8 per cent stock due 2003 available for sale from today. Page 31 Lex, Page 22 Strong demand, Page 23 Bank governor gloomy on deficit, Page 11</p>

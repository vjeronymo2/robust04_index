The CIT says that a pair of close, parallel runways would provide additional capacity similar to that projected for the single runway suggested in the DoT's own report. It says they could probably be constructed wholly within the existing airport perimeter. The report rejects the idea that total UK air traffic will be the same if runway capacity is provided at airports other than Heathrow.

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Black civil rights leader dismissed The firing of Mr Benjamin Chavis as executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People brings to an end one of the most tumultuous episodes in the 85-year history of the oldest and largest US civil rights organisation. Mr Chavis, a fiery preacher who has sought to bring younger and more radical blacks into the NAACP, was sacked by a nearly unanimous board of directors, after an eight-hour emergency meeting in Baltimore on Saturday. The board said Mr Chavis had 'embarked on a course of conduct which is inimical to the best interests of the association.' The immediate cause of his dismissal was the controversy over a Dollars 332,000 (Pounds 214,000) settlement reached, using NAACP funds, with a former assistant who had charged him with sexual discrimination and later with sexual harassment. Mr Chavis has denied the charges. He said after his dismissal that he was 'the victim of an orchestrated campaign to defame my character and my integrity.' The allegations threw fuel on a deeper argument over the philosophical departure which Mr Chavis had sought to bring to the NAACP. In the organisation's heyday - the 1950s and 1960s, when it won a series of civil rights victories in the US courts and the Congress - its leaders used to keep to the country's integrationist mainstream, allying itself with Jewish groups and white liberals, but shunning black nationalist leaders such as Malcolm X. Mr Chavis, in contrast, has lately held meetings with urban gangs and, most controversially, has sought to embrace Mr Louis Farrakhan, head of the Nation of Islam organisation. Mr Farrakhan outstrips other US black leaders in his appeal to young urban blacks. But his anti-semitism has made him the object of fierce argument. Mr Chavis's overtures to him have repelled many of the remaining Jewish backers of the NAACP, as well as many black moderates, and have turned away some corporate contributors. The debate will continue to simmer after Mr Chavis's departure. NAACP leaders in the 1950s regarded the go-it-alone ideas of the black nationalists as 'segregated thinking', but such ideas have since been linked with the 'empowerment agenda' of conservative political thinkers. This brings a response from many black activists, who feel the time has come for organisations such as the NAACP to move away from a programme basically aimed at getting white people and white institutions to change, and to concentrate instead on self-help within the black community in the US. Mr Chavis's successor will have to cope not only with this philosophical divide, but also with a series of organisational problems. Precise facts about the NAACP's finances and membership are unclear. Mr Chavis and his opponents continue to argue about whether he inherited a financial deficit and whether he has increased membership. The organisation itself has refused clarification. It appears certain, however, that the NAACP faces a deficit of about Dollars 3m, worsened at least in part by Mr Chavis's extensive travel programme and by substantial pay increases he awarded to senior staff. What's more, even if Mr Chavis has increased the NAACP's membership, which some critics dispute, that increase has come overwhelmingly among young members who pay much lower dues and thus are doing less to dig the NAACP out of its financial hole.</p>

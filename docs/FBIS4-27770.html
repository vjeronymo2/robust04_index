			<p>BFN     [Text] Working-level meetings in the Japan-U.S. framework  trade talks resumed in Tokyo on 1 June. "Theological arguments  over definitions of terms" (as stated by a senior Foreign  Ministry official), such as objective criteria, came to an end  for the time being at informal negotiations held in May.  Sectoral talks will now be held to discuss setting "objective  criteria" to gauge foreign access to Japanese markets. However,  there arises a possibility that the dispute between Japan and  the United States over the meaning of objective criteria could  further intensify, since the interests of relevant industries  would be involved. It is still uncertain as to how much  progress would be made in the trade talks by late June, when it  is hoped an agreement will be reached.    On the day following announcement of the resumption of the  bilateral trade talks, Walter Mondale, U.S. ambassador to Japan,  and Tatsuro Toyoda, chairman of the Japan Automobile  Manufacturers Association, held talks in Tokyo. Although  details of the meeting were not disclosed, officials concerned  believe that "prior to the resumption of the trade talks, the  ambassador made it perfectly clear that the United States wants  Japan to pour greater efforts into selling imported  automobiles." They feel so all the more because in the past,  the ambassador has questioned the Japanese marketing system,  saying, "Only a small number of dealers in Japan handle foreign  automobiles."    Automobile and auto parts trade, which accounts for a large  portion of the Japanese trade surplus with the United States, is  the greatest pending issue among the three priority sectors in  the framework trade talks. Although a certain amount of  progress has been made in the insurance and government  procurement sectors, discussions on automobiles and auto parts,  for the most part, are yet to reach the final stages.    In a lecture, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said:  "Japan should be able to promise to increase the number of  imported car dealers within a designated period." In reaction,  an official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  in charge of trade negotiations complained: "This is tantamount  to numerical targets and is beyond government control, so we  cannot accept it." There is also a possibility that Japan may be  pressed with new U.S. demands in the insurance and government  procurement sectors where talks are to be held along with the  automobiles sector.    Punitive measures will be in the picture when talks are held  on five additional sectors that the United States has asked to  have included as priority areas. Regarding sheet glass and  forestry products, the United States hints at imposing punitive  measures by reinstating the Super 301 provision (for determining  and taking counteraction against unfair traders and trade  practices) of the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act.  Regarding intellectual property rights, the United States hints  at imposing punitive measures under the Special 301 provision of  the 1988 U.S. Trade Act. In the financial services sector, the  United States is moving toward enacting by the yearend a  legislation that will allow it to take retaliatory action  against unfair practices.    Moreover, the possibility of the United States making  further  demands regarding macroeconomic policies has not disappeared,  either. The U.S. Government has said that it "would praise  Japan if it decides to implement tax cuts for three years ahead  of tax hikes" (as stated by Lloyd Bentsen, U.S. secretary of  treasury) to help it boost domestic demand. However, it is also  not clear whether the ruling coalition parties would be able to  make a final decision on a consumption tax hike in June. In  that case, it would become difficult to extend income tax cuts  for up to three years.    Japanese and U.S. leaders hope to reach accords on at least  three of the priority sectors by the July Naples summit and use  this as an opportunity to help stabilize their political  steering. However, in some quarters of the industrial circles,  which closely watch in which direction the trade talks are  headed, there are those who feel indifferent. For example, the  head of an industrial materials manufacturing firm has said: "In  the end, the talks will wind up being ambiguous with decisions  put off. The framework trade talks is a game played by  bureaucrats and lawyers."    Despite such circumstances, however, a point of compromise  must be found. Apparently, Japanese and U.S. leaders must find  a way to break the ice, eying the possibility of making  political decisions, while not simply letting bureaucrats take  care of the issue.</p>

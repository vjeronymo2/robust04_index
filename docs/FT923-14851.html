			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Chirac falls in behind Maastricht MR Jacques Chirac, leader of France's RPR Gaullist opposition party, has ended weeks of uncertainty by declaring that he will vote for the Maastricht treaty on European union. His decision, announced at a party meeting on Saturday, puts Mr Chirac in a minority in his own party. In an attempt to reduce divisions, Mr Chirac told RPR members they were free to vote as they liked in the September 20 referendum on Maastricht. 'I do not want an isolated France and a divided Europe,' he added. President Francois Mitterrand's decision to call the referendum has split the RPR between a pro-European leadership and a nationalist majority led by Mr Charles Pasqua. For a while, Mr Chirac said he was unable to come to a view and needed time to consider. Opinion polls suggest a majority will vote for Maastricht, so it would be unwise to campaign on anti-EC policies. According to a poll in Journal du Dimanche, 58 per cent will vote to ratify the treaty and 42 per cent against.</p>

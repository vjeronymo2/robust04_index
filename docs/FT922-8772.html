			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Hungary plans to boost infrastructure spending HUNGARY'S conservative government is to boost infrastructural spending and accelerate privatisation in an effort to 'initiate growth in the near future', it said yesterday. In a significant change of tack, the cabinet decided at the weekend that infrastructure spending would also involve using private funds to boost investment in roads and telecommunications. The initiative, designed to quell public impatience after two years of recession, coincides with growing speculation about the replacement of Mr Mihaly Kupa, the finance minister, by a more expansionist minister. The extent of the social pain being caused by economic reforms was made all the more clear by unemployment figures showing more than 500,000 registered out of work in April Nevertheless, the government is severely constrained by a spiralling public-sector deficit. The budget was in deficit by Ft66.7bn (Pounds 471m) in the first four months.</p>

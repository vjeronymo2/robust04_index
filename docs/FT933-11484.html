			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Letter: Claims on London's taxes Sir, Wealth, as measured by local gross domestic product, relates not merely to the local population ('London's tax burden criticised', July 27). In the reported comparison by the Centre for Economics and Business Research, London's GDP of Dollars 122bn is attributed to its 6.8m inhabitants. Yet a much larger population depends on London for its income. The Home Counties send hundreds of thousands of workers into the metropolis daily to work. It is inevitable that the crude London GDP per capita should be much higher than the British average. Certainly, London has a good claim to a fair return from the Treasury for taxes paid by staff and businesses. So in part does the larger population on which London depends for its success. This is one reason why taxes exceed public expenditure in London and other urban centres. The challenge in public spending is to arbitrate between the conflicting demands of business and people for funds to be channelled to their needs. Peter Tompkins, 7 Acton Street, London WC1X 9LX</p>

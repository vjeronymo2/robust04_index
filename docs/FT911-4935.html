			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / UK Company News: UK recovery buoys Albert Martin ALBERT MARTIN, the clothing manufacturer and importer, raised pre-tax profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 2.04m over 1990. Turnover was ahead from Pounds 69.11m to Pounds 78.11m. The recovery in UK operating profits, up 35 per cent to Pounds 1.98m, was helped by increased business with Marks and Spencer. New and established businesses helped overseas profits to Pounds 1.69m (Pounds 1.36m). While noting that the current trading climate remains 'extremely difficult', Mr Michael Kidd, chairman, was optimistic about prospects. Earlier this year the board was reorganised, as a move to increase efficiency of the group's manufacturing facilities, while developing its ability to source other merchandise worldwide. With capital expenditure of Pounds 2.4m, increased borrowings and high interest rates pushed net finance charges to Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 1.22m), although net borrowings at the year-end were little changed, amounting to 39 per cent of shareholders' funds. After an extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.8m, representing a UK plant closure to improve manufacturing efficiency, and minorities of Pounds 82,000 (Pounds 101,000), earnings per share rose 36 per cent to 9p (6.6p). An increased final dividend of 2.6p brings the total to 4.2p (4p). The shares closed at 70p, up 12p.</p>

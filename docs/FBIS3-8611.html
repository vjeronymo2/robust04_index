			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In an interview for the "First Program" of Polish  Radio and for the Polish Press Agency, Prime Minister Waldemar  Pawlak said that the overall demands of Solidarity were  justified but could not be achieved through strikes:    [Begin Pawlak recording] When we look at these demands,  these general demands concerning, for example, an increase in  real wages, I have to say that I, too, am in favor of the  implementation of these demands. The [word indistinct] of  putting forward such a demand is perhaps very big, and the  general, noble, intention is very visible, but afterwards it has  to be implemented. We want, through our actions, to bring about  the implementation of this intention. When we speak of limiting  the growth of energy carriers, I, too, am in favor of such a  solution. In this budget, we can already see a visible decrease  in the growth rate of energy prices in comparison with what had  been planned as late as in the second half of last year or  compared with the growth rate of prices that were implemented  last year.    I would like to remind you that our government limited these  price increases, and it seems to me that the difference between  us here lies in how to implement these demands successfully. I  am also in favor of implementing them. As I have said, however,  if we were to discuss and compete on the level of ideas as to  how to do this better and more quickly, it would certainly be of  benefit to us all. I would encourage the holding of such a  discussion and such a debate. [end recording]</p>

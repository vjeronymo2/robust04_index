			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Concerning the method for resumption of North-South  dialogue, the government will induce North Korea to make a  proposal for dialogue first, rather than the South's side making  a proposal. This was learned on 16 January.    The government discussed this with relevant officials from  the U.S. side and agreed that the United States would induce  North Korea to propose a working-level contact for the exchange  of special envoys between the North and the South when the  negotiation for nuclear inspection between North Korea and the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] is completed and when  a contact is held between the United States and North Korea for  an agreement on the date of the third round of talks.    A relevant government official said that since the North  side  refused the contact for the exchange of special envoys last  year, it is natural that North Korea should propose the  resumption of dialogue first, referring to remarks by Deputy  Prime Minister and Unification Minister Yi Yong-tok who stressed  that "we should not propose dialogue to the North merely for the  sake of dialogue and should face the North in a dignified  manner."</p>

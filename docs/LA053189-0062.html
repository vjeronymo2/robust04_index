			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FINE OF $35,000 UNFAIR, AVALON SAYS  </P> <P> Officials in Avalon are upset over what they call a "grossly unfair" fine of  $35,000 levied against the city for sewage discharge violations by the Los  Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board, even though the fine is less than  the board initially recommended.  </P> <P> In a March hearing, the board had recommended a fine of $100,000 but reduced  that on appeal after considering the city's ability to pay and Avalon  officials' stated intent to keep the Avalon waste treatment plant in  compliance, said David Gildersleeve, the board's supervising engineer.  </P> <P> The fine was levied despite explanations by city officials that mechanical  failures and employee turnover contributed to violations of the city's sewage  discharge permit at the plant in November and December of 1988.  </P> <P> "We think the facts indicated a much lower fine or no fine at all would have  been reasonable," City Manager Chuck Prince said.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Specific Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Most of the commenters objected to the inclusion of the definition of audit in &sect;230.452. These comments questioned the need to define a term that is used so little in the body of the regulations. One commenter pointed out that the word ``audit'' appears only three times in the rule (except in a section heading), and then only in conjunction with the word ``review.'' Accordingly, it is suggested that the definition adds nothing to the comprehension of the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MMS agrees with the comments and the definition of audit has been removed from the final regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Several commenters objected to the provisions of &sect;230.453(a)(3) which require MMS notification to the lessee that its request for refund or credit is authorized before a recoupment can be filed. Once MMS reviews the request, transmits it to Congress and the Congressional review period is satisfied, these commenters argue that they should be permitted to recoup. These commenters claim MMS is exceeding its authority by conditioning the lessee's right to a timely filed legitimate credit or refund on the receipt of a notice from the MMS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MMS disagrees with these comments. First, it is the Government's responsibility to assure that the technical requirements of section 10, including the 30-day congressional review period, have been satisfied before a recoupment is effected. Second, the requirement for MMS to give final approval allows for proper control. After MMS approves a recoupment, then it will know that when a credit adjustment appears on a Form MMS&hyph;2014, that credit adjustment is authorized. Further, there may be circumstances where a request for refund or credit is approved, but MMS may not allow the recoupment to be effected. MMS recently proposed rules related to administrative offset and to credit adjustments generally (58 FR 43582, August 17, 1993). There may be circumstances where a lessee owes money to MMS and MMS would want to retain the otherwise approved request for refund or credit as an offset. Thus, recoupments will not be permitted until MMS provides approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Several commenters objected to the requirements of &sect;230.453(b)(5) that lessees certify the accuracy of the data submitted in the refund request. One commenter noted that there is no necessity for the certification since the provisions of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 (FOGRMA) already contain adequate protection of the Federal lessor. According to this commenter, the certification adds nothing but additional paperwork to the process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MMS disagrees with these comments. It has been a long standing practice of MMS to require the certification as a condition of processing the refund. This is not a new requirement. Most lessees have long made the certification part of their refund request form letter, so no additional burden will be imposed by this requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The provisions of &sect;230.453(c) specifically state that the submission of a credit adjustment on a Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance, Form MMS&hyph;2014, will not constitute a refund request, or a partially completed refund request as discussed in &sect;230.453(c). Additionally, &sect;230.459 does not include the filing of a Form MMS&hyph;2014 as a reason the 2-year period of section 10 will be tolled. MMS requested comment on this issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eight responders offered comments on the status of a Form MMS&hyph;2014 as a section 10 refund request and if such filing should toll the 2-year limit. Four commenters stated that the Form MMS&hyph;2014 should toll the 2-year period since it includes nearly all elements of a properly completed refund request. Another commenter proposed that the Form MMS&hyph;2014 should serve as a conditional refund request. If during later audit it was judged valid, MMS should process the request for congressional review. If invalid, the lessee would be required to repay the amount of the credit with interest and apply for a refund. When more than 2 years had passed since making payment, the lessee would be time-barred from recovering the funds. It was urged that these procedures would serve as an incentive for lessees to only file credits in which they had a high level of confidence in their validity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While noting that tolling the 2-year period by filing a Form MMS&hyph;2014 would not benefit them, the sixth commenter observed that it would encourage lessees to file unauthorized recoupments on questionable properties ``just in case.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The last two commenters noted that most of the unauthorized recoupments filed in the past resulted from MMS' failure to issue formal guidance on the application of section 10. They recognized that this rulemaking resolves that problem, and they see no value to lessees in the future to toll the 2-year period by filing an unauthorized credit adjustment. With the publication of these rules, the commenters stated that lessees will know what adjustments are and are not subject to section 10. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MMS disagrees with the first four commenters. While Form MMS&hyph;2014 filings contain most of the information required for a refund request, they do not include the information necessary to constitute a proper request for refund or credit. Moreover, these credit adjustments do not request recoupments, instead they effect recoupments and thereby reduce Government receipts. Section 10 requires MMS and congressional review  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> before  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the funds are recovered. The conditional refund request suggestion also would not meet this requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

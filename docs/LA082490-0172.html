			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> UMPIRES FIRE BACK AT PHILLIES  </P> <P> The head of the umpires union has formally complained to the National League  president about the Philadelphia Phillies' criticism of umpire Joe West  following the club's 3-2 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers Wednesday.  </P> <P> Union chief Richie Phillips said he asked league President Bill White to punish  Phillies Manager Nick Leyva and General M anager Lee Thomas for their "savage  attack" on West following the defeat.  </P> <P> "It is outrageous that the Phillies use the umpires as a scapegoat," Phillips  told the Philadelphia Inquirer. "It is absolutely ludicrous that Joe West, or  any other umpire, in any way or fashion has a vendetta for the Phillies."  </P> <P> West, working first base, ejected Von Hayes after Hayes criticized home plate  umpire Harry Wendelstedt. Hayes said he was talking to his first-base coach.  West said Hayes "cursed" Wendelstedt and deserved ejection.  </P> <P> After the game, Thomas said West had "tried to play God on us" and Leyva said  West "just isn't a professional" and was trying to "stick it" to the Phillies.  On Thursday, Leyva called West "arrogant" and said, "he's got this macho thing,  he's got to show everybody that he's the boss."  </P></p>

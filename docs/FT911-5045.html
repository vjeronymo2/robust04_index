			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Observer: Europals All of a sudden everybody seems to want to visit the European Parliament. Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, was first on the guest list for this week's Strasbourg session, dropping in on the president of the parliament and socialist MEPs. But that did not prevent him being given a rough ride by some socialists. Jean-Pierre Cot, the socialist leader, praised him as 'amiable' but sometimes 'over the top, demagogic and irresponsible'. Still, at least Yeltsin had space to wander the corridors of the parliament's Strasbourg home without bumping into other international celebrities. A couple of days later and he would have been jostling for room with UN secretary-general Javier Perez de Cuellar (due today), Patricio Aylwin, Chile's president (scheduled for tomorrow), and an eclectic list of global statespeople including the Patriarch of Jerusalem, the speaker of the Swedish parliament, and ex-King Simeon of Bulgaria. Happily, there is no risk of MEPs losing their sense of perspective on more important Euro-issues. This week they have also been promised a visit from a group lobbying on behalf of France's camembert-producers.</p>

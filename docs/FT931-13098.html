			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News in Brief BANG &amp; OLUFSEN, the Danish audio and video equipment maker, made a DKr67m (Dollars 10.9m) pre-tax loss for the six months to November, against a profit of DKr2m last time, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. Sales fell from DKr1.16bn to DKr1.06bn. Last month, the group announced 400 redundancies and a reorganisation of its European sales organisation. Charges for changes in the sales network and the lower turnover were blamed for the poor first-half result. The group said December sales were satisfactory, and forecast a break-even result for the current half year. ***** Illinois Tool Works (ITW), the US engineering group, has extended its ADollars 94m (USDollars 64.8m) takeover offer for Siddons Ramset, the Australian hardware and fasteners group, until February 16, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney. ITW, which has bid ADollars 2 a share for Siddons through an Australian subsidiary, said it had extended the bid to allow financial institutions more time to accept. Pacific BBA, a subsidiary of BBA, the UK toolmaker, effectively abandoned a rival bid for Siddons earlier this month by announcing that its ADollars 88m offer would not be increased or extended beyond the deadline of January 27. ***** Brierley Investments, the New Zealand investment group, has unwound a joint venture with Guinness Peat Group (GPG), the UK investment company, set up to acquire Australian Consolidated Investments (Acil). Mr Paul Collins, chief executive, said Brierley had acquired GPG's half-share in Rossington Investments, the joint venture vehicle owning 96 per cent of Acil. Rossington bought Acil for ADollars 131m (USDollars 90.3m) in May last year after a takeover battle orchestrated by Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand entrepreneur, who is chairman of GPG and a director of Brierley. Acil recently sold its main asset, National Brewing Holdings, one of Australia's two main brewers, to Lion Nathan, the New Zealand brewer.</p>

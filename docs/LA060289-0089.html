			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEIJING TIGHTENS CURBS ON FOREIGN REPORTING  </P> <P> China clamped tight new martial-law restrictions on foreign reporting in  Beijing on Thursday, banning interviews with Chinese citizens and virtually all  other forms of press coverage.  </P> <P> The new rules also ban any photographing or videotaping in the areas around  Tian An Men Square, the center of the city where approximately 10,000 young  Chinese are continuing their demonstrations for democracy.  </P> <P> The crackdown on foreign news reporting could well signal an impending move by  the Chinese regime to clear the demonstrators from Tian An Men Square. Early  Thursday morning, a small contingent of Chinese troops was seen marching down a  city street near the square.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Hint From Mayor  </P> <P> In another hint that the authorities are on the verge of removing the  pro-democracy demonstrators, Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong told a group of children  Thursday: "I think that you will soon be able to pay tribute to the  revolutionary martyrs at the Monument to the People's Heroes."  </P> <P> That monument is located in the center of Tian An Men Square and is now  surrounded by the demonstrators.  </P> <P> Late Thursday night, tensions in downtown Beijing were high.  </P> <P> A crowd of students gathered outside the gate of the Beijing municipal police  headquarters near the south end of the square. Another crowd assembled outside  the gate of Zhongnanhai, the Communist Party headquarters. Onlookers listening  to students' speeches at Zhongnanhai spilled into Beijing's main thoroughfare,  partially blocking the street.  </P> <P> All but a few of the students outside Zhongnanhai dispersed around midnight.  But about 500 students and a few other people, incensed by an alleged police  beating of a student, spent the entire night in angry protest outside the  police headquarters.  </P> <P> Despite the tenseness of the confrontation, both sides showed great restraint,  as has been typical of virtually all such confrontations between students and  security forces since martial law was imposed May 20.  </P> <P> "Down with dictatorship! Long live democracy!" shouted the students, who  despite their obvious anger maintained order throughout the night.  </P> <P> The police, including about 20 who stood guard under a bright spotlight in  front of the station throughout the night, showed virtually no reaction to the  crowd, as if they were afraid of provoking a bigger incident.  </P> <P> "These students aren't in turmoil," said a middle-aged woman who joined the  crowd. "Our government is in turmoil. The police are in turmoil. They're  arresting people as they please. Do we have laws or don't we? The officers must  obey the law. The (officer who allegedly beat the student) should be punished  severely according to the law."  </P> <P> At dawn, the voice of a student who allegedly was beaten came on a police  loudspeaker, after discussions inside police headquarters that included two or  three other protesters, and said that officials had agreed to discuss the  incident more thoroughly and seek to resolve it in a mid-morning meeting with  student representatives.  </P> <P> The alleged victim then urged the crowd to go back to Tian An Men Square to  rest. Those gathered outside immediately accepted this and dispersed.  </P> <P> Over the last few days, Chinese authorities have shown increasing irritation  over a huge white "Goddess of Democracy" statue that Beijing art students  erected at Tian An Men, just across from the portrait of Mao Tse-tung  overlooking the square. Thousands of young Chinese have had their pictures  taken in front of the Styrofoam-and-plaster "Goddess," which resembles the  Statue of Liberty.  </P> <P> Students camped on the square pitched 60 red and blue camping tents on all  sides of the statue to help ensure that no sudden raid by police or soldiers  could snatch it away.  </P> <P> The official Chinese news media have begun to take a tougher line towards the  pro-democracy demonstrators, suggesting that the regime's hands-off approach of  the past few weeks is coming to an end.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A State of Anarchy'  </P> <P> "Many places have been in a state of anarchy," the Beijing Daily, this city's  official newspaper, declared Thursday. "The degree of disorder in some sense  has been similar to that of the Cultural Revolution."  </P> <P> Chinese officials announced the new restrictions on press coverage here during  a weekly news briefing at the Chinese Foreign Ministry.  </P> <P> "Without the approval by the Beijing Municipal People's Government, foreign  journalists or journalists from Hong Kong, Macao or Taiwan shall conduct no  press coverage, photographing, and videotaping of the troops enforcing martial  law," said Ding Weijun, a spokesman for the Beijing government.  </P> <P> Ding said press coverage, photographing or filming is banned in the downtown  areas around Tian An Men Square and the Great Hall of the People.  </P> <P> The rules also bar foreign correspondents from "press coverage in a disguised  form, such as making appointments with Chinese citizens to meet at the offices  or residences of foreign journalists . . . or at hotels or elsewhere."  </P> <P> Reporters or photographers who run afoul of the new rules have no rights of  appeal to the Chinese courts. The decree on news reporting says it is up to  Beijing municipal authorities to settle disputes over how the rules should be  interpreted.  </P> <P> However, authorities gave no indication of how strictly or swiftly they would  seek to enforce the new rules, and it was unclear even whether they are united  in their will to do so. Members of the foreign press corps said they will  continue working as they had before until officials clarify their intentions.  </P> <P> China has expelled at least five foreign correspondents over the past decade.  The most recent two cases were in early 1987, when an American reporter for  Agence France Presse and a Japanese reporter for Kyodo News Service were forced  to leave China after their coverage of student demonstrations for democracy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Earlier Rules Vague  </P> <P> When the Chinese regime first imposed martial law in Beijing nearly two weeks  ago, it included a series of restrictions on foreign press coverage. But those  earlier rules were vaguely worded -- leaving unclear, for example, whether they  applied in the areas around Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> Over the last few days, Chinese authorities have called in representatives of  several foreign television networks, the British Broadcasting Corp. and the  Japanese newspaper Yomiuri to warn them about possible violations of martial  law.  </P> <P> The Foreign Correspondents Club of Beijing issued a written statement Thursday  calling the restrictions on foreign reporting here "a deplorable case of press  censorship and harassment." The ban on press coverage "calls into question  China's policy of openness to the outside world," the statement said.  </P> <P> Despite the imposition of martial law in the nation's capital and the  disappearance from public sight of Communist Party General Secretary Zhao  Ziyang, who refused to endorse the martial-law decree, the Chinese regime told  foreign correspondents Thursday that there are no serious problems here.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Says Government Is Stable  </P> <P> Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua assured reporters at the weekly news  briefing that the Chinese government is stable. She said China's policies on  economic reform and opening to the outside world are unchanged.  </P> <P> "China hopes that foreign investment in China won't be affected," she said.  </P> <P> Li also asserted that there have been no changes in leadership positions of the  Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, the People's Liberation Army  or the National People's Congress.  </P> <P> Beijing remains surrounded by an estimated 150,000 to 300,000 troops called  here from other regions of China when some of the People's Liberation Army  forces stationed in the Beijing area reportedly refused to enforce martial law  here.  </P> <P> Zhao, the party secretary, has not been seen since the night of May 19, when he  made an emotional, tearful appearance before some of the demonstrators. He has  reportedly been under house arrest. In addition, a source in Hong Kong who is  in touch with Zhao's family has reported that the Chinese Communist Party was  preparing to denounce Zhao as a counterrevolutionary.  </P> <P> Hong Kong newspapers have reported that several other senior Chinese officials,  including Defense Minister Qin Jiwei and Wan Li, chairman of the Standing  Committee of the National People's Congress, would be ousted from their  leadership positions along with Zhao.  </P> <P> Besides having the potential to inhibit foreign press coverage at Tian An Men  Square, the new restrictions on news reporting may also be aimed at cutting out  leaks from Chinese sources to foreign correspondents about the ongoing power  struggle within the Communist Party.  </P> <P> Over the past week, several documents have circulated which give accounts of  recent party deliberations, such as a reported speech by President Yang  Shangkun urging party elders to take action against Zhao.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In response to the agreement on the  demilitarization of the exclusion zone 3 km east of the Drina  River, which UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] and the Serbian  aggressor's side signed on 21 May, the press center of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has been authorized to announce the  following:    Representatives of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army did not take  part in the signing of the agreement, although an offer was made  to them. They were not obliged to take part because the  agreement is not in line with UN Resolution 913 and NATO's  ultimatum, which clearly specify the obligations assumed by  UNPROFOR and the Serbian aggressor side. This makes it clear to  UNPROFOR representatives that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army will  be ready to discuss the implementation of UN Resolution 913 and  NATO's ultimatum in the future.    The situation in the field shows that the Serb aggressors  have not fulfilled all obligations specified in the above  mentioned documents. Among other things, they have not  withdrawn military units and weapons from the 3-km exclusion  zone around the town center. Furthermore, the aggressors' heavy  weapons are still in the 20-km zone around Gorazde and are not  under UNPROFOR's control. There are one tank, six howitzers,  seven [word indistinct], one self-propelled weapon, one 100-mm  cannon, and three antiaircraft guns in the 20-km zone. The  complete evacuation of the wounded has not been made possible,  and living conditions of the residents in the protected area  have not improved.    We stress that representatives of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Army  [break in reception] are ready to discuss the resolution of the  situation on the Bosnia-Herzegovina battlefields and other  decisions that will be based on UN and NATO resolutions.</p>

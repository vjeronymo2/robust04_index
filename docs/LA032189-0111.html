			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Micronics Records Subpoenaed: Pentagon criminal investigators probing  allegations that faulty electronic parts were placed in thousands of tactical  missiles subpoenaed eight years of business records from Micronics  International, a Brea defense contractor that has been the subject of a  criminal inquiry since last summer. The records concern Micronics' dealings  with Asher Engineering of Baldwin Park, a subcontractor that alleges it was  following orders from Micronics when it falsely certified that the parts met  military specifications. Failure of the switches could affect the reliability  of most of the nation's air-launched missiles. G. Addison Appleby, chairman and  chief executive of Micronics' parent firm, Precision Aerotech of La Jolla, said  a member of Precision's board was launching an internal investigation of the  charges. Micronics has denied any wrongdoing.  </P></p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Italy battle to 1-0 win after 'keeper is sent off Italy overcame a one-man disadvantage after goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca was sent off to beat Norway 1-0 last night in a bruising game at Giants Stadium in New Jersey. Pagliuca was ejected for touching the ball outside the penalty area and tripping Norway's Oyvind Leonhardsen as he closed on the Italian goal from a Norwegian breakaway. Bringing on substitute 'keeper Marchegiani, Italy surprisingly took off Roberto Baggio, who until then had looked the most likely to find an opening goal. Norway's strategy of deep defence and swift counter-attacking backfired in the second half when Italy's ten men battled to a deserved lead. Dino Baggio's close range header from Guiseppe Signori's 69th-minute free kick gave Italy three desperately-needed points. The result leaves Ireland, Italy and Norway tied in Group E with three points each.</p>

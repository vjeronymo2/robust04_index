			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TARKANIAN WINS AGAIN IN AN OLD HAUNT, 97-76  </P> <P> Returning to the Cal State Long Beach gym where he had never lost from 1968 to  '73 as coach of the 49ers, Jerry Tarkanian won again Tuesday night.  </P> <P> "I remember some great things about this gym," the Nevada Las Vegas coach said  after the Runnin' Rebels defeated Long Beach, 97-76, in a Big West Conference  game before a crowd of 1,889.  </P> <P> Tarkanian had to wait awhile for his return to the place where he once won 34  straight games. In recent seasons the two teams played at the Long Beach Arena.  </P> <P> What he probably will remember most about Tuesday night's game will be the  shooting of guard Anderson Hunt, who made 5 straight 3-point shots in the  second half to break out of a slump and lead the Rebels, who improved to 8-2  overall and 3-0 in the Big West.  </P> <P> Going into the game, Hunt had made only 11 of 50 shots from 3-point range.  </P> <P> "I've been telling him every game to keep shooting," Tarkanian said. "Anderson  is a great shooter."  </P> <P> Las Vegas led only 63-53 with 9:54 to play when Hunt got hot, and they had that  margin mainly because of Long Beach's poor foul shooting. At that point, the  49ers had made only 6 of 16 free throws.  </P> <P> But 3 minutes later, following a run that included 4 of Hunt's long shots, the  Rebels were up 78-56.  </P> <P> The presence of the 12th-ranked Rebels quickly brought out the best in the  49ers. Normally a 39% shooting team from the floor, Long Beach shot 57% in the  first half.  </P> <P> "I thought we could have easily walked away at halftime with a tie if we had  made our free throws," said Long Beach Coach Joe Harrington, whose team dropped  to 3-7 and 0-1.  </P> <P> With center John Hatten scoring 9 points in the first 5 minutes, Long Beach  led, 15-13, until a 3-pointer by Clint Rossum put the Rebels ahead, 15-13. Long  Beach was never in front again.  </P> <P> The 49ers tied the game at 20 but at halftime were down, 46-35.  </P> <P> "Our defense was terrible in the first half," Tarkanian said. "We kept getting  beat individually, and our front line didn't come to play.."  </P> <P> Tarkanian, known for his devotion to the man-to-man defense, then switched  successfully to a zone in the second half. Against it, Long Beach's shooting  dropped to 46%.  </P> <P> "We didn't run our offense the way we normally run it, so it made their defense  look a lot better," Harrington said.  </P> <P> The 49ers' press, which bothered Las Vegas last season in 2 games the teams  split, had little effect this time.  </P> <P> "It didn't bother us," Tarkanian said.  </P> <P> That didn't surprise Harrington.  </P> <P> "I knew they had a better team this year in the backcourt," Harrington said.  </P> <P> Hunt led Las Vegas with 21 points, while center David Butler had 18.  </P> <P> Hatten scored 17 for the 49ers.  </P></p>

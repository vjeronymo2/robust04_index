			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Why independents are being deleted: Michael Skapinker on an industry in which 'they say there's no such thing as a joint venture or merger' WHEN FACTORY Communications, the Manchester-based music company, went into receivership this week it was honest enough not to heap all the blame on the recession. The company said that the 'factory tried to do too many things, from adventurous buildings to ambitious recording projects, at a time when some foresight of the negative economic climate to come might have suggested restraint'. The collapse of Factory, which was founded by Mr Anthony Wilson and closely associated with Manchester's 1980s youth culture boom, casts further doubt on the viability of independent music companies. Many of those that have survived have done so only by selling out to large publicly quoted music conglomerates. Last March, Mr Richard Branson sold his Virgin Music group to Thorn EMI. PolyGram, the London-based music group owned by Philips of the Netherlands, bought Island Records in 1989 and A&amp;M Records in 1990. Geffen, an independent US label, was acquired by MCA in 1990. In the same year, MCA was itself taken over by Matsushita, the Japanese electronics conglomerate. In deciding it needed a music business, Matsushita was following Sony, which in 1988 bought CBS, the US record company. One of Virgin's founders, Mr Steve Lewis, says: 'As soon as a small, under-funded independent has a success, it finds it doesn't have the money to keep the artist.' Mr Lewis left Virgin after it was acquired by Thorn EMI and is about to set up a music company for the UK-based Chrysalis group. Mr Daniel Miller, chairman of Mute, one of the surviving independents, says: 'It's much more difficult now for an independent than it was 10 years ago.' Sales of singles are much smaller; companies have to produce albums. 'Now you have to do a lot of re-mixes, you have to make a video, and you have to spend so much more on marketing.' While the costs of marketing and international distribution encourage the trend towards music industry consolidation, many artists and managers prefer the intimacy of a smaller company. Singer George Michael has complained of being treated as a commodity by Sony. Some executives who have sold part or all of their company to large music groups have not enjoyed the experience. Mr Chris Wright, Chrysalis chairman, sold 50 per cent of his group's recorded music company to Thorn EMI in 1989 and the remainder last year. He felt that his company was no match for its larger partner. 'They say there's no such thing as a joint venture and there's no such thing as a merger. You have to experience that to know that it's true,' he says. Undaunted, he is starting again. Chrysalis' new label hopes to stand midway between the larger companies and the smaller independents. Mr Lewis says that the company intends to grow while keeping costs down by, for example, using freelance press and promotions staff. He believes he can avoid the big company trappings he encountered during his brief period at Thorn EMI. Mr Lewis, whose last position at Virgin was managing director of music publishing, says: 'When EMI bought Virgin, my financial controller was given a book the size of an encyclopaedia on how to do the accounts.' He adds: 'I've observed during my time in the industry that it has become more controlled by the legal and financial professionals. They seem to have the attitude that they want consistency of product. That's why George Michael feels he's treated as a piece of software. Artists' careers don't necessarily develop consistently. Artists take diversions. If you've got artists in their twenties, you have to let them grow and find their feet.' Some executives at large groups say they recognise these problems and believe smaller companies play a crucial role. Mr Alain Levy, chief executive of PolyGram, says: 'The independents are an important source of new product. New artists feel more comfortable in the environment of an independent - certainly for the first record.' Several of the large groups have taken partial stakes in smaller labels, promising them continued creative independence. Last August, Sony formed a joint venture with the UK independent Creation. PolyGram has had a joint venture with Go] Discs since 1987. Go] Discs, whose artists include Billy Bragg, was founded in 1983 on a start-up budget of Pounds 750. Mr Levy says he tries to give PolyGram's labels, which include Polydor, Decca and Deutsche Gramophon, as much managerial independence as possible. 'Once a year they are given budgets and profit targets, but within those overall controls we let the labels operate on a quasi-autonomous basis. If you create a huge bureaucracy, new artists won't come to you. The person the artist speaks to must be able to make a decision, or the person above them must be able to. If it goes higher than that, it's a problem,' he says. Mr Wright of Chrysalis will not be the last independent company manager who finds that this relationship does not work well. A link with a large company does, however, give small labels access to an international marketing and distribution network and provides them with an infusion of new capital. Mr Lewis points out that while marketing and distribution costs have soared, the advance of digital technology means it has never been easier to record music. 'A kid can go into a shop and buy the necessary equipment and put it on the back seat of a car,' he says. Although growth is difficult, entry costs are low and working in the music business is the ambition of many. Whatever the perils, there will be others to take Factory's place.</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: 27% take-up for Bromsgrove rights Bromsgrove Industries, the Birmingham-based specialist engineering conglomerate, yesterday announced that only 27.5 per cent of shareholders had taken up its 1-for-4 rights issue at 105p per share to raise Pounds 10.75m. The balance has been subscribed for by underwriters, which include a number of Bromsgrove's institutional shareholders. The shares yesterday closed 1p up at 104p. Mr Stephen Hayes, finance director, said the take up was in line with expectations since a significant amount of the group's big shareholders had underwritten the cash call. Institutional shareholders, which held 70 per cent of the stock before the cash call, now hold about 80 per cent of Bromsgrove's shares. The rights issue should eliminate gearing, which, at end-September, was 31 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alvaro Ayala from the "24 Hours Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Today, the Attorney General's Office insisted on  relocating five Medellin Cartel members from Santa Fe de Bogota  to Itagui. The government, however, through Justice Minister  Andres Gonzalez, continues to resist this transfer. Today, the  Attorney General's Office said its Medellin representative was  who requested the transfer of the five people charged with being  lieutenants of the late drug trafficker Pablo Escobar Gaviria.    A communique issued today by the Attorney General's Office  states that, based on Article 35 of the Penal Procedures Code,  the Medellin Cartel members must be accessible to the prosecutor  in charge of their case, thereby allowing preliminary meetings  and agreements. The government thinks differently however.    [Begin Gonzalez recording] Regarding their transfer, I have  stated that, in our opinion, it is not advisable to gather the  remaining Medellin Cartel members in the same place. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Securities Trust assets rise 5.6% SECURITIES Trust of Scotland, the international income investment trust, reported a 5.6 per cent rise in net assets per share to 89.2p over the six months to September 30. The Martin Currie-managed trust maintained its interim dividend at 1.08p, payable from earnings per share of 1.7p (1.53p). Last year's total of 3.25p was not fully covered by earnings. At the end of September the geographic split of the trust's portfolio was UK (71 per cent), Europe (10 per cent), US (10 per cent), Far East (7 per cent) and smaller markets (2 per cent). The trust has reduced its US weighting over the last six months and increased its holding in Europe. The first half net asset value performance lagged slightly behind that of the FT-A All-Share Index and Mr Tim Hall, the manager, said this was due to the trust's weighting in unfashionable, but high-yielding areas such as food and brewing.</p>

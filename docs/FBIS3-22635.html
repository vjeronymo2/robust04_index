Medical reports released in Annaba  indicated that the threat of typhoid was over; 27 cases were  still in the hospital out of the 38 cases that had been treated,  with eight cases confirmed as typhoid. [passage omitted]    It is worth noting that the governor of Annaba has set up an  emergency plan to fight this disease and is coordinating efforts  with the health centers and university hospitals in the province  with a view to carrying out the necessary tests and determining  the exact number of cases among the students.</p>

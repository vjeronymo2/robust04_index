			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At &sect;488.212, we proposed that, if the facility is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found, at the time of the survey, to have deficiencies that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do not pose an immediate and serious threat to resident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health and safety, HCFA or the State may allow the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to continue to participate for up to 6 months from the date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the survey if_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The State finds that it is more appropriate to impose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative remedies than to terminate the facility;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The State survey agency has submitted a plan of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correction approved by HCFA; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The facility (in the case of a Medicare SNF or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State in the case of a Medicaid NF) agrees to repay to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal government payments received if corrective action is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not taken in accordance with the approved plan of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We said that, if a facility does not meet these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility criteria for continuation of payment, HCFA would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the State must terminate the facility's provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement. If any deficiency at any severity or scope level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remained uncorrected within 90 calendar days after the last  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day of survey, HCFA would and the State must deny payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for new admissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We proposed that HCFA terminate provider agreements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SNFs and NFs, and stop FFP for NFs for which participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was continued, if cited deficiencies were not corrected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within 6 months of the last day of the survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposed rule, we also set forth specific rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on how to apply both low severity and scope levels and all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other severity and scope levels as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Low severity and scope levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _If both the severity level and the scope level are 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a deficiency still exists, but no alternative remedies are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed or plan of correction required as long as correction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is achieved within 90 calendar days from the last day of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The survey agency would be required to give the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility a summary of the deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _If the survey agency identifies a recurrence of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies at the next standard survey, HCFA or the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be required to impose one or more remedies specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at &sect;488.206 (Available remedies) due to the persistence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the deficiencies over time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

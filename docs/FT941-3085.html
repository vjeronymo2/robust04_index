			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Aldus and Adobe set to merge Aldus and Adobe Systems, two pioneers of desktop publishing software, are to merge in a stock swap deal valued at about Dollars 525m. Combined, the companies have annual revenues of about Dollars 520m. Adobe will exchange 1.15 shares of its common stock for each share of Aldus common stock. Aldus' share price rose sharply yesterday on news of the merger agreement, trading at Dollars 31 1/8 , up from Tuesday's close of Dollars 26 1/4 . Adobe Systems was trading at Dollars 28 3/4 , down from Dollars 32 1/2 . 'We believe our two companies, each with a rich history of inventing different aspects of the electronic publishing revolution, are simply much stronger together - both technologically and financially,' said Mr John Warnock, chairman and chief executive of Adobe Systems. Adobe and Aldus are widely recognised for having created 'desktop publishing' - the use of personal computers in publishing newsletters, magazines and newspapers. Over the past decade publishing software has grown into a Dollars 2bn industry. Adobe's flagship product is PostScript, a computer language for printers that has become an industry standard. It also makes programs that allow computer users to print text in various typefaces. Based in Mountain View, California, the company reported fiscal 1993 revenues of Dollars 313m and net income of Dollars 57m. Aldus' leading product is PageMaker, a program for the 'lay out' or design of documents such as magazine pages. Based in Seattle, Washington, it had 1993 revenues of Dollars 207m and net income of Dollars 9.5m. The companies' products are complementary, with little overlap, analysts said. Mr Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a California market research firm, said the deal would allow them 'to be much more of a powerhouse when it comes to next-generation desktop publishing, printing and graphics technology'.</p>

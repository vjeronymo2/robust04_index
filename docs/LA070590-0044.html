			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Thieves stabbed and killed one undocumented man and injured at least two others  during an early-morning robbery spree Wednesday along the U.S.-Mexico border,  police said.  </P> <P> The attacks took place near the southern levee of the Tijuana River, a popular  illicit international crossing zone, police said. Among those injured was one  migrant who was stabbed but survived and was hospitalized in serious condition.  </P> <P> The assaults occurred at a time when San Diego police have bolstered patrols in  the hazardous border strip in response to what authorities say is rising crime,  particularly in the rugged area west of the port of entry at San Ysidro.  </P> <P> Robbers have long preyed on the hundreds of migrants who each day attempt to  enter the United States without inspection by traveling across the rugged  border terrain.  </P> <P> The man killed Wednesday was at least the seventh person murdered by suspected  thieves in the border zone in San Diego during 1990, according to police  figures. There were five such killings during all of 1989.  </P> <P> The dead man was identified as Alejandro Soto Moreno, 25. His nationality and  other details about him were not available.  </P> <P> Police said he was among a group of up to 20 undocumented immigrants who were  attacked by three male robbers at about 12:30 a.m. The migrants had gathered  along a hilltop near the southern levee of the Tijuana River, at a spot about  two miles to the west of the San Ysidro border crossing and about 20 feet north  of the international boundary, according to police.  </P> <P> The assailants brandished knives and clubs, said Bill Robinson, a police  spokesman.  </P> <P> The other stabbing victim was identified only as Miguel Munoz. He was listed in  serious condition at UC San Diego Medical Center.  </P> <P> A third victim, whose name was not available, was treated at the scene for  minor injuries, police said.  </P> <P> No suspects were in custody, police said.  </P></p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Chirac's views help Paris to 2.4% gain AN EASING of political tension in Russia helped to improve sentiment yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS was excited by a number of external factors on the first day of the new account and, assisted by futures buying, the CAC-40 index regained the 2,000 level for the first time in two weeks. The index closed up 46.79, or 2.4 per cent, at 2,001.36 in turnover estimated at FFr3bn. Comments by Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the Gaullist RPR party, which polled the most votes in last Sunday's election, stressing that economic growth was essential for the country was interpreted by some investors as opening the way for an easing in the franc fort policy and lower interest rates. Carnaud Metalbox, down FFr15 or, 6 per cent, at FFr221, continued to draw interest as CGIP, one of the major shareholders, was reported to be discussing the purchase of MB-Caradon's 25 per cent stake at FFr190 a share. CGIP fell FFr20 to FFr1,148 while Pechiney International, which at one stage had been rumoured to have been interested in buying a stake, rose FFr8 to FFr223. LVMH gained FFr78 to FFr3,625 as a number of brokers lifted their recommendations on the stock. FRANKFURT had a good start, encouraged by Chancellor Kohl's reaffirmation that the solidarity pact is the right package to get the economy on the growth track again, and his pressure on G7 countries to support the Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin. The DAX index hit an intraday high of 1,671.89, up 12.44. However, immediate and domestic issues took over, with a March inflation rate of 4.3 per cent in two German states slightly above the February level; with higher postal services costs coming up, inflation is thought unlikely to fall below 4 per cent in the first half of this year. The DAX index ended 2.30 lower at 1,657.15 as turnover eased from DM7bn to DM6.9bn. Daimler and Volkswagen continued to post gains, DM10.50 to DM616 and DM2.40 to DM305.80 on the disclosure of hidden reserves, and top management moves respectively; and while some analysts said that this was only a trading move, both shares picked up in the post bourse, to around DM620, and DM308. ZURICH was enlivened by corporate results but, overall, the market continued its slow consolidation. The SMI index lost 9.3 to 2,137.5. Sandoz bearers picked up from an early SFr50 decline to finish SFr10 ahead at SFr2,980 as the group lifted net profit to SFr1.5bn and announced a higher-than-expected 34 per cent rise in dividend. Mr Eric Bernhardt of Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich noted that the profits gain attributable to the company's switch to the International Accounting Standards, at 50 per cent, was lower than expected. 'The fact that half of the rise came from higher operating margins is very positive.' However, he was revising down earnings estimates for this year and next by 5-6 per cent because of the uncertain outlook for pharmaceuticals sales in the US and Germany. Swissair bearers rose SFr7 to SFr580 as analysts noted a halved dividend, and attributed a much higher than expected group net profit for 1992 to extraordinary items. One added: 'These figures do not tell us anything about how the group will perform in 1993.' AMSTERDAM had to wait until after the close for VNU, the publishing group, to report a 59 per cent fall in 1992 net profits as it made a large provision for its printing division. The shares were 70 cents lower at Fl 101 as the CBS Tendency index slipped 0.1 to 105.8. STOCKHOLM was supported by further interest in Ericsson which accounted for some 50 per cent of total turnover of SKr953m. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 3.9 to 986.2. Ericsson B advanced SKr13 or 5.3 per cent to SKr260, a year's high, encouraged by strong order books for the first quarter of 1993. DUBLIN was not overly impressed by the overnight bids for the government's Greencore stake, but the impetus from interest rate expectations continued and the ISEQ overall index recovered another 16.08 to 1,457.29. COPENHAGEN again concentrated on the slide in Baltica Holding, down DKr19.79 or 25.7 per cent to DKr57.00. The KFX index closed 0.27 lower at 78.78 in turnover of DKr403m. Den Danske Bank, which has a 32 per cent stake in Baltica, regained DKr5 to DKr315.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- March 25                                           THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1136.88     1135.92     1135.71     1133.57 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1205.34     1202.80     1202.78     1200.54  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1132.78     1132.06     1132.17     1133.08 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1199.09     1199.86     1199.08     1200.17  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Mar 24    Mar 23    Mar 22    Mar 19    Mar 18  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1130.66   1131.55   1129.55   1145.37   1148.55 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1202.55   1203.95   1204.64   1223.70   1222.53  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1136.90; 200 - 1205.53 Low/day: 100 - 1131.33  200 - 1197.83.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / When profits land you in hot water: Are customers carrying too much of the burden of UK water privatisation Four years of drought have ended, but 1993 is likely to bring fresh troubles for the UK water industry. The Labour party called yesterday for savage windfall taxes on privatised utilities' profits, which prompted a 50 per cent rise in shares in water companies last year, making water the best-performing sector in the London stock market. This week also saw another tussle between the water industry and its regulator, Ofwat, over the basis for next year's Periodic Review, in which Ofwat will reassess the way water bills are calculated for the first time since privatisation. Ofwat has made clear its concern over rising water and sewerage bills - in two months, they will rise by an average of 10 per cent, a leap of nearly 60 per cent since privatisation three years ago. These controversies could be inflamed further this year by a political battle over plans to sell Scottish Water. All this raises questions of whether water privatisation has been successful, and whether regulation adequately protects customers. Three years of private ownership for the 10 water companies of England and Wales have brought some undisputed benefits - principally cleaner drinking water and beaches, and faster customer service. Before the December 1989 flotation, the industry, including the 33 small water companies which are not quoted on the stock market, had suffered years of underinvestment. In many cases, water did not comply with EC standards passed nearly a decade earlier. According to Mr Trevor Newton, group managing director of Yorkshire Water, the need for massive spending, estimated in 1989 at Pounds 28bn, was the main motive for privatisation. 'It's the same in Scotland now - probably Pounds 4bn-Pounds 5bn of spending needed which the local authorities cannot finance.' As a result of the spending, treatment plants have been improved, and within several years the UK will stop piping sewage into the sea. Levels of pesticides, nitrates and lead in drinking water have been reduced, and the speed of response to ruptured pipes and flooded sewers is greater. Companies also argue that they have become more efficient: 'There has been a sea change in attitudes,' says Thames Water. However, critics of water privatisation maintain that customers carry much of the cost of this modernisation through higher bills - and that they are paying too much. The pricing formula agreed in 1989 was that a company could put up prices each year by the rate of inflation plus a 'K' factor - a number set for each company by Ofwat, to allow it to pay for new spending. As a result, water and sewerage bills have risen by about 5 per cent more than inflation each year and will reach an average Pounds 170 a year on April 1. This compares with annual rises below inflation for the privatised telephone, gas and electricity utilities. Ofwat has warned that last year's bills could double in real terms by 2005 as the true cost of meeting EC and national environmental rules becomes clear. By then, the regulator has suggested, full compliance with all the rules could mean spending of Pounds 45bn, more than 50 per cent higher than estimates at privatisation. Even water executives have criticised the privatisation for not anticipating the industry's costs more accurately. Some also suggest that, because the price formula allows the water companies to pass on much of the cost to customers, it has encouraged over-ambitious water standards, beyond the levels necessary for health. 'I think that (if the government had been bearing the costs) there may well have had to be more scrutiny of the standards and more pressure on their costs, going back to the drawing board in some cases,' says Sir Roy Watts, chairman of Thames Water. Environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth claim that, for the same reason, the price formula has given water companies little incentive to try to pass costs back to industries and farms, which are the source of the pollution. The water industry stresses the difficulty of identifying the culprits, but concedes some of the charge: 'It is policy to make the polluter pay, but there's not a lot of (that practice) about,' says Sir Roy Watts. However, the most frequently voiced attack on the privatisation, and the focus of Labour's complaints, is that shareholders do not carry enough of the industry's financial burden. Dividends have risen by between 6 per cent and 10 per cent a year since 1989, and the shares - now worth Pounds 10.7bn  -have more than doubled in value. Financial analysts point out that critics often overstate the attractions of the shares. They argue that, although the reliability of the water companies' profits and dividends has increased the shares' popularity during recession, this advantage will diminish by comparison as other companies recover. However, the question of striking the right financial balance between shareholders and customers is also the main dispute - and an increasingly acrimonious one - between the water industry and Ofwat. Ofwat is ultimately responsible for getting that balance right when it sets price rises - a tough job, because it is almost impossible to create even limited competition in supplying water and sewerage. On Monday, the disagreements broke out again when the water companies attacked Ofwat's latest consultation paper as 'fundamentally arbitrary and flawed'. Alone among the utility regulators, Ofwat is legally obliged to allow the companies to earn a 'reasonable rate of return' on their capital when setting price rises. The dispute is about how to define that reasonable rate of return, an issue central to the 1994 Periodic Review. That review, which will set rises in water bills until 2005, will be the biggest test since privatisation of whether the regulatory framework adequately protects the customer. Mr Byatt has won public praise for his concern for poorer households faced with hefty bills. He can take some credit for the industry's increasing efficiency - he has made clear that he may penalise inefficient companies by setting them lower annual price rises at the review. He has also restrained price increases - held back this spring by about 1 per cent. However, leading City firms are questioning whether Mr Byatt will be able to be as tough at the review as his public comments suggest. Robert Fleming Securities, the investment house, argued in a report last month: 'Any attempt by Ofwat to set tough new price controls will be thwarted by the industry's massive investment programme. The programme is the saviour for shareholders . . . Ofwat cannot afford to be too severe or it will be in breach of its legal requirements to ensure that the industry can finance its activities.' The argument is put vigorously by the industry itself: according to one finance director, 'Mr Byatt has to face the realities of the market - we need the rates of return we are getting to raise money for the capital spending'. Comments like that identify one of the biggest difficulties of Ofwat's role, and one of the possible weaknesses of the regulatory regime in protecting the customer. Mr Byatt appears to have formidable power in setting price rises. But he is also legally obliged to set them high enough for companies to have enough money to bring their pipes and plants up to specified standards. Yet he does not control the water quality standards, which are set by the European Commission, the UK government and the National Rivers Authority, the river-quality watchdog. As a result he has almost no control over the industry's costs - and so in reality only limited control over prices. Mr Byatt's decisions in 1994 will show whether scepticism about the extent of his power is warranted. In the event, the water companies' anxieties about how their customers react to rising bills may be at least as important as Ofwat's endeavours to restrain them. A few companies say privately that most customers do not yet seem worried about bills, which are still usually less than those for gas, electricity or telephone. But water will eventually overtake the others  - 'and I guess we know in all honesty we can't keep putting up the prices forever at this rate, whatever the K formula says', one finance director concedes. The water companies are right to be concerned - they have a difficult case. Privatisation has clearly brought customers cleaner water and beaches, but there are legitimate concerns that the price they are paying may be too high.</p>

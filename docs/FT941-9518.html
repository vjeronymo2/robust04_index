			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Three-year pay deal in Ireland Ireland's government, employers and unions yesterday announced a new three-year tripartite agreement aimed at holding down pay and inflation and creating jobs, writes Tim Coone in Dublin. The accord links macroeconomic policies aimed at controlling inflation and job creation to centralised pay deals in the public and private sectors. Centralised pay deals have been the norm in Ireland since 1987, bringing labour stability and helping the government to cut inflation (1.5 per cent last year) and borrowing (2.5 per cent of gross national product). The deal allows for an overall 8 per cent pay rise in the private sector from 1994-96, and 11 per cent in the public sector up to June 1997. The additional 3 percentage points for public sector employees is a carry-over from the last agreement.</p>

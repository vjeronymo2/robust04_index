			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 18 (YONHAP) -- The North Koreans  continue making threats against the South, claiming current  inter-Korean relations are on "the eve of war" and blustering  that "South Korea will be melted away."    Such intimidating remarks against the South appear aimed at  two things -- solidifying the Kim Il-song-Kim Chong-il  leadership and demonstrating to the world the North's  preparedness for any emergencies.    Threatening that Seoul would taste "the flame of war," North  Korea has created a war environment to calm the people's  mounting discontent with the worsening economy and unite them  firmly behind "great leader" Kim Il-song and "dear leader" Kim  Chong-il.    Blaming South Korea and the United States for the tension  that is fueling the possibility of war, Pyongyang asserts that  the South and the Americans are plotting to invade North Korea  on the pretext of the nuclear dispute.    Saying they will never yield to pressure from the globe's  most powerful nation, the North Koreans want to show their  chuche (self-reliance) ideology to the world while trying to  ease international pressure for sanctions and buy the time  needed to develop nuclear arms.    The North Korean people's discontent with their  deteriorating  economy poses a grave danger to the leadership of the Kims, who  may try to overcome the problem through armed conflict, North  Korea watchers here say.    The North earlier refused to permit full international  inspections of its nuclear facilities and ruptured inter-Korean  dialogue by threatening to wage war.    North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam uttered a typical  threat against the South during a recent visit to Ukraine:  "South Korea should know that if a war breaks out, it would be  melted way, going to rack and ruin and an eventual end."    Such intimidation was repeated in a statement issued by the  Committee for Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland on June 6  and again during Ambassador Son Song-pil's press conference in  Moscow on June 8.    Threats were also made in many commentaries carried by North  Korea's propaganda organs.    The NODONG SINMUN, the official newspaper of the Workers'  (communist) Party, blustered in an editorial in the June 13  edition that if war broke out on the Korean peninsula, the South  would not be safe, according to NAEWOE Press, the official North  Korea watcher here.    Along with uttering threats against the South, North Korea  is  constantly eulogizing Kim Chong-il, calling him "an unrivaled  military commander."    Its propaganda organs claim Kim Chong-il predicted not only  an early end to the Persian Gulf war but U.N. economic  sanctions against Pyongyang.    North Korea's threats against the South may be intended to  establish firm unity among its people. But in view of the fact  that the intimidation comes from the highest levels, with even  senior foreign service officials uttering threats, and that  North Korea is in a war environment, such bluster may mean "a  realistic danger" hangs over the Korean peninsula, analysts say.</p>

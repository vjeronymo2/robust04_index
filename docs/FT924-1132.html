			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / International Company News: Shell abandons India partner ROYAL Dutch/Shell is abandoning its Indian partner of 25 years' standing and is pulling out of a planned Dollars 2bn petrochemicals venture in India following disputes about the management of the project. Even though Shell insisted the decision had nothing to do with the group's view of India's economy or economic reform programme, the move will be a blow to the Indian government. Ministers have frequently cited the Shell project as an example of the extensive foreign investment India hopes to attract as it opens its economy to the outside world. Shell has had a long association with Arvind Mafatlal, a textiles and chemicals group, which includes the joint ownership of National Organic Chemical Industries (Nocil), a chemicals manufacturer. The two partners have long discussed plans for Nocil to build a petrochemical complex on India's western coast. The scheme was delayed by bureaucratic wrangles and by protests from local environmental groups. The partners seemed to have overcome these hurdles. But in the past year, serious arguments have blown up over Shell's proposals to increase its stake in Nocil from 33.3 per cent to 51 per cent. It is understood that Shell wished to have management control of the project which would have been one of the largest foreign investments in India. News of Shell's decision was made public at a Nocil shareholders' meeting on Thursday, attended by Mr F Berger, Shell's co-ordinator for Asia. Mr Berger told the meeting that there were fundamental differences as to how the company should be managed. It was evident that these differences could not be resolved. He added that 'the withdrawal from Nocil at this time should not be construed as a reflection of doubt or disappointment in the progress of economic reforms in India. Shell strongly supports them.' Shell's move may have been influenced by the depressed state of the world market in petrochemicals and the fact that several other proposed petrochemicals complexes are under discussion in India. Under the terms of an agreement between Shell and Mafatlal, Shell is required to offer its shareholding in Nocil to Mafatlal for sale at a mutually acceptable price. Mafatlal says there will be no change in existing technology transfer agreements with Shell covering Nocil's present operations, which include a naphtha cracker.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (1): The users have their say This issue of Software At Work - the fifth in the FT's series of quarterly software reviews - looks at three main topics: Bespoke systems: software developed precisely for your company's needs, rather than cheaper, standard packages. Computer-related training for specialist staff. The 'hot-topic': groupware - an extra level of applications software which aims to create genuine interaction between people through a computer network. A strong emphasis of Software At Work is always to let the users have their say. Once again, we have selected site visits and case studies with the hope that these various approaches will help other software- users formulate their own strategies. For the site visits, our approach includes an overall report on how software is chosen and applied, together with a company snapshot, describing its main area of business. Then for each site report there is a technology or system profile, listing the software and hardware at the site. And, finally, we include in most cases a consultant's critique on just how effective - or otherwise - the system appears to be. We hope to return to selected sites in future issues, to track their progress. Sometimes today's success story is tomorrow's problem. We also try to avoid technical jargon: this review is intended for the executive decision-maker who may not have a technological background, therefore a list of buzzword definitions is included on this page.</p>

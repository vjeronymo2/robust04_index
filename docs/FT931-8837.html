			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesian producers fear constraints of cocoa pact INDONESIAN cocoa producers have advised against membership of the International Cocoa Organisation, despite the country's emergence as a leading world producer. Indonesia is expected to produce 220,000 tonnes of cocoa in this crop year, which ends on September 30, replacing Malaysia as the world's fourth largest producer, according to the Indonesian Cocoa Association (Askindo). The country's production has soared since 1981-82 when it produced just 23,000 tonnes. Askindo expects production to rise to 250,000 next year and to more than 400,000 tonnes by the end of the decade. It estimates that about 330,000 hectares (815,000 acres) are under cultivation but only 60 per cent are in production, with the remainder producing a first crop by 1996. Next week members of the ICCO, which groups main consuming and producing nations, meet in Geneva to negotiate a new price support mechanism for cocoa. The current agreement, signed seven years ago, has failed to maintain world prices, which have fallen from about Pounds 1,300 a tonne in 1987 to Pounds 730. Traders say the continued refusal of Indonesia to join the ICCO would weaken any new accord. Indonesian producers fear membership would have a negative impact on the domestic industry. 'We are very worried that if we become a member our production programme may be constrained by outside factors,' explained one executive yesterday. Some officials also wish to remain removed from the ICCO's internal squabbles and financial problems. The head of one plantation company noted: 'Most important (for a new price support agreement) is financing. But who is to pay, producers or consumers? And what about arrears? Some producers owe the association about Dollars 140m'. Askindo officials take a more pragmatic line, however, saying membership of the organisation may be inevitable given Indonesia's importance as a producer and the government's policy of promoting economic co-operation between developing nations. They say the preferred option for a new price support agreement would be a withholding scheme, based on historic production levels, rather than a quota or buffer stock systems.</p>

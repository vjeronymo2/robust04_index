			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Observer: Windsor Palace? So ex-RHM boss Stanley Metcalfe, who made his name in millin' and bakin', is adding hotel-keepin' to his portfolio. A blunt Yorkshireman, the new non-executive chairman of Queens Moat Houses is not keen on talking to the press but he clearly has his fans at Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank which has taken a lead role in advising QMH. Andrew Coppel, QMH's new chief executive, is a one-time Morgan man, and RHM was a Morgan client before the food group was taken over by Tomkins at the end of last year. Given that QMH owes Pounds 1bn to 65 banks, it might have been thought that the job of chairman would go to a banker. However, when Morgan drew up its shortlist, Metcalfe's name was on top. Old colleagues at RHM are wondering whether one of his first moves will be to take RHM's redundant headquarters in Windsor off Tomkins' hands. It would make a smashing hotel.</p>

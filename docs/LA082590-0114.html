			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> ERSKINE QUESTIONS PLAN-CHECKING FEE  </P> <P> Two weeks after the City Council imposed a substantial new plan-checking fee  for all building renovations and new construction, Councilman John Erskine is  calling for his colleagues to reconsider their decision.  </P> <P> Erskine said that letters of protest he received from the Chamber of Commerce  and a major developer prompted him to second-guess the council's approval of  the new charge, although he is not yet reversing his support of the fee.  </P> <P> It was one of dozens of new fees and cost hikes that the council, including  Erskine, approved Aug. 6 to make charges for the processing services equal to  what it costs officials to do the work.  </P> <P> The fee being challenged, similar to charges levied by some other Orange County  cities, is expected to bring the city an extra $500,000 in revenue this year.  It adds onto planning and permit costs a processing charge equal to 0.3% of the  assessed value of the work being done.  </P> <P> For a 400-square-foot room addition, the new fee will be about $75. Other  construction-related fees total $335.  </P> <P> But Erskine said he is concerned over what the charge adds to larger projects,  such as The Waterfront, a seaside residential and hotel resort.  </P> <P> The first hotel of the project opened last month, but most of the other  facilities are still in the planning stages.  </P> <P> Erskine, referring to a letter he received from Steven Bone, developer of The  Waterfront, said that Bone expressed concern about the added cost that the fee  would generate, specifically ". . . a couple of hundred thousand dollars onto  the next Waterfront hotel."  </P> <P> The Chamber of Commerce letter did not specifically denounce the new planning  charge, but only asked that the council "be equitable and fair to the entire  business community."  </P> <P> No date has yet been set for the council to reconsider the adopted processing  fee.

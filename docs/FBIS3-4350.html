Members of the Preliminary Working Committee  (PWC) are already voicing concerns over the positions of the  chief executive and principal officials of the post-1997 Special  Administrative Region (SAR) because the posts must be filled by  Chinese nationals without right of abode elsewhere. They  believe that with the high proportion of foreign passport  holders in senior civil service ranks, few senior civil servants  in Hong Kong will meet the eligibility criteria.    Hong Kong leader of the Government and Administration Group  for the PWC, Leung Chun-ying, said: "(Up to) 50 to 60 per cent  of the heads of department are expatriates. The remainder --  Chinese nationals -- hold either foreign or British passports.  We are facing the problem of finding enough competent people to  fill these SAR positions and still be compatible with the Basic  Law," Mr Leung said. "It is an issue the PWC has identified as  important to the smooth transition of Hong Kong to an SAR."    The 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which stipulates  the  terms under which Hong Kong will revert to Chinese rule, and the  Basic Law, the territory's post-1997 constitution, state the  chief executive -- the position which will replace that of  colonial governor -- and principal officials must be Chinese  nationals without right of abode elsewhere and must be appointed  by China. The posts of Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries of  departments, Directors of Bureaus, Commissioner Against  Corruption, Director of Audit and Commissioner of Police, would  be filled by Chinese citizens.    Mr Leung articulated PWC members' fears, saying the  possibility of a through-train for senior civil servants to  retain their posts beyond 1997 was becoming difficult because of  the high number of foreign passport holders. Concerns over the  eligibility and number of candidates for top civil servants  follows PWC recommendations late last month that the chief  executive be chosen 18 months early because of increasingly  fractious relations with Britain over Hong Kong's future. That  advice, also voiced by Mr Leung, would see a shadow governor to  Chris Patten before British rule ends.    Mr Leung carried his criticisms of the civil service  further,  claiming senior officials lacked the necessary knowledge of  China affairs to aid a smooth transfer. He called on the Hong  Kong Government to delegate a number of high-ranking officials  to be posted in Beijing to enhance liaison and understanding  between both administrations. Mr Leung said local officials'  knowledge of China "lagged behind" by at least 20 years and  called on the Hong Kong administration to catch up to ensure a  smooth transition.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 29 (YONHAP) -- Russia's national  television Ostankino cancelled airing of the second part of its  documentary on the Korean war, which had been to be aired  Saturday afternoon. The program was to be aired from at 3:55 to  4:25 PM, but shortly before the airing, Ostankino said the  program was cancelled because of "an unexpected condition."  Ostankino gave no further explanation, only adding that it will  later announce the airing time of the program, but informed  sources here said the program is likely not to be aired.    At the first part of the program aired on May 21, Gen.  Dmitriy Volkogonov, a Russian authority on the Korean war and  former military adviser to President Boris Yeltsin, clearly  showed that the Korean war broke out by North Korea's invasion  of the South.    Sources in the Russian press said that North Korea seemed to  have appealed strongly to the Russian Government, legislature  and Ostankino on airing of the program and called on them to  stop airing the second part of the documentary.</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: THE WORK PLACE;  </P> <P> AMONG THE PAYOFFS FOR LIVING IN O.C. ARE REGULAR MERIT RAISES, STUDY SAYS  </P> <P> If your salary is good, and pay raises come with regularity, you probably owe  it to the county's high cost of housing and low unemployment rate. Those are  the factors that cause local companies to fork over better-than-average pay  raises to executives.  </P> <P> County firms are in the top quarter of U.S. companies in the amount they budget  for merit raises -- annual performance-based pay increases.  </P> <P> A recent study by TPF&amp;C, a worldwide personnel consulting firm, has  surveyed budgets for merit raises set aside by 1,500 companies in 25 U.S.  regions. The study checked how those budgets increase from year to year.  </P> <P> According to the survey, merit raises paid to top management by companies in  Milwaukee rose 6.4% in 1989, giving it the best rating of all areas surveyed.  The worst was Houston, where merit raise budgets rose by just 4.6%.  </P> <P> The study showed Orange County in a four-way tie for fourth place in the  merit-raise derby; firms here increased their merit raise budgets by 5.6% in  1989.  </P> <P> San Francisco, where merit raise budgets rose 5.7%, and San Diego, where  budgets rose 6.2%, were the only areas besides Milwaukee to best Orange County.  Eighteen other regions -- including Los Angeles -- came in below.  </P> <P> Sky-high housing costs and subterranean unemployment levels account for county  firms' generosity, said Lawrence A. Wangler, who oversees compensation  practices at TPF&amp;C's Newport Beach office.  </P> <P> "It's so terribly difficult to bring someone (workers) into Orange County  because of the cost of housing," Wangler said. "If you're an employer, you're  more willing to provide a little more compensation to keep people here and in  their jobs, because it's a lot less expensive than trying to bring somebody new  in to fill a job."  </P></p>

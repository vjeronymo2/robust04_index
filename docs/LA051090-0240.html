			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TOYOTA DENIES BLOCKING ACCUSATORY PICKENS ADS  </P> <P> Toyota Motor Corp. denied today that it tried to prevent Texas oilman T. Boone  Pickens from placing ads in local newspapers in his battle to assert ownership  rights in a Japanese company.  </P> <P> But several of Tokyo's largest newspapers said they held up the ads, which  claim that collusive business practices force higher prices on consumers.  </P> <P> The papers said they were considering printing a version that omits company  names.  </P> <P> "There's no freedom of speech in Japan," said Pickens' lawyer, Kanji Ishizumi.  "Toyota published an ad in a U.S. paper saying 'shut up' to Pickens. They were  able to enjoy freedom of speech in the United States, but Pickens can't do that  here."  </P> <P> Pickens issued a statement Wednesday in Texas claiming that Toyota and its  powerful advertising agency, Dentsu, were trying to block him from publishing  the ads.  </P> <P> Since last year, Boone Co., a U.S. investment firm, has held the largest equity  stake in Koito Manufacturing Co., a major auto parts maker closely linked to  Toyota, Japan's largest auto maker.  </P> <P> Pickens says his unsuccessful battle to gain a seat on Koito's board of  directors and to exercise leadership in the firm illustrates how investment  opportunities are closed to foreigners in Japan.  </P> <P> The Pickens ad is addressed to consumers, auto parts employees and shareholders  of Koito.  </P></p>

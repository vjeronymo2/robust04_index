			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Arts: Lou Reed and Tom Petty - Pop Concerts Giving concerts is a serious business for Lou Reed nowadays. Notices in the foyer on Sunday gave warning that latecomers would only be allowed to their seats between numbers and that Reed would be singing material from just his last three albums. Any unseemly requests for old favourites, it was suggested, would not be viewed at all favourably. From such unpropitious beginnings, however, the evening could only get better, and Reed came on to give one of the most absorbing and finely judged of performances. Since he re-established himself with the abrasive New York in 1989, Reed's music has gone ever more inward and restrained. Perhaps the unbuttoned rocker will emerge again one day, but in the meantime the spare, ironic beauty of the Warhol tribute Songs for Drella, which he made with John Cale in 1990, has been enhanced in the elegiac tone of his latest album Magic and Loss, written in the wake of the deaths of two close friends. The first half was given over to the Magic and Loss songs. They are shaped very consciously into a cycle, complete with instrumental prelude and a reprise before the final number, titles hedged around with subtexts and lyrics, which for all their moments of black humour portray a struggle to come to terms with bereavement. Set against the very best of his recent work - the most self-lacerating of the Drella songs, the hard-driving 'Dirty Blvd' and 'Strawman' from New York  -Magic and Loss can seem single-paced and musically underpowered. Certainly Reed moved up a gear musically in the second half, pulling four numbers out of Drella, including a spell-binding delivery of 'A Dream', the deadly accurate parody of Warhol's diary style which turns suddenly from camp to horror. In the end, the fans did get something old. Noticeably relaxing through the second half, Reed even ventured the occasional smile, and offered a set of encores that included 'Sweet Jane', the mawkish Satellite of Love' and 'Walk on the Wild Side'. From any other rock star that would have been a predictable finale, but Reed has worked so hard at his new beginnings and at remaking his songs that reviving his best known number was really made to seem like a special blessing for his faithful and exemplary audience. * The pleasure in Tom Petty's concert with the ever faithful Heartbreakers on Monday was much more sporadic. Like Lou Reed, they too are over here on the back of an album, the pleasant, relaxed Into the Great Wide Open, which appeared at the end of last year and shows Petty extending his concerns in social issues and the green movement. The concert, though, revealed very little more, apart from a deeply embarrassing taste for whimsy, and a willingness to play up to the adoring fans in ways that a musician of Petty's honest excellence really does not need to contemplate. The best of the new songs were liberally scattered through the running order, along with recyclings of a good deal of tried and tested old material. The sound of the Heartbreakers grows ever more Byrd-like (Petty even included one of Roger McGuinn's own songs) and the vocal delivery shifts between the Dylan whine and a thin, effective lyricism. In the end it was all too protracted and indulgent, fatally sabotaged by the absurd play-acting in the middle. Lou Reed: Hammersmith Odeon. Last performance tonight. 'Magic and Loss' on Sire Records. Tom Petty: Wembley Arena. 'Into the Great Wide Open' is available on MCA Records</p>

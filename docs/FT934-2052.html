			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / China accuses UK of wrecking co-operation on Hong Kong China last night accused Britain of destroying co-operation on Hong Kong and appealed to the territory's residents for support in the deepening confrontation over the 1997 transfer of sovereignty from London to Beijing. The government in Beijing issued a stern statement in response to yesterday's tabling in the Hong Kong Legislative Council (Legco) of a partial reform bill aimed at broadening the franchise for elections due in 1994 and 1995. China says the bill violates Sino-British agreements. Although it did not explicitly close the door on further discussions, the statement said Britain had 'demolished the foundation of Sino-British co-operation'. The Beijing government said: 'We welcome the people in Hong Kong . . . to support and participate more positively in the work of the Preparatory Work Committee for Hong Kong's smooth transition and for maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity.' Beijing established the committee this year to advise on arrangements for 1997. British officials fear China will use the body to undermine the authority of the Hong Kong government. Mr Alastair Goodlad, a British foreign office minister, said it had been necessary to begin legislation to cover urgent issues and that that should give time for discussion with Beijing on other matters. He insisted in a parliamentary answer that Britain wished 'to co-operate with them in securing a smooth transition'. However, the Chinese statement made clear that a resumption of talks, which foundered last month after 17 rounds since April, depended on Mr Chris Patten, the governor, withdrawing his legislation. It said that tabling the bill without Beijing's agreement was 'another serious step' towards confrontation with China. 'In such circumstances, any election bill passed by Legco will be against Sino-British agreements. Therefore, it will not be acceptable to the Chinese side.' The statement added: 'The British side's move indicates that the British had unilaterally broken off the Sino-British talks creating man-made chaos . . . and posing obstacles to the smooth transition and handover of power in 1997.' In Hong Kong, Mr Michael Sze, secretary for constitutional affairs, told Legco that time had run out for talks about 'straightforward' issues relating to the colony's 1994 and 1995 polls. These include lowering the voting age from 21 to 18 years and abolishing appointed officials in local government. Other proposals to broaden democratic participation will be tabled in a second bill expected by the end of February. However, support for yesterday's bill has weakened. Observer, Page 19</p>

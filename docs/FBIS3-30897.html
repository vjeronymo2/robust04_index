			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus: "Europe Viewed </F> From the Perspective of the Meeting in Davos"]    [Text] One of the important topics on the agenda of the  World Economic Forum in Davos was Europe -- its current  situation, its so-called "expansion," and its future. I must  admit that I had to protest a little against the views regarding  Europe's expansion, because I am convinced that Europe can never  be expanded (or even made smaller) by anyone. Europe is Europe  regardless of the kind of institutions established in it, and  views about its expansion can only be contemplated in relation  to individual European institutions or organizations. In a  panel discussion involving the Belgian, Danish, Finnish, and  Czech prime ministers, it became obvious that this difference is  very important and that we are the ones who always point it out.  Finnish Prime Minister Aho played into my hands by quoting the  famous Finnish composer Sibelius, thus enabling me to reply that  Sibelius was not only a Finnish composer, but also --  undoubtedly -- a European one, without being recognized as such  by some European institutions. The topic of many discussions  was the future of Europe and its position in the world.    Our experience tells us that the success (or failure) of  Europe -- and, in fact, of all of us -- does not so much depend  on the existence, scope, and activities of multilateral European  institutions, but that it depends far more on the type and  structure of the political, social, and economic system that  exists in European countries. We know very well that the reason  for our own failure to keep pace with Western Europe and our  rather unhappy life during the past four decades was not the  existence of an institution like the Council for Mutual Economic  Assistance, but the existence of the communist regime. The  symmetric opposite also applies: The success of Western Europe  did not depend on European Community institutions, but on a free  society, private ownership, and a free market. This was not  only valid in the past, it is also valid for today and tomorrow.    It is being decided right now whether Eastern Europe will  uphold such a system or whether it will allow it to degenerate  into a new form of collectivism endorsed under the banner of  this or that old- new salvation-bringing "ism." The success of  Europe depends on the extent of individual freedom; the extent  of the free market and trade; the ability to get rid of  unnecessary state interference in people's lives and their  economic activities; curbing bureaucratic manipulation with  everyone and everything; our determination and courage to limit  the influence of the powerful and the social well being of lobby  groups; and our ability to put in order the basic economic  attributes, especially our handling of the reward we get for  them.    In this context and under these circumstances, it is  necessary to specify carefully the conditions for the possible  favorable impact of multilateral European institutions on our  future. I am concerned that the careful formulation of these  conditions is being forgotten due to the simplified and a priori  accepted argument that, without a united Europe, we will be  "small," "weak," and "unable to stand up to competition" with  the world's other regions. The favorable impact of these  institutions, however, depends on the following:    1. Whether these pan-European institutions are greater  advocates of the free market and free trade and greater  opponents of state interventionism, bureaucracy, and lobbying  than individual European states;    2. Whether the institutionalized, organized integration of  Europe produces "bulk savings," or whether the rewards from the  size of the regions would be higher than the losses associated  with the functioning of too-widespread organizations;    3. Whether the idea of a unified, institutionally united  Europe is in the real interests of Europe's citizens and not  just in the interests of European politicians of a particular  ideological persuasion, as is the case at the moment.    Patiently seeking (and empirically verifying) the answers to  these questions has nothing whatsoever to do with nationalism  (or internationalism), egoism (or altruism), or not seeing  further than one's own nose (or adopting a broader view and  perspective) as is often cast up -- in an oversimplified manner  -- on certain people in our country and abroad.    The Czech Republic proceeds from the hypothesis that the  Czech lands were always part of Europe and, therefore, that they  do not want to be deprived of all the advantages stemming from  membership in European institutions. I firmly believe that we  have already crossed the Rubicon dividing the two totally  different social systems, that we deserve to be taken seriously,  and that we are prepared for further steps toward European  integration. If I say integration, it is because I do not want  to say unification or association, which are altogether  different processes.    We want to be an "equal partner" that does not just want to  get or acquire something, we are also prepared to give. We know  we have to resolve our problems ourselves and, therefore, we are  not asking anyone to resolve them for us. We believe that the  current form of the European integration process is not the  final one, and we would like to participate in the never-ending  process of seeking the most ideal form for it. We realize that  our communist past enables us to see some things more clearly  than the countries of Western Europe, which did not have this  past. This was a great blessing for them, but it is our duty to  constantly point out some of the stumbling blocks. We believe  that we will be listened to.</p>

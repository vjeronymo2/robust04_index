			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEETING OF EVANGELICAL THEOLOGIANS TO DISCUSS SHIFT IN CONCEPT OF DEITY  </P> <P> An array of noted evangelical theologians will begin a three-day conference  Thursday at Christ College Irvine to discuss a what is termed a major trend in  conservative Christian thinking away from an angry, justice-meting God to a  loving, forgiving deity.  </P> <P> "All evangelicals would want to say . . . that God is both friend and judge,"  said the Rev. Michael Horton of Anaheim, president of the conference-sponsoring  Christians United for Reformation.  </P> <P> But the emphasis has been shifting toward preaching and teaching about God's  love, said Horton.  </P> <P> Speaking for the new perspective will be Clark Pinnock of McMaster Divinity  College, Ontario, Canada, Robert Webber of Wheaton College and Richard Rice of  Loma Linda University.  </P> <P> Talking about the older theology are Robert Strimple and W. Robert Godfrey of  Westminster Theological Seminary in Escondido, Rod Rosenbladt of Christ College  and Horton.  </P> <P> The meeting will begin 9 a.m. Thursday. Registration is $50.  </P></p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Whitecroft loss less than feared Whitecroft, the mini-conglomerate which has slimmed down to three core businesses, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 727,000 for the half year to September 30, compared with profits of Pounds 2.23m. That was better than expected, but the company is sticking to its decision to pass its interim dividend, announced a few days before the end of the period, when it forecast losses of about Pounds 1m. Turnover fell to Pounds 60.19m (Pounds 63.1m). Losses per share were 2.89p (earnings of 3.25p).</p>

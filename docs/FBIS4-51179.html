			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Li Wei (2621 0251): "Deng Pufang Pledges To </F> Ensure the Supply of Sufficient Food and Clothing to Disabled  People in China by the Turn of the Century"]    [Text] Beijing, 25 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Deng Pufang,  director in chief of the China Welfare Fund for the Handicapped,  talked this afternoon about the general development goal of  services for the handicapped in China by the turn of the  century. As far as the efforts to satisfy disabled people's  subsistence needs are concerned, he said, our goal is to narrow  the gap between the standard of services for the disabled and  the economic and social development level, to give the disabled  more opportunities for social involvement and to expand the  scope of involvement, to enable them to achieve  self-improvement, and to improve their living conditions.    Deng Pufang specified this general goal as follows:    --To solve the problems regarding the supply of sufficient  food and clothing to the disabled.    --To raise both the employment rate for disabled people in  urban areas and the at-work rate for disabled people in rural  areas to about 80 percent.    --To raise the compulsory education enrollment rate for  disabled children to 80 percent; and to provide vocational  training to about 80 percent of job-awaiting disabled people.    --To assist most disabled people in undergoing  rehabilitation  training in their own neighborhoods or at home; and to start  some urgent and effective rehabilitation projects with a view to  rehabilitating about 2 million disabled people.    --To enrich disabled people's cultural life.    --To promote preventive efforts to eliminate the main  factors  leading to disability.    Deng Pufang talked on this topic during the 10th meeting of  the board of directors of the China Welfare Fund for the  Handicapped held this afternoon.    He also noted that the services for the disabled in China  should be guided by the following principles in the future: 1)  To comprehensively enforce the Law on the Protection of Disabled  Persons; 2) to implement the development guideline of "stressing  real effects and laying down a solid foundation"; to focus on  efforts that can meet disabled people's urgent needs, benefit a  large part of the disabled population, and promise rapid results  and good effects; and to further develop a sound operational and  working system, a sound system of policies, laws, and  regulations, and a sound infrastructure system for services for  disabled people; 3) to adhere to the working principle of  "socialized services"; and 4) to give full play to the  initiative of disabled people and to the role of organizations  of disabled people, so as to enhance the spirit of  self-strengthening among disabled people.    The tasks facing Deng Pufang and his colleagues, one should  say, are not easy, because quite a lot of difficulties have yet  to be solved regarding services for disabled people in China,  even though many achievements have been scored in recent years.  The illiteracy rate among the disabled population remains as  high as about 60 percent, nearly 80 percent of blind, deaf, or  mentally retarded children stay out of school, 40 percent of  disabled people are jobless, and most disabled people have no  access to rehabilitation or medical facilities. However, as  Deng Pufang put it at the board of directors meeting today: "We  certainly can do a good job so long as we mobilize all sectors  of the community to join our efforts, and work in a  down-to-earth and creative manner."</p>

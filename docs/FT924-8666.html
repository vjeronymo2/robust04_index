			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / A ray of hope shines from a pit of despair: In a unique leasing deal, Scottish miners have invested their own money to reopen a British Coal colliery Monktonhall colliery near Edinburgh is the scene of a unique venture in British coal-mining. By the end of this month a group of miners who have formed their own company will begin regular production of coal from the pit which they have leased from British Coal. Not only is this the first time British Coal has allowed a deep mine to be worked by another operator, but each of the 110 miners who are working at Monktonhall has raised Pounds 10,000 to finance the venture and guarantee his job. Monktonhall Mineworkers has no other equity capital. Years of persistence in the face of opposition from local Labour politicians and scepticism by financiers appear to be paying off. 'It's up to ourselves,' says Mr Jim Parker, the managing director, a former British Coal executive. 'We've got no excuses. There's no bad geology, no lazy miners, and no bad management to blame.' British Coal stopped production at Monktonhall in 1987, deciding that it was uneconomical, but the mine was maintained so that it could be reopened. Local politicians and MPs launched a campaign to persuade the company to reopen it. In early 1991 Lothian regional council and other local authorities presented a consultants' report proposing a mining operation employing 370 men, with new investment of Pounds 8m. But to the dismay of the politicians and the National Union of Mineworkers, British Coal announced in August 1991 that it could not justify reopening the mine under its own management. However, British Coal was prepared to lease Monktonhall to another operator. This was the chance which a group of ex-mineworkers from the area, guided by Mr Parker and chaired by Mr Jackie Aitchison (then working as a bus driver), had been waiting for. Some of them had put Pounds 2,000 each into a consultants' feasibility study prior to the local authorities' report, and its conclusions were encouraging. Last December, British Coal agreed to negotiate a lease with Monktonhall Mineworkers, although it said a rival offer from Caledonian Mining, a private company based at Newark, Nottinghamshire, 'enjoyed comparable technical merit'. The state-owned company apparently chose the mineworkers because of political and public pressure. It took Monktonhall Mineworkers, assisted by the accountants Price Waterhouse, nearly six months to finalise the lease agreement. The Labour-controlled local authorities refused to provide finance, believing the venture would be short-lived, and the miners did not succeed in raising capital from outside institutions. 'We'd decided back in October 1991 to finance the project from our own resources,' says Mr Parker, 'but we wanted outside capital as a backstop. We found that institutions which had earlier shown interest in our scheme had turned against us. They listened to local politicians and union leaders. It's not outrageous to say that these politicians and unionists would have preferred the mine shut to it being operated by someone other than British Coal.' Labour politicians would have preferred to have the mine run by the nationalised coal company to it becoming a potential showcase for private enterprise. But the mineworkers had quiet backing from the government, which wanted the bid to succeed, and vocal support from local Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party. The mineworkers secured a loan facility for an undisclosed amount from the Bank of Scotland and decided to invest the maximum they could afford - Pounds 10,000 each, amounting to Pounds 1.1m for the first 110 miners. Some of them put in savings from their British Coal redundancy money, while others took out loans from the Life Association of Scotland or mortgaged their homes. Mr Parker says: 'No one was deceived. We encouraged the miners' wives to come to our meetings to hear about the risks.' The company has a waiting list of ex-miners willing to put in their stake. The company took over Monktonhall in June and installed new winding ropes, reactivated the underground conveyers and bought used machinery in England at one-tenth the price of new equipment, according to Mr Parker. Mr Parker says that Monktonhall should produce 250,000 tonnes of coal a year as the number of miners rises to 155, working two shifts over a five-day week. The mine produced about 1m tonnes a year under British Coal, employing about 1,000 people at its peak. According to Mr Parker, output per year should be 1,400 tonnes a miner, substantially higher than under British Coal's management. Productivity will also be higher, Mr Parker says, because the mineworkers will be working more weeks of the year than under British Coal, without that company's 'ludicrous holidays, loud-mouthed unions and spineless management. We have the motivation of people who have put their own money into their company.' The cost of production, he says, should be Pounds 1.30 a gigajoule compared with the Pounds 1.80 a gigajoule which British Coal is thought to charge ScottishPower, the leading electricity company in Scotland. But Monktonhall's costs are above those of opencast coal. This weakness was highlighted last week when ScottishPower, which had sought tenders for coal supplies, rejected Monktonhall's offer on the grounds that its price was uncompetitive. Instead, it accepted tenders from opencast suppliers in the UK and overseas. Though disappointed, Monktonhall Miners say they will be able to win enough contracts to survive. The company already has contracts to sell some of its coal, and is tendering for orders from large users in Ireland, Malta, the Isle of Man and the Isle of Skye. Quite apart from the battle for contracts, Monktonhall represents a high risk venture. Its financial resources are slender; the market for deep-mined coal is competitive, but it will have to maintain output and sales to cover the cost of keeping the mine pumped and paying interest to the bank. One coal industry observer, thinking of the miners' big personal stakes, calls Monktonhall 'a tragedy waiting to happen'. But Mr Parker has faith in the venture. He says several more pits which British Coal has closed could be reopened profitably on the same basis as Monktonhall with mineworkers as shareholders. He already has his eyes on the mothballed Frances colliery at Kirkcaldy, Fife, though that mine, he says, would cost Pounds 16m to revive, requiring more than the miners' personal funds. He believes the experiment at Monktonhall will improve the prospects for other mines faced with closure. 'There is nothing utopian about this venture. Men here in their 30s are going to make a lot of money at Monktonhall.'</p>

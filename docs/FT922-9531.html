			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (9): Trying to carve out a niche - Profile: Volksbank FEW PEOPLE outside Switzerland had heard of Swiss Volksbank until it emerged as a lender of Dollars 35m to a private company controlled by the late Robert Maxwell. The loan attracted wide attention abroad because it was made only after Mr Ian Maxwell and Mr Kevin Maxwell had pledged Berlitz shares owned by Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC) to Volksbank. The brothers had previously agreed to sell the shares to a Japanese company. The loan also raised eyebrows because few people in Switzerland would have expected this rather sleepy and parochial bank to be involved with the likes of Maxwell. Although Volksbank is Switzerland's fourth largest commercial bank, it is a distant fourth behind the third largest, Credit Suisse, and does not have a particularly distinguished performance record. While Credit Suisse had total assets of SFr155.6bn at the end of last year, Volksbank had only SFr46.5bn. And Volksbank's after-tax return on equity was only 3.1 per cent, compared with 9.9 per cent at Credit Suisse. The bank has been trying to improve its performance, and the Maxwell misadventure is a curious footnote in the story. Volksbank has long looked a rather awkward player on the Swiss banking stage. Though it is in a different league from the big three Swiss commercial banks, it is more than just a building society. It is a full service bank with 191 branches and agencies throughout Switzerland and a strong presence in both retail and corporate lending. The fact that Volksbank does not fit neatly into a clear category has given rise to speculation that it might be taken over. But none of the big three banks - and they are the most likely potential bidders  - is much interested in expanding its already large presence in the Swiss market. Volksbank's leaders recognised a few years ago that their main customers - Switzerland's army of small and medium-sized businesses  - were expanding abroad. 'We did not want to lose them because we could not serve them any more,' says Mr Rudolf Bosshard, the bank's director responsible for international development. They knew that they could not match the big three in the world's leading financial mar- kets. But they thought they could build a sufficient inter- national presence to preserve their client base at home. The obvious first step was to set up offices in the key financial centres that could provide customers with export finance, foreign exchange, capital markets and portfolio management services on competitive terms. A London branch was opened in 1985, and offices in New York, Tokyo and Sing- apore followed in 1989. Early this year, Volksbank purch- ased a 20 per cent stake in Banque Odier Bungener Cour- voisier in Paris rather than try to build up from scratch there. Ironically, it was through the application of this strategy that the bank came into con- tact with Robert Maxwell. In 1987, one of its Swiss industrial customers won a contract to supply machinery to a Maxwell company and Volksbank's London branch provided a guarantee of delivery. The contact was maintained. Volksbank lead-managed a bond issue for MCC a few months later and participated in a syndicated loan for it. However, it then decided to back away a bit. 'We realised Maxwell was too big for us,' Mr Bosshard says. Even so, the bank still has some Maxwell business on its books, and last year made provisions for a Dollars 73m loan to MCC. No provision was made for the Dollars 35m loan to the private Maxwell company because it was covered by the Berlitz shares, which the bank has since claimed. The second stage of Volksbank's international strategy began to take shape last year. Under its expansion programme, it has concluded co-operation agreements with banks in Bavaria, Baden-Wurttemberg and France. Now, says Mr Bosshard, it is looking for a partner or acquisition in northern Italy.</p>

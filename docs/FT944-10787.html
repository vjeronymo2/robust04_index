			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Shortcomings prejudice move to European unity Sir, Karl Lamers (Personal View, November 7) puts forward a compelling case for monetary union in the development of the European Union. The Treaty of Rome put the case for free trade within the community in the 1950s in much the same way . Some 40 years down the road, however, we have the UK with the most efficient steel industry in Europe but with companies being forced out of business because of ongoing blatant internal subsidy of many European steel producers elsewhere, not least in Germany. Is this not an aspect of national sovereignty which Germany and others choose to ignore? Let us put first things first, before moving on to more sophisticated alignments which will generate more problems than economic unity. When will continental Europe understand that we in the UK are not opposed to European union but are sickened by holier-than-thou appeals proclaiming higher aspirations while ignoring fundamental shortcomings in meeting the requirements of the Treaty of Rome? Doctor heal thyself. J M Paton, Culver House, Chester Road, Middlewich, Cheshire</p>

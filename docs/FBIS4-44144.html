			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] Mehmet Kahraman, state minister and Social  Democratic Populist Party deputy general secretary, has resigned  from his post. Kahraman submitted his resignation application to  Murat Karayalcin, state minister and deputy prime minister.    Kahraman stated that his reason for submitting his  resignation was that a human rights ministry has not yet been  established. Stating that he has been exerting efforts with  great hope and patience for a human rights ministry to be  established as envisaged by the coalition government agreement,  Kahraman said: In view of the negative attitude shown by our  coalition partner, the TPP [True Path Party], toward my human  rights ministry proposal at the Turkish Grand National Assembly  meeting, it was impossible to establish the ministry and make it  operational. For this reason, and because I believe that under  these conditions it will not be possible for me to favorably  fulfill my duties as state minister, I request that I be freed  from my duty.</p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MOVIES;  </P> <P> THE NEWCOMERS  </P> <P> Summer is the hottest season for the movie industry, when it makes its major  gambles -- including substantial wagers on new discoveries. The young nes can  come from anywhere. This group hails from such distant points as suburban New  Jersey and suburban Minnesota to the Sonoma Valley of California and the Hunter  Valley in New South Wales.  </P> <P> No wonder the forces behind the upcoming James Bond film, "License to Kill,"  thought Talisa Soto was right for the role of a former Miss Galaxy who fell in  with the wrong crowd. Nature was good to her. At 22, she is enormously  beautiful: dark hair, full lips, almond eyes.  </P> <P> Wearing a pale-blue denim shirt and black leggings, Soto turns heads at the Bel  Age. But she doesn't seem to notice; she's used to it. She fell into modeling  almost effortlessly at 15, she relates, when she showed up at New York's Click  agency in quest of a summer job. "I walked in on a Friday and got a job on  Sunday," she remembers.  </P> <P> Her first assignment was in Italy for Lei magazine. A few days later, she was  in Paris for British Vogue. Now, she thinks she was too young to savor the  experience. "I lost a pound a day," she recalls. "I wanted my mom's cooking, or  pizza. I wasn't into the saucy meals."  </P> <P> She's wiser now, and happy to acknowledge that she's acquired a tough veneer.  "I might have an edge and I would love to develop that even more," she says.  "Because if you're too sweet -- forget it, darling. Always question everything  and don't be gullible. You are your own boss."  </P> <P> One requirement of the Bond job is publicizing the product. But with Soto's  strong instinct for self-protection, she's not entirely comfortable meeting the  press. One of the perks of being a big star, she imagines, is being able to  turn down requests for interviews -- but the Bond producers will have none of  that.  </P> <P> Director Paul Morrissey, who cast Soto in his feature, "Spike of Bensonhurst,"  says Soto's reserve makes her intriguing on screen. "She's very quiet and  withheld, and the more she withholds, the more you're attracted to her," he  explains. "She's kind of a femme fatale. She has a kind of dignity."  </P> <P> However reserved she may be, Soto found her leading man, Timothy Dalton, even  more reserved: "Between actors, there should be give-and-take. I'm not saying  he's selfish, but at certain times he would put up this wall. He's very serious  and very English."  </P> <P> In fact, "License to Kill" was a relatively confining experience, especially  after the freewheeling set of the low-budget "Spike of Bensonhurst."  </P> <P> "I wanted to make this part as strong as possible," she says. "I wanted to make  my character manipulative. (But) I realize in the Bond thing, they try to have  a formula. They don't go for any spontaneity."  </P> <P> And shooting for 5 1/2 months, with an extended stay in Mexico City, was no  picnic, either. "It was great for the first month," she says. "The downfall in  this business is staying in hotel rooms. If you're in your own surroundings,  you're in luck. Going out to dinners, room service -- you get depressed. You  cry for nothing. It's ridiculous. But tough luck, baby. You chose to do this."  </P> <P> Even at the tender age of 15, Soto assumed a no-nonsense attitude about her  career. "For me, the first day I started working I realized this doesn't last  forever," she says. "It's quite obvious. It's all based on beauty and youth."  So she kept the modeling in perspective. "You use it," she explains. "It gives  you the freedom to do so much more. I view it as a job."  </P> <P> Soto grew up in Northampton, Mass., the youngest of four children born to  working-class Puerto Rican parents. She finished high school, then moved to New  York when her modeling career took off.  </P> <P> Eventually, modeling became boring and acting became interesting. She attacked  improvisation classes with her mind-over-matter determination: "When I knew I  was so scared, I said, 'Now I know I have to make an effort.' When you feel you  can't do something, you have to say, 'I'm going to do it.' " And the effort  paid off. "I was quite shy, and it helped me realize that if you want to  accomplish things, they don't listen to the quiet ones," she says.  </P> <P> Soto got into the movies through Morrissey, who is represented by Flick, the  talent arm of the New York agency that handled Soto's modeling career.  Morrissey says photographers at Click, the modeling division, referred to Soto  as "the Puerto Rican Grace Kelly." But with her air of mystery, he says, she  reminded him of Gene Tierney or Garbo. He adds that her beauty didn't hurt.  "The real history of the cinema is the history of great-looking people," he  says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> KELLY LYNCH  </P> <P> Kelly Lynch comes to an interview wearing no makeup, no nail polish, with her  blondish hair hanging limp to her shoulders. Dressed in an dark green T-shirt  and baggy black pants, the former model isn't making a fashion statement. It's  hardly what you'd expect of a starlet with a major role behind her (in  "Cocktail," opposite Tom Cruise) and three pictures coming out this summer.  </P> <P> But Lynch says she's embarrassed about "Cocktail" and she hardly thinks of  herself as a starlet. She'd rather play a real person, as opposed to beautiful  bimbo roles -- in movies as well as in life. That's why she proclaims herself  particularly pleased with her roles in two smaller films, "Drugstore Cowboy"  and "Warm Summer Rain," even though her role as Patrick Swayze's love interest  in the just-opened "Road House," is a bigger-budget studio film that might give  her higher visibility.  </P> <P> "In these next movies, I have layers to the characters. I didn't have to have a  makeup artist on me every five minutes making sure I looked beautiful. I can do  that, but it's an illusion. After a while, I want to geek out," she says.  </P> <P> "Drugstore Cowboy" producer Cary Brokaw says Lynch was true to her word in her  role opposite Matt Dillon. "If Kelly has a type, she was playing the far  extreme away from it," he says. "She plays a young woman addicted to drugs  who's spent most of her life in prison. She's an '80s equivalent to Ma Barker.  She's sort of played down her good looks, as much as that's possible."  </P> <P> A few years ago, Lynch careened around New York on a motorcycle and led a life  that was "a little, like, you know, experimental." But now she's a single  mother with a 3-year-old girl, Shane. "I want to be around for her," Lynch  explains. "I try to be a daredevil in my work, but not my life."  </P> <P> Coy about her age, Lynch acknowledges that she was born 20-some years ago in a  Minneapolis suburb called Golden Valley. "I had a mother like June Cleaver and  a little sister I used to beat up regularly," she says.  </P> <P> Her father was a restaurateur who didn't encourage her interest in performing.  "My mom was always sneaking me off to dance class and acting class," Lynch  says. "My dad was worried that I was going to be what I've become. He was  worried that I wouldn't make enough money to eat."  </P> <P> She barely sampled college before pulling out to pursue acting. But her career  was almost ended before it began by a car crash that threatened to leave her  paralyzed. She spent months recuperating.  </P> <P> "It was actually the best thing that ever happened to me," she says. "I decided  I wouldn't limit myself. When you really get your life taken away from you for  a long period of time, you (later) go at it with a different sense of purpose  and drive."  </P> <P> After recovering, Lynch went to New York and surprised herself by landing  modeling jobs -- posing for catalogue. "I kept waiting for them to take the  clothes off me and tell me to wash my face. I had this image of myself as a  goofy-looking thing."  </P> <P> Still, she says, her assignments weren't particularly glamorous. "Anybody can  make a $5,000 dress look good, but it's a really great model who can put on a  housecoat and sell it across America," she laughs.  </P> <P> Lynch almost apologizes for the television roles on "Miami Vice" and the cable  series "Hitchhiker" that got her started as an actor: "I assumed I was going to  be working in theater. But I had a rude awakening with rent and food and the  cost of living. How can people do that and work on the stage? I wasn't that  clever."  </P> <P> She first appeared in movies in a small role as a jaded model in "Bright  Lights, Big City." Then she went on to "Cocktail" as the insecure (and often  scantily clothed) wife of Tom Cruise's best friend, fellow bartender Bryan  Brown. But much of her performance was edited out of the film.  </P> <P> "I think it was more interesting as written," she says. "We had a dark story  about the '80s and it ended up being about flipping bottles and a stupid love  story."  </P> <P> Cruise, the hottest male star going, seemed uptight. His character repels her  in the film -- but there was that one moment where they kiss -- the moment of  "heat." She says that Cruise kept his lips firmly compressed during their  supposedly-passionate kiss.  </P> <P> Another rude shock occurred when United Artists canceled her next picture,  "Atuk," on the first day of shooting because of the studio's disputes with star  Sam Kinison. But UA rerouted her into "Road House," in which Swayze plays a  bouncer with a degree in philosophy. She's a doctor who becomes his sweetheart.  </P> <P> Lynch seems slightly baffled by the recent heat on her. She maintains that  stardom isn't her goal. "I'd rather do a small movie that just a few people see  than a big movie that I'm not proud of," she insists. "The integrity part of  this is as important to me as anything. I'm still an idiot and I look at this  as an art."  </P> <P> </P> <P> ROBERT SHAWN LENARD  </P> <P> At 20, Robert Shawn Leonard worries that he hasn't suffered enough to be great.  He has convinced a lot of people that he's a pretty good actor but he thinks a  lot of people are easily pleased. "You sort of get cast as a kid and you sort  of just have to play a kid," he says simply. "It's really later, when you get  into roles in Chekhov when you have to have incredible resources to fall back  on."  </P> <P> But there's "talk" around town, fired by advance screenings of the film "The  Dead Poet's Society," that Leonard manages to stand out in a group of seven  young actors who play Robin Williams' students. Williams portrays an English  teacher who sets out to inspire his prep school wards.  </P> <P> It was the first major motion picture role for Leonard, who has been  concentrating in theater since he appeared at age 12 in a summer stock version  of "The Music Man."  </P> <P> Joked Robin Williams of Leonard: "If Laurence Olivier and James Dean had a kid,  this is what it would look like."  </P> <P> But he went on to say that Leonard combines a theatrical talent with a strong,  emotive film presence.  </P> <P> Even though Leonard is thoroughly American, Australian Peter Weir, who directed  the film, saw something of the theatrically trained British actor in Leonard.  </P> <P> "Bobby struck me as magic from the moment he first read for the part," Weir  says. "In his work, he combines the best of the British (stage) actor with the  best of the American screen actor. He has the training and discipline that most  British actors get, (and) the camera loves him, which makes for a unique  leading man."  </P> <P> The young actor says Weir sought a theatrical performance focused more on his  body language than his facial expressions. "He was really into the  physicality," he explains. "Most film work is taking what's in your head and  showing it in your eyes. I'm not sure I have that much inside me yet."  </P> <P> But has his life has been too normal? He grew up in an "average suburban town"  in New Jersey. His father is a retired teacher, his mother is a nurse. "My  parents are still together, I don't do drugs . . . . Why am I an actor?" he  asks wryly.  </P> <P> Leonard followed "Dead Poets" with a stint in a free one-act play in a  theater-bar in New York. "All the theaters are sort of in my backyard here and  I know everyone . . . . I've never taken an acting class, never studied. But in  a way, it is studying, going from play to play," he says.  </P> <P> The Hollywood scene strikes Leonard as far less nourishing: "In L.A., actors  just sort of come and go. There's no base, no center where you see other actors  and study their work." Nonetheless, movies have their place in a young actor's  life. "The money's great," Leonard admits. "It certainly pays for doing  theater. I audition for everything."  </P> <P> Before "Dead Poets," Leonard had a couple of roles in small films and in TV  movies. On Broadway, he starred as Eugene in Neil Simon's "Brighton Beach  Memoirs" and shared the stage with Derek Jacoby in the British play, "Breaking  the Code."  </P> <P> While he pursues his career, Leonard also is toiling as a student at Fordham  University in New York. "Right now, I'm weeding the garden of Plato's Republic,  which has been hell for me," he says. "I've been studying part time for three  years, on and off, and I plan to finish before I die."  </P> <P> Nothing in Leonard's life at the moment seems likely to provide the baptism of  fire that he thinks he lacks. But he finds consolation in considering that his  hero, Jimmy Stewart, also had a fairly stable background. And Stewart, in  response to several fan letters, wrote to endorse Leonard's plan to stay in the  theater for the time being. "He wrote, 'It's the best training for an actor,' "  Leonard says happily. "If I can't follow Jimmy Stewart's advice, I don't know  whose I would."  </P> <P> </P> <P> YAHOO SERIOUS  </P> <P> If Warner Brothers is right, Yahoo Serious will prove to be more than just  another fresh face in the movies this summer. He will be a sudden sensation,  duplicating his phenomenal success in his native Australia with his first film,  "Young Einstein."  </P> <P> How much does the studio believe in this bizarre blending of Paul Hogan and Pee  Wee Herman? Enough to spend (they say) $8 million or more to market a movie  that cost just under $4 million to make. So keen were Warner executives to show  him off at February's ShoWest film market in Las Vegas that they offered to  send the corporate jet to retrieve him from his honeymoon in Africa. Serious  caught a regular flight, just like a regular guy.  </P> <P> A regular guy he isn't. At 35 he hardly looks like one, with electrified orange  hair and unusual sartorial tastes. On a stopover in Los Angeles, he was wearing  what he refers to as his "Elvis Presley pink" suit with tailor's measurements  printed on the fabric and a strip of buttons running along the seams. His socks  were pink and yellow.  </P> <P> He says, sweetly, "It's an anti-fashion statement."  </P> <P> Not only did he star in "Young Einstein," but he also wrote, produced, directed  and edited it. He worked feverishly to maintain creative control through five  years of permutations that finally brought it to the big screen. The effort  paid off when the picture became the fourth-biggest box office producer in  Australian history, behind the two "Crocodile Dundees" and "E.T. the Extra  Terrestrial"  </P> <P> Serious describes his film as "a cross between 'Lawrence of Arabia' and a Bugs  Bunny cartoon."  </P> <P> (He performed his own stunts, including break-dancing, hot-air ballooning,  horse riding, surfing, high diving and cliff climbing. In fact, his recent  honeymoon with co-star Lulu Pinkus sounded like something out of the movie.  Says Serious: "We've been white-water rafting down the crocodile-infested  Zambezi River.")  </P> <P> The plot follows the young radical Einstein's adventures through the invention  of the electric guitar and a love affair with Marie Curie. (In one satirical  shot, Einstein is ejected from a Sydney University lecture hall filled with  sheep.)  </P> <P> So what's with his name? Serious adopted it years ago (from the more pedestrian  Greg Pead) and offers no coherent explanation. But he says it works with his  new life as auteur: "When I perform, I'm 'Yahoo,' and when I'm the director,  I'm 'Serious.' "  </P> <P> Serious grew up in Hunter Valley on the northern coast of New South Wales.  After dropping out of school at 15, he briefly adopted his father's trade of  fitting tires. He dabbled in painting, attended art school for a couple of  years, then drifted into TV production.  </P> <P> But he dropped out again and went wanderlusting on an extended international  hitchhiking expedition that ultimately provided the inspiration for "Young  Einstein." The idea came to him on a trip down the Amazon when he spotted a  Brazilian wearing a T-shirt depicting the inventor as an elderly man, sticking  out his tongue.  </P> <P> Will success spoil Serious? He thinks not but he doesn't back away from media  scrutiny. "I kind of love it," he says. "And I don't do anything I don't want  to do." In that vein, he recently agreed to appear on Australia's "60 Minutes"  program as long as he could interview himself.  </P> <P> "I lashed myself with a really hard question: 'How do you cope with suddenly  being chased around and being a sex symbol?' It's a really horrible question, a  crass question," he says.  </P> <P> "So how did I answer?" He pauses for effect. "I said, 'Well, I could ask you  the same question.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> WINONA RYDER  </P> <P> Diminutive Winona Ryder, with her innocent brown eyes, may have one of the  summer's most dicey roles -- playing Jerry Lee Lewis' 13-year-old cousin and  bride. Even though she's all of 17, she worried about her love-making scenes  with 34-year-old leading man Dennis Quaid.  </P> <P> "The thing that I was really freaked out about was -- how it was going to  look?" she says. "Because, literally, I look about 11 years old. My hair's back  in a ponytail and I'm wearing these little Peter Pan-collar things and I just  look so young. And he looks older. I was really concerned that people were  going to see it and go, 'This is so perverted -- 34 and 17.'  </P> <P> "I was afraid that was going to take away from them watching the movie, that  all they were going to be thinking about was Winona Ryder and Dennis Quaid, not  the love story.  </P> <P> "But Jerry Lee and Myra -- as weird as it was -- I think they really were in  love with each other and I really wanted that to come across. I wanted to come  across like, it was love and when love comes so strong, there is no right or  wrong."  </P> <P> Ryder finally met Myra, when she was invited to attend one of the screenings of  the "dailies": "I was so nervous. We were showing her some stuff where he was  picking her up from school and says, 'I'm gonna marry you.' And it goes to the  wedding.  </P> <P> "I looked over and she was crying and I was so scared because I didn't know  what she was crying about. I didn't know if she was crying because I was a bad  actress or that it was so real.  </P> <P> "And then she turned to me and hugged me and said, 'You're a gift from God.' It  was probably the most amazing feeling that I've ever had in connection with  acting, to have that kind of approval."  </P> <P> Ryder has little in common with a 13-year-old growing up in Memphis in the '50s  ("It's the absolute opposite of me," she says). But she admits that she's not  entirely grown up yet, either. "Now, amazingly, people look at me -- I don't  even want to say it but -- not like a little girl anymore," she confesses. "I'm  talking about guys. It is sort of strange because I'm not, like, this really  experienced -- I don't really know what to do in . . . situations."  </P> <P> She laughs. "This is a strange place to be when you're 17. I'm still jailbait,  really. Thank God. When I turn 18, I don't know."  </P> <P> All this made her scenes with Quaid awkward, particularly because her leading  man immersed himself in the role of the wildly unpredictable rocker of living  legend.  </P> <P> "I never knew when he was being himself," she says. "When he would say  something to me, I didn't know if it was him saying it or Jerry Lee Lewis  saying it. I did sort of get confused from time to time. On the whole, he was  just very, sort of, obsessed. Obsessed and possessed."  </P> <P> For the most part, Quaid/Lewis played the protective role toward young  Ryder/Myra. And Ryder thinks the unnerving aspects of his behavior helped her.  "During actual filming, my stomach was sort of coming up through my throat,"  she explains. "When he gets into it, he gets into it. I was a little scared,  but that's great because Myra was scared a lot. When he would yell at her, when  he would not trust her, when he would accuse her of being unfaithful, what  could she do? When he would come on to her, no one had ever come on to Myra  before. So I think all my -- Winona's -- reactions worked very well for her  reactions, too."  </P> <P> "Great Balls of Fire" producer Adam Fields says Ryder isn't feigning the role  of ingenue. "Winona is a very young 17," he says. "She's not like New York or  Hollywood kids." Originally, he considered Emily Lloyd or even Holly Hunter for  the part, but Ryder surprised him with her performance: "She reminds me of  Elizabeth Taylor in 'National Velvet' or a young Audrey Hepburn."  </P> <P> Until this summer, Ryder's best-known role was as the mournful daughter in  "Beetlejuice."  </P> <P> The character seems alien considering Ryder's exuberance, but she says  appearances are misleading. "I've gone through very dark stages where I would  only wear black," she explains. "I went through that stage right before I did  that movie, so it was a cinch. I was very dramatic. I was like a living sigh.  It was my 'Sunset Boulevard' thing."  </P> <P> Right now, Ryder's enthusiasm for life is fully restored. She and her best  friend, model Heather Bursch, have plans. "I want to do the backpack thing --  first drive across the United States, rent a car and bring no money and no  clothes and write really bad poetry," she says, dissolving into a self-mocking  laugh.  </P> <P> "Do the whole Jack Kerouac thing. Then we want to go to Europe and do it there.  We also want to go to Africa. We want to go to college together. We want to end  up in Trinity in Ireland for the last two years but the first two years we want  to go somewhere in the United States." Meanwhile, she's taking guitar, piano,  cooking and fencing. "And I write a lot," she says.  </P> <P> Ryder grew up in Petaluma . She's the third of four children born to Cindy and  Michael Horowitz; her mother makes educational videos, and her father runs a  bookstore specializing in the '60s and the counterculture. The daughter chose  her current surname when she started acting.  </P> <P> Ryder's acting career lifted off effortlessly when she was 12. "I started going  to a little acting class and a casting director was there by chance," she says.  Her success came as a surprise.  </P> <P> "I thought about acting but it wasn't a life ambition," she says. "When an  agent called me, I said, 'Well, what do you do?' I never had to really work for  the things I got . . . . I concentrate a lot and I'm a really hard worker, but  everything happened for me in a great way."  </P> <P> She debuted in "Lucas" when she was 13. She followed with roles in "Square  Dance," "Beetlejuice," "1969" and the recent black comedy about teen suicide,  "Heathers."  </P> <P> Ryder's work prevented her from attending her local high school so she studied  independently and completed her high school requirements with a perfect 4-point  average. While she feels some yearning for the prom and other adolescent  trappings, she wasn't especially happy at her school.  </P> <P> "I was not Miss Popularity," she says. "Me and Heather were sort of the geeks.  Nobody ever paid attention to us or if they did, it was all negative . . . .  They confronted us a lot. They would say, 'You're going to go nowhere.' It's  funny. Now, she's in Elle and I'm sure all those girls are feeling a little bit  stupid."  </P></p>

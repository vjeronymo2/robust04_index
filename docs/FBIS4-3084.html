			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 15 (XINHUA) -- China's drive to build  a socialist market economy has brought new opportunities and  prospects for the people of minority nationalities and the  economy in the areas where they live.    Ismail Amat, minister in charge of the State Nationalities  Affairs Commission, told a press conference today that the  economic construction in the ethnic areas has achieved success  since China adopted its reform and opening-up policy 15 years  ago.    Ismail, who is also a state councillor, said that the gross  domestic product in such areas in 1993 increased by 11.9 percent  from the previous year -- the highest growth rate since 1985.    The volume of foreign trade in such areas last year was up  41.8 percent from the previous year, to more than 5.7 billion  U.S. dollars, he said.    Ismail said that China has further opened its border areas,  where a large part of China's minority nationality population  lives, resulting in a boom of border trade. He added that the  regions have been utilizing an increasing amount of foreign  investment.    He told reporters that the country has newly opened 43  national-level inland outlets, and 34 of them are in the areas  inhabited by people of minority nationalities, in addition to  190 regional-level ones they already have.    He said that the living standards of the people in those  areas have been significantly improved over the past years, with  the per capita income for farmers and herdsmen rising from some  70 yuan in 1978 to more than 600 yuan last year.    Against the backdrop of intensified ethnic and religious  conflicts in some parts of the turbulent world, China has foiled  sabotage attempts of hostile elements in the world and  separatists both at home and abroad, the minister stressed.    He said that the towns and cities in the border areas  inhabited by minority nationality people have become the  frontier of China's opening-up drive, as the country offers more  areas for foreign trade and business in a strategy called  comprehensive openness.    The past 15 years of reform and opening-up has considerably  strengthened the economic muscle in those areas and accumulated  precious experience, which, in turn, has provided sound  material, social and ideological conditions for further  developing such areas, the official said.    He indicated that the establishment of a socialist market  economic regime will help bring the advantages and vitality of  the areas into better play.    As the overall national strength and macro-economic control  capacity grow, the government will become more capable of  assisting the underdeveloped areas so as to help them catch up  with the rest of the country, Ismail said.    He said that the unity of the country's nationalities and  their increased contacts and communications have combined to  create a harmonious environment both for the developed east and  the underdeveloped west to make up for each other's short points  and accomplish common development.    He added that social stability, particularly in the minority  nationality-inhabited areas, has formed a sound basis for  economic progress and the expansion of reform in such areas.    Ismail said the government will commend those individuals  and  collectives contributing to the unity and progress of all  nationalities in September at a national meeting.    Meanwhile, in-depth research will be carried out to study  ways to promote the cause of national unity and progress in the  process of building a socialist market economic system.</p>

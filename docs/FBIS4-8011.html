			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] There is some good news in Mostar today. A  checkpoint has finally been opened for civilians to pass from  one part of town to another and the work on normalizing the town  infrastructure has begun. Here is a report by our Mostar  correspondent Omer Vatric:    [Begin Vatric recording] This day will be remembered in  Mostar by the first meetings of family members and friends at  the town line of separation, at which only bullets and shells  were meeting for a full 11 months. On two occasions, 50 Mostar  people from the eastern and 50 from the western part of the town  met at the crossroads in front of the burnt-down Hit department  store. They were coming in groups of 25 and had two hours to  tell about their pain, fear, and hope. [passage omitted] New  groups of citizens should meet tomorrow as well as the next day.    The citizens of Donja Mahala, Semovac, and Sermica will  remember this day because the water came back. Water  authorities say that, in conformity with agreements reached with  the Croatian Defense Council, these districts will get drinking  water after more than nine months. Unfortunately, the entire  left bank [of the Neretva] will remain without water in the  coming days, and the entire eastern part of Mostar will remain  without electricity. Constant talks about the implementation of  the Washington agreement and implementing the agreed federation  bring hope that all of Mostar will have water and electricity  soon and that the building of bridges and a general  normalization of life will begin.

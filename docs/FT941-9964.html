			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Templeton Emerging placing and offer Templeton Emerging Markets, the largest UK investment trust in the emerging markets sector, hopes to raise new capital through a placing and offer for subscription of conversion shares. The public offer is likely to be in March. On conversion, one warrant will be attached to every five new ordinary shares. The trust subsequently plans a scrip issue in October, giving shareholders two new shares for every one they hold already. This should improve the liquidity of the shares, which are currently priced at about 450p. A savings scheme attached to the fund allows investments of as little as Pounds 30 a month, so a lower share price would make it easier for those savers to invest. Existing warrants for the trust expire in September. After the scrip issue, the trust plans to issue new warrants, with a 10-year life, on a 1-for-5 basis for all ordinary shares except those resulting from the conversion share issue, which will already have warrants attached. The terms of those warrants will be adjusted to put them on an equal footing with the new warrants. Shares in the trust, which has assets of about Pounds 420m, have been trading at a premium to net asset value of as much as 17 per cent in recent months, but this has now fallen to about 7 per cent. Templeton raised Pounds 85m of new capital, through a placing and open offer, less than a year ago. The trust has a wide geographical distribution between 21 countries.</p>

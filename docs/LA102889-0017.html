			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MILITARY BILL CONTAINS $194 MILLION FOR AREA  </P> <P> The Senate on Friday approved an $8.5-billion military construction bill that  includes $194 million for the San Diego area.  </P> <P> The legislation, which now goes to the President for approval, provides funding  for a $7.5-million, 600-space parking garage at the Navy Hospital in Balboa  Park; $15 million for 183 units of family housing at Camp Pendleton and three  child care centers -- at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, the 32nd Street Naval  Station and the Naval Training Center.  </P> <P> Earlier, the construction of 412 units of housing had been approved for Camp  Pendleton. With the added 183 units, Camp Pendleton will be able to house  nearly 600 families, said Rep. Bill Lowery (R-San Diego).  </P> <P> "The additional homes, for our personnel and their families, highlight the  committee's emphasis on providing decent and affordable housing for the  military," Lowery said.  </P> <P> Officials at Camp Pendleton have been upgrading living quarters for years, and  the money will help accelerate their efforts, said Marine Gunnery Sgt. Stan  Pederson. "Raising the standards of living makes a difference as to how your  people operate. This is a real quality-of-life issue."  </P> <P> The funding for construction in the San Diego area also includes the following  projects:  </P> <P> * $3.6 million to upgrade security at the San Diego Fleet Combat Training  Center.  </P> <P> * $12.8 million for a firefighting trainer facility at the Fleet Training  Center.  </P> <P> * $13.9 million for a vehicle maintenance facility at Camp Pendleton.  </P> <P> * $24.5 million for bachelor enlisted men's quarters at Camp Pendleton.  </P> <P> Officials welcomed the money as being much needed, and some said they could  easily use more.  </P> <P> "You're not looking at any fat in the budget here," said Cmdr. Doug Schamp, a  Navy spokesman. "What you're looking at is probably the cream of a large  package submitted for approval, and, after much scrutiny under microscopes,  these items approved were considered necessary to continued operation at the  current level."  </P> <P> The legislation was approved by the House on Thursday.  </P></p>

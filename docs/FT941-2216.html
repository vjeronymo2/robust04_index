			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rising house sales help lift Avonside to Pounds 5.5m Avonside, the building services and housebuilder floated off from Cannon Street Investments in 1992, increased pre-tax profits by 21 per cent to Pounds 5.51m in 1993. The rise followed a drop in first half profits from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 2.2m. Since then house sales had risen significantly and margins had also improved, Mr Christopher Glynn, chairman, said yesterday. Even so margins fell slightly. Profits were helped by a Pounds 203,000 contribution from acquisitions, BS Glazing and Clydesdale Roofing, and a 21 per cent increase in the number of homes sold to 262. The group operates in Scotland, north England and Wales. Turnover increased by 29 per cent to Pounds 66.3m (Pounds 51.5m). Mr Glynn said this was a satisfactory performance in difficult market conditions. The proposed final dividend, is to be increased to 2.3p making a total for the year of 4.2p (4p). This is covered by earnings per share of 8.54p (7.08p). Mr Glynn said prevailing economic conditions of low inflation, falling interest rates and a slight improvement in unemployment levels had encouraged an increase in house sales. Margins in the building services division, however, had begun to recover from their recessionary low. The group expected house prices to stabilise in 1994 and for margins and prices in the building services division to continue to recover.</p>

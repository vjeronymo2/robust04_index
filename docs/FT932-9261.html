			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Unrest in public services threatens disruption THREATS of summer disruption to the public services grew yesterday as the Fire Brigades Union conference voted unanimously to organise strike ballots and the National Union of Teachers voted to boycott national curriculum tests. The most serious immediate danger to the government comes from the FBU, whose general secretary, Mr Ken Cameron, warned the government: 'Take us on, and you take us on at your peril.' The firefighters' union wants to protect a 15-year-old formula that links pay rises for its members to increases awarded to the top 25 per cent of manual workers. The union's leaders argue that the formula will be scrapped because of the government's 1.5 per cent pay limit, although ministers and local government employers insist that nothing can be determined about firefighters' pay until November, when their negotiations are due. The NUT's boycott vote, by a majority of 96 per cent of those who voted, and 67.3 per cent of the total relevant membership, meant that the three biggest teachers' unions will all boycott the tests, in effect destroying any chance that they can produce meaningful results. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, 'deeply regretted' the decision. The 1.5 per cent public sector pay policy may bring more trouble for the government in other areas. Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries, is due to publish a report on police pay next month and its recommendations may prompt unrest in the police force if it threatens to alter the formula, which has led to enormous increases for the police pay bill in recent years. Other groups in the public services, notably ambulance workers, nurses, civil servants and local-government staff, threaten disruption against the government's planned cuts in services, privatisation of services and the contracting-out of work to private companies. The firefighters' union is joining ambulance and health workers in demonstrations on May 26. However, a tactical disagreement between the teachers' unions provides a ray of hope for the government over testing. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, said: 'I urge all those unions implementing the boycott to be very clear and correct about their objective.' He said that comments from the NUT suggested the dispute was 'more concerned with the educational, philosophical and political aspects of testing, which cannot form the basis of a legitimate trade dispute'. The NAS/UWT has beaten legal challenges by presenting its boycott as a dispute solely over workloads. Fire union agrees to strike ballots, Page 10 Major defiant at test boycott, Page 10</p>

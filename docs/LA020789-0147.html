			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> FAIRFAX STORES EMPTIED IN METHANE LEAK  </P> <P> About 50 commercial buildings in the Fairfax district were evacuated early  today after potentially explosive levels of methane gas were detected on a  sidewalk and in the basements of two stores, one of which was shattered by a  gas explosion in 1985.  </P> <P> Authorities expected the evacuation to last all day. To prevent a dangerous  buildup of gas, firefighters planned to pump ground water from beneath the area  into the sewer system. Removing the water, officials said, would relieve  pressure on the gas, which is naturally produced by rotting organic material in  old oil fields underlying the area.  </P> <P> Workers at a K Mart and Ross Dress for Less Store in a Third Street shopping  center across from the Farmers Market reported the gas seepage at 6:12 this  morning. Dangerous levels of methane also were found on the sidewalk in front  of the Gilmore Bank, as well as in the shopping center.  </P> <P> Several blocks of Third Street between Fairfax Avenue and Gardner Street were  immediately blocked off.  </P> <P> Authorities attributed the gas threat to the same forces that caused the 1985  explosion, which injured 21 people. Subterranean methane gas still seeps to the  surface, where it is trapped by buildings and streets.  </P> <P> "The gas is always looking for a way out of the ground," said Assistant Fire  Chief Jim Young. The recent rain has compounded the problem by saturating the  ground and leaving less space for the gas.  </P> <P> "The percolation is quite forceful," said Vince Marzo, another Fire Department  spokesman. "We'd probably be looking at angels with harps" if a match were  struck near the area, Marzo said.  </P> <P> After the 1985 blast in the Ross Dress for Less Store in the Parklabrea  Shopping Center, gas vents were installed beneath the parking lot and in Ross's  basement. The city has also since required the installation of gas detection  devices in residential basements and directed commercial building owners to  meet new ventilation standards in their basements or to install gas detection  equipment.  </P></p>

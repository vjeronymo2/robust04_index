			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 11 (YONHAP) -- Yi Ki-taek, chairman of  the main opposition Democratic Party, held back from officially  announcing his plan to visit the United States at his party's  Supreme Council Monday amid rising intra-party criticism of its  timing.    Yi had been determined to report details of his schedule for  a U.S. visit in a Supreme Council meeting Monday as a formal  step before embarking on the trip.    The opposition leader, who has already postponed his  departure originally scheduled for Sunday, however, expressed  his intention to go ahead with the plan, saying, "If the  domestic political situation worsened, it would be difficult for  me to leave, but it is neither easy nor good to delay for the  second time, or cancel, it."    "Even if I went there, I would come back in a hurry if the  domestic situation warranted," Yi said, hinting that the visit  is still on.    Meanwhile, sources close to Yi said he would leave for  America on April 19 for a 13-day visit featuring a meeting with  Vice President Al Gore, speeches at the National Press Club in  Washington and the Asia Society in New York, and a tour of  California's silicon valley.    Some members of the DP Supreme Council strongly opposed his  departure, however, as the party is demanding a special session  of the National Assembly to deal with a "national crisis."    The Democratic Party has launched a nationwide movement to  oppose the Uruguay Round trade agreement and vowed not to ratify  the accord at the National Assembly. It is also demanding a  probe into the power struggle gripping the Chogye Buddhist order  and alleged diversion of Buddhist slush funds into the political  arena.</p>

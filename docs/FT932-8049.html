			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Two groups to compete for stake in Belgian bank FORTIS, the Dutch-Belgian financial services group, and Generale de Banque, Belgium's largest bank, are to fight it out for a stake in the Belgian state-owned savings bank, ASLK-CGER, in the first round of a four-year, BFr70bn (Dollars 2.1bn) Belgian privatisation programme. The sale of up to 49 per cent of ASLK-CGER, which has a network of bank and insurance branches, could raise as much as BFr33bn and help reduce Belgium's budget deficit. Mr Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian finance minister, has also indicated that a bid for a majority stake in ASLK-CGER would be considered, although Belgian legislation would have to be altered to allow the state to give up control. The deadline for submitting 'indicative non-binding' offers for ASLK-CGER closed yesterday afternoon. Both Fortis - which groups the activities of the Belgian insurer AG and the Dutch group Amev - and Generale de Banque confirmed they had put in bids. They refused to give further details or to indicate whether they had bid for a majority or minority stake. Internationale Nederlanden Groep, the Dutch financial services group which last year considered bidding for Banque Bruxelles Lambert, another leading Belgian bank, will not be making an offer for ASLK-CGER. ING paid the required BFr2.5m to examine the ASLK-CGER prospectus but decided the group would not fit into its strategy. Until recently Generale de Banque and Fortis were considering linking to develop 'bancassurance' activities in Belgium, but fell out over the terms of co-operation. Fortis sold most of its 14.7 per cent stake in the bank a month ago. It was not clear yesterday if other bids had been submitted. There had been rumours that French group Caisse des Depots et Consignations and the German bank WestLB were interested, but CDC is understood not to have made a bid. ASLK-CGER, which is being advised by Petercam, the Belgian broker, will now consider the bids and submit its decision for approval by the government before the summer. Fortis said it hoped the whole sale could be concluded before the end of the year.</p>

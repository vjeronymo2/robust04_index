			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / International Company News: GFSA considers merging 3 gold mines GOLD FIELDS of South Africa (GFSA), the country's second largest gold producer, is considering merging Libanon and Venterspost, two of its more marginal mines, with Kloof mine. Analysts speculate that a deal could be based upon tax savings, with the group being allowed to offset Libanon and Venterspost's losses and capital spending against Kloof's current revenues. Libanon and Venterspost are two of the most vulnerable mines in the South African gold mining industry. They made respective after-tax losses of R3.2m and R3.3m in the first quarter of 1992, and have stock market capitalisations of about R85m (Dollars 23.6m) and R60m respectively. Kloof, by contrast, is one of the richest mines in the industry. It made R111.5m profit in the March quarter and has a market capitalisation of about R3.7bn.</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hungary increases farm export pressure HUNGARY, EVEN after sacrificing a fifth of this year's harvest to drought and heat, is increasing the pressure on west European producers. Mr Gyorgy Rasko, state secretary at the ministry of agriculture, yesterday forecast that Hungary's agricultural exports would double to Dollars 5bn within five years. He said that Hungary was 'the cheapest producer in the world' because of the large average size of farms, low wages and the country's naturally fertile plains. Hungary estimates that its farms, once they are run with fewer administrative overheads, can produce wheat at a cost of Dollars 50 a tonne compared with the west European level of about Dollars 120 a tonne. Counting the cost after the hottest August on record, the government yesterday forecast damage of Dollars 500m or 20 per cent to crop output in 1992. 'We have enormous losses,' said Mr Rasko warning that they could grow even further over the next two weeks. Yields are forecast to decline most for maize, by about 30 per cent from the average of 1989-91, prompting Mr Rasko to forecast that less than 500,000 tonnes would be exported this year. The ministry has granted licences for only 1m tonnes of wheat exports, compared with capacity for 2m tonnes and last year's 2.5m tonnes. But Mr Rasko said that the biggest surprise was that Hungarian agricultural exports, largely to the European Community, far from falling, had risen 20-25 per cent in the year to the first half of 1992. The state secretary predicted that total agricultural exports in 1992 would reach Dollars 2.5bn despite the drought, about the same as last year. The government ascribes the export performance partly to the association agreement with the European Community, which expanded Hungary's quotas and reduced the tariffs and levies to which deliveries were subject. 'The EC is not as protectionist as many people thought,' commented Mr Rasko. Exports have grown too because 300 private trading companies have set up since the state-owned trading houses that used to conduct Hungary's agricultural trade lost their monopolies. The new traders are far more flexible and enterprising than their predecessors.</p>

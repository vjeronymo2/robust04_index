			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 23 (KNS-KCNA) [dateline as received] --  An emergency meeting of Koreans in Japan against the U.S. war  moves took place in Tokyo on April 17.    It was co-sponsored by the Alliance of South Koreans in  Japan  for Democracy and Unification, the South Korean Youth League in  Japan and the Democratic Association of South Korean Women in  Japan.    The resolution adopted at the meeting urges the United  States  to give up the scheme to resume the "Team Spirit" military  exercises and stop deploying Patriot missiles and other weapons  of mass destruction in South Korea under the pretext of the  "nuclear issue" and hold the third round of talks with North  Korea at an early date and resolve all the outstanding problems  between the two countries in a peaceful way in a package deal.    It demands that the Kim Yong-sam regime renounce the policy  of confrontation with the North and dependence on foreign forces  and choose the road of national reconciliation and reunification  by maintaining independence and that the Japanese Government  seek a negotiated solution to the "nuclear issue," instead of  following the U.S. war policy.</p>

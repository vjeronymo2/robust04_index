			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Package Grants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This grant program permits applicants to submit one concept paper (or application) for a ``package'' of related grants rather than separate proposals for each related component of the package. Package grants of up to $750,000 per year may be awarded to support projects that address interrelated topics or the core elements of a multifaceted program, or that require the services of all or some of the same key staff persons. Package grants must enhance (not merely maintain) an applicant's services and must otherwise meet the Institute's grant criteria. The Board retains the discretion to support all, none, or selected portions of the proposed package. Package grant concept papers and applications will be considered on the same schedule as project grants. See sections III.J., V.C. and D., VI.A.2.b. and 3.b., VII.A.3., VII.C., and VII.D. for more information about package grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Technical Assistance Grants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this program, a State or local court may receive a grant of up to $30,000 to engage outside experts to provide technical assistance to diagnose, develop, and implement a response to a jurisdiction's problems. The Guideline allocates up to $600,000 in FY 1995 funds to support technical assistance grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Curriculum Adaptation Grants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A grant of up to $20,000 may be awarded to a State or local court to replicate or modify a model training program developed with SJI funds. The Guideline allocates up to $350,000 for these grants in FY 1995, the same amount allocated in FY 1994. See section II.B.2.b.i.(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Like Technical Assistance grant applications, letters requesting Curriculum Adaptation grants may be submitted at any time during the fiscal year. However, in order to permit the Institute sufficient time to evaluate these proposals, letters must be submitted no later than 90 days before the projected date of the training program. See section II.B.2.b.i.(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Scholarships <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Guideline allocates up to $250,000 of FY 1995 funds for scholarships to enable judges and court managers to attend out-of-State education and training programs. See section II.B.2.b.v.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Guideline establishes four deadlines for scholarship requests: November 1, 1994 for training programs beginning between February 1, 1995 and April 30, 1995; February 1, 1995 for programs beginning between May 1, 1995 and July 31, 1995; May 1, 1995 for programs beginning between August 1, 1995 and October 31, 1995; and August 1, 1995 for programs beginning between November 1, 1995 and January 31, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As in past years, the proposed Guideline provides that each scholarship application must be accompanied by a concurrence signed by the chief justice of the applicant's State. The purpose of this requirement has been to assure that: the applicant's participation in the program benefits the State; the applicant's absence to attend the program would not present an undue hardship to the court; and receipt of a scholarship would not diminish the amount of funds made available by the State for judicial education. Because this requirement has caused some confusion among applicants and there are variations among States in the manner in which the concurrence request is considered, the Institute is particularly interested in receiving comments regarding the benefits and drawbacks of continuing the concurrence requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Renewal Grants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are two types of renewal grants available from SJI: Continuation grants (see sections III.H., V.C. and D., and IX.A.) and on-going support grants (see sections III.I., V.C. and D., and IX.B.). Continuation grants are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to support limited duration projects that involve the same type of activities as the original project. On-going support grants may be awarded for up to a three-year period to support national-scope projects that provide the State courts with critically needed services, programs, or products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Guideline establishes a target for renewal grants of no more than $3 million, a little more than 25% of the total amount available for grants in FY 1995. See section IX. Grantees should accordingly be aware that the award of a grant to support a project does not constitute a commitment to provide either continuation funding or on-going support.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

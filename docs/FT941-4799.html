			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Taiwan sinks 3.4% as Kuala Lumpur rebounds After gaining substantial ground on active buying by domestic financial institutions in the morning session, share prices met large-lot arbitrage selling and profit-taking, leaving the market only marginally higher on the day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 index closed 86.51 up at 19,898.39 after opening at the day's low of 19,826.28 and peaking at 20,090.71 in the early afternoon on active buying of Nikkei 300 stocks by a UK brokerage. Traders said profit-taking ahead of the March book closing seemed almost at an end, while some domestic institutions were starting to buy shares. 'The supply demand situation is becoming quite positive,' said Mr Nobuhiro Kaneda, general manager of Daiwa Securities' equity division. He expects the Nikkei 225 to close the month - the end of the current business year - within the range of 19,000 and 21,000. Volume totalled 320m shares, against 343m. The Topix index rose 8.22 to 1,616.32, while the Nikkei 300 edged up 1.92 to 298.39. Advances led declines by 565 to 423, with 197 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 1.31 firmer at 1,339.98. Mounting concern over the rice shortage prompted speculative buying of foods stocks. Hopes that Japanese consumers would eat more bread supported bakery and flour milling shares, with Yamazaki Baking rising Y50 to Y2,190 and Nisshin Flour Milling gaining Y70 at Y1,290. Frozen food and processed food makers were also firm, with Ajinomoto, the leading food company, moving up Y10 to Y1,320 and Nichirei, a large frozen food maker, advancing Y12 to Y719. Banks, heavily weighted in the Nikkei 300, gained ground, with Industrial Bank of Japan adding Y30 at Y3,280 and Sanwa Bank Y20 at Y2,190. Profit-taking depressed the motor sector, which was previously higher on foreign buying. Nissan Motor, the most active issue of the day, dipped Y10 to Y874 and Toyota Motor declined Y10 to Y2,070. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 5.73 to 21,957.94 in volume of 99.2m shares. Roundup Regional markets took divergent paths. TAIWAN plunged 3.4 per cent on stop-loss selling triggered by the market's failure to rally on Monday, the first day of trade after the central bank raised the ceiling on foreign investment. The weighted index opened lower and sank for most of the session, ending 190.91 down at 5,456.68. Turnover shrank to a moderate TDollars 55.45bn from Monday's TDollars 80.75bn. The financial sector, which had surged in recent days on speculative buying by big investors, dropped 4.3 per cent, with China Development losing TDollars 7.50 at TDollars 123. KUALA LUMPUR staged a strong rebound in the afternoon to close higher, helped by gains in overseas markets and news that the British High Commission in Kuala Lumpur had denied reports that London was contemplating retaliatory action against Malaysia's trade ban. The composite index was finally 10.58 up at 1,056.30 after setting a low for the day of 1,035.62 in the morning. Petronas Dagangan made its debut, the shares rising to a high of MDollars 7.95 before closing at MDollars 6.95, compared with the MDollars 2.80 offer price. SINGAPORE recouped some losses on late bargain hunting after a slight recovery in Malaysian shares traded over the counter. The Straits Times Industrial index ended 3.56 lower at 2,240.18 but after a day's low of 2,221.96. HONG KONG finished sharply higher, aided by bargain hunting, but trading was thin as sentiment remained cautious. The Hang Seng index was finally 233.03 ahead at 10,294.58, having jumped more than 270 points in early trade after an overnight rally of Hong Kong stocks in London. AUSTRALIA strengthened as 556m shares were traded, with the All Ordinaries index fin-ishing 27.0 ahead at 2,171.7. NEW ZEALAND took its lead from Wall Street and the NZSE-40 capital index ended 30.75, or 1.4 per cent, up at 2,226.08. But turnover of NZDollars 39m was only about half the level seen earlier in the year. MANILA turned back after a firm opening as weakness in Benpres sparked other stock sell-offs. The composite index shed 17.25 to 2,637.03. Benpres lost 80 centavos at 9.70 pesos. SEOUL slipped lower, the composite index declining 10.77 to 884.85. Shares made a slight recovery on a bout of selective buying of blue chips and issues with low price-earnings ratios towards the close, after dropping more than 14 points in the early afternoon.</p>

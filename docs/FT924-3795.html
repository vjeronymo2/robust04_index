			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Letter: Who getting tough with whom? Sir, Surely there is a misprint in your headline, 'Tougher control of City urged by Treasury' (December 4). Should it not read 'Tougher control of Treasury urged by City'? Christopher Taylor-Young, Taylor Young Investment Management, 45 Curlew Street, Butlers Wharf, London SE1</p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZAP! INTO THE NINETIES;  </P> <P> STATE OF THE ART FOR FILMS;  </P> <P> THE LASER VIDEO DISC WILL DO TO HOME ENTERTAINMENT IN THE NEXT DECADE WHAT THE  VCR DID IN THE EIGHTIES  </P> <P> Ten years ago, when America was saying goodby to the decade that bred both  Watergate and the pet rock, the film and electronics industries were fresh  allies on the brink of the biggest home entertainment revolution since the  invention of television.  </P> <P> Now, as we say goodby to the decade that bred Contragate and designer water,  they are inching toward the brink again. Having spoiled us rotten with  cost-efficient VCRs, neighborhood video stores and $2 movie rentals,the  Hollywood and Tokyo-based partners are about to lead us out of the Fuzzy Age of  videotape and into the 425-lines-of-resolution, four-channel digital audio age  of the video disc.  </P> <P> In the 1980s, we got used to watching movies cheaply at home, at our  convenience, without commercial interruptions. In the 1990s, we will get used  to watching them under conditions that will almost duplicate the experience in  first-run theaters. That means we will switch to larger, higher-definition  screen TV sets and, most likely, to laser video-disc players.  </P> <P> The thousands of techologically hip who have already installed video-disc  players at home have long known the advantages of discs over tape, not only for  viewing movies but for filmed concerts, interactive lectures and for film  study, as well. Laser delivers vastly sharper images and crisper, fuller sound,  but the album-size discs can also be encoded to show both motion and still  pictures, and though the discs themselves are more expensive to manufacture and  encode than videotape cassettes, they never wear out.  </P> <P> "A lot of this I don't understand, but what I do understand is (we're building)  a knowledgeable movie audience," said former Academy of Motion Pictures Arts  and Sciences president Fay Kanin, at a recent event where film cinematographers  gathered for a demonstration of video-disc technology. "I remember the first  time I went out to a video store . . . and saw those rows of films and the  people's excitement, I really thought the millenium had come. You're now  educating a public to understand what (movies) are all about."  </P> <P> Movies -- first threatened with obsolescence by radio, then TV, then home video  -- are stronger than ever as we enter the last decade of the first electronic  century, and whatever the 1990s bring, they will likely be stronger in the year  2000. Japanese electronics giant Sony closed out the '80s with its purchase of  Columbia Pictures, and other foreign buyers -- more from the Land of the Rising  Sun, to be sure -- will follow.  </P> <P> The "Made in Japan" label that used to serve as a warning sign on tinny  5-and-dime gadgets is now a boast of excellence on robot-assembled automotive  and electronics goods. Having captured the bulk of the hardware market in the  still growing home electronics industry, the Japanese's next frontier for  expansion is here, in Hollywood, where -- despite a measurable slide in quality  control -- the "Made in the U.S.A." label still means something.  </P> <P> The colorizing of black-and-white classic movies provided one of the 1980s'  hottest technological controversies, but that aesthetic felony, along with the  equally crass mayhem done on wide-screen films to make them fit the nearly  square TV format, will be forgotten like bad wine once wide-screen,  high-resolution TV is here.  </P> <P> Sony executives, in the afterglow of their purchase of Columbia Pictures, talk  about the future they see for Sony's high-definition video technology for film  production. By shooting and editing movies on videotape then transferring the  final version to film, they say production costs can be drastically reduced.  This is true, especially with films laden with expensive special effects, but  will anybody want to see the movies?  </P> <P> In the few instances where the tape-to-film process has already been used -- in  the Kathleen Turner film "Julia and Julia," for instance -- audiences thought  they were watching a TV soap opera in a theater. Most front-rank film directors  wouldn't touch tape with a 10-foot boom pole.  </P> <P> "The Sony people are deluding themselves into thinking video will ever replace  film," said director Joe Dante ("Gremlins"), a keen follower of cutting-edge  film technology. "I can't believe that outside porno theaters, audiences will  accept that kind of quality."  </P> <P> Does that mean film and film projectors will still be the way movies are shown  in theaters 10 years from now? Possibly. The 35-millimeter,  24-frames-per-second system of filming and projection has been the standard for  about 70 years. There have been occasional technological forays into theatrical  exotica: 3-D, Cinemascope, Cinerama, 70-mm, Imax, Showscan (70-mm shot at 60  frames per second). But the real adventures ahead are, as they were in the  '80s, more likely to occur at home than in the multiplex.  </P> <P> People with large screens, video-disc players and proper surround-sound audio  systems have already glimpsed and heard the future and even with the current  limitations, it looks bright and sounds clear. Such wide-screen films as  "Lawrence of Arabia" and "The Robe" are already available on video disc in  their original full frame format. The "letterboxed" discs create a black band  above and below the film's image, a distraction that American marketing mavens  believe will cause resistance among consumers here.  </P> <P> As the Japanese gain a greater say in the software sold in the U.S., they may  be less daunted by that problem. In their country, the video-disc player and  letterboxed movies are in wider use than squared films on videotape. If the  future of home entertainment is movies (let's be optimistic and assume the  future isn't "Married . . . With Children"), it is inevitable that the coming  high-definition changeover will also bring with it a wider TV screen. After  all, the square screen only became the standard because when TV was invented,  movies were square.  </P> <P> In any case, the video-disc player is apt to become the TV accessory of choice  in the next few years, and in fact, the revolution has already begun. More than  4,000 films have been transferred to laser discs, disc players are now  competitively priced with VCRs, and in a growing number of instances, video  discs offer features that videotape engineers can only dream of.  </P> <P> Santa Monica-based Voyager Company, through its inspired Criterion Collection,  has been letterboxing wide-screen films for several years. Some of the major  studios are now doing it, as well.  </P> <P> For knowledgeable movie fans, a group whose size has multiplied with the advent  of home video, the Criterion discs are a revelation. Such classic films as  "Singin' in the Rain" and "Citizen Kane" become both perfect-presentation  movies and annotated film courses. You can watch "Singin' in the Rain" in all  its Technicolor glory with its original sound track, or you can flip a switch  on your remote control and have Ron Haver, film curator for the Los Angeles  County Museum of Art, explain how each scene was shot, who dubbed whose voices,  and how the film got made in the first place.  </P> <P> At the end of each Criterion release, you get an assortment of ancillary sights  and sounds. For "The Magnificent Ambersons," the followup to "Citizen Kane"  that was taken away from Orson Welles and re-redited by RKO, you can not only  read the original script and note the studio debauchery, but listen to Welles'  "Mercury Theatre" radio play that inspired the movie.  </P> <P> The supplementary material often includes illustrated story boards (you can see  how Alfred Hitchcock carefully blocked out the famous crop duster scene for  "North by Northwest"), still photos, trailers, star and director interviews,  and scenes that do not appear in the film, either because there wasn't room (a  Scarecrow and Dorothy number from "The Wizard of Oz," for instance) or because  there were miscues when shot (there's a painful shot of a stuntman leaping from  a trolley and landing on his rear end on a paved street for a scene in "Singin'  in the Rain").  </P> <P> While our homes are being converted from tape to disc, school rooms and lecture  halls will get theirs, too. The laser player, projecting from discs that can  hold more than 100,000 instantly retrievable still photo images, is going to  make the slide projector seem about as current as a washboard.  </P> <P> Entire museums of art can be put on one disc, indexed and selectively projected  onto screens. Encyclopaedia Brittanica has transferred more than 100 of its  educational films to disc and other publishers are moving quickly to create a  software inventory for the hardware explosion that, with the sudden drop in  prices, seems inevitable.  </P> <P> Until this year, the cost of quality laser video-disc players has remained high  compared to VCRs. Now, players equipped with digital stereo sound and capable  of playing both standard and extended play discs are priced under $500. Since  the same machines also play all sizes of compact disc recordings, it is cheaper  to upgrade a home entertainment system with a combination laser video and  compact-disc player than to buy a compact-disc player and VCR. For about $250  more, you can add equipment that will make your player interactive, meaning  that you can buy the indexed three-disc set of "The Louvre," and with a push of  a button, call up any of the 6,000 pieces of art transferred from the famed  Paris museum.  </P> <P> According to industry sources, there are between 500,000 and one million  video-disc players in U.S. households, a fraction of the estimated 60 million  VCRs in use. The number of films available on disc has lagged way behind those  on tape, but the presses are busy now. Almost all new films are transferred to  disc and many of the classic films are getting the kind of specialized  treatment -- the letterboxing, narration and supplemental material -- for which  Voyager's Criterion has become known.  </P> <P> The prices of discs are coming down, too. Movies on discs sell for from $25 to  $40 (Criterion's extended treatment discs go for as much as $125) and in major  markets like Los Angeles and New York, are readily available for daily rental  at rates comparable to those charged for tapes.  </P> <P> It is ironic that most of the technology for video-disc players has been around  almost as long as the VCR. Video-disc players were being demonstrated at  consumer electronics shows in the late '70s, in the next booth over from tape  demos. The images and sounds were better even then, but eccentricities in both  the market and some of the equipment combined to give video a 10-year public  relations setback.  </P> <P> The most heavily marketed early disc player was RCA's Selectivision, a machine  that used a needle and turntable to mimic conventional record players. Besides  the video confusion this caused whenever the family dog leaned against the  stereo cabinet and attempted to dislodge a flea, the discs seemed fragile and  distractingly mysterious.  </P> <P> It was also assumed that the greatest use of home video would be to record  television shows for later viewing. Few people besides those who got rich on it  foresaw the day when the sales of movies on videotape would exceed box-office  grosses for first-run movies (home video revenues passed theatrical's in the  mid-'80s).  </P> <P> Finally, most Americans were satisfied with the relatively poor quality of  their TV images, and they hadn't even thought of how much better movies would  sound if the tracks were pumped through their amplifiers and stereo speakers  instead of being strained through the three-inch mufflers that came with their  sets.  </P> <P> The remaining drawback to the laser player is its inability to record broadcast  and cable signals. But even that objection can be over-ruled. Most people who  move up to disc already have VCRs, and home entertainment systems can  accomodate both machines. Industry experts say that the need for a machine that  both records and plays will be met sometime in the '90s, either with the  introduction of recordable discs (the technology exists, but the price is now  prohibitive) or with a laser player that includes an 8-millimeter videocassette  component.  </P> <P> In any event, the logical next step for millions of consumers who have gone  from being captives of network schedules to having discretionary choice over  thousands of home entertainment options is to enhance the quality of their  experience.  </P> <P>  Steven Smith and Nina J.

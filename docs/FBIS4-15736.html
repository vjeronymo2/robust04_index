			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Lyudmila Aleksandrova, Nikita </F> Yermakov, Yuriy Sizov, and Vladimir Shekhovtsov]    [Text] Madrid, 11 April -- Today Russian President Boris  Yeltsin expressed satisfaction that "Spain will figure strongly  in Russian foreign policy." He spoke at an official dinner  given in his honor by the Spanish King Juan Carlos I, in the  Palacio de Oriente.    According to the Russian leader, the present visit "will  become a turning point in the history of relations between the  two countries." Prospects for the stable development of  Russian-Spanish cooperation, which is a long-term one and is not  affected by political considerations, are becoming clearer.    Boris Yeltsin noted that a treaty on friendship and  cooperation between Russia and Spain, which will be signed in  Madrid on 12 April, will become the legal basis for this new  stage in bilateral cooperation. This fundamental document "will  open wide horizons for interaction between our countries in  various spheres."    For a long time the peoples of Russia and Spain were forced  to live under systems of dictatorial state power that were  hostile to each other. Numerous obstacles and bans were put on  the path toward mutual rapprochement. "The Treaty on Friendship  and Cooperation is the result of the triumph of democracy both  in Russia and Spain," the president said.    In his opinion, the unique experience that allowed Spain to  be transformed into a stable, law-based, democratic state with a  developed economy is very valuable for Russia. Now Spain is  integrated into the European system. It plays a noticeable role  in the European processes and occupies a worthy place in the  world community.    He welcomed the involvement and active role of Madrid in  international affairs and expressed readiness to join efforts in  order to "jointly take part in tackling difficult international  problems."    Boris Yeltsin stressed that the new Russia is becoming a  full-fledged member of the community of democratic states. "We  want," he continued, "this process to meet our national  interests and the goals of building a new order based on mature  strategic partnership to a greater degree."    Having noted the difficulty of Russia's integration into  world economic relations, the president stressed that this  process will require "mutual adaptation -- a political,  economic, and psychological one. We count on the fact that  leaders in the West have the political courage to do what is  necessary to resolve this."    A mutually beneficial dialogue between the leadership of  Russia and Spain on most topical issues of modern times has  become traditional, the head of the Russian state said. He  expressed confidence that the establishment of a direct line of  communications between the Kremlin and the Moncloa Palace -- an  agreement on which was signed today by the foreign ministers of  the two countries -- will allow it to be given a greater sense  of urgency and regularity. "We will be able to cooperate more  closely and constructively in the sphere of international  relations, both in building a peaceful, unified, democratic  Europe and in establishing a new world order."    Boris Yeltsin reported that a grand monument to Columbus,  "which will be soon erected in Seville according to a design by  our sculptor Tsereteliy," will be a sign that Russia recognizes  Spain's eternal contribution toward the formation of a modern  civilization.</p>

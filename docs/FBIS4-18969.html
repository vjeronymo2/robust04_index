			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou held a scheduled  meeting with the Yugoslav ambassador this evening. Our  correspondent Foivos Karzis has the following report:    [Begin Karzis recording] Good evening from our studios on  Mourouzis Street. The prime minister's meeting with Ambassador  of New Yugoslavia [as heard] Milan Milutinovic, which lasted  approximately 25 minutes, ended few minutes ago in the Maximos  Palace. Mr. Milutinovic was extremely sparing in his statement  immediately after the meeting. He said that he had discussed  the latest developments with the prime minister and that he had  submitted a message from the Yugoslav Government but he did not  want to disclose its details.    Mr. Milutinovic also did not want to comment on how the  Serbs  would react to the bombings from the NATO aircraft in the past  few days.    Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic will arrive in Athens  on Wednesday [13 April] and it is not ruled out that Vladislav  Jovanovic, the foreign minister of new Yugoslavia, will also  visit the Greek capital on Friday.    We should also note that a short time ago National Defense  Minister Yerasimos Arsenis said in the most categorical manner  that no Greek crews would take part in the NATO operations in  New Yugoslavia.    Of course, there is concern in Athens over the latest  developments on the Bosnian front. The government is following  these developments closely, as all the parties favor a peaceful  settlement of the crisis. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Haikou, April 13 (XINHUA) -- Construction of a  "state-farm" town was started in Haikou City, capital of Hainan  Province, recently.    Designed by architects from Qinghua University, the town is  expected to occupy 150 hectares with a building area of 2.6  million square meters.    The town will include six main buildings and two sections:  buildings for offices and conferences, trade, services,  telecommunications and financial business as well as cultural,  scientific and technological, and recreational facilities; and a  residential section with gardens and a modern villa division.    With a total investment of 10 billion yuan, the project is  expected to be completed in eight or ten years.    In the town, there is plenty of room for parking, and every  household will have a parking space for cars.    The state farm sector in Hainan Province has more than 100  medium-sized enterprises with more than one million people.    In the past few years, the sector has made great  contributions to the opening up of Hainan Island.    Experts said the construction of the town is aimed at  promoting the secondary and tertiary industries and will provide  an opportunity for the sector to remold its development pattern.</p>

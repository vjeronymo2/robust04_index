			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Kishinev 15 April, TASS -- Official Kishinev  [Chisinau] expressed a protest against negative reaction of the  Romanian political circles to the decision of Moldavia [Moldova]  to join the Commonwealth of Independent States.    "Everyone should understand that Moldova is an independent  state and can take any decision," Moldavian President Mircea  Snegur stated in this connection.    Some Romanian law-makers called on their colleagues to  condemn "the inclusion of the traditional Romanian lands into  the new Soviet empire," according to the Kishinev radio.    Dumitru Motspan, deputy chairman of the Moldavian parliament  and also the leader of the ruling Agrarian and Democratic Party,  called Romania's reaction insulting. The recent poll and  parliamentary elections showed that overwhelming majority of the  population stood against unification with Romania and for  independence, he told ITAR- TASS.    "We will conclude profitable economic and other agreements  with all countries of the world, join international unions and  do not intend to ask anyone's permission for that," Motspan  stressed.    "The inclusion of Moldavia into CIS and the economic union  would allow it to establish civilized mutual relations with CIS  countries, to restore old and create new mutually beneficial  economic links," he added.</p>

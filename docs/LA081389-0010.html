			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIVE SUMMER STORIES  </P> <P> Kudos to you for devoting an entire issue to new California prose. The mix was  excellent. The magazine should now give equal time to the poetry of our region.  Certainly this would include more of author Kate Braverman ("Falling in  October"), but let us have a summer reader representing the best of eclectic  Los Angeles to round out the sampling of the major new voices of Californian  writers.  </P> <P> CARA MICHAELSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

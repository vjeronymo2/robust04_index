			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: March rethink as losses accelerate: Abortive venture into financial services results in extraordinary cost MARCH GROUP, the USM-quoted racing cars and engineering company, has skidded into a Pounds 3.2m loss after extraordinaries for the year to end-October, with an abortive venture into financial services and a Pounds 2.6m legal action against Alfa Romeo to be found among the debris. The comparable result was a profit of Pounds 970,000. Mr John Cowen, chairman, pinned the main blame for the reversal on developments at Cobbold Roach, the Southampton-based stockbroker bought for Pounds 3.1m in April last year from Elders IXL. The purchase was intended to form part of a diversification drive aimed at reducing March's exposure to the volatile world of motor racing. Cobbold's affairs in the period leading up to February this year are now the subject of investigations by the The Securities Association and the Fraud Squad. They are looking into the apparent misappropriation of Pounds 200,000 of clients' funds as well as money missing from March itself. Mr James Stewart, Cobbold's managing director, resigned in February. Even before the misappropriations issue arose, Cobbold Roach had run up trading losses of Pounds 1.3m during March's 10 months of ownership. Of the Pounds 1.85m extraordinary charge Pounds 1.57m related to a provision for the withdrawal from financial services. There was a Pounds 1.26m extraordinary credit last time from the sale and reorganisation of the motor racing businesses, notably the disposal of its grand prix operations to Mr Akira Akagi's Leyton House organisation. By last October Cobbold was losing money at an annual rate of Pounds 1m. March's advisers said it would be possible to sell Cobbold at a price to cover most of the investment. By December terms had been agreed with an unnamed buyer. On the evening of January 24, the scheduled date for the completion of the sale a Cobbold director expressed concern about a number of client accounts. By just before midnight, with Cobbold's accounts rushed up from Southampton, Mr Cowen had talked to all Cobbold directors. At 12.30 the prospective buyer was warned that irregularities discovered meant the deal would almost certainly be off. A month later, the shell of the business and some of its assets were sold for Pounds 200,000 to Neilson Milnes, a Liverpool-based stockbroker. The cost of closing what is left of Cobbold are put at Pounds 826,000, including reimbursing private clients. The total Pounds 2.1m loss from the venture was described as a bitter pill by Mr Cowen, the former United Technologies chairman, who since mid-1988 has been steering March away from what then appeared to be a certain collision course with receivership. March is also claiming Pounds 2.6m from Alfa Romeo. The sum represents the value of a two-year contract for March to develop and supply Alfa Romeo-engined racing cars for America's most prestigious motor racing series, the Indy car championship. The contract covered 1990 and this year. However, March-Alfa Romeos contested only three races before Patrick Racing, which operates the team for Alfa, announced it was switching to cars built by Lola, March's chief rival. March is claiming substantial damages from Alfa, alleging breach of contract, and has filed suits alleging defamation, conspiracy and intentional interference with a third part contract against Patrick Racing. The contract dispute is scheduled to be settled by arbitration in Geneva in February next year. Following talks with the company's lawyers on prospects of winning the case, March's board had decided to make no provisions for the debt in the latest accounts, said Mr Cowen. He added that the company would be returning to its engineering and motor racing roots, but was not forsaking the acquisition trail. March has shareholders funds of Pounds 6.2m, he pointed out, with an unutilised bank facility of Pounds 600,000. 'As of this moment we're not geared.' In the year under review turnover fell to Pounds 14.36m (Pounds 17.44m) and the pre-tax loss was Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 420,000). The loss per share came out at 5.4p (1.7p).</p>

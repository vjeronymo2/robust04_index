			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia): Nikkei dips 1% as Hong Kong rallies Arbitrage unwinding and profit-taking by overseas investors depressed share prices, and the Nikkei closed down 1 per cent after posting a small gain in the morning session, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 index fell 208.14 to 20,137.23 after a high of 20,333.27 and a low of 20,103.92. Traders were discouraged that the index broke a June low of 20,168, a support level. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 6.96 to 1,615.82 while the Nikkei 300 lost declined 1.15 to 292.81. Losers led gainers by 748 to 261, with 158 issues remaining unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 0.47 to 1,302.57. Volume totalled 280m shares against 251m. Foreign investors continued to take profits but traders said the selling was in small lots, and the low volume exaggerated the index's decline. Buying by public funds supported share prices at lower levels. High-technology blue chips continued to be sold as investors reduced their exposure to high-export oriented sectors which are seeing their profit margins squeezed by the yen's strength. Hitachi, the most active issue of the day, fell Y16 to Y959 while Toshiba lost Y13 to Y722. Nissan Motor, which declined earlier in the week on selling by overseas investors, rebounded Y8 to Y753, but Honda Motor lost Y10 to Y1,680. Brokers, which are expected to be hit by the recent slump in share prices and stock market volumes, lost ground. Nomura Securities declined Y10 to Y2,220 and Nikko Securities fell Y40 to Y1,210. Tuesday's merger announcement between Toyo Sanso and Taiyo Sanso, two industrial gas and oxygen makers, depressed Toyo, which ended with an offered price of Y580, down Y80 from its previous close. Chiyoda Shigyo, an industrial paper maker which will be absorbed by San-Mic Trading, an unlisted paper company, also failed to trade, and ended at an offered price of Y406, down by a maximum daily fall of Y100. Speculative buying supported Misawa Resort, which gained Y150 to Y638. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 151.46 to 22,495.40 in volume of 27.5m shares. Aoyama Trading, the men's suit retailer, fell Y250 to Y4,090 on profit-taking. Roundup The Pacific Rim had an active day with markets moving in opposite directions. HONG KONG rose strongly on buying related to index futures and options and the Hang Seng index jumped 207.82 or 2.3 per cent to 9,402.18 in turnover that improved to HKDollars 4.36bn from HKDollars 2.46bn on Tuesday. The positive government land sale results, which failed to inspire investors on Tuesday, boosted the market as both institutional and local investors became active buyers. Brokers attributed a strong performance in the banking sector to the 38.3 per cent jump on interim income reported by HSBC Holdings' Marine Midland subsidiary. HSBC put on HKDollars 2.00 to HKDollars 91.75 and Hang Seng Bank rose HKDollars 1.00 to HKDollars 54.75. The properties sector was the biggest gainer with the sub index rising about 3.4 per cent. SHANGHAI's A share index plunged 5 per cent as investors cashed in shares when it became clear that the rally of the previous two days was not sustainable. The index lost 19.30 to 370.13 in heavy turnover of Yn849m. In Shenzhen, A shares were hit even harder with the index plummeting 6.3 or 5.8 per cent, to 100.87. The Shanghai A index had gained about 7 per cent since Monday, recovering much of the ground lost last week. But selling set in as soon as the market opened yesterday. TAIPEI was dragged back from Tuesday's four year high by waves of profit-taking, and brokers forecast that the consolidation was likely to continue in the near term. The weighted index lost 65.88 or 1 per cent to 6,66.34 in turnover that fell to TDollars 90.54bn. Some buying was in selected industrials, with the most active issue, China Petrochemical, up 50 cents to TDollars 37.4, but sentiment was cautious as the market had been overbought in previous days, brokers said. MANILA rose 2 per cent on the back of heavy foreign buying of blue chips and selected second-liners which are expected to post good second quarter profits. The composite index soared 56.07 to 2,784.60 in volume that picked up to 989.93m shares. KUALA LUMPUR was pulled 1.2 per cent higher for the fourth consecutive day by institutional demand for blue chips, although late profit-taking flattened out earlier gains for the broader market. The composite index ended up 11.88 at 1,020.19. Telekom Malaysia firmed 40 cents to MDollars 19.30 in response to its 24 per cent jump in half-year net earning. BANGKOK was higher in active trade fuelled by institutional buying of the communications, finance and banking sectors. The SET index rallied 21.14 or 1.6 per cent, to 1,367.64, slightly off the day's high of 1,368.20. Turnover was a heavy Bt10.76bn. Krung Thai Bank gained Bt2 to Bt66 and Prime Finance put on Bt6 to Bt173. SEOUL edged lower in quiet conditions with the news that the central bank would require investment trust companies to repay their 850bn won of outstanding loans by August 12 dampening sentiment towards the close, brokers said. The composite index closed 0.98 lower at 934.22. SYDNEY took the release of low inflation data in its stride, closing slightly firmer after lingering in a tight six-point trading range. The All Ordinaries index finished 0.4 ahead at 2,041.7.</p>

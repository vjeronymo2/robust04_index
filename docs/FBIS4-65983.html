			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Responding to daily criticism by Bernard-Henri  Levy and his gang, President Francois Mitterrand is standing  firm on his Bosnia policy. [passage omitted] The president has  taken his arguments further in a long and fascinating interview  given to the weekly NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR. Jerome d'Orville has  the details:    [d'Orville] Mitterrand has given his firm support to the  government against [Socialist Party leader] Michel Rocard and  against Bernard-Henri Levy and his intellectuals. To deny the  role and the usefulness of the United Nations, he says, would be  -- under the cover of an apparently pacifist stance -- the  surest way of prolonging the war. Sarajevo is breathing, and so  is Gorazde; thanks to whom? the president asks. Francois  Mitterrand is categorical: condemning negotiation is equivalent  to opting for war. Today, we can glimpse the chance of a  peaceful solution, and we have to seize hold of the opportunity,  he declares.    The president does not have very positive things to say  about  the situation in Italy either. He describes the circumstances  in which Silvio Berlusconi came to power as dubious. It is an  approach to democracy to which we are not accustomed, he says,  and which seems dangerous. The time has come to say: beware --  danger, Mr. Mitterrand asserts, condemning the pressure put on  public opinion by the vast information networks controlled by  Mr. Berlusconi.    Asked about Algeria, the president says that France should  welcome those people whose lives are in danger because they have  chosen progress.    Finally, the president speaks of the achievements of the  Left  in government, achievements of which he is proud, even though  Socialist governments have not done enough for equality of  opportunity. Francois Mitterrand reminds readers that the Left  has traditionally been a minority in France because conservative  forces still control the main information networks and the major  financial centers, and because the administration is permeated  with their ideology.</p>

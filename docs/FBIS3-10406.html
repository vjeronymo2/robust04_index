			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 5 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Colombian  Mines Minister Guido Nule denied today any agreement had been  signed with Cuba on oil matters, but he said the terms to  formalize "a possible commercial agreement for the sale of  crude" are being studied.    The government of President Cesar Gaviria announced last  week  it would supply Cuba with approximately 20,000 barrels of oil  daily under normal trade conditions and at international market  prices.    The Colombian decision has caused uneasiness among the  Miami-based Cuban community, which has agreed to stage protest  marches in Florida and block products from that South American  country that are sold in U.S. stores.    In a preliminary reaction, approximately 30 anti-Castro  exiles demonstrated in front of the Colombian Consulate in Miami  yesterday to voice their disconformity with the aid Gaviria's  administration is giving to Fidel Castro's government.    Colombia cannot subject or condition its international trade  policy to public demonstrations, Nule stated at a news  conference this afternoon, referring to the protests initiated  yesterday by Cuban exiles in Miami.    "I do not think Colombia can subject or condition its policy  to public demonstrations," the minister said, insisting Cuban  exiles have "a high sensitivity, and one must understand it."    Nule said any operation carried out with Havana "will be  carried out within the strict practices of international trade."    "There is no agreement at this time, and we are only  studying  the terms of a possible agreement, such as payment guarantees,  volume, and quality," he explained.    Cuba is an important market, and Colombia cannot see any  reason why it cannot sell fuel to the Caribbean island,  according to the minister.</p>

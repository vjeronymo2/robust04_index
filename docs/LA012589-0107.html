			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TO FORMER DODGER HOLTON, ORIOLES ARE LOOKING GREAT  </P> <P> Almost two months after he learned his World Series ring would be arriving by  courier instead of by handshake, Brian Holton formally was welcomed to his new  team this week.  </P> <P> On the December day he was sent to the Baltimore Orioles in a trade that made  first baseman Eddie Murray a member of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Holton's wife,  Wendy, spent the morning looking at homes in some nice Southern California  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> After almost nine seasons in the minors and surgery to piece his right elbow  back together in 1983, Holton figured two straight splendid seasons in the  Dodgers' bullpen had earned him that much security.  </P> <P> It had not, and this week while he toured Memorial Stadium, met some of his new  teammates and spoke of being one of the building blocks for the reconstruction  of the Orioles, Wendy Holton was house hunting again -- in Baltimore.  </P> <P> "You learn to adjust," he said, smiling. "I'm excited about being here. I had a  good time in Los Angeles. When I left, I'd earned a World Series ring, and I'd  like to have another one."  </P> <P> Holton spoke in the stadium's executive boardroom where he shared a media  conference with first baseman Randy Milligan, whose career, like Holton's, has  taken some unexpected turns.  </P> <P> Holton spent the last year establishing himself as a first-rate major-leaguer  -- a 7-3 record with a 1.70 earned run average -- but Milligan has been traded  twice and now has a chance at a second new beginning.  </P> <P> Few people would have predicted that 12 months ago, after Baseball America  named Milligan its "minor-leaguer of the year." He'd just finished a tremendous  season at Class AAA Tidewater, hitting .326 with 29 home runs and 103 RBI and  missing an International League triple batting crown by an eyelash.  </P> <P> But in the New York Mets organization, he found himself on an assembly line of  major-league talent. From the moment his 1987 season ended, the Mets told him  he'd probably be headed back to Tidewater because Keith Hernandez didn't look  close to retirement.  </P> <P> "They told me that, then I had some contract problems," Milligan said. "With  all my good seasons with the Mets, I felt they could have done a little more  for me. I was in no shape to play baseball."  </P> <P> He got a break late in spring training when the Mets sent him to Pittsburgh for  catcher Mackey Sasser, a deal that appeared to have opened one last door for  Milligan. It did not. He finished with just 82 at-bats -- .220, three homers,  eight RBI -- and spent about half the season at AAA Buffalo. After it was over,  he was traded to the Orioles for a middling minor leaguer.  </P> <P> "(The Pirates) called it platooning," Milligan said, "but what it was is that  I'd play against some of the left-handed pitchers (with Sid Bream playing  against the righties). There are not many left-handed starters in the National  League, and I ended up sitting all the time. I don't feel 82 at-bats makes you  a big-league player. . . . You've got to be in there to learn the ropes and  learn the pitchers. I still have no doubt I can make it."  </P> <P> He'll have the chance now because as the Orioles look for Murray's replacement,  they've pretty much thrown the door open to Jim Traber, Milligan and perhaps  others. Milligan, 27, says a chance is all he can ask.  </P> <P> "I think it's a great opportunity," he said. "It seems like when you go to a  team that's a winner, you don't get a chance. Hopefully, I'll get the chance  here. They need right-handed power, and that's me. . . . I don't see myself not  winning the job."  </P> <P> Holton's situation is less radical. At 29, he has proven himself, having been  an important part of a bullpen that led the National League in wins, saves and  ERA in 1988. He had the Dodgers' lowest ERA and a winning percentage second  only to NL Cy Young winner Orel Hershiser's.  </P> <P> His ERA was the second-lowest in the majors among pitchers with 75 or more  innings (Cincinnati's John Franco was 1.57). He allow no runs after Aug. 14,  and one run in six postseason innings.  </P> <P> What the Orioles can offer him that the Dodgers couldn't is a chance to start.  The Orioles go to spring training in three weeks with rookies Pete Harnisch and  Bob Milacki penciled in for two of the five starting spots. The other three are  open, and Holton is a good bet.  </P> <P> "I'm excited about that," Holton said. "My number one goal is try to win a job  in the rotation. I'd been a starter my whole career (entirely in the Dodgers  system) before I got to the Dodgers, and I feel my role is to be a starter."  </P> <P> He said it was a huge adjustment going from best team to worst, but added, "I  found out what it takes to win. You've got to set a goal that's within reach,  then go for it. I was surprised to be traded, but after it happened, I was  happy. This is a good opportunity for me."  </P> <P>  -- Orioles Notes: Prospects Jose Mesa and Leo Gomez agreed to 1989 contracts.  Right-hander Mesa, 22, was 0-3 with an 8.62 ERA last year at Class AAA  Rochester; he had a bone spur removed from his elbow July 29. Third baseman  Gomez, 21, went out with a stress fracture in his right leg April 29; he had  hit .325 in the organization over the last three years.  </P></p>

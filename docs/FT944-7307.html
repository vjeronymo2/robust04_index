			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Cost cuts 'may hit standards in the civil service' MPs yesterday called for a code of conduct for public officials - and warned that traditional civil service standards 'should not be relaxed in order to secure economy and efficiency'. The Treasury and civil service committee drew up its report amid fears that recent reforms of Whitehall's operations have undermined integrity and impartiality. The report says reforms have 'reinforced the need for greater vigilance about standards throughout the civil service'. At the heart of the committee's recommendations - agreed unanimously by the committee - is a proposed civil service code, establishing basic rules of behaviour for the nation's 500,000 public servants. Following confusion over responsibilities of ministers and officials in the arms-for-Iraq scandal, it recommends the creation of a Civil Service Commission to hear complaints where a Whitehall official feels a breach of procedures has taken place. The report also lays down some principles of conduct for ministers. The committee stresses the importance of the principle that any minister found to have knowingly misled parliament must resign. 'The knowledge that ministers and civil servants may evade questions and put the best gloss on the facts but not lie or knowingly mislead the House is one of the most powerful tools members (of parliament) have in holding the executive to account,' the report says. Reporting on the creation of Next Steps agencies - which carry out executive functions on behalf of government departments - the committee warns that standards will be threatened unless the government introduces legislation setting out rules of conduct for ministers and officials. The report says that if Next Steps status comes to be seen as 'a staging post to the private sector' the value of executive agencies will be considerably reduced. The committee also has harsh words for the government's market-testing initiative, saying it has 'not been conducted effectively by the government' and has not won the broad support of civil servants. The MPs express their astonishment at the small number of in-house bids permitted under the government's competing for quality programme in 1992-93. The Role of the Civil Service. HMSO.

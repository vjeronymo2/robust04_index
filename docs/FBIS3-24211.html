			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pavel Kandel: "Russian Policy in the Bosnian </F> Mirror"]    [Text] Russia's actions in the recent crisis around  Sarajevo can be relegated to a number of rare successes from the  standpoint of diplomatic skill. There was, it is true, a certain  confusion in the beginning. Indications of this are the  diplomatic illness that the president "endured on his feet" and  the statements of various officials that contradicted each  other, which has already become traditional. But at the  culminating moment the situation was assessed accurately, the  weakness and ambiguity in the positions of the other players  were fully exploited, and the thrust that was created by NATO's  ultimatum was used to support its own line, which also led to  the triumph of Russian diplomacy.    There is boasting in Moscow about Russia's independent role.  The obvious irritation in Western capitals with Russian  "license" is competing with secret satisfaction over the outcome  of the Sarajevo crisis. Meanwhile, success became possible only  because all the players, although hardly by agreement, played  their role in the general game. Using KGB terminology, the West  played the role of "malicious investigator," after which came  Russia's turn, to whom it fell, in the person of the "good  investigator," to reap the fruit.    Russia and the Western powers objectively mutually  complemented each other in their actions, but differed sharply  in their substantiation. The price of such rhetoric, it would  seem, is not high. But it always addressees itself to those  social forces that have a predominant influence on foreign  policy and, therefore, it is not indifferent to the real driving  motives of the parties. Russia explained its resistance to  NATO's ultimatum in a different way: The impermissibility of  attempts to bypass it, the unacceptability of imposing the model  of settlement, and the danger of any decision other than a  continuation of negotiations. But objectively this denoted an  attempt to lessen international pressure on the Serbian side,  which was the most powerful and most successful in seizures, and  which would also reinforce its position behind the negotiating.  And while at the beginning of the Bosnian conflict Russian  foreign policy tried, albeit inconsistently, to be impartial, as  it developed it began to regard "Orthodox co-religionists" and  "Slavic brothers" with greater and greater favor. This  corresponded fully to the biased leniency of the European states  toward Croatia, and of the United States toward the Bosnian  Muslims.    However, the important interests of the Western states are  not affected here, and only the Bosnian gap in European law and  order stains their reputation. It is hardly possible to ascribe  to genuine Russian foreign policy interests an inclination to  assist the Belgrade regime in a partition of the former SFRY in  accordance with the ideals of a Greater Serbia. Bosnian rural  areas are hardly the most effective scene for demonstrating  greatness. The space, where the collapsed Yugoslav dinar,  contrary to an anti-German mood, is being squeezed out by the  German mark, which Russia will be unable to counter with  anything for a long time, is outside the radius of influence of  the Russian economy. In precisely the same way a military  advanced post, separated from it by the territories of Ukraine,  Moldova, and Romania, is not very suitable for the defense of  Russia, if the counterproductive task of having a permanent  irritant on NATO's southern flank is not set. There is also no  promise of foreign policy dividends in an alliance with an  international social outcast that contrived to squander the  enormous foreign policy capital of the former SFRY.    Of course, it can be assumed that Russia's readiness to  support "a Serbian cause" to the last Serbian soldier is  explained by sober political realism. After all, Serbia, as has  happened more than once, will remain an "historical ally" of  Russia only while the war lasts and the international isolation  continues. It is then in Russia's interests to support this  status as long as possible. The task is the more gratifying in  that it does not require any sacrifices by Russia, except for  damage to its international prestige. But access to the matches  for the powder keg of Europe is a considerable temptation. The  intent is sufficiently cynical to appear politically authentic.  Of course, in this case also, the question of the cost of such a  temporary "historical alliance" remains.    The reality, however, is more transparent. Russian foreign  policy is more and more becoming a direct derivative of the  arrangement of internal political forces, taking on a dangerous  independence from the strictly foreign policy interests and  objectives of the country. The most authoritarian ruler is  incapable for long of refuting through his behavior the  well-known formula of foreign policy being a continuation of  domestic policy. The exerted striving for foreign policy  self-affirmation is greater the weaker the domestic stability of  the existing regime, the narrower its social base and political  support, and the more dismal its socioeconomic situation. It is  not just a question of complaisance to the pressure of the  national-communist opposition that prevails in parliament and to  the intrigues of the lobbyist groups, from the pro-Serb to the  Karabakh and Abkhaz groups, which need an example and an  international-legal precedent to legalize their own claims. It  is not only a matter of the efforts of the president's "court"  to forestall the opposition by intercepting some of their  slogans and the votes of the electorate. For the country as a  whole, which is obsessed with a complex of greatness but which  is deprived of many of its status symbols and a material basis,  there is an inevitable striving to assert an independent role in  the international arena.    The time has also come for a sobering up of Russian foreign  policy from "romantic Westernism," and just as naturally for a  departure from "market romanticism." The policy is even more  pertinent in that such romanticism is principally foreign to the  West itself. Fraternizing with windmills is just as absurd as  fighting them. Perhaps it is for this reason that all the  factions of the State Duma voted for a resolution that denounces  NATO's ultimatum. However, the age-old misfortune of the Russian  character--dislike for the middle ground--turns into a tragic  shortfall in the policy of the centrist social and political  forces. Therefore, there is a very great risk that "market  romanticism," given the most insignificant changes in the  composition of the leading personalities, will be replaced by an  antimarket romance, and that illusory Westernism will turn into  great power illusions. The magical transformation of Kozyrev's  Stockholm parody into a Russian foreign policy program is a  dangerous symptom of precisely such an evolution. It is entirely  superfluous to talk about the foreign policy constructions of  the national-communist opposition.    The Sarajevo crisis revealed latent maturing processes of  changes in Russian foreign policy. This may become the guarantee  of more businesslike relations of Russia with Western  states--proof of the fact that not only is the West necessary to  Russia, but that Russia is also necessary to the West. The  Sarajevo crisis can also turn out to be the start of a new  opposition. But while Russia cannot escape a serious discussion  with the Western partners, for example, as a result of their  attempts to counteract the voluntary reintegration of the  post-Soviet space, to quarrel regarding Bosnia is pure  childishness. But the president and his circle are hardly ready  to be at loggerheads with the State Duma over this. It is  because what is happening there in fact makes no difference to  one or the other. After all, Russian foreign policy, to Russian  politicians of various colors, is only a place for settling  domestic political scores.</p>

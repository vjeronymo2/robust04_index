			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Voting in southern Lebanon VOTING opened in southern Lebanon yesterday in the third and final round of its general election, despite a Christian boycott, Reuter reports from Sidon. Over 500,000 voters are eligible to choose from among 131 candidates competing for 23 seats in the new 128-seat national assembly. The Syrian-backed government tightened security yesterday, with thousands of troops guarding towns and villages. Christians say the polls are a ploy by Syria to tighten its grip on Lebanon. They want the elections held after Syrian troops withdraw from Beirut and nearby areas.</p>

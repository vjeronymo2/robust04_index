			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / New consortium may bid for ITN THAMES TELEVISION is con-sidering promoting an alternative consortium to bid for, or refinance, Independent Television News. The news was given to ITN shareholders before yesterday's board meeting, the first to consider the offer for the news organisation made last week by a consortium of four companies including Carlton Communications. The ITN board meeting yesterday agreed a five-year deal to supply a news service to ITV at an average of Pounds 53m a year. The agreement now has to be ratified by the ITV companies. The board also agreed to set up a sub-committee to investigate further the approach by the consortium and alternative proposals. A further board meeting will be held on Thursday October 29. Last week Carlton, Central, London Weekend and Reuters promised to buy the 400,000 ITN shares for Pounds 1 each and inject up to Pounds 30m to cover a property deficit on ITN's London headquarters. Ratification of the five-year news supply agreement was set as a condition of the deal. The letter from Thames, the largest ITN shareholder, said that the ITV companies which at present own ITN should be aware that Thames 'is considering promoting an alternative or revised proposal for the future ownership and/or refinancing of ITN'. The letter - which was signed by Ms Linda Coe, company secretary - did not go into any specifics or give any numbers. Mr Richard Dunn, chief executive of Thames, is the chairman of ITN. The Carlton offer, being organised by Hambros Bank, expires on November 4.</p>

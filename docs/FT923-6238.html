			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Selling programmes hit share prices FURTHER turmoil in curren-cies, fuelled by conflicting Maastricht opinion polls in France, prompted increased selling pressure in UK equities yesterday. Share prices were hit by a series of trading programmes, including one very large programme heavily weighted to the sell side and operated by a leading UK investment bank. A final blow came when a US brokerage sold the Footsie futures contract heavily. The FT-SE Index plunged by more than 50 points to the day's low of 2,260.6 as sterling fell within  1/2 pfennig of its permitted ERM floor. However, the market rallied as the trading day drew to a close without any sign of the full-point rise in UK base rates now widely feared on the London stock market. The index was finally 30.1 down at 2,281, the lowest closing level since February 1991 - although it traded as low as 2,294 only a month ago. Traders drew little comfort from the late recovery, which reflected the shortage of stock in a market where marketmakers are keeping positions as tight as possible. Several dealers said the market's loss would have been greater had it been possible to sell stock in the size offered by some institutions. Dealers at the marketmaking firms are sticking rigidly to the bargain sizes shown on the Seaq screens and brokers found great difficulty in offloading larger deals. Nevertheless, Seaq volume jumped to 537.7m shares from the 382m of the previous session. Monday's Seaq total brought retail business worth a mere Pounds 666.6m but yesterday's retail total is expected to be higher. Equities opened lower against a background of continued worry over sterling and weak performances from share prices in Tokyo and New York. But London steadied at first, to show a fall of under seven points on the Footsie, in spite of a heavy fall in Grand Metropolitan following a boardroom statement. Share prices fell steeply just before lunch when the heavy selling programme from a London investment bank hit the trading screens. Substantial blocks of shares were sold, ranging from dollar-influenced issues to domestic building and construction shares, which are particularly sensitive to base rate worries. Losses increased as the pound crumbled in the face of a French opinion poll suggesting a 51 per cent 'no' vote against the Maastricht treaty, although it was soon followed by disclosure of a second poll indicating the same percentage for a 'yes' vote. Two more, smaller, trading programmes were identified and the trading screens reported sizeable deals in, among many others, British Steel, Glaxo, Tarmac and J. Sainsbury. The stock market finished on a gloomy note, with analysts looking nervously over their shoulders at the Footsie 2,100 mark. Some believe that even this benchmark could be challenged if the UK authorities are obliged to raise base rates by a full point in order to defend sterling in the ERM range.</p>

			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HOMEFED STOCK BUYER LOOKS AT THE LONG RUN  </P> <P> David J. Dunn, founder and general partner of Idanta Partners, describes  himself as an "occasional" contrarian who sometimes buys severely depressed  stocks with the expectation that, in the long run, they will see rosier days.  </P> <P> Dunn said Monday that Idanta's recent purchase of 7.2% of troubled HomeFed  Corp.'s outstanding shares is comparable to the La Jolla-based investment  firm's 1972 acquisition of stock in two large advertising agencies that were  then nearing record market lows. It took the badly battered agencies several  years to rebound, but Idanta eventually "made very good money on them," Dunn  said.  </P> <P> Idanta, which in recent weeks has acquired 1.6 million HomeFed shares at prices  ranging from $4.54 to $6.675 per share, has also acquired relatively small  positions in Wells Fargo and Security Pacific banks.  </P> <P> Idanta's investment in HomeFed, which was announced Friday afternoon, helped  push the San Diego thrift up $.75 to $5.875 on Monday. The stock was trading as  high as $33.25 in June, when it reported a sharp increase in bad loans.  </P> <P> Dunn said he has no assurances that HomeFed, Wells Fargo or Security Pacific  won't sink even further.  </P> <P> "I hope to be bottom-fishing now," he said. "But I learned some time ago that  you can think you're at the bottom and fall through" to a new, lower stock  price. Dunn declined to say whether Idanta will acquire additional HomeFed  shares.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't buy (real estate-related stocks) in California unless I was willing  to suffer through a continuing downturn and see some decline in values," Dunn  said. "We're not predicting that the market in real estate is going to turn up  this year or even in 1991."  </P> <P> Idanta, which has never invested heavily in banks or savings and loans, began  acquiring financial-institution stock in recent weeks because they are "really  undervalued securities," he said.  </P> <P> HomeFed "seemed to have faced up" to its problem loans by setting aside  adequate reserves during recent quarters, Dunn said. "But we have no insights  into (the S&amp;L) other than what we get from reading their reports and  commentaries in the newspaper," he added.  </P> <P> Dunn and Idanta aren't the only investors hoping to snare eventual profits by  bottom-fishing in the generally depressed financial industry.  </P> <P> Warren Buffett on Oct. 24 became Wells Fargo's largest shareholder by acquiring  5.03 million, or 9.8%, of the giant bank's outstanding shares. News of the  acquisition pushed Wells Fargo stock up $1.375 to $50.50.  </P> <P> Dunn, who cautioned that financial institutions probably are not wise choices  for investors who concentrate on short-term gains, noted that Buffett once  defined long-term as "forever."  </P> <P> Dunn said Idanta's long-term outlook in the stock market often means keeping  stocks for as long as five years before trading them. Idanta takes an even  longer view in its venture-capital investments, where the partnership maintains  holdings for as long as 20 years, Dunn said.  </P> <P> The investment firm's principal owners are the Bass family of Texas. Idanta,  with a total investment portfolio valued at $100 million, is best known for  investments in high-technology stocks such as Apple Computer, Sun Microsystems  and Intel.  </P> <P> It has also provided venture capital to a number of start-up high-tech firms,  including Pacific Communications Sciences of San Diego and Iomega of Utah.  </P> <P> Dunn on Monday repeated that Idanta views HomeFed as an investment, and that  the firm has no intention of trying to take over the S&amp;L.  </P> <P> Dunn said Idanta made the investment without alerting Robert F. Bass, one of  Idanta's investors, who heads the group that acquired Stockton-based American  Savings.  </P> <P> "I'd honestly forgotten that Bob was in American," Dunn said. A Bass  representative "called on Friday to remind me of that . . . (but) the Basses  are inactive partners, and I'd say it had been years since I'd talked to them."  </P> <P> Dunn formerly served as chairman of Prime Computer, a Natick, Mass.-based  company that Idanta had helped capitalize in 1971.  </P> <P> Idanta remained one of the computer company's largest shareholders until the  firm was sold to a New York investment firm in 1989.  </P></p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / G7 focuses more on medium term TOMORROW'S meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries should be able to focus on medium term problems facing the world economy as well as the short term outlook. For although the International Monetary Fund this week scaled down its expectations of global economic growth this year, developments over the past three months in the US, Japan and Europe have brought policies in the main industrial countries into better balance. However, US moves to cut its budget deficit, the Japanese growth package and the slow decline in German interest rates may not be beyond criticism. In discussions ahead of this week's meetings of the G7 and IMF in Washington, some of America's partners have warned that the US deficit reductions are no more than a useful beginning. Japan's partners find it difficult to estimate how far the Japanese package will boost the economy, while the US this week said it would like further cuts in German rates. The moves represent a willingness on the part of the main industrial countries to share responsibilities for strengthening the world economy. Policymakers believe they should contain downside risks to the global economy and ensure that tomorrow's G7 meeting in Washington is harmonious - in contrast to some in past years. If harmony does prevail, much of the credit will go to Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, who has pursued a policy of avoiding international economic confrontation. 'It is excellent working with Bentsen,' a German official enthused yesterday. European officials report that the US now takes the views of its G7 partners seriously. This month's agreement on measures to help Russia has also boosted confidence in the G7 as a forum for co-operation. British officials expect Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to underline the importance of pushing ahead with structural reform, including the need to remove rigidities in continental Europe's labour markets. He will also stress the importance of a liberal world trading system and the need for western industrial countries to open their markets to goods from eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.</p>

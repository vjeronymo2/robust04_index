			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, April 23 (AFP) -- Three people were injured  Saturday when a bomb exploded in an empty house in northern  Cairo believed to be used as an arms store by Islamic militants,  security officials said.    The blast, in the densely-populated al-Matariyah district,  injured three passers-by.    Police were questioning an Islamic militant in connection  with the incident.    Two Islamic militants were injured Thursday when five  explosive devices they were planning to use in attacks  accidentally blew up in a shop in the 'Ayn Shams district of  Cairo.    The blast badly damaged the front of the shop, which was  owned by one of the injured, a chemist. His cousin was also  hurt.    The outlawed Islamic group al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah has been  waging a violent two-year campaign to topple Egypt's secular  government in which more than 360 people have died.</p>

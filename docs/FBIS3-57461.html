			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 24 TASS -- The priority task of the  Ostankino TV and Radio Broadcasting Company is to develop an  economic mechanism for the company's operation under market  conditions, Grigoriy Shevelev, who was recently appointed to the  post of the company's first deputy chairman, said in an  interview with ITAR-TASS here on Monday.    Shevelev noted that state television "cannot adapt itself to  new economic conditions" up to this time, while budget financing  covers only less than 50 per cent of the company's requirements.    He is convinced that a proposal on cutting the volume of  broacasting will not yield desired results and is not the only  way of tackling the problem.    Stressing that only economic solvency can guarantee true  independence to the company, the deputy chairman suggested that  this problem be settled by introducing rent for tv programmes.    But, according to his opinion, this is highly improbable in  the near future. He supposed that a solution can be found by  turning Ostankino into a joint stock society.    In Shevelev's opinion, many organisational and creative  problems calling for urgent solutions piled up at the company  over the past few years when six chairmen changed at the  Ostankino TV station.    He claimed that the plotting of the company's economic,  organisational and creative course will be among the first moves  by the new leadership.    The leadership, together with the federal service on  television and radio broadcasting, intends to participate in  drafting a bill which will define legal guarantees for the  operation of the state-owned tv and radio company.    Much attention will be also given to the quality of  programmes. "The Ostankino Company is Russia's national asset,  and it is impossible for us `to lower the plank'," Shevelev  stressed.</p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW FALLS 52 AMID WORLDWIDE SELLOFF; PRICE OF OIL SLIPS IN U.S.  </P> <P> Investors around the world went on a selling binge today, hammering stocks  sharply lower on global markets in a computer-driven sell-off sparked by rumors  and worries over the oil-rich Middle East.  </P> <P> U.S. oil prices did a turnabout and dropped sharply following a speech by  Iraq's President Saddam Hussein that traders viewed as conciliatory and less  provocative than other statements he has made since the Aug. 2 invasion of  Kuwait.  </P> <P> Stock prices fell sharply on Wall Street in heavy trading today as investors  continued to worry about the prospect of war in the Mideast.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 52.47 to 2,603.96, according to  preliminary figures.  </P> <P> In the broader market, losing issues trampled gainers by a ratio of nearly 7-1.  Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a heavy 194.63 million shares against  129.63 million in the previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index fell 3.46 to 176.96.  </P> <P> At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index dropped 3.95 to 327.34.  </P> <P> "Everyone's just very, very nervous here," said Tony Woodruff, a managing  director at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.  </P> <P> Several times the Dow fell more than 50 points, each time triggering one of the  NYSE's "circuit breakers" designed to prevent a price free fall. The mechanism  bars stock sales connected to index-futures arbitrage until the prices of the  stocks involved rise.  </P> <P> In early afternoon trading, West Texas Intermediate crude for September  delivery was down 36 cents from Monday's close to $28.20 a barrel on the Merc  after a trading high earlier of $29.08 a barrel.  </P> <P> On the U.S. Gulf Coast cash market, prompt delivery West Texas Intermediate  dropped in the space of less than an hour from $28.95 to $28.30 a barrel around  10 a.m. PDT, 25 cents less than Monday's quote.  </P> <P> Overseas, the reaction to Hussein's speech was less clear.  </P> <P> On the European cash market, the United Arab Emirates' Dubai light -- the key  OPEC crude from the Middle East shipped mainly to the Far East -- was up 35  cents to $25.90 a barrel.  </P> <P> Britain's widely traded North Sea Brent fell 77 cents to $28.65 a barrel.  </P> <P> The securities sell-off began in Europe following unconfirmed rumors that funds  from Kuwait Investment Office in Britain had been unfrozen by authorities and  were being rapidly liquidated in markets.  </P> <P> Prices fell across the board in London, Frankfurt, Paris and Zurich as jittery  investors unloaded holdings for cash. In London, about $18.8 billion had been  wiped off the value of shares.  </P> <P> The blue-chip London Financial Times 100-stock index, which fell 20.3 points  Monday, tumbled 48.5 points today to 2,108.1.  </P> <P> The closely watched German Stock Index, which lost 30.19 points Monday, fell  87.73 points, or about 5.2%, to 1,549.96 -- its lowest close since Nov. 24,  1989.  </P> <P> Traders in Frankfurt said stocks fell as foreign investors, in particular from  Britain and the United States, sold stocks as worries over the Middle East  continued.  </P> <P> In Paris, the French General Index lost 8.89 points; in Zurich, the Credit  Suisse Stock Index fell 20.9 points; in Brussels, the broad-based Brussels  Index tumbled 236.86 points, and in Amsterdam the CBS General Share Index lost  3.7 points.  </P> <P> Earlier in Asia, stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange suffered their fourth  straight loss.  </P></p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Conjuror creates illusion of profit: Richard Waters unravels the phantom trading scheme at a US investment bank He was the model bond trader. Joseph Jett appeared to be making huge profits for the US investment bank Kidder Peabody - and he was taking hardly any risks. It wasn't as though no one was keeping an eye on him. His activities were scrutinised as recently as last September by auditors inside the company. They found nothing suspicious. The paperwork created by the large number of trades he generated was difficult to keep up with. But that appeared to be a minor administrative problem. Behind this facade of normality, the 36-year-old Jett was pulling off one of Wall Street's more unusual financial schemes, Kidder says now. It didn't involve rigging prices or insider dealing - the kind of skulduggery with which the financial markets are more commonly associated. Instead, Jett was busy creating the illusion that he was making big trading profits (see accompanying article). The deception earned him a bonus of Dollars 9m last year. To borrow from Bonfire of the Vanities, Tom Wolfe's book about a New York bond trader in the 'Roaring Eighties': Jett had turned himself into a 'Master of the Universe'. How could one trader conjure up Dollars 350m of profits over three years before the phantom scheme was discovered? And how could he do it while working for a subsidiary of General Electric, a group which prides itself on its strong management and tight controls? It may not be as difficult as it sounds. In the powerhouse of Wall Street, the biggest earners in the financial markets, the traders whose annual bonuses are the stuff of legend, are looked on with awe. They stand out among the armies of footsoldiers who populate New York's vast trading floors, the mortals who are all looking for the chance to join the big league. Contemplating Jett's rise, Jack Welch, the chairman of GE, muses: 'One of the overriding things you see here is the enormous impact of the 'star' system . . . a strong, successful personality may have more influence than they should'. Such titans of finance often deal in arcane financial instruments that few outsiders understand, and pursue esoteric strategies whose risks are difficult to predict. Wielding great influence and shrouded in mystique, it is hardly surprising if they are seldom challenged. Joseph Jett was one of the footsoldiers when he turned up for work on Kidder's bond trading floor in July 1991. At 33, his chances of making it to the big time appeared to be retreating fast. He had already spent two years as a bond trader at Morgan Stanley, and another two at First Boston, the investment banks. 'Unremarkable', is the verdict of a previous employer. Morgan Stanley dispensed with him during one of the periodic exercises most US firms undertake to weed out unproductive traders. Two years later, First Boston did the same. It wasn't that he was losing money: he just wasn't making enough. This lacklustre background may have fed Jett's determination to succeed a third time around. Certainly, he had shown determination and ambition in the past. Born and raised in the small town of Wickliffe, in the mid-western state of Ohio, Jett's intellect had taken him to two of the US's top academic institutions, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied chemical engineering, and the Harvard Business School, where he studied for an MBA. In addition, he was one of only a small band of black traders in a business dominated by whites. The determination of the outsider trying to make his mark is evident from reports of his strong will, his drive to make money, even if he wasn't very successful. So if Jett was looking for the big time in 1991, he could hardly have strayed into a more receptive environment. Kidder had its own reasons to be ambitious. Since it was bought by General Electric in 1986, the firm had made losses in three years and a modest profit in only one. GE had paid Dollars 600m for 80 per cent of the firm, and then been forced to pump in an extra Dollars 550m as a buttress against bad loans and high-yielding low-quality junk bonds. Welch was becoming impatient: he was reported to be trying to sell Kidder - which almost happened in 1992 when Kidder's rival, Primerica, was interested in buying the firm. Kidder had other problems apart from lack of profitability. Just months after being bought by GE, it was caught in the centre of an insider trading scandal. Martin Siegel, its star takeover adviser, was implicated by the convicted insider-trader Ivan Boesky, and in turn pointed the finger at a senior Kidder trader. By the late 1980s, the sight of men being led from trading rooms in handcuffs had become one ofthe most powerful images of Wall Street's decade of greed. Other investment bankers walked out in 1989, after Welch tried to exert more control of the wayward bank by installing Michael Carpenter, a GE executive, as chief executive. The long-time chairman was ejected. Kidder was now among the least successful investment banks on Wall Street. Bond trading offered a way back to prominence. It was one business Kidder knew something about, having developed a highly regarded mortgage-backed securities operation in the 1980s. And in 1991, it was bent on using this prowess to become a top bond house. The drive was well-timed. The US bond markets soared in 1992 and 1993, and mortgage-backed securities became one of the most lucrative areas of the financial markets. Kidder began making big profits - and paying big bonuses. Mike Vranos, a 31-year-old described as the firm's 'boy wonder', led the charge. Numbered among Wall Streets' top 10 traders in 1992 by Financial World magazine, Vranos's bonus for the year was estimated at between Dollars 10m-Dollars 15m. Jett, the junior trader who had failed to make his mark, was carried to the top on the same tide. Just two years after joining the firm, Jett was named a managing director - a powerful position on Wall Street - and made head of Kidder's government bond desk. To all appearances, he was generating spectacular profits. Even now, Carpenter says: 'We were flying the aeroplane with a compass and a tacometer and an altimeter, all of which said everything was normal.' The problem was, the readings on the instruments gave no indication that the aircraft was out of control. For Kidder and GE, some troubling questions remain. How did the loophole exploited by Jett arise, and why did Kidder's normal controls prove inadequate at exposing it earlier? Perhaps even more important, why did the firm's senior managers omit to ask more questions about the trading strategy of a man who appeared single-handedly to be generating close to 20 per cent of the firm's profits last year? Edward Cerullo, the head of Kidder's bond operations and Jett's immediate manager, 'did have a grasp on the trading strategy and the profits did not seem inconsistent with that', insists Carpenter. Cerullo has been found wanting before: two years ago, he was censured and fined Dollars 5,000 by the National Association of Securities Dealers for failing to supervise a Kidder bond trader who reported false profits. Cerullo remains at Kidder as head of the bond department though six junior traders and administrative staff have been suspended while Kidder investigates the fake profits scheme. Jett has been fired by Kidder and could not be reached for comment at his home in Manhattan. For the rest of Wall Street, the questions raised by Kidder's embarrassing troubles are equally discomforting. How many other Masters of the Universe have ridden rough-shod over slack controls? Jett's fake profits were uncovered only when Kidder's administrative staff became swamped by the tens of thousands of trades he had generated. If he had operated on a more discreet scale, the scheme might have taken longer to emerge. Other US investment banks spent last week insisting that it couldn't happen to them - while busily reviewing their own systems of controls, just to be sure.</p>

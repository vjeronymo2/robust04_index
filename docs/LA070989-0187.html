			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL MISCELLANY NAMES AND NUMBERS  </P> <P> All-Snub Team: Here are some talented players who won't be in Anaheim Tuesday  because they weren't selected for the All-Star team: First base -- Fred McGriff  or Alvin Davis; Second base -- Rob Thompson or Bill Doran; Shortstop -- Ozzie  Guillen; Third base -- Carney Lansford; Catcher -- Bob Boone; Outfield -- Ken  Griffey Jr., Joe Carter, Brett Butler, Rob Deer, Paul O'Neill or Lonnie Smith;  Pitchers -- Bert Blyleven, Kirk McCaskill, Dennis Martinez, Rick Sutcliffe,  Jeff Ballard, Ed Whitson, Roger Clemens or Mike Schooler.  </P> <P> Snub II: Reflecting on the failure of National League Manager Tom Lasorda to  pick either Doran or Thompson as the second base reserve and the low position  of Lasorda's Dodgers in the standings, the Houston Astros' Dave Smith told the  Houston Chronicle: "Thank God that . . . won't be in a position to manage this  team (the NL All-Stars) next year."  </P> <P> Yankee Killer: Ted Higuera of the Milwaukee Brewers improved his career record  against New York to 11-2 Monday night. Among pitchers who have 10 or more  career victories against New York, Higuera's .846 win percentage is the highest  in history.  </P> <P> Power Outage: The Boston Red Sox, 53-28 at Fenway Park last year, are 20-21  this year, having been out-homered, 35-18. In fact, the Red Sox have hit only 3  homers in their last 17 home games. No wonder Manager Joe Morgan gazed out at  the Green Monster in left field recently and said, "We don't even come close  any more."  </P> <P> AL Least: When the Yankees moved over the .500 mark Thursday night (they're now  43-42), it was the first time any AL East team other than Baltimore had been  over .500 since May 26. There have not been three AL East teams over .500 since  May 13.  </P> <P> Henderson &amp; Henderson: In his first 16 games as the Oakland Athletics  leadoff hitter, Rickey Henderson is 25 for 61 (.410) with 10 walks, 19 runs and  11 runs batted in. Dave Henderson, batting second, is headed in the other  direction. D. Henderson has 17 hits in his last 101 at bats (.168) and 30 in  his last 161 (.186). ROSS NEWHAN  </P></p>

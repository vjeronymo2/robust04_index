			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A U.S. Foreign Minister' in Pakistani Cabinet"] </F>   [Excerpt] A precious jewel, Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali of the  Muslim League Junejo Groups, has been appointed the foreign  minister. This is Madam Benazir's first major blunder, and, if  she does not rectify it soon, she will not have to wait long to  suffer from its horrible results. Dozens of other ministers were  appointed. However, no appointment was objected to in such a way  as Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali's appointment.    This precious jewel was a minister in former Prime Minister  Nawaz Sharif's cabinet. It was his misdeeds and slanderous  activities that made Nawaz Sharif lose his seat of power. Mr.  Nawaz Sharif gave him full freedom to make statements, and  religious circles were greatly agitated because of his absurd  talks. Mr. Nawaz Sharif demonstrated deplorable laziness and  evasiveness in understanding the reality behind it. His sole  remark in the cabinet was enough to show which lobby had  nourished this plant. He had taken the oath to be faithful to  Pakistan and its constitution which recognizes the Koran as the  source of laws. However, he took pot shots at the decision on  the interest system, based on the Koran and supported by the  religious court. He did not hesitate from making harsh and  aggressive statements against religious scholars, and Mr. Nawaz  Sharif remained quiet about his attitude. This was the time when  confrontation between Mr. Nawaz Sharif and religious leaders had  first started. However, Nawaz Sharif did not even sense Asif  Ahmed Ali's perversion. Meanwhile, his precious jewel gave  Pakistan the ugly label of terrorist nation. Nawaz Sharif woke  up when the whole nation objected to Ali's actions. However, the  water had risen above his head by that time, and, despite Nawaz  Sharif's issuing a warrant for his arrest and his voluntary  resignation from the cabinet, Nawaz Sharif could not make it  good and lost his bid for power.    Begum Benazir Bhutto was aware of this whole background, but  included Asif Ahmed Ali in her cabinet under Junejo's Group's  pressure. The pressure was not just from the Junejo Group; it  also came from Washington. We can understand Begum Benazir's  helplessness against this pressure and her appointment of a  notorious person like Asif Ahmed Ali to her cabinet. This is an  open act of blackmail in front of our eyes, and she claims that  she would not be blackmailed by anyone. [As the poet said] Who  would not fall in love with such simplicity!    Begum Benazir's helplessness is her own; however, the nation  is not in the same position. Soon after this appointment, a  Muslim League spokesman reacted with a statement condemning  Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali's appointment by the PPP [Pakistan  People's Party]. The fact that this minister had jeopardized  Pakistan's safety and security last April is known to everyone.  The person who was actively trying to have Pakistan declared a  terrorist nation should not be involved in the government at  all, and, giving him such an important position as that of  foreign minister, is out of the question. We have got the hint  as to the kind of foreign policy Benazir's government wants. We  can assume that its foreign policy will be based on efforts to  make India happy, to end our nuclear program, and to adopt an  apologizing attitude about Pakistan's Islamic character. This  was Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali's mission, and this will now be the  PPP mission which he will follow as the foreign minister.    General Senator Hafiz Hussein Ahmed, secretary general of  the  Islami Jamhoori Muhaz, was surprised that Begum Benazir has  appointed a person foreign minister, who a few months ago was  trying to accuse his own country of being involved in terrorism.  In his opinion, such an irresponsible person should not be  appointed to such a responsible position. His becoming the  minister will mean he will finish what he had started to do  (Daily NAWA-I-WAQT 17 November 1993).    Maulana Alrouf, president of Jamiat-i Ittehad-i Ulema of  Karachi, said in reaction to Sardar Asif's speech that he had  played an important role in the fall of the former government  and has distanced the religious groups from Nawaz Sharif. That  is why the religious groups were against the Muslim League  during the 1993 elections and the PPP had benefitted from it.  Now the PPP's appointment of such a person, who issued an  antireligious statement against condemnation of the interest  system, who had insulted the religious leaders, and who was  involved in a conspiracy to declare our country a terrorist  nation, is equivalent to inviting Allah's wrath on us. If this  man is not removed from the cabinet, the apprehension felt by  the religious circles will not be removed (Daily JASARAT Karachi  19 Nov 93).    These reactions indicate that Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali's  appointment has sowed the seeds of confrontation between  religious groups, the opposition, and the Benazir government. It  is a proven fact that no Pakistani government has been  successful after alienating the religious groups. Therefore, we  had said in the beginning of this article that the appointment  of Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali to the foreign ministry was Benazir's  first blunder, and, if she does not rectify this mistake, she  will not have to wait long to suffer consequences .    The new foreign minister announced the day after his  appointment that he was going to end Pakistan's isolation at the  international level. Someone should ask this foolish person when  was Pakistan alone? During Nawaz Sharif's era, Pakistan led the  Group-77 nations. Last year Pakistan become a member of the  Security Council with the international vote in its support. In  addition to the Security Council, Pakistan was appointed a  member to another important UN agency, the Social and Economic  Council. These honors were received with the support of majority  of the countries in the world. How does it indicate that  Pakistan was alone? The truth is that his eyes are masked by  U.S. interests. He sees Pakistan alone in the whole world just  because the United States has stopped aid to it for the last two  years. Nawaz Sharif received huge amounts of aid from Japan and  Korea after the United States stopped its aid, and Pakistan  started such large projects as motorways to prove that it did  not care for U.S. aid and could make do without it. The success  Pakistan had in building planes and missiles without U.S. help  has worried the United States about losing an important customer  for its defense and economic markets. Therefore, it is not  Pakistan that is alone; it is the United States. Asif Ali is  trying to get the United States, and not Pakistan, out of this  economic isolation. He will work in the Pakistani cabinet as the  American foreign minister. The whole nation objects to his  speech.</p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL DISTRICT'S LEGAL FEES PUT AT $2  MILLION  </P> <P> The financially strapped Compton school district has spent nearly $2 million in  legal fees the last four years, at least double what most other Los Angeles  County districts spend, according to a report prepared this week by the  district's financial staff.  </P> <P> The district's Board of Trustees, facing a budget shortfall of at least $7  million in the next school year, ordered the report. One law firm, Melanie E.  Lomax and Associates of Los Angeles, received almost half the money the  district spent on legal expenses, according to the report. She said the  district was involved in a large number of lawsuits and has several  construction projects under way that required legal work on contracts.  </P></p>

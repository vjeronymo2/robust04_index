			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHER STRIKE: THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY  </P> <P> When the relationship between the Los Angeles Unified School District and its  teachers collapsed and the teachers went out on strike, we all witnessed  educational paralysis. Thousands of children suffered an unconscionable loss  mainly because their school district and their teachers could not get along.  </P> <P> Los Angeles has clearly had the most visible labor-management troubles of any  district in California, but it is unfortunately not unique. The Los Angeles  impasse is but one manifestation of the adversarial relations that currently  exist between teachers and district management in many parts of the state.  </P> <P> In light of these problems, one may appropriately ask: Is it inevitable for  school districts and teachers to engage in conflict? Or can both sides in fact  better serve their own interests by pursuing a more cooperative style of  negotiation?  </P> <P> In the private sector, American companies and unions have been forced by  competitive pressures to learn cooperative and participatory styles of labor  relations. Can cooperation work in the schools as well? We believe there is no  place where it can -- and must -- work better.  </P> <P> California's teachers and district management share a joint responsibility for  educating young people. In virtually all things relating to education, they are  expected to cooperate. For example, they work together to develop curricula, to  devise new programs and to set educational goals for students.  </P> <P> But when it comes to contract negotiations, too often their natural cooperation  breaks down and both sides lace up their gloves in anticipation of a fight.  </P> <P> Some blame this anomaly on the application of collective bargaining laws to  school districts. We disagree. The collective bargaining structure has proven  itself sound and useful. The structure is not intended to be, and need not be,  a vehicle for conflict. Just because collective bargaining has sometimes been  practiced in confrontational ways does not mean that confrontation is the only  way -- or even the best way -- to operate under the system.  </P> <P> Indeed, negotiation specialists like those at the Harvard University  Negotiation Project have found that both sides in a collective bargaining arena  stand to gain if they refuse to look at the negotiation as a win/lose  proposition and instead treat it as a creative exercise in joint problem  solving. Under this approach, the negotiators get together to identify  problems, pursue joint interests and establish common goals. In this way, to  the greatest extent possible, neither side gives in but rather both sides win.  </P> <P> It is hard to change from a counterproductive conflict style of collective  bargaining to one that stresses the importance of building trust and  cooperative, long-term relationships. To do this, both teachers and management  need to engage in some new thinking about negotiation.  </P> <P> Several school districts throughout the state, in places like San Marcos (North  San Diego County), Folsom-Cordova, Napa and Ukiah have on their own  successfully made this change toward collaborative-style collective bargaining.  Others have engaged in experimental projects called "trust agreements" where  teachers and their districts agree to pursue a cooperative solution to  particular problems such as curriculum, staff development or peer review.  </P> <P> However, due to a lack of awareness and familiarity with the process, these  encouraging advances have not yet caught on in many parts of California. The  state needs to play a role in fostering cooperative bargaining relationships in  districts that yearn to pursue alternatives to conflict, but don't yet have the  skills to start.  </P> <P> We support the establishment of a voluntary statewide program for training  employee and district negotiators. The program would focus on how to reduce  conflict by approaching the collective bargaining relationship in constructive  ways.  </P> <P> Administered by the Public Employment Relations Board, the program would  provide intensive workshops and seminars in which union and management would  jointly participate in forming practical, cooperative partnerships.  </P> <P> An investment of this kind promises to reduce conflict over the long run. And  it just might prevent impasses like the one that plagued the Los Angeles  district and its students.  </P></p>

			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Figures indicate recovery in commercial property The scale of the recovery in the commercial property market was underlined yesterday by figures showing total returns from property of 18.6 per cent in 1993. Capital values grew by an average of 10.2 per cent. These estimates by Richard Ellis, a firm of chartered surveyors, reveal a sharp improvement on the previous year when commercial property made negative returns of 2.1 per cent. Property's strong performance, which was particularly pronounced in the last few months of the year, stems from a historically high income return together with a significant fall in investment yields. The office sector made the greatest improvement of any sector of the property market, moving from a 1992 return of minus 5.4 per cent to just under 20 per cent. Total returns for retail property improved from 0.2 per cent in December 1992 to 17.6 per cent a year later. Industrial property improved over the year from 2.3 per cent to 18 per cent. Office values rose by nearly 11 per cent, compared with a fall of 15.4 per cent in 1992. Retail values rose by 10 per cent, compared with a fall of 7 per cent. Industrial values improved by nearly 16 percentage points to 8.4 per cent.</p>

			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / World Bank sees need for Dollars 4.3bn THE West Bank and the Gaza Strip will need about Dollars 4.3bn (Pounds 2.8bn) of investment in infrastructure and human resources to get their economies back on their feet after a peace settlement, according to a study by the World Bank. Bank officials said the study showed a need for about Dollars 1.3bn in the first three years for such priority projects as health, education, sewers, water supply, roads and housing, with another Dollars 3bn over the next five years. The World Bank assessment, contained in a 600-page report on the two territories' basic needs, has been sent to Israel, Jordan and the Palestinians for comments and is expected to be finalised in time for multilateral talks on Middle East regional economic development due to take place in Copenhagen in November. Officials said the needs assessment in the Gaza Strip and West Bank - excluding east Jerusalem - was based only on an economic analysis. About Dollars 25m could be spent on a full engineering feasibility assessment. With the emerging possibility of peace between Israel and the Palestinians, US officials have been sounding out other countries for help in financing the eventual settlement. The US bore most of the cost of the earlier peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, but the US hopes for help both from other members of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations and from Arab oil states.</p>

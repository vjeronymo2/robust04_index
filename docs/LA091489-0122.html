			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNWINDING ON PINE;  </P> <P> LONG BEACH'S HIRING OF OUTDOOR COMBOS DRAWS MIXED REVIEWS  </P> <P> Barry Banmann was on his way somewhere else in Long Beach late one Thursday  when the sound of music drew him to Pine Avenue.  </P> <P> "I think it's very nice," said Banmann, a 45-year-old harbor worker, glancing  at the several live combos placed strategically between 1st and 3rd streets. "A  little bit of jazz on this corner, a little bit of reggae on that corner --  I'll try to make this a habit."  </P> <P> Officials of the city's Redevelopment Agency would be cheered to hear that.  </P> <P> Concerned about the dearth of after-hours foot traffic on the street generally  regarded as the showcase of the city's downtown revitalization effort, they  recently took the unprecedented step of committing $109,000 in agency funds to  a three-month promotional campaign. About $20,000, the officials say, is being  spent to hire street musicians to perform from 5 to 7 p.m. each Thursday in an  event called "Unwind on Pine." The rest is paying for thousands of leaflets and  a series of newspaper ads to publicize that and other downtown events.  </P> <P> "It's a very important part of what this agency is all about," said Susan  Shick, the Redevelopment Agency's executive director, adding that the agency  has never before spent so much money on a single promotional effort.  </P> <P> Such an effort is necessary now, she said, to bolster business on the street  which, for the past three years, has been the home of a group of trendy  restaurants, nightclubs and art galleries. The businesses were drawn to the  area by the promise of a downtown renaissance, but it has been slow in coming.  At least three of the new businesses have failed and several others continue to  struggle.  </P> <P> This campaign "was designed to send a message to the pioneering merchants that  we care about what's happening to them and have committed resources to their  need," said Donald Westerland, chairman of the agency's board of directors. "It  has sent a message of support that can't be misconstrued."  </P> <P> But halfway through its 12-week run, the program is getting mixed reviews.  </P> <P> Pedestrian turnout, some merchants say, has been disappointingly low. A jazz  band recently dropped out of the series after one of its members, miffed at  being paid a month late, refused to continue performing. And although the  owners of some Pine Avenue establishments -- most notably Mum's restaurant,  System M and the Williams/Lamb Gallery -- say the promotion has significantly  enhanced their Thursday night business, others contend that the effort is  ineffectual, overly expensive and too narrowly conceived.  </P> <P> "It needs more pizazz," said Lloyd Ikerd, owner of the new Pine Avenue Pacific  Coast Club. He noted that one recent "Unwind on Pine" concert drew only 18  spectators. "We could have saved a lot of money and bought 18 people dinner,"  he said.  </P> <P> Said Gerry Fishkin, a local psychologist and author who serves on the board of  the Long Beach Ballet and is a frequent Pine Avenue visitor: "If this is what  $100,000 worth of advertising does, it's a dismal failure."  </P> <P> Event promoters attribute the late band payments to a delay in the processing  of invoices, which they say has now been cleared up.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Several Problems  </P> <P> But part of the overall problem in attracting visitors, according to John  Morris, owner of Mum's and one of the early supporters of the project, is that  the original concept called for closing the street on Thursday evenings to  create a festival-like atmosphere conducive to pedestrian crowds. That,  however, depended on the implementation of a longstanding plan by Long Beach  Transit authorities to permanently reroute Pine Avenue buses to nearby Pacific  Avenue. And that, in turn, depended on the completion of construction on  Pacific Avenue to accommodate the new light-rail system. Work was expected to  end early this summer, but has been delayed by unforeseen technical problems.  </P> <P> "We're ready to move today," said Larry Jackson, Long Beach Transit director,  "but the contractor is nowhere near completion." While the official termination  date is now sometime in October, Jackson said, "it's questionable in my mind  whether they'll be done by then."  </P> <P> Other obstacles to attracting evening crowds to Pine Avenue, critics say,  include poor lighting and inadequate parking. Some question the wisdom of the  Redevelopment Agency's advertising strategy which, among other things, calls  for advertising the Thursday night event almost a week in advance. And at least  one member of the agency's board itself has raised philosophical questions  regarding the ethics of using public money to promote a handful of private  businesses rather than for public improvement projects of benefit to all.  </P> <P> "I'm not very comfortable with it," said James Kennelly, a new board member who  was not involved in the decision to go ahead with the promotional project. "I  don't think it's a proper use of tax dollars. The agency could get all bogged  down on these piddling things; these (restaurant owners) are big boys -- they  know how to advertise."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Program Is Defended  </P> <P> Other redevelopment officials respond that promoting business in the  redevelopment district is indeed within the agency's purview, especially in an  area like Pine Avenue whose success is seen as critical to the success of  downtown as a whole. The Friday advertisements -- consisting of two pages in  the Weekend supplement of the Press-Telegram -- promote more than just the  Thursday-night events, they say. Other ads are placed in the Grunion Gazette.  And while the response has not been overwhelming, they say, it is getting  better each week and is directly benefiting merchants in the area.  </P> <P> "There's no magic formula," Shick said. "Our hope is that the (potential)  strength (of Pine Avenue) can be spread downtown. This is an important part of  an overall program."  </P> <P> In fact, the city's efforts come after a long period of harsh criticism by Pine  Avenue merchants against Shick's predecessor, Roger Anderman. Many felt he was  not doing enough to promote business on Pine.  </P> <P> In that context, some critics say they applaud the city's show of commitment  while at the same time question the efficiency of its effort. "We're going in  the right direction," Ikerd said, "but it's going to take some time."  </P> <P> For now, though, the Thursday night revelers seem to be enjoying the sparsely  populated sidewalks.  </P> <P> "This was great," said Kellyann Linehan, 28, an executive secretary who lives  in the area. "This kind of entertainment is hard to find; I thought the streets  would be jammed."  </P> <P> Added her friend, Ed Steele, 26: "If this were happening in San Diego or San  Francisco, there'd be 300 people."  </P></p>

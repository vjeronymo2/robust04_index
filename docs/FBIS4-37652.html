			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 23 Jun (INA) -- Iraq has reiterated its  support for the Yemeni people's struggle against the  secessionist and apostate forces in defense of their unity and  the unity of their soil and state.    This came in a statement issued at the conclusion of the  parliamentary talks that were held between a delegation from the  Yemeni House of Representatives and the Iraqi National Assembly.    The statement stresses the Iraqi people's denunciation of  the  interference of some suspect regional and foreign parties to  prolong the fighting and impose the status quo of disunity in  order to dismember the Republic of Yemen and jeopardize the  unity of its people.    The two sides condemned the continued blockade imposed on  the  people of Iraq. They called for an immediate end to the  blockade since Iraq has implemented all its obligations toward  the unfair UN Security Council resolutions issued against it.    The Yemeni House of Representatives delegation visiting  Iraq,  led by Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Kibsi, held meetings with officials  and heads of unions and professional and popular organizations  to explain the latest developments in the situation in Yemen and  the efforts to resolve the crisis in a manner that conforms with  constitutional legitimacy, which is being defended by the  fraternal Yemeni people.</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> SCHOOL NOT RATTLED BY DRILL TIMING  </P> <P> It was a dress rehearsal that couldn't have been more timely. On Wednesday, the  same morning that a series of earthquakes rocked Northern California, the staff  and students of Jackson Elementary School staged a full-scale earthquake drill.  </P> <P> The event also inadvertently fell on the 84th anniversary of the 1906 Great  Earthquake, which devastated San Francisco. And it came the day after sizable  aftershocks from a Feb. 28 earthquake were felt in the Southland.  </P> <P> "When we planned the drill, we had no idea that the date we selected fell on  the anniversary of the San Francisco quake," said Bill Boettcher, risk manager  for the Santa Ana Unified School District. "But that coincidence and the  earthquakes of today showed us how vulnerable we really are and how important  proper training is."  </P> <P> The earthquake drill involved the school's 1,200 students, 70 teachers and  staff members and dozens of parents. The scenario had a major 7.4 earthquake  occurring at the Newport-Inglewood Fault, causing widespread damage to the  area.  </P> <P> At the school, emergency stations went into operation, the Santa Ana Fire  Department was notified and well-planned emergency preparedness plans were  called into action. Children feigning injuries were brought to first-aid  stations and attended by volunteers, while teachers marched their classes  outside for a head count.  </P> <P> First-grade teacher Marie Wood brought her students to the playground after  conducting a "drop" drill in her classroom.  </P> <P> "No one panicked, and the kids followed directions very well," Wood said. "We  practiced a lot, and I had a lot of confidence in the children."  </P> <P> But the first-aid station was not just filled with fakers. In all the  excitement, fifth-grader Tim Nelson suffered a lump on the head when he hit it  on the corner of his desk while trying to crawl underneath.  </P> <P> "I thought we were in a real earthquake at first," said Tim, as he held an ice  pack to his head. "They told us it (the drill) was going to happen, but I  didn't think it was time yet."  </P> <P> For several of the parents who agreed to participate, the drill proved to be  unsettling.  </P> <P> "After standing there for 15 minutes and not seeing my kids, I was feeling  panicky and lightheaded and was getting really nervous," said Effie Coulter,  the mother of three Jackson students.

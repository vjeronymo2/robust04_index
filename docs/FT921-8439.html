Mr Mandela made his statement during a speech in Cape Town as black and white negotiators began considering proposals by his ANC and other groups for the government that would rule during the transition to democracy The government of Mr F W De Klerk, the ANC and most other political groups began negotiations in December on rewriting the constitution. A working group on the interim government issue met yesterday to begin assessing widely differing proposals put forward by the 19 parties and organisations involved. Proposals so far have agreed an interim government should control finance, the media, foreign affairs, security forces and preparations for elections.

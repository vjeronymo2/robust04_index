			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: London coffee futures lose early gains as rally boils over - Market report London COFFEE futures ended broadly unchanged after a volatile afternoon marked by speculator and trade buying as well as technical selling and some trade liquidation, dealers said. The market, which was predicted to open Dollars 57 higher in the November position following gains amounting to Dollars 250 earlier in the week, was slightly firmer at midday but during the afternoon it swung from a day's high of Dollars 3,650 a tonne to a low of Dollars 3,530. At the close it stood at Dollars 3,573. The London bullion market GOLD price broke through its previous resistance area around Dollars 383 a troy ounce in early afternoon business as good buying from the New York commission houses spilled over into Europe. It closed at Dollars 384.25 an ounce, up Dollars 2.25. Dealers were restrained in their enthusiasm, however. 'There's very little physical interest around on gold at present, so I can't see this rally lasting,' said one. SILVER, underpinned by gold's move, broke through resistance to hit a high of 534 cents an ounce before encountering selling. Compiled from Reuters</p>

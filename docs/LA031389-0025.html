			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : KARYN WHITE HEATS UP THE PALACE WITH ENERGY  </P> <P> With her wild mane of hair and barely there mini-dress, hot newcomer Karyn  White headlined the Palace Friday and exhibited the offhand sexiness and  unharnessed energy of Chaka Khan back in her Rufus days. White's 45-minute show  had its rough edges, but her raw, energetic approach was refreshing in a time  when so many entertainers are polished to high-gloss sterility.  </P> <P> The petite singer, whose debut album has just passed the million-sales mark,  opened with "The Facts of Love," the Jeff Lorber hit that introduced her to pop  audiences. White engaged in a lot of Janet Jackson-esque choreography that drew  heated response from her male fans, but id was her impassioned vocals on such  numbers as "Superwoman" and "Love Saw It" (a duet with singer-producer  Babyface) that really rocked the room. While as adept at dance hits as Jackson  and Jody Watley, White is a far superior vocalist. She has a touch of Khan's  earthy soul, and even Whitney Houston's authority. And a bright future.

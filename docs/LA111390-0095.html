			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROFILE ;  </P> <P> MEXICO HAS NEW GENERAL IN THE WAR ON NARCOTICS;  </P> <P> JORGE CARRILLO OLEA SAYS HIS APPOINTMENT TO THE POST OF ANTI-DRUG CZAR DOES NOT  REFLECT A SHIFT IN OFFICIAL POLICY. IT MAY, HOWEVER, BE A SHIFT AWAY FROM  ALLEGED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN COMBATTING DOPE DEALERS.  </P> <P> This country's new drug czar, Jorge Carrillo Olea, has met repeatedly with U.S.  officials to reassure them that his appointment does not signal a shift in the  country's aggressive anti-narcotics program and coordination with the United  States.  </P> <P> President Carlos Salinas de Gortari named Carrillo Olea to the top drug post  Oct. 15 to replace Javier Coello Trejo, under whose leadership the Federal  Judicial Police had captured record quantities of cocaine but reportedly  committed widespread human rights abuses.  </P> <P> "There is great uncertainty in the United States about what Carrillo's attitude  will be regarding (bilateral) coordination," said a source in the Mexican  attorney general's office. "There will be more coordination. He's interested in  a more fluid exchange of information."  </P> <P> The bespectacled Carrillo told reporters at a press conference after his  appointment that "international cooperation is key to combatting this social  phenomenon -- drug trafficking."  </P> <P> Before taking the drug post, Carrillo Olea was director general of national  security, a job that included analyzing the flows of South American narcotics  through Mexico. Salinas named him to the new post with the title of general  coordinator of investigations and the fight against drug trafficking; because  he is not a lawyer, he could not legally be appointed to the post of deputy  attorney general that Coello held.  </P> <P> At 53, Carrillo, a retired army general, has a background in army intelligence  rather than police work; he is far more polished and political than was his  gruff and burly predecessor.  </P> <P> "He is someone with a military training who is hard and intransigent but  intelligent and political," said the source in the attorney general's office  who declined to be identified. "Coello didn't have the political sensibilities  that he has."  </P> <P> A U.S. source comparing the two said, "He (Carrillo) is a sharp instrument  instead of a blunt instrument."  </P> <P> Coello, who held the job of deputy attorney general for two years, first ran  into trouble with the Mexican press and people when he publicly defended his  bodyguards against charges that several of them gang-raped more than a dozen  women in Mexico City early this year.  </P> <P> National and international human rights groups also held him responsible for  the torture, extortion, kidnaping and murder allegedly committed by the Federal  Judicial Police under his authority. Government officials conceded that Salinas  brought in Carrillo to clean up the department's actions and image.  </P> <P> At the same time, Salinas proposed new laws aimed at curbing police torture.  Under the laws that must be approved by the National Congress, interrogations  would be carried out by lawyers from the attorney general's office rather than  by federal police, and they would be conducted in the presence of a defense  attorney. Confessions no longer would be sufficient evidence on which to  convict a suspected criminal; suspects illegally detained would have to be  released.  </P> <P> Some U.S. drug officials feared that the changes might mean the Salinas  administration was pulling back on its anti-drug efforts. Salinas has served  two years of his six-year term, and past administrations have tended to let  down their guard on the drug front after two years, falling into a pattern of  police corruption by the final two years.  </P> <P> Since his appointment, Carrillo has met with U.S. Ambassador John D. Negroponte  as well as with top Drug Enforcement Administration officials in Mexico. He has  told them that police will vigorously pursue drug traffickers while observing  human rights and that the government will continue to develop its Northern  Border Task Force, a program to intercept cocaine-laden aircraft headed for the  United States from South America.  </P> <P> "He said his appointment should not be interpreted as a change in policy," said  one U.S. official.  </P> <P> "I think the human rights policy is going to diminish their (Mexican police)  effectiveness at the street level, but not at the program level," the American  official added. "You have to treat (suspects) like you do in the United States  now, which means they have all the leeway in the world to say nothing.  Investigations will go more slowly."  </P> <P> Coca, the plant from which cocaine is produced, is not grown in Mexico, but  Mexico is a major route for getting the drugs into the United States. U.S.  officials estimate that 300 to 350 metric tons of South American cocaine passes  through Mexico into the United States each year.  </P> <P> U.S. and Mexican government cooperation in the fight against drug trafficking  has grown immensely under Salinas. The U.S. government is to deliver nine armed  Huey UH-1H helicopters to Mexico beginning this month for the Northern Border  Task Force to use in bringing down the drug planes. Eleven Mexicans currently  are in training to fly the helicopters at Ft. Rucker, Ala. The helicopters will  be on loan.  </P> <P> Mexico also will purchase two Cessna Citation fixed-wing aircraft with radar to  track drug flights from South America. A U.S. Customs team has been in Mexico  for several weeks training pilots to use the radar, fly and repair the planes.  On one such training mission last month, the Mexican government captured six  tons of cocaine in Ciudad Jimenez, Chihuahua -- the largest seizure ever in  Mexico.  </P> <P> U.S. and Mexico officials said they will continue to work together through the  Northern Border Task Force. They said that U.S. P-3 radar aircraft will track  flights from Colombia into international waters off the coast of Mexico, where  the American planes will hand off tracking of the flights to the Mexican  Cessnas. The Cessnas will follow the Colombian planes to clandestine strips in  northern Mexico, where they will be met by federal police in the armed  helicopters. The Cessnas cannot land on the dirt airstrips.  </P> <P> The Chihuahua raid essentially was a dry run of this.  </P> <P> "This proves that when all the elements are in place, it goes right," said a  U.S. official.  </P> <P> U.S. and Mexican officials said they expect Carrillo to keep a lower profile  than his predecessor, but to be equally active. They said he has been holding  meetings with police commanders to impress upon them that there will be new  laws regarding arrests and investigations.  </P> <P> Human rights and the fight against drug trafficking "are not incompatible,"  Carrillo told reporters.  </P> <P> "There is a lot of uncertainty among the commanders," said a Mexican official.  "Carrillo is stressing legality to them. He is going to be different in style.  The hand of Carrillo will be seen when the continued efficiency of the police  is felt, but legally; when we announce five tons of cocaine has been captured  and the judge doesn't say, 'But the pilot was tortured, his confession was  extracted through torture.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Biography  </P> <P> Name: Jorge Carillo Olea  </P> <P> Title: General coordinator of investigations and the fight against drug  trafficking  </P> <P> Age: 53  </P> <P> Personal: Graduate in military administration of the Superior War School in  Mexico. Former undersecretary of the interior.  </P> <P> Quote: "No one in the DEA or the Federal Justice Police receives sufficient  money . . . We need to pay police officers better money, and the attorneys and  the judges, but we can never pay them enough if there is a lack of ethical  commitment."  </P></p>

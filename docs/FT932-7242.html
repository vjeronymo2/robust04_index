			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Letter: High fares for high speed Sir, Your article, 'Mitterrand mocks UK as new TGV link opens' (May 19), states that French rail users are complaining about the higher fares they will have to pay to help recoup the cost of building the new Paris to Lille line. The range of fares quoted in the article is just about the same as we currently pay in Britain for the comparable length of journey between London and Bristol, without BR having made comparable outlays on new trackwork and rolling stock. What prospect is there of high-speed rail links in Britain at fares we can afford? J W Smith, 5, Old Deer Park Gardens, Richmond, Surrey TW9 2TN</p>

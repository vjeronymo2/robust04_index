			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCR PLANS READING OF WORK BY ONCE-BANNED SOVIET PLAYWRIGHT  </P> <P> Government disapproval brings its own reward, particularly for writers. Ask  Vaclav Havel. Well, don't bother -- everybody knows about the dissident  playwright turned Czech leader. Ask Alexander Buravsky.  </P> <P> When he started writing plays in 1980, the Soviet Ministry of Culture banned  his works. Then along came perestroika. Political maverick Boris N. Yeltsin  allowed a production, and Buravsky found himself the toast of Moscow with a hit  play called "Speak Out."  </P> <P> As the lanky, soft-spoken playwright recounted his breakthrough, an ironic  smile flickered on his lips. "The fact that my plays were forbidden for many  years gave me some kind of advertising," he said in university-trained English.  "That is how I could push them very fast on the stage."  </P> <P> Fast indeed. Following "Speak Out" in 1986, a political drama set around the  time of Stalin's death in 1953, five more of his plays reached production over  the next two years alone: "Tinfoil Stars," "Under the Table," "The Guest  House," "We Play for Money" and "Liberty: Year Two." All had movie stars in  them. All were mounted at elegant Moscow theaters.  </P> <P> Since then, the 37-year-old Buravsky has seen his plays translated and staged  across Europe -- in Poland, West Germany and France. Now he hopes to launch a  career in the United States with his seventh and most recent play, "The Russian  Teacher," which will receive a New-SCRipt reading tonight at South Coast  Repertory in an English adaptation by Keith Reddin.  </P> <P> The original version, which opens Tuesday in Moscow (Story, F16), came to the  attention of SCR's David Emmes last April on a trip to the Soviet Union, where  he saw it in rehearsal.  </P> <P> "Before this one, I wrote about the French revolution," Buravsky said,  referring to "Liberty: Year Two" (given a reading Dec. 20 in Los Angeles as  part of the Mark Taper Forum's "New Work Festival '89"). "It was very serious.  Tragedy. Bloodshed. Robespierre. Danton. And so on. I decided, that's enough. I  want to be funny, but at the same time not to be stupid. It was a kind of  challenge to speak of serious things in a funny way."  </P> <P> The idea for "The Russian Teacher" struck him while he was pondering the  contradictions of a society in which no private property is allowed because the  state owns everything, yet its citizens busily commandeer what they need for  all sorts of commercial enterprises.  </P> <P> "If you are on a Moscow street, for example, it is very difficult to get a  taxi," Buravsky explained. "So when you are waiting with your hand raised,  suddenly a black limousine will come to a stop and take you. It is not a taxi.  It belongs to the Communist Party or the Central Committee or a government  ministry. The chauffeur has nothing to do all day. He brings a bureaucrat to  the office and takes him home. In between, the limousine is his private  property. You give him money and he takes you."  </P> <P> Buravsky recalled riding as a passenger in one of these gypsy cabs when it was  flagged down for speeding. Without any prompting from the chauffeur, the  playwright surprised even himself by suddenly becoming an impostor. He played a  party official on his way to an important meeting, which achieved the desired  effect. "We went free," Buravsky said.  </P> <P> But he also got to wondering what role he might have taken had the limousine  been a prison van. Would he have played someone on his way to jail, perhaps an  arrested politician? And that led him to imagine a more bizarre situation.  </P> <P> What if he were a surgeon in a hospital on the Black Sea, a luxurious resort  area where accommodations are difficult to find during the height of the  vacation season? What if this surgeon were to take advantage of the room  shortage and rent out the beds in the orthopedic ward of the hospital as though  it were a hotel? What if the people who check in, among them a Russian teacher,  suddenly had to play the roles of patients with broken arms and legs because of  an imminent inspection?  </P> <P> "It was just my fantasy," Buravsky said. "I don't use symbolic phrases to say  our Socialist country is this way. But there is a subtext that we are locked  (in a ward) and we are forced to play roles different from who we are."  </P> <P> In a society where professions are decided early, the Jewish, Moscow-born  playwright believed until the age of 14 that he would be a cellist like his  grandfather, Isaak Buravsky, a renowned Soviet musician. But after studying  cello for 10 years at the Moscow Central School for gifted children, Buravsky  made a discovery: "I wanted to read words in my books, not only notes."  </P> <P> Shifting to language studies in high school, he went on to Moscow University  and graduated with a journalism degree in 1975, he said. For several years he  worked at Soviet Screen magazine as a feature writer. Eventually, he began  turning out unproduced play scripts.  </P> <P> "There were many people who wanted to use what I wrote before perestroika,"  Buravsky recalled. "Even in the Ministry of Culture there were people who  wanted to help me. But they wanted me to rewrite, rewrite, rewrite, to go  through the censorship.  </P> <P> "My editor, a very kind woman, used to say to me: 'I'm helping you. Why don't  you help me?' I tried. I'm not so strong that I refused altogether. I wanted to  see my plays on the stage. But I couldn't. So I earned my living not only as a  journalist. I wrote for comedians."  </P> <P> Getting nowhere with his plays, Buravsky managed to shift course once again. In  1984 he gained admission to the Soviet Union's sole graduate school for film  makers and screenwriters, where only a dozen or so applicants are accepted each  year. On graduation, he said, their future in the movie industry is virtually  assured.  </P> <P> In fact, Buravsky already has four produced movies: "Down Main Street With an  Orchestra," "The Amateurs," "Freedom Is Paradise," and "The Gambler," which he  co-directed and is still in post-production.  </P> <P> But despite the glamour of the movie world, theater remains his first love. To  write screenplays, he said, "is to work as a professional. But to write plays  is to be an artist."  </P> <P> "With movies I feel I am serving a huge team of people," Buravsky explained.  "Everyone is always in a hurry (because) movies are expensive to make. Or maybe  it rains. Your character needs a raincoat. That means a bad mood. You must  rewrite for the director, for the cameraman and so on.  </P> <P> "But with a play I feel I am serving myself."  </P> <P>  A staged reading of "The Russian Teacher," a satiric comedy about perestroika  by Alexander Buravsky, will be given at 7:30 p.m. at South Coast Repertory, 655  Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $6. Information: (714) 957-4033.  </P> <P> </P></p>

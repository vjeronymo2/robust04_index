			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Guide to UK Property (12): Harsh realities - The South / The Reading-Bracknell area's development boom is now well and truly over SENTIMENTS in the property markets in the south-east and the south-west never reached the deep lows experienced in central London during the recession. But, that said, at a national level they have been hit considerably harder than the markets of the midlands and the north. No clearer visual evidence of that impact was provided than by the millions of square feet of vacant space in office block after office block in the M4 'Golden Triangle.' Surveyor Savills' recent estimate of office vacancy rates in the Reading-Bracknell area was 22 per cent - comparable with the most gloomy estimates of vacancy level in the City of London. The area's development boom, due in no small part to the introduction of the B1 office consent - now generally regarded as misguided at best  - is well and truly over. Savills puts estimated 1992 completions at 319,000 sq ft in four projects. Corresponding figures for 1993 and 1994 are 140,000 sq ft in two buildings and 85,000 sq ft in a single building, respectively. But just recently Bracknell has started to move. Several recent lettings included that of Grosvenor Square properties' 71,500 sq ft Greenwood House to Novell UK and of the 40,000 sq ft L'Avenir development to Cadence Design Systems by receiver Mr Mark Batten of Price Waterhouse. These and other deals have, however, only taken place after hard-pressed landlords faced harsh realities and accepted that in order to attract takers they would have to put together incentive packages similar to those offered by City of London landlords. More high profile lettings in Bracknell are understood to be on the way as tenants take advantage of what is on offer. Reading itself accounts for little of the area's oversupply, says Mr Ken Williams of surveyor Vail Williams. He adds that the town is one of the few pockets in the south-east where there is only a small amount of quality space available. Despite this, top town centre rental packages equating to less than Pounds 20 a sq ft are being offered - in contrast to Arlington's Theale Business Park where rents of about Pounds 24.50 a sq ft are probably the highest in the region. The building boom in the south-east in the 1980s was mainly concentrated in the office and B1 categories. Very little new industrial warehouse space was built; spiralling land values made such developments unviable. The result was that there has been no oversupply of new industrial space and much of the industrial property supply consists of second-hand, outdated stock. As land values have plummeted there is a greater willingness to release land for industrial development. In general terms, industrial rents in the M3-M4 corridor stand at about Pounds 6-Pounds 7 a sq ft and in the south coast areas - around Portsmouth and Southampton - at Pounds 5-Pounds 6 a sq ft. The south-west has also suffered. Mr Tim Stevenson of surveyor Chestertons points out that the area had become heavily reliant upon the financial services sector, the defence industry and, further west, the tourist industry. All three have taken substantial hits. In Bristol, office rents have risen to Pounds 20 a sq ft with recent small lettings at Queens Quay, Queens Square, to County NatWest ventures and Zurich Assurance at that figure. Chestertons estimates that more than 1.5m sq ft of office space is available in central Bristol, although only 375,000 sq ft is in good quality new buildings. Average take-up historically has been about 400,000 sq ft a year - even during last year some 352,000 sq ft was let. But this year has been very quiet, says Mr Stevenson - and it looks very unlikely that last year's figure will be matched or even approached. Bristol's first covered shopping centre, the 320,000 sq ft Gallerias, opened last year some 75 per cent let and is reported to be trading well. Over the years, Bristol has grown largely because of its attractions to relocating companies. There are, says Mr Stevenson, one or two large space users looking at Bristol seriously - along with other locations. Falling rents in central London have reduced the cost differential which used to be the main reason for decentralising. However, some organisations are still considering moving out, for a variety of other reasons including quality of staff, working environment and life style. Surveyor Richard Ellis is advising Lloyds Register of Shipping on its move from offices in the City of London and in Croydon. After looking at some 54 locations on the M3-M4 axis, those on the short list of three are: Swindon, Southampton and Hook. The 330,000 sq ft of accommodation required is subject to an architectural competition and the location which is finally selected will receive a considerable shot in the arm for its property market. In a generally dull market in the south-east and south-west, there are inevitably one or two bright spots. One of these is is Plymouth where the office market, with only some 140,000 sq ft of good quality newish space available, is ticking over at about Pounds 12.50 a sq ft to Pounds 13 a sq ft. But the star performer is the retail market. Mr Stephen Lobb of Chesterton says that it has been busier in the past 12 months than at any time during the past 10 years. Central Plymouth is one of the few locations of its size which has yet to benefit from a big new shopping development and it has suffered from a shortage of prime shopping space. Operators previously unable to open in Plymouth have scrambled for the few gaps created by relocations and or recession casualties. Throughout the south there is demand for investment property which meets strict criteria: good quality building; solid covenants and a yield in, or approaching, double figures. Such propositions are in very short supply indeed.</p>

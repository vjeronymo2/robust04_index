			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE FACTS ABOUT VEAL  </P> <P> I am disturbed that someone might believe Sandi Bouchard's ludicrously  inaccurate letter (Sept. 3), which condemns Calendar and others for airing  views about the condemnable (albeit legal) practices connected with formula-fed  confined veal calves.  </P> <P> White veal is an unnatural product obtained by unnatural means. Its production  should be outlawed in this country as it has been in Sweden and some other  countries. These nations are banning facts, not fictions.  </P> <P> GENE BURKE  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

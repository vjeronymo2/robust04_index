Measuring the transparency and the print quality in concert provides the most relevant data to determine whether Postal Service automated sorting equipment will be capable of successfully reading the address and/or barcode during processing. Thus, Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards for letter-size mail in automation-rate mailings require that addresses viewed through a glassine window covering must provide a print contrast ratio (PCR) of at least 45 percent and that barcodes viewed through the material must provide a print reflectance difference (PRD) of at least 30 percent. (These percentages pertain to both the red and the green portions of the optical spectrum, when measured using a USPS or USPS-licensed envelope reflectance meter.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although these readability standards identify useful performance criteria for window-covering material, some glassine manufacturers have complained that it is difficult to translate them into production criteria for their products. It is impractical for glassine manufacturers to know, in advance of production, the quality of the printing that will show through the window of an envelope using their product, yet this information becomes critical in determining whether the material meets USPS automation-compatibility specification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, to help glassine manufacturers establish appropriate criteria for the glassine itself in isolation from the printing that will be used with it, the Postal Service conducted a series of laboratory and operational tests on a variety of materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The laboratory test method used was the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) D 1003, Standard Test Method for Haze and Luminous Transmittance of Transparent Plastics. Test measurements were taken with a MacBeth Color-Eye 7000 Spectrophotometer and Optiview software set for correlated haze. Environmental conditions, material thickness, dimensional stability, gloss, and haze were carefully measured and monitored during testing on both the Postal Service multiline optical character reader (MLOCR) version A and the wide area barcode reader (WABCR). (A detailed description of testing methods and criteria is available on request.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of these tests, the Postal Service proposes that glassine window-covering material be evaluated for automation compatibility by measuring its haze value. Correlated (transmitted) haze is defined as the percentage of transmitted light that deviates from the incident beam by forward scattering when passing through a specimen. Any specimen with a haze value greater than 30 percent, when tested in accordance with ASTM D 1003 is considered diffusing or translucent. This can affect readability on the OCR or WABCR by diffusing the image of the printed insert as read through the window-covering material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: BA firm on Orly opening Shares in British Airways were strong, closing 8 ahead at 378p, with the day's trading boosted by a broker's recommendation and news that France had agreed to open its Orly airport to UK airlines. France had previously resisted a European Union directive to open the lucra-tive London to Orly route, a move which nearly provoked a confrontation with the UK. The recommendation came from long-time bull Strauss Turnbull, which said: 'The stock is a good recovery play. The yield is attractive and the rating undemanding. Also, British Airways is well positioned to take advantage of European deregulation.' Full-year profits of Pounds 301m reported last week were at the top end of expectations and saw the stock return to favour after a sustained period of weakness. Transport analyst Mr Nick Cunningham at Strauss predicts profits for the current year will jump by nearly 50 per cent to Pounds 450m.</p>

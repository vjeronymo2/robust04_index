			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Company News in Brief NORTHERN TELECOM, the Canadian telecommunications group, is to take a 7.5 per cent stake in MMB, the French holding company which controls Matra, the telecommunications and transport group, and Hachette, the advertising and publishing company, writes William Dawkins. The move, to come into force at the end of this year, is a consequence of an offer published yesterday to buy out the outstanding MMB shareholders to pave the way for the merger of Matra and Hachette. ***** Paribas, the diversified French banking group, yesterday reported a fall in first-half net profits to FFr1.11bn (Dollars 231m) from FFr1.3bn in the same period of 1991, Reuter reports. The bank said it expected second-half and full-year earnings to be in line with those of the first half. ***** Alitalia, Italy's flagship carrier, said that in spite of continuing difficulties in the transport sector its first-half net loss narrowed to L39bn (Dollars 32m) from L104bn in the same period last year, AP-DJ reports. Revenue rose 22 per cent to L2,549bn. ***** Saffa, the Italian paper and cardboard manufacturer, yesterday registered a 52 per cent fall in parent company pre-tax profits to L20.5bn for the first half of 1992 from L42.8bn in the corresponding period of 1991.</p>

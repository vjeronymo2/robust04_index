On the agenda are, among other things, a review of the  International and Domestic Economic Situations, the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC), prospects of the North American  Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), post-Uruguay Round world trade,  Korea's financial market opening, wider market access and  science-technology cooperation.    The meeting is Korea's first with a NAFTA member since the  agreement went into effect Jan. 1.    Seoul will ask Ottawa to be fair and follow the UR agreement  in making a final dumping ruling on Korean steel.    The Canadian Department of National Revenue's preliminary  ruling, dated Jan. 17, slapped a 45.6-percent dumping margin on  hot-rolled carbon steel plate exported mainly by Dongkuk Steel  Mill Co. and Pohang Iron and Steel Co.    Son Chun-yong, assistant foreign minister for Economic  Affairs, represents the Seoul side. Howard Balloch, assistant  foreign minister for Asia and the Pacific, is Canada's  representative.</p>

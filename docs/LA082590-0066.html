			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> GAS MASK FACTORY WORKING 24 HOURS  </P> <P> The heavy demand for gas masks from Middle Eastern distributors has forced a  Barcelona firm to cut short vacations and begin round-the-clock production, one  of the firm's owners says.  </P> <P> Jeroni Llorca of Llorca Protective Systems said Thursday the company had  planned to start producing its new Vispro civilian-use gas mask in September.  But frantic calls from distributors in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria and Israel  persuaded the firm to begin immediately.  </P> <P> Llorca said employees are producing about 1,500 masks a day. He expects his  first shipment to go out Sept. 15.  </P></p>

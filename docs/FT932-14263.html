			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / People: Francis Maude switches American banks Less than a year after joining Salomon Brothers, Francis Maude, financial secretary at the Treasury until he lost his seat at the last general election, is on the move again - this time to rival US investment bank Morgan Stanley. The job description (head of privatisation) remains the same, but at Morgan Stanley International, Maude will get a seat on the board as a managing director (he was only a director at Salomon) and an opening in a bank with higher standing internationally in the privatisation business. 'There is nothing particularly sinister' in the early switch, Maude says, pointing out that his new employer is 'set up to do large-scale privatisation business'. He tactfully declines to comment on his experiences at Salomon, where his name has not been closely associated with any large new transactions. Still only 39, Maude has now had three careers - as a barrister, junior minister and now banker - but says: 'There is time for plenty more.' Though he has indicated that he will not fight to regain his old seat as an MP, he adds that his political ambitions are 'not dead by any means'. The move to Morgan Stanley was seen by former colleagues at Salomon as a way for Maude to make his mark quickly (and presumably very profitably) before jumping back into politics at the next UK election.

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Brittany Ferries joins ban on exports of livestock Brittany Ferries dealt a blow to Britain's Pounds 200m live animal trade yesterday when it banned virtually all shipments from midnight tonight. That cut off the last regular export outlet. The company joined other ferry operators in halting live exports after uncovering 'flagrant breaches' by livestock hauliers of its code of conduct. Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, will meet Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, early next week to press for new laws to crack down on cowboy operators, which he claims are ruining the business for other farmers. Brittany Ferries stopped carrying animals destined for immediate slaughter in August after public outcry over the way animals are treated in transit, but it continued to carry livestock for further fattening before slaughter on the Continent. The company required operators to confine deliveries to Brittany, Normandy and the Loire Valley to minimise discomfort to the animals. It said spot checks showed the code had been 'cynically disregarded', with some animals transported as far as Spain. Mr Ian Carruthers, Brittany Ferries' managing director, said: 'I am both saddened and shocked by the total disregard the majority of livestock exporters have shown for the code. Basically they have misled us about the end destination of the animals in their care.' The ferry company's decision to ban all live shipments - except of breeding stock and competition horses - cuts off another route to the lucrative live export trade. A chartered ship carried 3,000 live lambs from Grimsby to Calais this week and several planeloads of calves have been flown out. But farmers' leaders say that is tiny for a business that exported 2m lambs and 500,000 calves last year - 20 per cent of British meat exports. The Royal Society for the Protection of Animals welcomed the ban and said it would be writing to Mr Waldegrave to urge him to toughen British welfare standards and impose an eight-hour maximum journey time. European Union agriculture ministers last week failed to agree on a journey limit of 15 hours.</p>

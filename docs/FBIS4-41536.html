			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Khodii] </F>   [Text] Irkutsk June 24 TASS -- "The presidential decree  against gangsterism is the first step in extraordinary  legislation against crime. Attitudes to the decree may differ  but I think we are doomed to this," Russian Vice-Premier Sergey  Shakhray told correspondents here today.    Shakhray has finished a trip to the extreme northern areas  with a governmental delegation to analyze goods supplies and  will attend a meeting of the council of the "Siberian Agreement"  interregional association.    Efforts of all power branches should be pulled in measures  against organized crime, stressed Shakhray. A corresponding  draft law has been approved by the government and submitted to  the State Duma.    Asked about his opinion of the proposal to prolong powers of  deputies, the president and other power structures, Shakhray  said "i almost do not doubt that the deal of political elites --  prolongation of the Civic Accord Treaty -- will not result in  any elections till the end 1998. This can be legalized only  with a constitutional amendment or a constitutional law".    Speaking of goods delivery to the extreme northern areas,  Shakhray said extreme measures will have to be taken if the  goods are not transported on rivers in July. This first of all  goes for oil products, coal and foodstuffs. Otherwise, they  will have to evacuate residents from the extreme zones.</p>

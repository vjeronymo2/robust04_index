			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (5): Nothing till you're 65 or 60 - Going early, State pensions / Moreover, early retirement can seriously reduce your state entitlement  - but all is not lost MOST PEOPLE assume that they will automatically receive the full basic state pension. But this is not the case. Your pension depends on several factors, including the number of years you have paid National Insurance contributions (NICs) and the length of your working life. Early retirement can seriously reduce your state pension if you do not take preventive action. For the 1993-94 tax year, the full basic or 'old age' state pension is Pounds 56.10 a week for a single person. To qualify for this rate, you must have paid Class 1 (employee) NICs for about 90 per cent of your working life (minimum 27 years). Class 2 (self-employed) and Class 3 (voluntary) NICs also count. If you have paid less than this, your pension will be reduced. The minimum state pension is 25 per cent of the full rate, and for this you need at least nine qualifying (full) years. Incomplete years do not count. Women who pay the reduced-rate NIC  - the 'married woman's stamp'  - do not build up a right to the state pension. However, both men and women who do not qualify can usually claim the spouse's pension under their husband's or wife's NIC record. The married couple's pension (single plus spouse's pension combined) currently is worth Pounds 89.80 a week. If you want to find out what your state pension will be  - and this will be particularly important for those planning to retire early  - the Department of Social Security (DSS) operates a 'pensions forecast' service *, which provides a detailed breakdown of your entitlement. If you give up work early, or have previous contribution gaps, you should find out whether you can pay voluntary NICs to protect your pension. Men aged 60 or over, in retirement and earning less than Pounds 2,800 a year, and therefore not liable to pay NICs, should receive NI credits up to age 65. Your local DSS office will advise on these points. Early retirers should note that the state pension is not paid until they reach 65 (men) or 60 (women). The spouse's pension is not paid until the main claimant reaches pension age. Some company schemes make good this pension shortfall  - such a 'bridging pension' is usually equivalent to the single state pension, and paid from the date of retirement until state pension age. In addition to the basic state pension, there is an earnings-related pension known as Serps (State earnings-related pension scheme), which was set up in 1978. Employees who have spent part or all of their career with companies that do not offer a 'contracted out' occupational scheme automatically would have paid in to Serps through their NICs. Unlike the basic state pension, a right to Serps builds up from day one. The total value, however, will again depend on the contribution period, and these details will be given in your DSS pension forecast. Serps is also paid from age 60 for women and age 65 for men. If you worked between 1961 and 1975, you may also qualify for a graduated retirement benefit. * For a pension forecast, ask at your local DSS office for form BR 19. Each forecast takes between three and six weeks to process, longer if you are widowed or divorced. The DSS publishes several useful leaflets. Ask for 'A guide to retirement pensions' (NP46), 'Retiring' (FB6) and 'NI voluntary contributions' (NI42). There is also a free telephone advice service: ask for Freeline Social Security on 0800 666555.</p>

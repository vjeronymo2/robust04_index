			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEVENS IS INJURED IN DEL MAR SPILL  </P> <P> Gary Stevens was thrown from his mount in the third race Friday and suffered a  broken right wrist and cuts on his face that required stitches. He will be out  for at least a month, agent Ray Kravagna said.  </P> <P> Stevens was scheduled to ride Winning Colors today in the $100,000 Maskette  Stakes at Belmont and On the Line in the $200,000 Budweiser Breeders' Cup  Sunday at Del Mar.  </P> <P> The accident occurred when Stevens' horse, Bin of Ice, ran into the inside rail  midway through the stretch. The horse attempted to jump the plastic rail but  could not clear it, causing the rail to splinter. Trainer Craig Lewis said his  horse "was pretty cut up and took a lot of stitches."  </P> <P> Stevens spent the night at Scripps Hospital in La Jolla and was due to undergo  surgery for his broken wrist.

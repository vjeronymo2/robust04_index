			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben and Gay Bekhor] </F>   [Excerpt] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will  meet today twice with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and will hear  from him the details of the "peace package" Israel is offering  Syria. Christopher leaves for Damascus tomorrow to present the  Israeli proposal to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad.    The following are the components of the peace package: an  Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights; setting up of full  peace and full relations; security arrangements on the Golan;  implementation of the arrangements in stages over several years;  an exchange of ambassadors between Damascus and Jerusalem after  the initial withdrawal stage. Israel will suggest to Syria to  start deliberations in joint working groups on the details of  the arrangement.    The package that will be handed over to Christopher will not  detail the withdrawal line and will focus on Israel's security  needs within the framework of the arrangement with Syria on the  Golan, and in a parallel agreement to be signed with the United  States, which will pledge to strengthen Israel. In his talks  with Christopher, the prime minister will request that the  Israeli-U.S. agreement will accord Israel security guarantees  and will assure maintaining current aid levels, as well as the  supply of advanced weaponry and intelligence information from  satellites to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. The defense  establishment is at present working on the list of requests to  be made to the Americans.    The package to be presented to Christopher will include the  principles of each of the components of the arrangement. The  security arrangement will include deep demilitarization of the  Syrian side and less deep demilitarization by Israel, thinning  out of forces on both sides, the setting up of early warning  stations on the Golan, and deployment of an international force  on the plateau to supervise the arrangement.    Rabin will also reiterate his call to al-Asad to take public  steps to assist in legitimizing the agreement among the Israeli  public.    Israel expects progress in the arrangement with Syria to  bring about simultaneous progress in the peace process with  Jordan, Lebanon, and the other Arab states, except for Iraq,  Iran, and Libya.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- A Bank of Japan [BOJ]  source said Thursday [17 February] the central bank is ready to  show its determination to prevent the yen from rising sharply.  The source made the remarks shortly after the U.S. Commerce  Department released 1993 and December trade figures.    The department said the United States had a record  merchandise trade deficit of 59.3 billion dollars in 1993 with  Japan, while its deficit in December shrank to 5.30 billion  dollars from 5.72 billion dollars in November.    "The December trade deficit figure was smaller than  expected," the source said on condition of anonymity, noting the  improvement reflects a steady recovery of U.S. competitiveness.</p>

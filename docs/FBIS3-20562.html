In sharp  contrast, there have been endless fiscal problems in China in  the same period, including a mounting budget deficit that came  back year after year. A heated debate revolving around the  budget deficit is now underway in the theoretical circles and in  the functional departments from a variety of perspectives. This  article focuses on government budget deficits in the seven years  (abbreviated hereafter as the last seven years) between 1986 and  1992 (including those in the Seventh Five-Year Plan).    1. Characteristics of Budget Deficits    The Chinese Government ran a budget deficit every year in  the  14 years between 1979 and 1992 with the exception of 1985, when  it reported a tiny surplus as a result of one-time factors,  accumulating a combined deficit of 130 billion yuan, or 10  billion yuan annually on the average. If debt incomes are  discounted, China's budget was in the red every year for the  past 14 years, with a combined deficit of 400 billion yuan, more  than 30 billion yuan each year on the average. See table below  for details.    By halving the 14-year period, we see that budget deficits  of  the last seven years had the following characteristics:    1) The deficits increased persistently all round.    Regardless of whether the narrow or broad definition is  used,  China ran a budget deficit in each of the last seven years. (See  table below.) Under the narrow definition, the accumulated  deficit shot up to 336,559,000,000 yuan, 3.7 times that of the  first seven years.

Source: "China Statistical Yearbook," 1991, JINGJI RIBAO 6 April 1992.   2. Difference between revenue and expenditures = gross revenue - gross expenditures.   3. Net difference between revenue and expenditures = gross revenue -debt incomes - gross expenditures      Not only did the government deficits for the last seven  years  show a sustained increase, but they were present in the entire  process. Earlier, the government drew up a balanced budget only  to see it dip into the red during the execution and  policy-making stages. Later, it started out with an unbalanced  budget, so the deficit was there from the beginning and remained  there through the execution and policy-making stages. This is  clear from the government's 1992 budget, where gross incomes  were listed as 391,213,000,000 yuan and gross expenditures,  411,939,000,000 yuan, yielding a deficit of 20,786,000,000 yuan  (as published). This kind of persistent, all-round, and  process-long deficits portend a deteriorating fiscal state for  the nation.    2) Coexistence between printing money and issuing bonds to  close the budget deficit    Basically there are two well-established ways to close a  budget deficit: one, issue treasury bonds at home and overseas  to raise funds, and, two, print money. Recurrent expenditures in  the last seven years amounted to 1,883,433,000 yuan in all,  while expenditures totalled a whopping 2,189,922,000 yuan,  resulting in a shortfall of 306,489,000,000 yuan. The issue of  bonds at home and abroad raised 217,827,000,000 yuan, still  leaving a gap of 88,662,000,000 yuan. This left the government  no choice but to print money to balance the budget. As a result,  the deficits of the last seven years had a duality to them: both  the issue of bonds and money-printing were used to close the  budget gap.    3) Coexistence between economic growth and rising government  deficits    The Chinese economy enjoyed fast and sustained growth in the  last seven years, with the GNP expanding at the average annual  rate of 10.94 percent each year. See table below for  year-by-year GNP data.    Table 2. GNP 1986-1992 (unit: in billions of yuan)   Item/Year    1986      1987      1988        1989        1990        1991        1992   GNP          969.63    113.01    1,401.82    1,591.63    1,768.61    1,892.41    2,005.95      Be that as it may, there was not the slightest improvement  in  the government's fiscal plight. On the contrary, the deficit  rose 16.7 percent annually on the average based on the narrow  definition and 25.1 percent using the broad definition. The  deficit outpaced economic growth by 7 to 15 percentage points  annually on the average. Thus, the last seven years were  characterized by the coexistence between fast economic growth  and a deficit rising just as fast. In fact, what distinguishes  the last seven years is the fact that budget deficits increased  at a rate higher than the economy. This is the sign of a  worsening fiscal situation. The average annual growth rate of  the GNP exceeded 10 percent in the first seven years also, yet  the budget deficit fell 15 percent annually. We had the best of  both economic worlds then: economic growth and a shrinking  budget deficit.    4) Coexistence between a budget deficit at the central level  and local budget deficits    The nation was in a fiscal bind in the last seven years,  running a deficit year in, year out. The fiscal difficulties  were common to local governments as well as the central  government: Both were in the red in just about every year. Table  3 gives a detailed picture of the coexistence of budget deficits  at the two levels, national and local.    Table 3: Budget Deficits at Central and Local Levels 1986-1992 (unit: in  billions of yuan)   Item/Year    1986     1987      1988     1989     1990      1991      1992   Combined     -7.05    -7.96     -7.86    -9.23    -13.96    -21.11    -23.75  National  Deficit   Central      -4.55    -12.66    -1.49    +0.03    -0.49     -18.07    -20.64  deficit   Local        -2.50    +4.70     -6.37    -9.26    -13.47    -3.04     -3.11  deficit      While the budget deficit of the central government rose 24.1  percent each year on the average, the budget gap at the local  level expanded 3.1 percent. In contrast, there was no such  coexistence in the first seven years, particularly during the  Sixth Five-Year Plan. Although the central treasury was unable  to balance its books in those years, local governments ended  each year with a surplus. That both national and local  governments are now drowning in a sea of red ink testifies to  the accelerating deterioration of our fiscal position.    2. Causes of Budget Deficits in Successive Years    Budget deficits were caused by a host of factors, some  external to public finance, some having to do with public  finance itself.    1) A broad decline in profitability    Measured by whatever indicator--gross social output value,  GNP, or national income, the Chinese economy grew by more than  10 percent annually during the last seven years. In real prices,  the gross social output value rose 14.8 percent each year on the  average; gross industrial output value, 12.8 percent; and  national income, 12.9 percent. But robust economic growth has  not been accompanied by an equally brisk increase in government  revenue. Take the profit and tax to investment ratio, for  instance, which is directly related to how much the government  collects in revenue. The profit and tax to investment ratio has  been declining in successive years. For enterprises owned by the  whole people, the profit and tax to investment ratio dropped  from 20.7 percent in 1986 to 12.4 percent in 1990, a decline of  8.3 percentage points. Calculations show that because of the  fall in the profit and tax to investment ratio, the treasury  collected a total of 125 billion yuan less in taxes and profits  in the Seventh Five-Year Plan, a drop of 25 billion yuan each  year. By 1992, the ratio had slipped to just 10.11 percent for  industry nationwide, a 100 percent decline. This shows that  economic growth in China came at a high cost; the growth was  fast but low in profit, thus driving down the profit and tax to  investment ratio year after year. The plunge in profitability  lies at the heart of the string of budget deficits over the  years.    2) The decline of government revenue as a share of GNP    What the government collects as revenue makes up part of the  added value created in all sectors of the national economy that  finds its way into the hands of the government through  distribution and redistribution. Revenue originates in the third  phase of industrialization. Given a particular set of  circumstances, changes in the size of government revenue as a  share of GNP should be in direct proportion to changes in the  magnitude of the revenue; the higher the percentage, the greater  the revenue, and vice versa. The size of the revenue relative to  the GNP plays a critical role in the formation, changes, and  development of the deficit. Government revenue accounted for  more than 20 percent of the GNP every year during the first  seven years. Since 1987, however, the share has been declining,  down to 16 percent in 1988-1991 and a mere 15.5 percent in 1992.  In developed Western countries, government revenue typically  constitutes over 40 percent of the GNP, and in Asia's four  mini-dragons, over 25 percent. China was off by 25 percentage  points compared to the former and 10 percentage points compared  to the latter. When the percentage is too low, government  revenue inevitably shrinks and any increase will be slow in  coming. This is a major cause of China's budget deficits.    3) The heavy burden of government subsidies    In the last seven years the treasury shelled out 333.8  billion yuan in all to subsidize money-losing enterprises and  another 233 billion yuan in price subsidies. Total price tag:  566.8 billion yuan, far in excess of the sum of budget deficits  for the same period. While this shows that public finance in  China is people-oriented and production construction-driven, it  also leaves absolutely no doubt that the onerous burden of  government financial subsidies is an extremely important  explanation of China's fiscal woes, including the budget  deficits it has been piling up many years in a row.    4) Government revenue losses a severe problem    The massive amount of revenue that has been lost,  particularly as a result of tax evasion, is another major cause  of China's fiscal difficulties and budget deficits in the last  seven years. Because of flagrant tax evasion, a substantial  amount of revenue that should have gone into the national  coffers was simply lost for nothing. Reportedly, the tax evasion  rate is 10 percent in developed nations and 20 percent or so in  developing countries. There are no reliable statistics on China,  but a number of existing studies does give us a glimpse of the  dimensions of tax evasion and tax underpayment in China.  According to a survey by the Xiangtan tax bureau in Hunan, 44.2  percent and 32.3 percent of individual industrial and commercial  households practiced tax evasion in 1988 and 1990, respectively.  In 1988, only 3 billion yuan or so were collected in revenue  from individuals. In 1989, following the nation's first personal  tax general inspection, the figure shot up to 13.2 billion yuan.  The increase continued in 1990, hitting 14.5 billion yuan. Be  that as it may, insiders believe that the government is  collecting at most half of what is owed the treasury in taxes.  Every inspection, so said a tax official from the Chaoyang  district in Beijing, shows that at least 90 percent of the state  enterprises and collective enterprises had some tax problems,  large or small. Thus tax underpayment and tax evasion have  become a chronic problem in tax collection--a big budget buster.    5) Budgetary discipline softening and spending getting out  of  control    Some of the causes of fiscal difficulties can be found at  the  revenue end, others at the spending end. At the spending end, a  striking problem is softening budgetary discipline and the loss  of control over spending. This manifests itself not only in the  way the scale of capital construction was widened without  authorization, including the reckless proliferation of  nonproductive projects, buildings, hotels, etc., but also in the  multiplication and over-staffing of government organs at all  levels. Turning to the number of people on the public payroll,  the wages of 15 million people came out of the nation's budgets  in 1979. By late 1991, the number had risen to almost 40  million, a 267 percent increase over 1979. In 1980,  administrative costs nationwide amounted to 40.4 billion yuan.  By 1991, it was 140 billion yuan, up 347 percent compared to  1980. Some localities waste national funds wantonly, causing  severe fiscal difficulties.    6) Explosion of off-budget funds    There is a finite amount of funds at the disposal of the  treasury at any given point in time. Budget funds and off-budget  funds are related to each other and money can be shifted from  one to the other. Under normal circumstances, off-budget funds  should be lower than budget funds in terms of both the absolute  increase and the growth rate. Just the opposite happened in the  last seven years. Off-budget funds soared. Take the 1986-1989  period, for instance. While budget funds rose a mere 5.86  percent annually on the average, off-budget funds expanded  rapidly at the average annual rate of 11.22 percent, double that  of budget funds. Absolutely speaking, there were almost as much  off-budget funds as there are budget funds. As more treasury  funds were shifted outside the budget, the amount that remained  inevitably diminished. This is another important reason why the  state became strapped for funds and could not balance its budget.    3. The Nature of Budget Deficits    For 14 years the Chinese Government ran a deficit in its  budget year after year, but the nature of the deficit changed  over time. At the beginning the policy was to "balance revenue  with expenditures and come up with a little surplus." The  government started out by drawing up a balanced budget, not a  deficit budget. However, the subjective did not coincide with  the objective in the course of implementation, that is,  projected revenues did not materialize while expenditures  exceeded what was planned. The result: a deficit, an unforeseen  deficit that occurred because the projected balance was upset by  new factors. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, there was a  gradual erosion of public appreciation for the fiscal policy of  "balancing revenue with expenditures and coming up with a little  surplus," while the inconsistency between the finite nature of  revenue and the infinite nature of spending was over-emphasized.  Prompted by a desire for instant gain and dismissing deficits as  harmless, we relaxed the spending restraint in executing the  budget and increased expenditures as we pleased. Revenue and  expenditures thus went out of balance and a deficit ensued, an  artificial kind of deficit that resulted from conscious  decisions. As the Seventh Five-Year Plan went underway, the  policy of "balancing revenue with expenditures and coming up  with a small surplus" fell by the wayside, the prevailing idea  then being that "it is alright to run a deficit." Under the new  policy, the deficit was made part and parcel of the entire  budgetary process, from its preparation to its implementation.  It was used to close the gap created by the excess of  expenditures over revenue, to expand the scale of construction,  and to run and develop the economy and all sorts of  undertakings. In essence, what we had was a deficit policy; what  we practiced was deficit economics.    4. Closing Budget Deficits: Major Strategies    To overcome our fiscal difficulties and eliminate the budget  deficit, the most basic solution is to raise the level of  profitability of the entire national economy substantially  during the third phase of industrialization, effectively ending  the situation in recent years when the economy was locked in  fast but unprofitable growth. Certainly, raising the level of  profitability is an extremely arduous piece of systems  engineering, absolutely not something that can be tackled by the  Ministry of Finance alone. But this does not mean that finance  agencies should sit by idly and do nothing. On the contrary,  they must play an active part to push the enterprise along. This  article focuses on ways of resolving the fiscal difficulties and  eliminating the budget deficit primarily from the perspective of  finance agencies. These are some of the more important steps  that can be taken:    1) Clearly define a guiding philosophy for public finance    For years after the PRC was founded, it had always been the  philosophy of public finance in China to "do what one is capable  of, balance revenue with expenditures, and come up with a small  surplus." As reform and the open policy went into full swing and  hampered by the decline in profitability, the gap between  revenue and expenditures widened by the day. In recent years a  heated discussion has been underway revolving around the  question of whether deficit budgeting is any way to close the  gap. At the heart of the discussion is this: Are deficits good  or bad? Pedantic arguments and counter-arguments continue to  fly back and forth, with no conclusion in sight. In essence,  however, the controversy is really over whether our public  finance philosophy needs to be reformed.    Take a look around the world today. All countries that  follow  a deficit economic policy, whether capitalist or socialist, now  find themselves in a bind: saddled with debts and a string of  budget deficits and caught in economic turmoil and relentless  inflation. Rare is the country which manages to break this  cycle. Even the United States, the paramount capitalist  superpower, has finally seen the light after tasting to the full  the bitter fruits of deficit budgeting for years. As soon as he  assumed office, President Clinton started pushing for an end to  the deficit and has taken a number of practical steps to trim  the deficit. As for the developing nations that have adopted  deficit budgeting, the vast majority of them are being plagued  by inflation and staggering under a mountain of debts that will  never be paid off in full, their economies in worse shape than  ever. What China has been following in recent years is actually  a deficit economic policy. Although the policy has not yet  resulted in economic disruptions of disastrous proportions, the  skyrocketing inflation of 1989 and the subsequent drive to  improve the economic climate and rectify the economic order are  clear signals. They also mirror the "time release" effects of  deficit budgeting. As the peak period of debt repayment looms on  the horizon, China has gotten to the stage where it must take  out new loans to pay off old ones. In 1992 debt incomes  accounted for 20 percent of gross revenue for that year. In the  same year, however, debt expenditures amounted to 54 percent of  debt incomes. This is something to be taken note of. In price  reform, the two tracks are beginning to merge and full-fledged  price decontrol is now under way. The prices of certain capital  goods and articles of daily use are rising rapidly. Some  signals, such as the depreciation of the renminbi against the  dollar, are all raising the inflationary expectations of  consumers (and producers too) to various extents. We are now at  a turning point where consumers expect change; people are  anticipating a new round of inflation. Accordingly, the  prolonged and widespread existence of budget deficits, whether  covered by borrowing or the issue of more money, is harmful.  Only by adhering to the fiscal philosophy of "do what one is  capable of, balance revenue with expenditures, and come up with  a small surplus" can we ensure that the economy and revenue grow  at the same pace.    2) Improve revenue collection management and supervision.    Revenue collection is the cornerstone of all public finance  operations. Thus far finance departments at all levels have done  an enormous amount of constructive work to strengthen collection  management and supervision. Their achievements must be  acknowledged. However, we also should see that tax underpayment,  tax evasion, and tax cheating continue on a large scale so that  the treasury cannot get hold of the funds it is entitled to and  ends up with reduced revenue. Had collection management been  tightened further, the national coffers would have been enriched  by 30 billion yuan, or 10 percent. Thus improving collection  management and supervision is a major tool to overcome fiscal  difficulties and erase the deficit. Since taxes make up over 80  percent of government revenue, we should concentrate on beefing  up tax collection and supervision. Besides improving existing  methods of proven effectiveness, we should study extensively the  effective measures that other countries, particularly developed  nations, have adopted to strengthen tax collection management  and supervision and combat tax evasion, modifying for  application in China those that are scientific and suited to  China's conditions in order to further improve and strengthen  its tax collection and supervision system. As for measures now  in use which are known to be effective, such as the annual tax  general inspection, they should be continued steadfastly and  improved further. Penalties and punishments should be made more  severe to prevent continuous revenue losses and deter new tax  underpayment and evasion effectively. These days tax offenders  are fined and ordered to pay back what they owe the government  in taxes. But then they would turn around and continue their tax  evasion until they face yet another round of the same penalties.  We must break that vicious cycle. Serious blatant tax evaders  must be dealt with in accordance with the law and punished  harshly. In addition, these days localities cut or waive taxes  and call them preferential policies. The upshot is that tax  revenues are fragmented and funds that should have flowed into  the national coffers are misused or siphoned off into other  channels. We must take pains to stop these trends.    3) Tap new revenue sources ceaselessly.    The third step finance departments can take to overcome  fiscal difficulties and eliminate the deficits is to pay  attention to tap new revenue sources in a timely fashion based  on the latest progress on the reform and open policy front. In  this respect Guangdong has broken much new ground profitably and  achieved a lot of gratifying results. Its experience should be  disseminated. In 1992 Guangdong sold off 7,010 hectares of land,  earning 9.4 billion yuan (including urban infrastructural  matching fees), equivalent to 44.8 percent of the provincial  government's total revenue for the year. In many prefectures and  municipalities, land-derived incomes are approaching or have  exceeded what the local jurisdiction collects in revenue and  have been dubbed the "second treasury." It is a foregone  conclusion that land, a state property, will enter the market  extensively as a special commodity as reform and the open policy  are furthered steadily and a socialist market economy gradually  takes shape and develops. Logically speaking, incomes derived  from the auction of land use rights based on land prices should  go to the Ministry of Finance, At present, however, the  government is losing such incomes on a substantial scale as they  end up in the hands of some collectives, groups, or individuals.  Land transactions are highly profitable, which explains why land  speculation has become such a major problem today, with a  handful of people reaping a windfall at the expense of the  state. In conjunction with other interested national agencies,  finance departments should immediately work out laws and  regulations to lay down clearly the taxes payable by people  involved in land transactions as well as their legitimate  profits. They should waste no time in conducting a comprehensive  and thorough audit and firmly recover all illegal profits to  benefit the national coffers. Moreover, finance departments at  all levels should be required to devote manpower to study and  identify new revenue sources without cessation. The real estate  market, stock exchanges, high-tech market, and other markets are  all new revenue sources that must not be overlooked. Tapping  these new sources will go a long way toward easing our fiscal  plight.    4) Strictly limit and gradually reduce miscellaneous  government subsidies.    Miscellaneous subsidies cost the Ministry of Finance 570  billion yuan in lost revenue and increased expenditures in the  last seven years, averaging over 80 billion yuan a year. For  this reason, we must take stock of every kind of government  subsidies most carefully. The last thing we should do is to  impose a single policy across the board. With the exception of  subsidies to offset policy-induced losses, which should be  retained, we must require all other operating losses to be  turned into surpluses within one to two years, after which  subsidies would be cut off. Public finance in China, we must  insist, should be production-based public finance, not  welfare-oriented public finance. No longer should the treasury  continue to spend vast sums of money to salvage from the bottom  of the sea of the socialist market economy those enterprises  that prefer surviving long-term on state hand-outs to struggling  on their own to turn business losses into profits. To do so  would violate the law of the market--survival of the  fittest--and be counter-productive. Turning to price subsidies,  price subsidies for agricultural capital goods and protective  procurement price subsidies for agricultural products should be  retained. As the government moves to decontrol prices gradually,  other price subsidies, such as those for articles of daily use,  should be abolished. Instead, the treasury should offer  subsidies only to those households below a predetermined income  level. Under the current system, everybody, from 10,000-yuan  households to 100-yuan households, collects subsidies. That  practice should be brought to an end. If only government  subsidies are cut 10 percent a year, the treasury would be able  to trim spending or increase revenue by 8 billion yuan. This is  something that must be taken seriously.    5) Strictly rein in all sorts of nonproduction expenditures  and tighten budgetary discipline.    Besides revenue-enhancing efforts, an extremely vital step  to  eliminate fiscal difficulties is to strictly rein in all sorts  of nonproduction expenditures. In 1991 China spent 34.78 billion  yuan in administrative costs, a 610 percent increase over 1978.  It has been calculated that by halving the public payroll, the  central government can save about 60 billion yuan a year.  Purchases by social groups nationwide reached 41.38 billion yuan  in the first half of 1991, a gain of 17.9 percent over the  corresponding period a year ago. The health care bill footed by  the treasury in 1990 exceeded 10 billion yuan. When it comes to  these and similar massive nonproduction expenses, we must  stiffen budgetary discipline and strictly prohibit  over-spending. Finance departments at all levels must stick to  the spending level in the budget, firmly refusing to pay any  overspent amount. Furthermore, the squandering of state funds on  any pretext must be proscribed by formal decree. There is a new,  unhealthy trend in the special economic zones, Hong Kong and  Macao: using public funds to throw "10,000-yuan banquets" and  pay for "1,000-yuan simple meals" just to show off one's wealth.  Another fad rapidly gaining popularity is to make study trips  abroad at public expense, gobbling up wealth the workers create  through hard labor. A one-month study mission to the United  States costs the government over 70,000 yuan per person. These  days even perennially under-funded elementary and secondary  schools have been lining up to send study missions overseas  bearing all sorts of names. These trends should be checked  without delay. By tightening budgetary discipline, we can avoid  over-spending.    6) Make the most of and strengthen auditing and supervision.    As reform and the open policy quicken their pace, some units  and individuals have resorted to a variety of illegal ploys to  participate in economic activities and misappropriate government  properties and funds, thus siphoning off public assets into  private hands and making a fortune at public expense. This is  particularly true of the upstarts who reaped a windfall from the  third round of industrialization. Now they lead a life of  decadent luxury every day, spending money like water. It is  imperative, therefore, that we scrutinize our financial and  economic law and discipline and conduct an audit on the assets  of every upstart. Illicit incomes should be recovered and the  economic climate must be purified. We must create a normal  economic order consistent with a socialist market economy,  protect state properties, and encourage people to get rich  legally.    In short, China was plagued by fiscal problems and ran a  budget deficit year after year in the seven years between 1986  and 1992, the outcome of a broad decline in profitability and a  deficit economic policy. The only way to end this plight and  push ahead with the development of a socialist market economy is  to look back in earnest and work out practical and feasible  strategies.</p>

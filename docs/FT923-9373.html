			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Pacer halves to Dollars 320,000 at midway Pacer Systems, the US-based electronics and aerospace company quoted on the USM in London, reported a 50 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Dollars 320,000 (Pounds 168,000) for the six months to June 30. Sales rose 4 per cent to Dollars 14.5m. Mr Jack Rennie, chairman, said profits had been depressed by higher-than-normal marketing and proposal costs. The group currently had proposals out for about Dollars 90m-worth of business, he said. Some of this would begin to feed through in the second half. The dearth of proposals resulted in a 5 per cent drop in the order book to Dollars 55m. Earnings per share fell from 7 cents to 4 cents. The dividend was maintained at 3 cents. Mr Rennie and other directors together hold about 50 per cent of the shares.</p>

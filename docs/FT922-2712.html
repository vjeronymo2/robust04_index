			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Pounds 100m pledged to global fund for environment BRITAIN IS to earmark Pounds 100m of new money for environmental spending over a number of years to help replenish the Global Environment Facility, Mr John Major, the prime minister, told the Commons yesterday. He admitted, however, that the timescale over which the money would be made available was indefinite and depended on when the fund - which is used by the World Bank and the United Nations to help third world countries to finance environmentally friendly projects - required it. Reporting back on his return from the Earth Summit in Rio, Mr Major said it was a 'milestone' while acknowledging that the results had not gone 'as far as some would wish'. He said that Britain itself could have 'gone further' on climate change than the convention provides. Without the intervention of his ministerial colleagues, however, 'there might not have been a climate convention to sign'. He said he had written to other EC heads of government and the G7 leading industrial nations proposing an 'action plan' to carry forward commitments made at Rio. On broader subjects, he said he hoped that other G7 nations would adopt the Trinidad terms on third world debt by the end of this year, and claimed that agreement in the current General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks was nearer 'than anyone realises or anyone imagined just a few weeks ago'. He said he wanted to see the talks reach a conclusion by the end of this month, 'beyond which I think we run into timetabling troubles with the US presidential election'. Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour deputy leader, urged Mr Major to exploit Britain's 'special relationship' with the US to persuade president George Bush to sign the biodiversity agreement on protecting rare plants and animals.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (18): Discussions focus on price - Profile: The Gaymer Group NEGOTIATING a sale price with a vendor who is potentially your biggest customer is no easy task. It is no surprise, therefore, that Candover Investments' buy-out of Vine Products and Whiteways, Showerings and Warninks, the UK wines, spirits and soft drinks suppliers, from Allied-Lyons required lengthy discussions. 'It meant making sure you could see their point of view and where possible, within reason, trying to accommodate it. And hopefully they were doing the same for us,' says Mr Stephen Curran of Candover Investments, which backed the management team led by Mr John Wilkinson. Negotiations opened in July 1991 but the deal was not signed until February 1992. Mr Curran says: 'We were in a series of protracted negotiations. 'Price was the main sticking point, but our investigations took time too.' VPW, Showerings and Warninks businesses produce and market a wide range of alcoholic drinks, including Gaymer's Olde English, Copperhead and Babycham. The new company will be named The Gaymer Group Europe and Mr Mike Dowdall, previously a main board director of Unilever, has been appointed chairman. VPW and Showerings are based mainly near Bristol and also at Shepton Mallet, Somerset. Warninks' main facility is in Holland. The combined companies have 1,300 employees. In the 12 months to February 1991, combined turnover of the three companies was Pounds 178m with profit before interest and tax of Pounds 23m. The picture for this year is confused by a change of year end. Mr Curran believes profits will be lower but that the new company is doing at least a well as was predicted when the deal was struck. It was Allied-Lyons who took its time at first. It had to evaluate all offers and only settled on the managers at the beginning of December. Candover believes this is because their offer was for both companies. Candover was attracted to the buy-out because of the strength of the management team: 'They appeared competent, hardworking, skilled and sensitive. They worked together, knew their business and they were clearly keen to do the buy-out,' says Mr Curran. He says the team's energetic enthusiasm for the deal showed they recognised that a buy-out demands a great deal of time as well as an opportunity. Negotiations - suspended during the Christmas period - initially centred on price: 'Allied-Lyons wanted between Pounds 150m and Pounds 160m but we settled on Pounds 140m in the end,' says Mr Curran. Allied-Lyons received Pounds 115m in cash and Pounds 25m in vendor loans. Equity for the buy-out is being provided by institutions investing through the Candover 1989 Fund, and CINVen, Legal &amp; General Ventures and Advent International. Bank term debt of Pounds 33m and working capital facilities of up to Pounds 35m are being arranged through Barclays Bank and National Westminster Bank and co-lead underwritten by Barclays, NatWest and Bank of Scotland. Mezzanine finance of Pounds 15m is being provided by Mithras Investment Trust and Legal &amp; General Ventures. These borrowings are necessary since the company tends to produce stock in the summer which is mainly sold over the Christmas and New Year period. Once the price was agreed Candover had to conduct a thorough investigation of the company. 'We had to make sure the sales organisations would blend well together, find out whether there were any potential economies of scale in manufacture and ensure that the arrangements with the vendor who is our best customer were satisfactory to both parties,' Mr Curran says. 'Overall the investigations revealed that the company had been doing well, but recently not quite so well. We had to satisfy ourselves that dip in profits was a temporary one.' Candover also had to satisfy its own board of directors that it was worth investing in some of the lesser known brands such as Camelot (a form of perry), Festival Vat (a cider) and Zapple (a speciality drink). The Gaymer Group Europe's branded portfolio is targeted at the C1, C2 and D socio-economic groups. Mr Wilkinson, managing director of the new company, admits some of the brands have not had top priority in recent years: 'We have launched the Gaymer Group Europe this year in a major marketing initiative. We are confident that the planned investment in the brands, plant and people will create a highly competitive, independent European drinks group.'</p>

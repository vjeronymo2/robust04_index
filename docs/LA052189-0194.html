			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: PATRIOTS THE MEN WHO STARTED THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION BY  A.J. LANGGUTH (TOUCHSTONE/SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: $10.95)  </P> <P> This history of the American Revolution focuses on the great men and decisive  acts that are part of our national mythology. The author undertakes to make the  historical figures appear human, neither glorifying heroes nor dismissing  traitors. His conversational style and simple presentation bring the issues  alive. Of John Adams, he writes: "When the debate over the Articles of  Confederation moved from committee to the floor of the Congress, John Adams  joined those delegates who assailed Dickinson's one-state, one-vote provision.  Now that his hard work had brought him wealth and eminence, he couldn't agree  that property should count for nothing." Although the breadth of material may  lead some to dismiss the book as superficial, Langguth has produced a history  exciting enough to interest teenagers and a treatment of the idea of heroism  serious enough to engage history buffs. "For those who have decried the  mushification of American history," wrote Jody Powell in his review of  "Patriots" in these pages, "A. J. Langguth has provided a spicy, toothsome  respite."  </P></p>

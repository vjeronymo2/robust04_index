			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I. S. Nekrasov, V. N. Prokopov, Kursk </F> Polytechnical Institute; UDC 621.391.82]    [Abstract] A system for autocorrelation processing of  random pulsed signals is examined, and its fundamental  probability characteristic is obtained. It is demonstrated that  if some limited a priory information on the structure of random  pulsed input signals is available, the estimates of their  initial periods can be obtained by applying autocorrelation  processing, while a high level of noise rejection of mutual  interferences is provided. A block diagram of the system  containing n parallel connected processing channels is provided,  and the probabilities of correct determination of the channel  number, probabilities of the signal transmission, and of false  alarm were analyzed. The following conclusions were formulated:  for a specified ratio f[.sub]i+1[/]/f[.sub]i[/] there  exists an optimal threshold value K, where the probability  P[.sub]i[/] of correct determination of the channel number is  maximum, and the probability P[.sub]false alarm[/] is  minimum; with increased ratio f[.sub]i+1[/]/f[.sub]i[/],  when K is specified, the probability P[.sub]false alarm[/] is  reduced; the increased ratio f[.sub]i+1[/]/f[.sub]i[/] may  lower the threshold K, and as a consequence, increase  P[.sub]i[/] for a specified P[.sub]false alarm[/].

			<p>BFN     [Text] The United States Embassy in Fiji has come under  fire for refusing to issue visas for 70 soccer fans who have  already paid travel packages to attend the world cup in Los  Angeles later this month. The Fiji Football Association, while  expressing disgust at the Embassy's refusal, said it would take  the matter up with the world soccer body, FIFA. The President  of the Fiji Football Association (?Chadendra Majaraj) said the  rejection was a bad reflection on the United States, which had  sought Fiji's support to host the world cup. A spokesman for  the American Embassy, Dennis (?Rowndes) said normal visitor  rules were applied when applications were screened. He said some  visas were approved while those which were not failed to show  strong intentions of returning to Fiji once the world cup was  over.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: Court rules on asbestos claims A BALTIMORE circuit court jury yesterday decided that three US companies - GAF, Keene Corp and Pittsburgh Corning - would have to pay up to 2 1/2 times their share of compensatory damages to three sample plaintiffs as the largest asbestos personal injury trial in the US draws to a close. The three companies, and the Porter Hayden Company, had already been found negligent either in making or installing asbestos-containing products at a time when the companies knew, or should have known, that the products were dangerous. In July, the jury ruled that these companies, and two others, must pay Dollars 11.2m in compensatory damages to three sample plaintiffs. No damages were awarded to three other plaintiffs, whose injuries were deemed to be unrelated to their asbestos exposure. Although the latest decision applies to only three plaintiffs, the formula will be used in a series of mini-trials for the remaining 8,549 plaintiffs in Maryland whose cases are scheduled to be heard in the autumn. In addition, the ruling is likely to have implications for the remaining 86,000 asbestos injury cases pending in the US. Yesterday, the jury decided that GAF should pay punitive damages of 2 1/2 times its share of compensatory damages. Keene Corp and Pittsburgh Corning, a joint venture between PPG Industries and Corning, must pay 1 1/2 times their share of compensatory damages. The jury became deadlocked over a formula for the fourth company, Porter-Hayden. Two other companies, AC&amp;S and MCIC, were excluded from punitive damages. The exact share of compensatory damages for each company has not yet been decided. In addition, attorneys for the companies have said they would challenge the jury's verdicts on the grounds that it was wrong to consolidate the cases.</p>

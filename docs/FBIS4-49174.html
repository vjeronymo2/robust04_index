			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by staff reporter He Liangliang (0149 </F> 0081 0081): "With Support From China, Create U.S.-Soviet  Equilibrium--Nixon, Mao Zedong Cooperate in Breaking Bipolar  World"]    [Text] Richard Nixon's strategic insight and practice have  rarely been seen in the contemporary world, but Nixon was also  the only person who was forced to step down from power for  violating the law of his own country, although he broke fresh  ground in U.S. diplomatic strategy. Nixon's impact on  international politics remains indelible, not because he was  involved in the "Watergate incident," but because he opened the  door to Sino-U.S relations. Nixon's trip to China in 1972 not  only changed international relations at that time, but also had  an impact on the global strategic pattern in the last three  decades of the 20th century, and even in the 21st century.  However, the wishful thinking of one side could not achieve  this purpose. In other words, if there had only been Nixon's  wish and if the Chinese leaders had not had the same intention,  there would not have been "a week which changed the world"  (Nixon's own words). The most developed capitalist country and  the most populous socialist country of the East shook hands, and  the event shocked the whole world and disrupted the bipolar  world marked by U.S.-Soviet confrontation arranged at Yalta.  The world was thus pushed to a multipolar pattern, and China  became an indispensable factor in international affairs. This  was the historical significance of Nixon's visit to China. On  the grand stage of history, Nixon and Mao Zedong played a  leading role together; Kissinger and Zhou Enlai also played an  important role.    Nixon mounted the political stage very early. He was first  elected as a representative in 1946, when he was only 23, and  was elected senator four years later. He was vice president in  the Eisenhower administration for seven years, and a member of  the power circle. During this period, he visited more than 50  countries, and accumulated a good deal of diplomatic experience.  In particular, he became famous for waging the so-called  "kitchen debate" with Khrushchev in 1958.    In 1968, Nixon was elected as the 37th president of the  United States. In the late 1960's, the economic strength of  Western Europe and Japan grew very fast, and the military  strength of the Soviet Union was even greater. The developing  countries also began to rise on the international stage. The  Sino-Soviet confrontation led to a split in the communist camp.  China possessed nuclear weapons, and its international  influence was increasing. Within the United States, the black  civil rights movement, the student anti-war campaign, the  women's movement, and the new left were in the ascendant and  formed the most powerful anti-establishment mass movement in the  contemporary history of the United States. There was also a  radical cultural trend signified by the appearance of hippies.  The U.S. economy in that period was bogged down in so- called  "stagflation," that is, high inflation and low growth appeared  at the same time. All of this caused a famous journalist, the  editor-in-chief of TIME, to conclude that "the `American  century' is on the decline."    When Nixon became the occupant of the White House, he faced  a  situation in which crises and opportunities existed side by  side. Tenacious by nature, he liked facing challenges. At that  time, the United States faced two diplomatic and strategic  difficulties. One was its involvement in the Vietnam war, and  the other was the expanding power of the Soviet Union. The  United States' involvement in the Vietnam war, like its  involvement in the Korean War, was aimed at checking a  nonexistent "Chinese threat," but the United States did not win  either of these wars. Although China's strength in those days  was much less impressive than it is today, China still  resolutely and indomitably resisted and withstood strong  external pressure. China did not yield to the United States,  nor did it yield to the Soviet Union. In the West, President De  Gaulle of France noticed this first, and France was the first  Western country to establish diplomatic relations with China [as  published]. In 1969, shortly after Nixon took office, he met  with De Gaulle. The French president told Nixon: "You had  better recognize China as soon as possible, and you should not  recognize China after it becomes strong." Nixon was deeply  impressed by this advice.    In August 1968, the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia, and  then provoked armed conflicts with China along the Xinjiang and  Heilongjiang frontiers. The world's attention was drawn to the  Soviet Union's expansion and hegemonism. After studying the new  trend, Nixon found that Soviet threats against China showed that  the Soviet Union had become more aggressive. If the Soviet  Union carried out "surgical operations" against China, that is,  launched a preemptive nuclear strike against China, then the  global balance would be upset, and this would endanger U.S.  interests. In his memoirs, Kissinger mentioned Nixon's  strategic change and said: This was a "revolutionary theory" and  an "important event in the foreign policy of the United States,"  because "a President of the United States had announced that the  survival of a major communist country was of strategic  significance for us."    The above-mentioned factors show that Nixon had changed U.S.  China policy due to many considerations, but the most important  consideration was the long-term national interests of the United  States. That is, he tried to use the strength of China to keep  a balance between the United States and the Soviet Union.  However, the move also objectively raised China's reputation in  the international community. In particular, China was still  embroiled in the unusual "Cultural Revolution" period. This  event also created favorable conditions for China's later  opening.    The "Cultural Revolution" was a major mistake committed by  Mao Zedong in his later years, but this does not mean that Mao  did not make any major contributions to the country in his later  years. He promoted the development of Sino-U.S. relations, and  this marks a great feat of his in the diplomatic field. His  meeting with Nixon was one of the most important and impressive  diplomatic events of this century. The meeting marked the  climax of Nixon's epoch-making visit to China, and made the  seven-day visit "a week that changed the world."    Mao Zedong only made two trips overseas in his life, and  both  were visits to the Soviet Union. However, he was not unaware of  the outside world. Modern technology allows people to know all  about the world without going out of their homes. Mao was a  statesman and a military commander, but he was also a great  strategist. He had the talent to devise strategies which  assured victory a thousand miles away while he sat in his  command tent. He commanded battles against the United States  during the Korean war, the Jinmen bombardment, and the Vietnam  war. He also said that "U.S. imperialism is only a paper  tiger." He was a master of dialectics, and he never looked at  things from a rigid or inflexible point of view. Mao had strong  interest in the revolutionary history, politics, and economy of  the United States. In late 1970, while talking with his old  friend, Edgar Snow, Mao again mentioned the U.S. federal system,  and he also mentioned Washington and Jefferson. Then, he talked  about the ongoing Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks in Warsaw. Mao  said: "I am not interested in such talks any more. Nixon also  has no interest. There should be face-to-face talks between  us." "If he wants to visit Beijing, you may bring a message to  him and tell him that he can come quietly in private. He may do  this just by getting on an airplane. He may come as a tourist  or in his capacity as President. I do not think that I will  quarrel with him, but I may still criticize him somewhat."    Snow indeed brought this message to the White House. After  that, with Mao Zedong's personal approval and Zhou Enlai's  concrete arrangements, the U.S. ping-pong team visited China,  and the small ball eventually moved the globe. The American  athletes entered China on 10 April 1971 via Hong Kong, Lo Wu,  and Guangzhou, and then flew to Beijing. Three months later,  Kissinger made his secret visit to Beijing.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Chae Hui-muk] </F>   [Text] U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown has sent a  letter to his Korean counterpart Kim Chol-su, asking for help in  a lawsuit involving the top managers of two U.S. firms here,  business sources said yesterday.    David D. Ussery, representative director and president of  detergent retailer Amway Korea; Jason Li, general manager of  health food seller Sunrider International Korea; and nine other  persons working for the firms are on trial for alleged illegal  retailing in the form of so-called multi-layer home-visit sales.  This is pressure on the Korean government and its aim is to  rescue the U.S. businessmen from the lawsuit although the courts  are independent of the administration, a businessman said.    It follows an earlier American attempt by Defense Secretary  William Perry to put pressure on his Korean counterpart Yi  Pyong-tae to buy airborne radar jamming device manufactured by a  U.S. firm, he said.    Late in December last year, Perry sent a letter to Minister  Yi and the letter was disclosed early this month, causing public  criticism against the United States.    An official of the Trade-Industry-Energy Ministry confirmed  the reception of the letter, refusing to disclose details. He  said, "The letter came late last month. But we cannot disclose  the contents of the letter as it involves a sensitive trade  issue."    Prosecutors arrested Ussery, Li and five other persons  working for the two firms charging them with illegal retailing  on July 1 last year. This was the first arrest of foreigners in  violation of the law on home-visit sales.    U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed "concern" about the  issue during his visit to Seoul July 10-11 last year.    Prosecutors filed a summary suit against the top managers of  the two firms and nine others Nov. 16 to wind up the sensitive  case quickly with a mere cash penalty. But the Nambu (southern)  branch of the Seoul District Criminal Court ordered a formal  rather than summary trial Dec. 9, refusing the summary  indictment requested by the prosecutors.    Stating his reasons for ordering the formal trial, Judge Min  Pyong-hun of the court said, "There has been a dispute about the  legal interpretation of the law on home-visit sales. It also  would have been hard to make a ruling based on the investigation  records produced by prosecutors. As a result, a formal trial  was needed where evidence and arguments can be brought forward."    The first trial will reportedly be held next month.</p>

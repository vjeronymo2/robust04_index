"Everywhere, the  defense minister was sufficiently informed about the situation  in the field, thanks to the information given him by senior  officers supervising the operations." Despite the difficult  conditions in which the soldiers are living, "the morale of our  troops is high. There is no doubt that the visit by their  minister has brought them some joy to the heart," especially  when he shared a meal with them.

			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> WEATHER SERVICE TO MOVE RADAR SYSTEM  </P> <P> Ventura County is the perfect site for weather radar that will replace a system  dating back to the 1950s, National Weather Service Meteorologist Art Lassard  said this week.  </P> <P> The National Weather Service plans to move from Los Angeles to Oxnard to  install new state-of-the-art equipment.  </P> <P> Sulphur Mountain, between Oxnard and Ojai, was picked as the perfect site for  the system after a two-year survey by the government, Lassard said.  </P> <P> The operations office will be built on a separate site within the Sammis  Business Center between Rice and Del Norte roads.  </P> <P> Both parcels need to be acquired before plans can be finalized.  </P> <P> NEXRAD, an acronym for Next Generation Radar, will be installed nationwide in a  modernizing effort by the National Weather Service.  </P> <P> Officials hope that the office will be in operation by mid-1992 and will house  about 28 electronic technicians, meteorologists and administrative assistants  issuing weather forecasts for most of Southern California.

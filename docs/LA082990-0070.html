			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UPDATE / BOSTON HARBOR;  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN ISSUE NOW A $6.1-BILLION CLEANUP PROJECT;  </P> <P> MANY WERE EMBARRASSED BY BUSH'S CRITICISM. THE MASSIVE EFFORT IS SHOWING  RESULTS.  </P> <P> One of the more notable issues of the 1988 presidential campaign was the  horrendous pollution of Boston Harbor. George Bush blamed Michael S. Dukakis,  his Democratic opponent, for allowing the harbor to become the dirtiest in the  United States.  </P> <P> Today, Bush is President, Dukakis is the lame-duck governor, and the  $6.1-billion harbor cleanup, under federal court supervision, is well under way  with little help from either of the 1988 presidential contenders.  </P> <P> The Metropolitan Water Resources Agency, created by the Legislature in 1985  under pressure of several anti-pollution lawsuits, is supervising the cleanup  -- the largest public works project ever undertaken in New England. U.S.  District Judge David Mazzone is overseeing the effort.  </P> <P> Major elements of the cleanup plan include upgrading primary sewage treatment  plants on Nut and Deer islands in the harbor; building new primary and  secondary treatment facilities on Deer Island; building a plant in Quincy to  turn sludge into marketable fertilizer pellets; replacing and repairing miles  of water and sewer pipes, some 80 years old, and controlling combined sewage  overflow systems, pipes that handle both rainwater and sewage.  </P> <P> In the last two decades, when many other cities were rehabilitating their  systems, largely with federal funds available under the Clean Water Act, Boston  was seeking waivers to save money. Now, federal funds have dried up and state  finances are in such a sorry state that Massachusetts has the lowest bond  rating in the nation. That means 95% of the costs of cleaning up Boston Harbor  will be borne by water and sewage ratepayers, who are beginning to wonder  whether federally mandated secondary treatment is worth it.  </P> <P> Annual water and sewer bills are expected to reach $1,200 or more per household  by the end of the decade, with a big increase next year, when bills will jump  from an average $330 per household to $400.  </P> <P> Chester Atkins, a Massachusetts Democrat who represents a number of communities  where water and sewer rates are climbing, last year got a bill through Congress  to fund a National Academy of Sciences study of a controversial proposal to  treat wastes at the primary level with chemicals, instead of at the secondary  level with bacteria.  </P> <P> Paul Levy, who has directed the Water Resources Agency since 1987, said that  even if the scientists made a "conclusive finding that secondary treatment is  not appropriate," Congress would be unlikely to change the law to benefit  Massachusetts and California. Los Angeles and San Diego also have challenged  the need for secondary treatment, Levy noted.  </P> <P> Sheila Lynch, vice president of Save the Harbor/Save the Bay, an environmental  advocacy group, said there has been "a noticeable difference" in the  cleanliness of the harbor this year. She wants the water agency to keep its  secondary treatment plans.  </P> <P> As for the Bush campaign commercial, "People in Massachusetts were  embarrassed," Levy said. The water agency confronted the image problem head-on,  preparing a videotape that began with footage of Bush calling it "the harbor of  shame." The agency told institutional investors, "OK, here's what you think you  know about Boston Harbor, and here's what's really happening . . . ."  </P> <P> "In a way," Levy said, "Bush did us a favor . . . . It created impetus."  </P> <P> Of course, Levy added, "Everybody noticed the inconsistency when he left the  money out of the budget."  </P> <P> In the budget he presented last January, Bush omitted $20 million scheduled to  help pay for the cleanup, part of an appropriation arranged by former Speaker  of the House Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr. before he retired. The money was  eventually restored in conference committee.  </P> <P> Ratepayers have already seen some results from the increased fees. Boaters and  swimmers have reported improvements in the harbor water this year, and there  have been fewer beach closings. Some swim in the harbor, and others wouldn't  dare.  </P> <P> Caryl Rivers, a 20-year resident of Winthrop whose back yard ends at the  harbor, frequently takes a dip. But she does take precautions. She calls  Winthrop Town Hall to find out the latest coliform count before wading in.  </P></p>

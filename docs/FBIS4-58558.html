			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Political Department Head </F> Faruq Qaddumi by Kamal Tarabayh on 4 May; place not given; from  the "Today's Guest" feature -- recorded]    [Text] [Tarabayh] Brother Faruq Qaddumi, PLO Political  Department chief, good evening.    [Qaddumi] Good evening. Welcome.    [Tarabayh] Brother Abu-al-Lutf [Qaddumi's nom de guerre],  the first question that comes to mind is: Why didn't you attend  the agreement signing ceremony in Cairo.    [Qaddumi] This has been my position since the very  beginning, and it has not changed. It is a position of caution  and carefulness because the Palestinian people have not achieved  their aspirations. We are now confronting a new challenge. We  face a hard test. But we will not give in to despair. We will  face these difficulties with confident hearts.    [Tarabayh] You refused to go to Washington when the  Declaration of Principles Agreement was signed. But you then  made a statement stressing the importance of the Palestinian  people's unity. What would you say to Palestinians today?    [Qaddumi] At this important, difficult phase in history, we  say the Palestinian national struggle will continue  relentlessly....    [Tarabayh, interrupting] ...the armed struggle?    [Qaddumi] The Palestinian national struggle, by all means.  It will continue relentlessly and its fire will not end. We  are fighting for a legitimate cause in order to regain our  legitimate rights from an usurping enemy that is supported by  strong world powers. Despite this, our people's determination  to resist continues and our intifadah inside the occupied  territories will remain until the last Israeli soldier leaves  our blessed Palestinian soil. We are advocates of peace, but we  reject surrender. We believed in the peace process on clear  foundations, which have not been realized yet. We were certain  about these foundations--the land-for-peace formula--from the  very beginning, and we will achieve that goal, God willing,  regardless of how long it takes.    [Tarabayh] Abu-al-Lutf, do you think the agreement signed  today in Cairo is a step forward or backward on the path of  peace?    [Qaddumi] In fact, we are facing difficult options as I have  said. We must choose the least of two evils. We can judge what  was signed today through experience. I am completely optimistic  that our people will continue their national struggle to create  the appropriate conditions that will serve their objective in  national independence and the creation of their state with holy  Jerusalem as its capital.    [Tarabayh] There is discussion now about the formation of a  Palestinian government with members from inside and outside the  occupied territories. Will Abu-al-Lutf join such a government?    [Qaddumi] What kind of government are we talking about,  especially since there is nothing complete yet? There is no  room for a government. There may be room for leaders or for a  national Palestinian authority.    [Tarabayh] As head of the PLO Political Department, were you  in full agreement with the other members of the PLO Executive  Committee, especially President Yasir 'Arafat, about the  agreement signed today?    [Qaddumi] I think brother Abu-'Ammar ['Arafat], as was clear  from what we saw on television, was angry and unhappy about what  he was presented with. But as I have said, it was an  inescapable evil.    [Tarabayh] But why was he unhappy knowing that the signing  ceremony was, according to the Palestinian party in particular,  preceded by hard, intensive, and lengthy negotiations that  covered all aspects?    [Qaddumi] But at the last moment, there were some points the  Israelis agreed on initially but then rejected.    [Tarabayh] You are one of the historical leaders of  Palestinian national action and you are a founding member of  Fatah. On this occasion, on this important occasion, what do you  say to the supporters and opposers of the agreement within the  Palestinian people?    [Qaddumi] I tell everyone that at this difficult phase we  must not transfer our rage to the inside. It should be directed  against the Israeli enemy who usurped our land. The fault is  not ours, but that of those powerful forces, the Zionist forces  that usurped Palestinian land and expelled our people. It is  our destiny to stand united to continue this resistance, and to  continue the construction in order to create new facts on the  ground, without showing any sign of exhaustion. We will not  give in to despair. We will continue this march. The march of  history, which doomed certain states to collapse, will also doom  our enemy to failure. We are hopeful that, through the  developments in today's world, we will triumph, God willing.    [Tarabayh] Do you think the agreement signed today is an  initial step on the path to establishing the independent  Palestinian state?    [Qaddumi] We will discuss the details of this agreement. If  there were positive points, then every leader, official, and the  rank-and-file must take advantage of this opportunity to  buttress all resources so we can continue this struggle until we  reach national independence. I am certain we will get there  soon.    [Tarabayh] At this moment in particular, where does  Abu-al-Lutf stand? How optimistic or pessimistic is Abu-al-Lutf?    [Qaddumi] I have never been a pessimist. I am an optimist  by nature. We started this revolution from nothing and  generations joined it and excelled in fighting the Israeli  enemy. The people were never tired. This is a long march but  the signs of victory can, God willing, be seen on the horizon.    [Tarabayh] You undoubtedly remember at these times the  brothers and comrades who fell on the path of struggle,  particularly Fatah Central Committee members such as Abu-Jihad  [Khalil al-Wazir] and Abu--Iyad [Salah Khalaf] and the other  martyrs. Do you have anything to say on this occasion?    [Qddumi] To these heroic martyrs, to the martyrs who fell  for the sake of the Palestine cause and for the liberation of  Palestine, I say one word: We remain faithful to the pledge.  We will continue our struggle until we realize the hope for  which they fought and for which we started the revolution  together to achieve that noble goal, national independence and  sovereignty over our land, regardless of the sacrifices.    [Tarabayh] And to the children of the stone: Are they  required today or in the near future to drop the stones and move  to other forms?    [Qaddumi] I say to these younger generations: Hold on to  the stone until the last Israeli soldier leaves Palestinian  soil. Blessed be they, and greetings to them and to all future  generations that will build Palestine with their strong arms;  and until the occupation is terminated and until we establish  the pillars of peace. We are advocates of peace but we reject  capitulation. The late Tunisian poet, Abu-al-Qasim, once said:  Despite illness and enemies, I will remain like an eagle  standing on a lofty summit.    [Tarabayh] Faruq Qaddumi, Abu-al-Lutf, thank you for this  interview.    [Qaddumi] Thank you.</p>

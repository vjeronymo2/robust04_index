			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NHL NOTES;  </P> <P> SINKING SABRES DEAL FOLIGNO TO MAPLE LEAFS  </P> <P> The struggling Buffalo Sabres traded their captain, forward Mike Foligno, to  the Toronto Maple Leafs today for two veteran players, Lou Franceschetti and  Brian Curran.  </P> <P> Trade rumors had surrounded Foligno, 31, for several weeks.  </P> <P> He played in all but one of the Sabres' 32 games so far this season, but seldom  started and scored just four goals with five assists as the Sabres got off to a  disappointing 10-15-7 start.  </P> <P> Foligno, who was acquired from Detroit in 1981, has played in 663 games during  his career at Buffalo, scoring 247 goals and 263 assists for 510 points.  </P> <P> He holds Buffalo's all-time record for penalty minutes, with 1,450, including  42 this season, and ranks in the team's all-time top 10 in most other major  categories. He had been the Sabres' captain since Feb. 15, 1989.  </P> <P> Franceschetti, 32, a right wing, has appeared in only 16 games after sitting  out part of the season with a broken foot. He has scored one goal and one  assist this season.  </P> <P> Curran, 27, has not played since being recalled on Dec. 13 from the Leafs' farm  team at Newmarket, Ontario.  </P> <P> All players are expected to report to their new teams by Tuesday, when the  Leafs will visit the New York Islanders and Buffalo will play at Hartford.  </P> <P> Boston defenseman Ray Bourque, who had seven points in three games, was named  NHL Player of the Week.  </P> <P> Bourque had a goal and six assists in two victories over Hartford and a 1-1 tie  with the New Jersey Devils, giving him 28 points in 29 games this season.  </P></p>

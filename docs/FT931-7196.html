			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Packer hires a 'deal maker' to lead new ConsPress expansion MR KERRY PACKER, the Australian industrialist and publisher, yesterday announced the appointment of Mr Brian Powers to replace Mr Al Dunlap as managing director of Consolidated Press Holdings (ConsPress). Mr Packer, the sole shareholder in ConsPress, said Mr Powers would lead the company through 'a period of growth and development'. The announcement fuelled speculation that Mr Packer is planning a substantial acquisition. ConsPress recently acquired a 10 per cent stake in Westpac, the troubled Australian bank, and is rumoured to be considering a bid for MGM Pathe Communications, the US film studio. Mr Powers, 43, is a partner in Hellman and Friedman, the US investment bank, and a director of John Fairfax, the Australian newspaper group controlled by Mr Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph group. His appointment follows the resignation of Mr Dunlap, who returned to the US last week after completing two years of a five-year contract, during which he disposed of most of the group's non-core businesses. Mr Dunlap, who earned the sobriquet 'chainsaw' for his zeal in cutting operating costs, is believed to have left ConsPress after a disagreement with Mr Packer about the legal interpretation of his remuneration package. He reduced ConsPress to three main businesses - 49 per cent of Valassis Communications, the US coupon insert business; 42 per cent of Nine Network, Australia's top-rated television channel; and 45 per cent of Australian Consolidated Press, the leading domestic magazine publisher. Mr Powers, who was closely involved in the acquisition of the Fairfax group by a consortium led by Mr Black, is regarded by analysts as a deal maker whose style may be more in line with Mr Packer's renewed interest in expansion.</p>

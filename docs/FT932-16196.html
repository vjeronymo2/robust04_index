			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / BES investments increase sharply INVESTMENT in Business Expansion Scheme companies more than doubled to Pounds 957m in the 1992-93 tax year from Pounds 367m in 1991-92. Figures prepared by the Allenbridge Group, an independent BES consultancy, show that residential property companies attracted Pounds 950m, with only Pounds 7m going to the small high-risk trading companies the scheme was first set up to fund. This was the worst year for trading companies since the BES began, and they have not raised more than Pounds 36m in a year since the scheme was opened to assured tenancy investment in 1988-89. According to Allenbridge, Pounds 880m was raised in 1992-93 by companies that attempted to guarantee a fixed return at the end of five years, while only Pounds 77m went to more entrepreneurial schemes. Mr Ian Pugh, BES analyst with Allenbridge, attributed the sharp rise in takings to two factors. First, demand was inflated by a loophole - attacked by the Labour party - which allowed investors to exit their investments after six months using loans. Schemes using BES shares as security for loans were abolished in the Budget, but not before they had raised Pounds 568m. The second factor was that building societies, which had not previously found a route for raising funds via the BES, fuelled the growth. Bradford &amp; Bingley, Bristol &amp; West, Leeds Permanent, and National &amp; Provincial societies, Barclays Bank and TSB all raised Pounds 50m or more via the BES. The abolition of the loans loophole has made it harder to raise funds quickly, but the Building Societies Association believes that the BES still offers a cheap way to finance repossessions. The BES will be axed at the end of December, following an announcement in the 1992 Budget. This could allow intermediaries to hurry investors into making decisions. However, the Revenue has signalled in three rulings - which are being challenged - that it will not allow sponsors bent on using the BES for tax avoidance any leeway: It has refused to permit tax relief so far on schemes, launched just before last year's general election, which bought accommodation for University College, London. The Revenue believes they may have violated assured tenancy regulations by letting the accommodation to conferences during the summer vacation. Loan-back schemes launched before the Budget by the banks BZW and National Westminster still await a ruling on whether they will receive tax relief. The two schemes each took Pounds 25m, but have not yet convinced the Revenue that shares were correctly issued in time to beat the deadline - midnight on the Monday before the Budget. Both banks have said alternative exits will be provided if relief is not allowed - this could involve total refunds. Investors in Country Gardens, a series of trading companies which raised Pounds 15m under the BES in 1985, 1986 and 1987, have been asked by the Revenue to return their tax relief with interest. Tax inspectors had decided the companies were in technical breach of BES regulations by operating a non-qualifying subsidiary and holding too much cash.</p>

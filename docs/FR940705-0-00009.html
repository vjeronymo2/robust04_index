The producer may request and CCC may approve removal of a quantity of the commodity from storage, without the payment of CCC of the loan amount, if the principal amount outstanding on such loan before such removal does not exceed the maximum loan value of the quantity of the commodity remaining in storage after such removal. When the proceeds of the sale of the commodity are needed to repay all or a part of a farm-stored loan, the producer must request and obtain prior written approval of the county office on a form prescribed by CCC in order to remove a specified quantity of the commodity from storage. Any such approval shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable form, copies of which may be obtained by producers at the county office. Any such approval shall not constitute a release of CCC's security interest in the commodity or release the producer from liability for any amounts due and owing to CCC with respect to the loan indebtedness if full payment of such amounts is not received by the county office. If a producer fails to repay a loan within the time period prescribed by CCC for a farm-storage loan and commodity pledged as loan collateral has been delivered to a buyer in accordance with Form CCC&hyph;681&hyph;1, Authorization for Delivery of Loan Collateral for Sale, such producer may not repay the loan at the level that is less than the loan level determined in accordance with &sect;1421.25(a)(1)(ii), (b)(2), or (d)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (e) If the commodity is moved on a nonworkday from storage without obtaining prior approval to move such commodity, such removal shall constitute unauthorized removal or disposition, as applicable, of such commodity unless the producer notifies the county office the next workday that such commodity has been moved and such movement is approved by CCC. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 16.

In determining the rate of payment for excess hauling, the State committee may establish reasonable mileage minimums below which producers will not receive compensation for hauling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) (1) Producers may request trackloading for loan collateral where approved warehouse space is not available locally or where KCCO determines that it would be to the benefit of CCC. Where local weighing facilities are not available or when requested by producers, destination weights may be used for settlement purposes. All producers loading in the same car must sign an agreement stating the percentage share of the total quantity to be credited to each. When requested by producers prior to delivery of the commodity, settlement may be made on the basis of destination grades. Such destination grade determination for a car shall be applied to the entire quantity of a commodity loaded into the same car, regardless of the grade or quality of a commodity loaded into the car by any producer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

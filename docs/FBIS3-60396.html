According to the medical  report issued by the Medical Superintendent, Mubende Hospital Dr  Ngobi, the cause of death was meningitis.    The disease has reportedly claimed many lives in various  areas of Mubende district but the worst hit being Kibalinga,  Kasana in Buwekula areas. Only a few cases have so far been  reported to the District medical authorities.    The District Medical Officer, Mubende Dr Bagambisa George  revealed it was a strain of malaria parasites which was  difficult to treat using ordinary malaria drugs. He attributed  the escalating number of deaths to the ignorance of the people  about the prevailing outbreak of the disease. He said normally  during dry periods meningitis is common among the people and  claims a lot of lives.    He also conceded he had received reports of the disease in  the district.    Meanwhile, a source who talked to The New Vision  and asked for anonymity, disclosed a district team headed by the  District Medical Officer, Dr Bagambisa is soon to go around the  district educating people about the causes of these rampant  deaths.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Li Jianxing (2621 1696 5281) and </F> XINHUA reporter Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900)]    [Text] Beijing, 30 Mar (XINHUA) -- In view of the  increasingly rampant crime of forging, reselling, and stealing  invoices in certain localities; and the serious problem of  certain lawless elements using counterfeited special invoices  for value-added taxes [VAT] to evade taxes and swindle the  government out of tax refunds, the Supreme People's  Procuratorate, Supreme People's Court, Ministry of Public  Security, and State Administration of Taxation recently decided  to launch a collective, nationwide campaign from April to June  to crack down on crime.    Leading members of these four departments -- the Supreme  People's Procuratorate, Supreme People's Court, Ministry of  Public Security, and State Administration of Taxation --  gathered at a teleconference today to plan the crackdown. Vice  Premier Zhu Rongji attended the conference and gave important  instructions. Luo Gan, state councillor and secretary general  of the State Council, addressed the meeting.    Luo Gan said: China's reform for building a socialist market  economic system has now entered a critical period for pushing  the entire project forward and achieving breakthroughs in key  areas. The core of tax reform, which is one of the several major  reform projects to be carried out this year, is to establish a  system of indirect taxes based primarily on value-added taxes.  Under this system, tax deductions are assessed according to the  amounts of money noted in invoices. This is an internationally  accepted norm. Working like a "chain," a special invoice for  value-added tax connects all business processes -- from  production to distribution, and from wholesale to retail. If  problems occur in any one of the "chain's" links, it will break  and cause tax losses.    Luo Gan pointed out: Recently, a trend has appeared in  certain areas, namely: Certain lawless elements, who are  blinded by greed, have forged invoices by illicit means, and  made use of these invoices for criminal purposes, such as  evading taxes, swindling tax refunds, smuggling goods, and  selling smuggled goods. The crime of forging, reselling, and  stealing special invoices for value-added taxes, in particular,  will jeopardize the implementation of the new tax system as a  whole. Thus, we must come down hard on all lawless conduct of  forging invoices, especially forging, reselling, and stealing  special invoices for value-added taxes.    Luo Gan said: All regions and departments must have a  consensus of views, be more aware of the problem, provide  stronger leadership over the crackdown, and work in close  coordination with each other. This problem must be dealt with  comprehensively and regularly. Governments at all levels must  place the project high on their agendas. Each region and  department must assign a leading cadre to take special charge of  organizing and coordinating the crackdown. Principal leaders of  public security, procuratorial, judicial, and taxation  departments themselves must get involve in the crackdown, which  must be meticulously organized and tightly supervised. Capable  persons of public security, procuratorial, judicial, and  taxation departments must be immediately assembled to play their  part in a coordinated manner according to the collective plan.  Firm actions must be taken to stop the criminal trend of  forging, reselling, and stealing invoices. We must make sure  anticipated results are achieved so that a good environment  favorable for implementing the new tax system and for achieving  a sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic development  can be created.    The meeting today also urged all people's courts and  procuratorial, public security, and taxation organs to do away  with interference from local protectionism, from departments  trying to protect their own interests, and from irregular  practices in certain trades and professions; give priority to  cracking down in key areas and major cases; and carry out all  assignments impartially and promptly. It said: While cracking  down on special cases, efforts should also be made to publicize  the cases so that the people will become educated. Collective  and major crackdown actions should be reported through  television and radio stations, newspapers, and journals.    Liu Jiachen, vice president of the Supreme People's Court;  Zhao Dengju, deputy procurator general of the Supreme People's  Procuratorate; Mu Xinsheng, vice minister of public security;  and Jin Xin, deputy director of the State Administration of  Taxation, also spoke at the teleconference. Liu Zhongli,  minister of finance and concurrently director of the State  Administration of Taxation; and He Chunlin, deputy secretary  general of the State Council; and persons in charge of relevant  departments attended the teleconference.    It has been learned that the crackdown conducted by the four  departments will be carried out in large and medium cities and  regions where forgery, resales, and theft of invoices have been  quite serious; and the crackdown will also be carried out in  other areas along with routine operations. Priority will be  given to cracking down on those who forge invoices en masse in  underground printing shops, as well as on lawless elements  engaged in forging and reselling invoices as a lucrative  profession; and on elements who forge invoices to evade taxes,  obtain tax deductibles, and swindle tax refunds. Special  efforts will be made to crack down on organized crimes of  forging, reselling, and stealing invoices.</p>

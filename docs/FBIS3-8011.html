			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Interior Ministry has turned down the  application for the registration of a new right-wing party, the  Democratic Union [Demokraticka Unie]. Milah Hulik, member of  the preparatory committee, said that the application was turned  down because only 700 out of a total of 1,570 signatures  supplied were accepted. The law requires at least 1,000  signatures for a political party to be registered. Allegedly,  another reason for the decision was certain unusual features in  the Democratic Union's program.    Milan Hulik was hopeful that the reasons for turning down  the  application would be removed and that the new right-wing party  would be registered as soon as possible.</p>

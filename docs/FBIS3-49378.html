"Dreams of a greater, or even of a `middle-sized' Hungary  cannot be fulfilled," Huska said, adding that it was not  possible for the government not to have contingency plans in  case the state should be threatened. He expressed the  conviction that Slovakia would be able to preserve its  territorial integrity.    Slovak Minister of Culture Dusan Slobodnik said that "there  is no government more tolerant than the current Slovak one."  Slovak Deputy Premier Sergej Kozlik called on Slovaks to  express their dissatisfaction over attempts by the Hungarian  minority to achieve autonomy in southern Slovakia.    "It is time for parliament to consider passing a law on the  protection of the Republic," Slobodnik said, adding that among  the Hungarian minority there were still "many decent people who  want to live peacefully in Slovakia."    The worsening of the situation in Slovakia is tied to a  demand made by the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny  Island, which is calling for autonomy for southern Slovakia from  Bratislava to the Ukrainian border. An assembly to discuss the  demand is to be held on January 8 in Komarno, southern Slovakia.</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Arts: Balthus - the shock of the old / Art in Switzerland Old people are not expected to shock, except by the sobering spectacle of their own decay. As for an old, world-famous artist, he or she is almost by definition one who no longer shocks the public. After two generations, the public feels it knows that artist's work. And yet, our idea of the artist's work will inevitably be largely ersatz, formed by the publishing industry's choice of images for coffee-table books, posters, art calendars and postcards. Certain artists' work more easily becomes ersatz than others. Lowry is one, Balthus is another. Balthus is now 85 and his paintings (at least, the most 'Balthusian' of them) have for decades been among the most recognisable of any artist still living. As for the real thing, however, it is not easily seen; Balthus is still owned largely by private collectors and not by museums. How odd, even perverse, then, that the Musee des Beaux-Arts in Lausanne, Switzerland, has made so little fuss about Balthus, the first major retrospective since the Paris/New York shows of 1983-4. The Lausanne museum is honouring Balthus, who has lived in the canton of Vaud for the past 15 years. Originally, the exhibition was to have focused on paintings associated with Switzerland, where the artist spent his childhood and adolescence and the war years from 1940. But Balthus himself was enthused by the idea, collectors responded generously, and the result is a major exhibition which moreover looks marvellous. More than 50 paintings, 30 drawings and watercolours are spaciously hung in the lofty white galleries. They include a good number of the painter's best-known paintings from the 1930s to 1950s; 'The Street', 'Le Passage du Commerce Saint-Andre', 'The Children', 'Therese', and 'Les Beaux Jours'. As well as the figure paintings, there are a fascinating group of the landscapes which are the less well-known side of Balthus's work. 'The Mountain' (1937) is an extraordinarily declamatory and even crude painting of a party of young walkers revelling in the panoramic grandeur of the Alps. They respond with exhilaration to the azure sky, the dizzy views. But there is also seduction in the heat. One of the two girls is still fast asleep on the velvet turf, wrapped in a personal solitude which is typically Balthus. After the war, landscapes in France and more recently Italy have become places of timeless enchantment. Tiny figures endowed with the poise of Gicaometti sculptures herd their cows or call in a white horse from the orchard. They are lost in a pastoral world of Virgilian perfection. In his youth, Balthus famously copied the frescoes of Piero della Francesco and Masacio. His landscapes have the quality of missing fragments from the background of a fresco. The warders are on the alert to keep visitors far enough away from Balthus's surfaces. Already in 'La Victime' of 1937, the paint is thick, mottled, clotted. The technique of putting layer upon layer of pigment means that from close up, 'Large landscape with Cows' painted at the Chateau de Chassy in 1959 is almost like paint cohering to a pile rug. The image floats on the surface. No reproduction of Balthus's work ever begins to convey this extraordinary texture. If the texture of the real thing is a surprise, so too may be the sombreness of Balthus's palette, especially in the early years. Reproductions tend to make his work look lighter. Here, the catalogue (not a complete one, by the way, costing SFr50) is badly at fault. Balthus's colours have become brighter over the decades, as his famous nudes have become more decorative and the atmosphere less menacing. 'Young Girl with a Blue Towel' (1958) is an enchantingly pretty painting of a stocky girl in a bathroom. She is delectably pink and almost herself seems to radiate light in the brilliance of a summer morning. So far I have described some of the surprises you may find in the retrospective. What of the shock of Balthus? The most recent work in the show, 'Cat and Mirror III', was finished this summer and is exhibited for the first time. This golden-haired girl on a couch has an anatomy which is stranger even than the oddest Balthus figures  -which is saying quite a lot. However, far from being nude like most of her predecessors, she is fully clad and even rather fashionable, in her luminous lilac leggings. The couch on which she lies, observed by a tabby cat, is loaded like a boat with gaudy patterned fabrics. Were this the only painting by Balthus of a young girl which one had ever seen, it would be quite mystifying as to why Balthus still has an exotic and even evil reputation. And yet, it is almost exactly 60 years ago that he achieved lasting notoriety with his first exhibition in the Galerie Pierre in Paris. Five large paintings (each 6ft) portrayed situations which were erotic, even sado-masochistic. The real shocker was 'The Guitar Lesson', showing a woman teacher sexually assaulting the adolescent girl pupil, bent across her lap in a clear travesty of a Pieta. Balthus had found a subject which would never cease to unnerve and even shock. That particular painting is absent from the show. Even so, there are a host of young girls, some with long thin limbs like Gothic beauties, some with rounded limbs and moon faces. For many people, Balthus will for ever be a dubious artist. They reprehend him for being the classicist who paints a thoroughly unclassical nude, and more basic still, for being a dirty old man whose nudes of the '80s show him as still fixated on the Lolita figure. So yes, Balthus can still be shocking. Indeed, such is the degree of hysteria in Anglo-Saxon countries about adult exploitation of child sexuality, it is questionable how many museum directors would feel comfortable today about staging a retrospective of Balthus, 'Guitar Lesson' and the rest. In Lausanne they see things differently. The exhibition is fascinating and full of beautiful images; see it, if you can.                           *       *       * If you linger in Lausanne, close by at Martigny the Fondation Pierre Gianadda is showing Edgar Degas (150 works; open daily, until November 21). Henry Darger; The Adventures of the Vivian Girls at the Collection de l'art brut is deranged, distasteful but curious. The collection itself, formed by Jean Dubuffet, should be seen. The Fondation de l'Hermitage is showing Claude Monet and His Friends: works loaned from the Musee Marmottan and private collections (until September 26). Last month, the Museum of the Olympics opened down by the lake. It is far more ghastly even than I imagined, but has some interest as a sign of the times. Balthus runs until 29 August.

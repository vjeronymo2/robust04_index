			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by DELOVOY MIR commentator Vladimir Mekhontsev </F> under the "A Viewpoint" rubric: "The Baltic 'Train' and Russian  Interests"]    [Text] No matter from which angle we look at the  Baltic question--historic, economic, military-strategic, or  geopolitical--one cannot fail to notice the main point: This  region represents a zone of vitally important interests for  Russia--as well as some for other CIS states, as a matter of  fact. Therefore, the three Baltic countries' joining the NATO  "Partnership for Peace" program could not fail to affect Russia  to some or other extent.    This would all not be so bad had we been dealing with  ensuring European (and hence world) security within the  framework of CSCE structures, which already have been  functioning rather successfully for almost two decades. When,  however, certain forces promote the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization, with its well-known military might and quite  well-defined interests as a guarantor of stability on the  continent; when the Baltic countries themselves see their  joining the "Partnership" program as a step in the direction of  full integration into the NATO structures; when their  aspirations find their realization in a complete distancing from  Russia--this may not only have a negative effect on our  political interests, but may also have an adverse effect on our  economy.    And indeed, large ports on the Baltic Sea, oil terminals,  transit oil and gas pipelines, huge electrotechnical and  transport-building production facilities, which in most  instances were built through the efforts of both Russia and the  former Union republics, may be placed overnight out of Russia's  reach by a nod from a NATO "conductor." The evidence that this  is not entirely contrived are the voices sounding even from the  State Department of the largest NATO member--the United States.  This is what the influential WASHINGTON POST recently wrote,  quoting the revelation of an official of the aforementioned  organization: "The fight in the economic sphere of Russia will  be protracted and difficult. We are resolutely against a Russian  sphere of influence; neither do Russia's neighbors want it." And  keeping in mind that the Russian leadership has not yet made a  decision on whether to participate in the "Partnership," it is  easy to understand why Russia reacted with such keen sensitivity  to the Baltic countries' joining this program.  <H5>  Political Euphoria and Real Difficulties </H5>   Without doubt, for the purpose of realizing their "strategic  goals," the Baltics states intend widely to use the potential of  international organizations and alliances. That is why joining  the "Partnership," seen in this context, did cause a certain  surge of political euphoria among the leadership and radically  minded population strata of these countries. Nevertheless, one  can easily forecast that emotional elation will subside as soon  as it encounters economic realities.    First, participation in the program is a rather costly idea.  If competent persons in the Baltics do not dare to provide even  the most approximate figures, one may come up with an estimate  on the example of Poland, for which its membership in the  "Partnership for Peace" will cost $22 million annually. But this  is, so to say, an "external" difficulty. There are also purely  internal ones.    The fact that the three republics of the region were for  decades a part of the integrated economic system of the former  Union; that their production ties had been locked onto partners  in other republics (to a considerable extent in the Russian  Federation); that their products had been designed for the  all-Union market--these and other factors are unlikely to allow  for a sufficiently rapid structural restructuring of industry in  Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia in order to redirect it toward  Western markets. (And this market, actually, is quite crowded to  allow one to quickly find his "niche" in it.) Lithuania's  example is indicative in this respect: According to the data of  the Lithuanian department of statistics, last year Russia was  the destination for 41 percent of its exports, and provided 75.1  percent of its imports. For comparison: Exports to the West  accounted to 25.9 percent, and imports--12.7 percent. It is not  accidental that the Lithuanian Embassy in Moscow noted that  "economic relations and trade involve mainly Russia and the  former republics of the Soviet Union."    Another difficulty is the Baltic states' dependence on  deliveries of fuels and energy from Russia and some CIS  countries. In an attempt to overcome this "difficulty," the  Baltic countries undertake various steps and are searching for  alternative solutions. The most prominent example of this is the  proposed construction of new export-import oil terminals in  Lithuanian Butinga and Latvian Liepaja. Besides a purely  economic factor (considerable financial expenditures on the  actual construction in Butinga or deepening the navigating  channel in Liepaja), there are political and ecological factors  that may play a negative role.    The point is that a terminal in Butinga, which will have  better capabilities than the port of Liepaja to service  high-tonnage tankers, has the prospect of becoming completely  Lithuanian in the future and presenting serious competition to  Liepaja. This must worry the Latvian side, while for Lithuania,  according to specialists, "the issue of the terminal is the  issue of the survival of its industry." Environmentalists also  may take an active stand against the construction of a new  terminal in Butinga (practically on the border with Latvia), who  believe--and not without good reason--that in the event of any  accident at the terminal, the Latvian natural environment will  sustain serious damage.    In short, there are more than enough problems. And anyway,  it  is very difficult to foresee all the difficulties arising along  the thorny road of independence. It is much more important, in  my opinion, to attempt to understand what Russia will lose in  the event of such a decisive turn of the Baltics toward NATO and  what needs to be done in order to....  <H5>  ....Ensure the Russian Interests in the Region </H5>   In the opinion, for instance, of specialists from the  Russian  Foreign Economic Relations Scientific Research Institute,  keeping in mind the difficult financial situation, Russia will  not be able to build new ports in the near future. In other  words, we will be forced to seek some sort of compromise to  ensure for ourselves a gate to the Baltic Sea.    There also exist certain concerns in the matter of using oil  pipelines. Russia already is paying considerable money for each  tonne of Russian oil being exported through transit pipelines.  It is easy to imagine how dearly a hypothetical increase in the  cost of transit will cost Russia.    The question of Kaliningrad Oblast--a "Russian enclave"  surrounded at all sides by "abroad"--may flare up in a way  painful for Russia. The ink was not dry yet on A. Brazauskas'  signature under the agreement of Lithuania joining the  "Partnership" when Lithuanian radicals, led by high-ranking  members of parliament, began openly to demand seizing  Kaliningrad Oblast from Russia and creating on its territory a  new state integrated into the structures of Northern Europe.    Of course, to avoid these and many other difficulties in  relations with the Baltics, we should have thought of Russian  interests considerably earlier. By now many political statements  of the Russian leadership are seen, in particular by the press,  as attempts to board a train that has already left the station.  There is a certain amount of truth to it. Strictly speaking,  however, the "train" has just "started off," and Russia still  can make it there.    In order to accomplish this, we probably should, while  holding a firm political position with respect to vitally  important interests of Russia in this region, to more actively  use first and foremost economic levers. I do not mean threats to  "turn off oil or gas faucets"--for this will only provide a  short-term benefit but to a large extent deprive us of a  prospect to develop normal relations between Russia and the  Baltics. Normal economic relations, however, unrestricted  development of business and trade not only on a state level but  also on the level of concrete companies and individual  producers, will enable us to ensure Russian interests in the  Baltics.    In the opinion of specialists from the Russian Federation  Ministry of the Economy, the most realistic road is through more  active involvement of Russia's business circles in the Baltics;  striking root there by creating joint enterprises, buying blocks  of stock of large enterprises--in short, using the broadest  complex of measures with the aim of developing business and  trade-economic ties with Russia. But this cannot be a one-way  road. It is necessary to create a system of certain preferences  for Baltic business as well. In this respect, the signing and  the soonest possible ratification of already existing  agreements--for instance, on most-favored trade status--would  help a great deal.    Most importantly, Russia needs a clear, centralized policy  with respect to its next-door neighbors. People responsible for  the conduct of foreign policy and entrepreneurs must walk hand  in hand. This two lines should be brought together not in the  ministerial sense, but on a much more broad political and  practical scale.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 195.5&blank;Conversion to service subject to this part. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 195.5 regulates the conversion of steel pipelines to hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide service that is subject to part 195. Under &sect;195.5(a)(4), a converted pipeline must be hydrostatically tested to substantiate the maximum operating pressure (MOP) permitted by &sect;195.406. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 195.5(a)(4) actually uses the term ``maximum allowable operating pressure,'' but for consistency with &sect;195.406, this term is changed below to MOP by removing the word ``allowable.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To substantiate the MOP of a converted pipeline, an operator must know the pipe design pressure (see current &sect;195.406(a)(1)). Consequently, if pipe design pressure is unknown, a steel pipeline may not be converted under &sect;195.5. Although the design pressure of components is an MOP factor under &sect;195.406(a)(2), pipeline components are normally designed to be as strong or stronger than attached pipe. Thus, pipe design is the critical factor in substantiating MOP under &sect;195.5(a)(4), and lack of knowledge of component design pressure is not a significant safety concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSPA proposed to amend &sect;195.5 to permit conversion using an approach found in section 845.214 and Appendix N of ASME B31.8 for gas pipelines whose design pressure is unknown. Under this proposal, operators would pressure test the pipeline under Appendix N until pipe yield occurs. Instead of design pressure, this yield test pressure would be used to compute MOP by applying certain reduction factors to 80 percent of the first pressure that produces pipe yield.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All THLPSSC members who voted on the proposed amendment to &sect;195.5 supported it in concept. However, two members thought the wording of Appendix N should be copied directly into part 195 to avoid referencing a gas pipeline code in liquid pipeline regulations. We believe the principles of Appendix N apply equally to gas and liquid pipelines. And since the B31.8 Code is widely used, operators of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide pipelines will not find it difficult to obtain and apply Appendix N.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSPA received five comments on the proposed amendment to &sect;195.5. Two operators and a pipeline-related association agreed with the proposed amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One operator suggested that if pipelines operating at less than 20 percent of specified minimum yield strength (SMYS) are subject to &sect;195.5, RSPA should allow operators up to 10 years to meet the testing requirements. At present, none of the standards in part 195, including &sect;195.5, applies to pipelines operating at less than 20 percent of SMYS (see &sect;195.1(b)(3)). However, this commenter may have had in mind &sect;206 of the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;508), which provides that exceptions to regulations under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 (49 U.S.C. app. 2001  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), such as part 195, may not be based solely on low internal stress. Because of this statutory mandate, RSPA has proposed to apply part 195 to certain low-stress hazardous liquid pipelines (Docket PS&hyph;117; 58 FR 12213; March 3, 1993). Still, that proposal would not require any existing low-stress hazardous liquid pipeline to be tested under &sect;195.5, because such pipelines would not be converted pipelines. Of course, if part 195 becomes applicable to low stress pipelines, any pipeline converted to low stress hazardous liquid service subject to part 195 would have to be tested under &sect;195.5. But, since testing is the backbone of the conversion process, RSPA does not believe &sect;195.5 should be amended to extend the time for testing to 10 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A state agency was concerned that if test pressure must be measured at the high elevation point of test segments, the test could stress the low point of the segment beyond yield. However, the Appendix N test method should not result in overstress at the low elevation, because the method does not require increases in test pressure after the first yield occurs in the test segment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a separate rulemaking proceeding (Docket No. PS&hyph;124; 57 FR 39572; August 31, 1992), RSPA proposed to allow the use of the Appendix N method in converting pipelines to gas service under 49 CFR 192.14. This gas pipeline conversion standard is similar to &sect;195.5. Comments to that notice argued that pressure testing to yield is unnecessary to qualify certain pipelines that operate at low stress (generally pipelines 123/4 inches or less in nominal outside diameter operating at pressures of 200 psig or less). RSPA believes these comments are also relevant to hazardous liquid pipelines. All other factors being equal, hazardous liquid pipelines operating at low internal stress present less risk of failure from time-dependent defects than higher stress hazardous liquid pipelines. Because of the lower risk, RSPA has modified the final rule to provide that pipelines 123/4 inches or less in nominal outside diameter to be operated at a pressure of 200 psig or less may be converted without testing to yield. The MOP of such pipelines may be determined under &sect;195.406 by using 200 psig as pipe design pressure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule has been redrafted to improve clarity, to better relate conversion to design pressure and MOP under &sect;195.406, and to include the changes discussed supra. In the final rule, the proposed amendment to &sect;195.5(a)(1) is revised and published as an amendment to &sect;195.406(a)(1). This latter section deals specifically with pipe design pressure and MOP. As set forth infra, revised &sect;195.406(a)(1) provides that when pipe design pressure is unknown for steel pipelines being converted, a reduced value of first yield hydrostatic test pressure may be used as design pressure to compute MOP. If the pipeline to be converted is 123/4 inches or less in nominal outside diameter and is not yield tested, 200 psig may be used as design pressure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

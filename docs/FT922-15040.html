			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Fisons It was always likely that Fisons would choose an insider as its new chief executive. Much less obvious was why elevating Mr Cedric Scroggs would reassure investors that the group was on the mend, but in the event he has made an encouraging start. There is no denying the fine growth of Fisons' scientific instruments division under Mr Scroggs' leadership. Effecting a shake-up of the pharmaceuticals division will be a far tougher challenge. It is not just a question of his lack of experience in the technical world of drug marketing. There is also the immediate issue of restoring Fisons' reputation in the US. Mr Scroggs acknowledges that Fisons made mistakes in its relations with the Food and Drug Administration. The forthcoming FDA inspection of its Opticrom plant is an early opportunity to show investors that such errors can be put right. More generally, a strategy of focusing on defined areas such as respiratory drugs suggests a new realism about Fisons' size in the pharmaceuticals market. Other drugs will be developed by joint-marketing deals, raising the hope that partners will improve the performance of the division as a whole. It is too early to conclude that Fisons' management can change its spots, but at least Mr Scroggs has declared his intent.</p>

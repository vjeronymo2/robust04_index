			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / GM director says board has discussed post of chairman GENERAL Motors appeared yesterday to be preparing to oust its chairman, Mr Robert Stempel, as the company's top outside director admitted that the board was discussing the future leadership of the deeply troubled carmaker. GM's non-executive directors are believed to be unhappy at the slow pace of the restructuring of the group, designed to restore it to profits, taking place under Mr Stempel. His removal would send the company a blunt message of the urgency of change and could also mark the start of a much more radical restructuring programme. Mr John Smale, the non-executive director who heads the executive committee of the GM board, yesterday issued a statement in response to mounting press speculation that Mr Stempel would be asked to step down. He said the board had taken no action about any management changes. However he added that 'the question of executive leadership is a primary concern to the board of directors of any company and GM is no exception. The GM board of directors continues to carefully reflect upon the wisest course for assuring the most effective leadership for the corporation.' Significantly, the statement included no explicit words of support for Mr Stempel. It contrasted sharply with previous denials from GM spokesmen of moves to oust the chairman. The board is thought to be undecided who might best succeed Mr Stempel. One possibility is Mr Smale, the 63-year-old former chairman of Procter &amp; Gamble, who last April led a coup by non-executive directors, frustrated at the slow pace of change at GM, which clipped Mr Stempel's powers by removing him as head of the executive committee. The non-executives also replaced Mr Stempel's right hand man, Mr Lloyd Reuss, as president and head of the troubled North American auto operations with Mr John Smith, previously head of international operations. Mr Stempel was admitted to a hospital in Washington DC last week suffering from high blood pressure. He quickly returned to work, but directors might use the illness as a pretext for his resignation. The next scheduled meeting of the board is in New York on November 2. GM is expected next week to report third quarter losses of up to Dollars 850m (Pounds 520m) due to the inefficiency of its North American car operations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ghanaian contingent of ECOMOG [Economic  Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]  has reportedly arrested several truckloads of arms and  ammunition on the Monrovia- Buchanan Highway. According to the  reports, the consignment of arms and ammunition was intended for  the Liberian Peace Council [LPC], and was being escorted to  Buchanan by the Nigerian contingent of ECOMOG. This exposure by  the Ghanaian contingent proves what the NPFL [National Patriotic  Front of Liberia] and Africa Watch have revealed that the  Nigerian contingent of ECOMOG is the sole supplier of arms and  ammunition to the LPC in its onslaught against the Liberian  people in southeast Liberia.    In a related development, military personnel of the NPFL  recently intercepted large quantities of arms and ammunition  from members of the LPC, which had been delivered by the  Nigerian ECOMOG soldiers during late hours of the night.</p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEASING FIRM ORDERS JETS WORTH UP TO $5.2 BILLION  </P> <P> International Lease Finance, a major aircraft-leasing firm based in Beverly  Hills, said Tuesday that it has ordered 42 airliners worth $1.9 billion from  Airbus Industrie, McDonnell Douglas and Boeing and placed options for 67  additional planes worth $3.3 billion.  </P> <P> The company said it ordered 15 jetliners each from Boeing and McDonnell  Douglas, and 12 from Airbus, the European consortium.  </P> <P> In addition to the new orders and options, International Lease said it  exercised $1.055 billion worth of options for 24 Boeing jetliners, including 19  narrow-body 737s. International Lease acquired the options in May, 1988.  </P> <P> Tuesday's order is unusual for International Lease because it consists mainly  of options. Normally, firm orders dominate the company's aircraft purchase  plans. Buyers ordinarily pay a manufacturer less when they take an option than  when they place a firm order; if they decide later to go ahead with the  purchase, the option is converted to an order.  </P> <P> Steven F. Udvar-Hazy, president of International Lease, said the emphasis on  options reflects recent uncertainty in the airline industry caused by higher  fuel prices, deregulation in Europe and talk in Congress of a return to  regulation in this country. Most of the company's customers are airlines that  prefer to lease rather than own their planes.  </P> <P> "We feel this order leaves us well-hedged and gives us maneuvering room to  determine demand," Udvar-Hazy said.  </P> <P> International Lease split its order for narrow-body aircraft between Boeing and  McDonnell Douglas. St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas, which builds its  commercial airliners at its Douglas Aircraft subsidiary in Long Beach, was shut  out in 1988 when the leasing company ordered $6.6 billion worth of planes from  Boeing and Airbus.  </P> <P> However, Seattle-based Boeing stands to get the lion's share of Tuesday's  narrow-body order if all the options are exercised.  </P> <P> Udvar-Hazy said the company decided to order the 15 McDonnell Douglas  twin-engine MD-90s and take options on 15 more because the company already has  a large number of Douglas MD-80s in its fleet, and "we felt we needed something  to succeed the MD-80s going into the 1990s."  </P> <P> The MD-90 orders and options will give a boost for the Douglas jet, whose only  other customers so far are Delta Air Lines and Alaska Airlines. The plane is  early in its development stage, and the first one would be delivered to  International Lease in 1995.  </P> <P> The firm orders for the McDonnell Douglas planes were worth $565 million, and  the options totaled $560 million.  </P> <P> International Lease ordered eight Boeing 737s and took options on 24 others  because, Udvar-Hazy said, the aircraft is popular with many customers.  International Lease took options on a total of 48 Boeing aircraft, including  747s, 767s and 757s. The company said the firm orders were worth $795 million,  and the new options were worth $2.59 billion. International Lease said delivery  would begin in 1995.  </P> <P> From Airbus Industrie, International Lease ordered 12 A321-100s worth $510  million and placed options for four more, worth $170 million, for delivery in  1995.  </P></p>

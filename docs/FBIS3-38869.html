But it will not be a routine meeting  because it will have to reply to the UN secretary general's  request to authorize, if necessary, the air strikes which have  been under discussion since the Americans suggested resorting to  them last August. In addition, it will not have escaped  anyone's notice that the EC's Council of Foreign Ministers  officially referred the handling of the Bosnian crisis to the  alliance.    It is true that NATO seems to be the only instrument which  can be used if there are to be strikes against targets in  Bosnia. But, in the present context, which is that of great  pressure being exerted by public opinion following the massacre  in the Sarajevo market, it is difficult to avoid the impression  that political decisionmaking centers, which still claim to be  handling the Bosnian problem, are only too pleased to  temporarily pass on the "hot potato" to the alliance.    According to a top official, the ambassadors' official  meeting this Wednesday (after two days of unofficial contacts  and a luncheon for the 16 heads of mission on 8 February) should  not give rise to differences of opinion. The preparatory  discussions have helped to smooth them over, to the extent that  a positive response to Mr. Butrus-Ghali's request is expected.  Of course, after publishing in several official communiques  their readiness to "launch air strikes," the allies would find  it difficult to go back on their promises. London, Ottawa, and  even Athens (which on 8 February) flattered itself on having  held back the "hysterical improvisations" of the advocates of  force) will thus very probably be forced to once again brandish  the threat of an air strike.    NATO is expected to refuse; but, as a high-ranking diplomat  remarked, all aspects of the problem must be taken into  consideration. Indeed, there is still a great difference  between accepting a state of alert in theory, although this term  is not part of alliance jargon, and an actual strike.  Therefore, just because NATO gives its formal agreement to  placing its forces at the UN secretary general's disposal, that  does not mean that the latter will use them. The room to  maneuver between these two possibilities remains large; and it  is on this that the allies are counting, providing a way out of  the embarrassing situation into which the Sarajevo market  massacre has placed them.    In short, the response of the UN secretary general, whose  room to maneuver is reduced because of Moscow's potential veto,  could merely be a new transitional stage in a process which has  made patience a cardinal virtue. The Western countries hope  that the Serbian irregulars will take account of that; moreover,  in Atlantic circles, it is stressed that Wednesday's meeting  gives nobody the feeling that they are being caught up in a  spiral of military action.</p>

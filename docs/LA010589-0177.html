			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE COLLEGES;  </P> <P> GOLDEN WEST FORFEITS 11 VICTORIES  </P> <P> The Golden West College women's basketball team has forfeited 11 victories this  season because it used an ineligible player, assistant Coach Dave Stricklin  said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Kim Wilson, a sophomore guard, was not included on the list of eligible players  submitted to the Orange Empire Conference for the first half of the season but  played because Golden West Coach Dick Stricklin thought she had been included  on the list, Dave Stricklin said.  </P> <P> Golden West drops from 18-3 to 7-14 overall.  </P> <P> Wilson is eligible for second-semester games, which include Golden West's first  conference game Wednesday. Golden West defeated Riverside, 111-54, and Wilson  scored 18 points.  </P> <P> "It's really unfortunate," Dave Stricklin said. "But it doesn't affect us in  conference, and that's what determines if you make the playoffs.  </P> <P> "It might be a big deal to some people, but the team isn't upset about it all.  We are fine and ready to play now." STEVE KRESAL  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT IN MURDERS FACED EARLIER CHARGES;  </P> <P> CRIME: THE MAN CHARGED WITH KILLING THREE FORMER CO-WORKERS IN TUSTIN HAD BEEN  ACCUSED EARLIER OF CRIMES IN RIVERSIDE AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES.  </P> <P> The man accused of murdering three former co-workers in Tustin has been wanted  by Southland police for more than a year for allegedly punching a motorist in  Riverside County, as well as stealing vehicles and fleeing from authorities in  San Bernardino County, officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> "It seems to me that if we'd put more effort into catching this guy in the  first place," said Don Unkenholz of Corona, whose trailer was allegedly stolen  by Greg Sturm in late 1989, "then three young men might be alive today."  </P> <P> Sturm, 20, was arrested last week in connection with the Aug. 19  execution-style murders of three workers at a Super Shops automotive parts  store in Tustin. Authorities allege Sturm killed the young men while robbing  the store to support his drug habit.  </P> <P> "We knew a year ago that this Greg Sturm had problems," Unkenholz asserted.  "There were warning signs, but we ignored them."  </P> <P> But Southland authorities countered that the handling of Sturm's case is only a  reflection of a judicial system that has been slowed by gridlocked courts and  overcrowded jails.  </P> <P> "You can always speculate in hindsight," said Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty.  Lew Rosenblum, who will prosecute Sturm when he reappears in court Sept. 7 to  face charges of murder, robbery and burglary.  </P> <P> "But unfortunately, there are thousands and thousands of arrest warrants out  throughout the state, and you have to work the biggest ones. It's a question of  priorities," he said.  </P> <P> Added San Bernardino County Deputy Dist. Atty. Vic Stull, whose office brought  misdemeanor theft charges against Sturm in 1989: "We just don't have the  resources to track all these people down.  </P> <P> "Generally, misdemeanors are not actively sought. If we get a tip and we know  exactly where the person is, we can go get him. But otherwise, we've had  warrants go for years, literally. With a guy like this, with what we had before  us, he did not appear then to be a homicidal risk, so we couldn't spare the  time and people to track him down."  </P> <P> In May, 1989, a warrant was put out for Sturm's arrest in Riverside County  after he allegedly fled the scene of a roadside confrontation. He was charged  with assault and battery for allegedly punching another motorist in the face  during an argument.  </P> <P> A warrant for Sturm's arrest was issued again in October, 1989 -- this time, in  San Bernardino County after he failed to show up in court on charges of  receiving stolen property and evading arrest. Arrested with two juveniles, he  had allegedly stolen trailers with off-road vehicles on them, then fled when  approached by a police officer.  </P> <P> Misdemeanor charges were lodged against him in both incidents.  </P> <P> Now, however, he faces the gas chamber if a jury finds that he bound three  former co-workers at the Super Shops store, shot each of them in the head at  close range and took $1,100 from the store.  </P> <P> Described by employers and neighbors as hot-headed and combative, Sturm had  been fired from the store just a few weeks before the murders and returned to  the scene of the crime the day after with a friend.  </P></p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Dollar hits new low against D-Mark: Pound pushed nearer ERM floor European shares fall on fears of interest rate rises A FRESH WAVE of investment in the D-Mark yesterday pushed the dollar to a new low against the German currency and depressed share prices across Europe on fears of increased interest rates. The stronger D-Mark created further tension in the European exchange rate mechanism, depressing several of the weaker currencies against the D-Mark and pushing both sterling and the Italian lira closer to their ERM floors. The pound's London close against the D-Mark of DM2.7825 was its lowest level since Britain joined the ERM in October 1990. However, the dollar's weakness pushed the pound above the Dollars 2 level during the day for the sec ond time in two weeks. In London, the pound later finished a shade lower at Dollars 1.9970, up slightly less than 1 cent on the day, although it ended in New York at Dollars 2.002. Early today in Tokyo it was quoted at Dollars 2.0035. The stronger D-Mark triggered widespread investor disquiet at the prospect of higher interest rates in Europe at a time when economic activity is generally weak. On the London stock market, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares finished 14.2 points down at 2,298.4, just above the day's lows. Bourses in Paris, Frankfurt and Milan all fell by between 0.6 per cent and 1.6 per cent. The move out of dollars into D-Marks was assisted by a report from the US National Association of Purchasing Managers, which underlined the slow nature of the US economic recovery. If pressure continues on weak ERM currencies, including the pound, lira and French franc, European central banks may be forced to support them. That would happen either by the central banks intervening on the foreign exchanges to buy the currencies, or by lifting borrowing rates. As investors switched funds from dollars into D-Marks, the US currency fell to a new all-time low of DM1.3895. Although it later gained ground slightly, by the New York close it remained more than 1 pfennig below Monday's close at DM1.39. In early Tokyo trading today it was quoted at DM1.3892. Against the D-Mark, the pound drifted down during the day, losing more than half a pfennig. It closed in London within half a pfennig of its ERM floor against the D-Mark of DM2.7780, before firming slightly in New York to DM2.7840. The lira also came under pressure, closing in London at L764.6 to the D-Mark, down from L763.75 the previous night and close to its floor of L765.40. European stock markets were given little help from Wall Street where, in quiet trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shifted only weakly to higher levels. At the close in New York it stood at 3,266.26, up 8.91. On the currency markets, there was no clear sign of central bank intervention to support either the dollar or sterling in generally thin trading. However, at one stage in European trading, the dollar was lifted by unsubstantiated rumours of intervention by the US Federal Reserve to buy dollars for D-Marks. Traders reported widespread selling of dollars for D-Marks from international currency investors, particularly large fund management groups. Such investors have recently bought D-Marks in volume because of the big difference between German and US interest rates. In Britain, the three-month interbank rate, an indicator of where the market thinks base rates are moving, remained at about 10 1/2 per cent. That indicated perceptions that base rates, now at 10 per cent, are likely to move up by  1/2 a point in the near future.

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Week Ahead Sears, the retailing group behind such names as Selfridges, Wallis, Dolcis and Olympus, the most interesting number at Tuesday's interims will not be the profit figure of about Pounds 20m before tax and exceptionals, but the size of the latter item and the fate of the dividend. Opinion is split over whether the 1.525p payment will be held. Having sold the menswear division and warned of an accompanying Pounds 82m extraordinary charge, Sears will probably deal with its other problem division, footwear, above the line. One analyst estimated Pounds 40m to Pounds 50m of exceptional costs for the restructuring of the British Shoe Corporation. Forte, the hotels group, announces half-year results on Thursday with City forecasts ranging widely from pre-tax profits of Pounds 25m to Pounds 40m, compared with last year's Pounds 42m. Attention will be focused on the prospect of senior management changes. Although analysts do not expect any immediate word on the possible retirement of chairman Lord Forte, the group might announce the appointment of some non-executive directors. Results on Friday from Amstrad, the electronics and computer company, are expected to show a loss for the year to June 30 of about Pounds 70m. The company's PC business, which provides it with the bulk of its revenue, has been battered as the industry's major players have been engaged in an all-out price war. The company might cut or pass its dividend. Even if one were paid, it would not dent Amstrad's Pounds 100m cash pile. However, given Alan Sugar's stated interest in buying back the shares at 30p, and the expected size of the company's loss, many analysts expect the dividend to be passed.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: CU raises Pounds 17m for green trust COMMERCIAL Union, the insurance group, yesterday announced that it was raising Pounds 16.9m via a placement of shares to launch a new investment trust. Most of the shares have been taken by institutions, as had always been CU's intention but a small proportion has gone to large intermediaries. The CU Environmental Trust will aim for long-term capital growth from investments in companies which benefit from new environmental protection expenditure. There will be no geographical limitations. Listing particulars were published yesterday for the issue of 17.5m ordinary shares at 100p each, with warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis providing the right to buy shares at 100p at annual intervals over the next 10 years. Dealings are expected to start next Friday, April 3. The trust will be managed by CU Investment Management, which will receive an annual management fee of 0.75 per cent, plus an initial fee of Pounds 40,000 (exclusive of VAT). James Capel will act as sponsor and stockbroker.</p>

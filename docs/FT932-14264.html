			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / PowerGen opens Pounds 290m gas plant THE THREAT to coal mining from gas was underlined yesterday when PowerGen became the first of the two large electricity generators officially to open a combined cycle gas turbine power station. The 900MW output of Killingholme, on Humberside, is equivalent to that produced from a station supplied by two large coal mines. It is the first of three combined cycle stations planned by PowerGen. National Power, the other large generator, is building a gas-fired station on a site adjacent to PowerGen's Killingholme plant. All but one of the 12 regional electricity companies are involved in building combined cycle stations. Enron, the US company, recently opened a 1,875MW plant on Teeside. Combined-cycle stations use exhaust gases from a gas turbine to power a steam turbine, thereby reducing emissions. Mr Ed Wallis, PowerGen chief executive, said yesterday that Killingholme, built at a cost of more than Pounds 290m, would probably not have been built unless the electricity industry had been privatised. 'Privatisation really gave the board the right to manage, to do what it believed was commercially right,' he said. At privatisation, 'we inherited power stations that were on average 20 years old. They were predominantly coal. Fuel was expensive and dirty. When you compare combined cycle stations to coal equivalents it is difficult to see the disadvantages,' Mr Wallis said. Meanwhile, Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, yesterday warned that even more jobs would have to go from the coal industry if was to become fully competitive with imports. 'If we are prepared to accept the assistance of the taxpayer to allow us to become yet more efficient, then we must accept that there will be a price to pay,' he said. British Gas has completed its second gas auction, offering supplies to 102 companies that applied for gas under the release programme agreed by the company as a way of encouraging competition.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Attitude to work of young Japanese is 'laziness' Sir, As a 29-year-old Japanese salaryman currently staying in London, I read with great interest the feature on the changing work ethic in my home country ('More than the job's worth', October 16). I welcome that Japanese businessmen now feel there is more to life - such as sense of achievement and satisfaction - than honourable sacrifice in the service of a big-name company. But not all of them could be labelled 'corporate slaves'. Some were 'corporate fighters' who sincerely and voluntarily did their best to make their family, company and eventually country happier. I thank them and am proud of their hard work in the past 45 years which reconstructed war-devastated Japan, with few natural resources, as a major economic power. I share the concern of Mr Kusamitsu, of Tokyo University, that Japan's corporate strength, partly built on the devotion of my father's generation, might be weakened due to the new work ethic. What irritates me is that, recently, it seems trendy among the younger generation in Japan to have less aspiration for a career and more inclination for hobbies. Some even say hard work is out of fashion now. This does not, as they claim, have anything to do with creativity or fairness: it is just laziness. They should not have less ambition for a job at a time of deep recession, but should aspire more to worthwhile jobs, to which they can show commitment.

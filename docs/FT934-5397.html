			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Railtrack delays pricing after row with Treasury Railtrack, the company which will run Britain's rail infrastructure from next April, has delayed announcing its prices because of a dispute with the Treasury. The company believes the value of its assets, set at around Pounds 7bn by British Rail, is no more than Pounds 5bn and could be as little as Pounds 3bn. The dispute has prompted Sir Alastair Morton, chairman of Eurotunnel and head of the government's private finance working group, to offer his services as an arbitrator between the two sides. A downward revaluation of Railtrack's assets would enable the company to set lower prices for the use of its track. It believes lower charges would encourage more private operators and BR management buy-outs to bid for franchises under the government's rail privatisation initiative. But in spite of backing by the Department of Transport, which would like Railtrack to announce its pricing as soon as possible, the Treasury has refused to countenance revaluation of the assets. The Treasury believes that on a replacement cost basis the track is worth at least Pounds 7bn. Furthermore, it argues that higher prices for private operators to use railway lines would be offset by government subsidies. Private sector train operators have warned that if charges are too high they will be unable to offer a competitive service. Many fear that subsidies could be clawed back in the future by the Treasury. Railtrack is also in dispute with the Treasury over the rate of return the company should earn from the government's investment. The Treasury is adamant that Railtrack's rate of return should be set at 8 per cent, while the company is arguing that 5 per cent would be more appropriate. The differences between the two sides are worth hundreds of millions of pounds to Railtrack. Eight per cent of assets valued at Pounds 7bn is Pounds 560m compared with Pounds 250m on a 5 per cent return from assets which are valued at Pounds 5bn. Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack chairman, is expected to continue to argue that he should have greater freedom from the financial limits that apply to nationalised industries. He is not expected to announce the company's pricing structure until the new year. Tube breakdown, Page 10</p>

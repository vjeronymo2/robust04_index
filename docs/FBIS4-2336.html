			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Chen Jiaying (7115 1367 3841)] </F>   [Text] Lisbon, 7 Apr (XINHUA) -- When interviewed by  XINHUA on the eve of his visit to China, Portugal's Prime  Minister Cavaco Silva stressed that the Portuguese Government  hopes relations with China can develop further in all areas.    The Portuguese prime minister said his trip to China has two  major purposes: namely, promoting the development of bilateral  relations, including economic relations, and commemorating the  seventh anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint  Declaration on the Macao issue.    Silva indicated that one priority of Portugal's foreign  policy is to develop relations with China. He said the Chinese  Government also attaches great importance to developing  relations with Portugal; this can be proved by Premier Li Peng's  visit to Lisbon in 1992 and President Jiang Zemin and Vice  President Rong Yiren's visits in 1993.    Silva maintained that China, being a major country in the  Far  East and the world, deserves full access to worldwide economic,  political, and cultural relations. He said China has achieved  tremendous success in economic development, reform, and opening  up; China's impressive economic growth will help the merger of  China and the world's economies.    As regards bilateral relations, Silva said the fact that 60  Portuguese entrepreneurs will join him in visiting China shows  that Portugal hopes to expand the two countries' trade volume  and develop cooperation between Portuguese and Chinese  enterprises in making direct investments and establishing joint  ventures. He indicated the future is extremely favorable for  Portugal and China to develop economic and trade relations, and  the two countries can develop cooperation in telecommunications,  banking, infrastructure, and other areas. This should be a new  way for promoting the development of the two countries' economic  relations, he stated.    On the Macao issue, Silva stressed that the signing by  himself and the Chinese premier in April 1987 of the Joint  Declaration by the Chinese and Portuguese Governments on the  Macao issue was an important historical event because a  historical problem was resolved as a result of the declaration.  He said that, regarding the Macao issue, the Portuguese  Government has three basic objectives to achieve: stability,  progress, and building confidence in the future. He said: "The  operations of the Portuguese-Chinese Liaison Group are  proceeding normally. The second half of Macao's transitional  period will be a smooth one."    Commenting on international issues, the Portuguese prime  minister said the Asia-Pacific region--particularly China--has  become a world center enjoying high economic growth, and the  gradual integration of Asia-Pacific economies has intensified  these countries' extraordinary development. The development of  economic and trade relations between the European Union and  Asia-Pacific countries will be beneficial to both sides.    Silva pointed out that although the European Union has  encountered certain problems and obstacles in its construction,  it still has achieved significant progress. He expects the  economy of West Europe will be able to begin a new cycle of  growth by the end of this year.    In conclusion, Prime Minister Silva stressed that Portugal  attaches great importance to problems between the north and  south, and that Portugal has constantly reminded European  countries not to forget the south.</p>

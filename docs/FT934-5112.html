			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Their Budget - The student Jennie Gentles, 29 Attends: North London University and lives in a two-bedroomed flat in Streatham, south London Only source of income: maintenance grant from Croydon Borough Council, and her main outgoings are rent and books for her social sciences postgraduate degree course Politics: did not vote in the last election. Next time will vote Labour Wanted: a bigger grant and for the chancellor to address worries about the National Health Service. She feared VAT on books Said yesterday: 'There are so many students already living on the poverty line: his move from grants to loans means the poor will be penalised. It will create a two tier education system. The pounds 1.5bn for the NHS isn't enough. It needs a higher input; they've already dismantled the welfare state.'</p>

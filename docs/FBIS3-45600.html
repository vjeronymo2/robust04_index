Disciplinary sanctions were taken against 17,000-odd  government employees, of which 32 were department-level  officials, 378 county- level officials, said Cao Qingze,  minister of supervision.    Exactly 1,031 of them were handed to the judicial sector for  further investigation and prosecution, Cao said as he was  reporting his work today at the annual inspection conference of  delegates to the National People's Congress, China's supreme  legislative body.    He said the supervisory bodies have been focusing in 1993 on  corruption cases -- involving officials and other employees in  Communist Party organizations, government bodies, executive law-  enforcing branches and economic management sectors.    The corruption cases usually embraced the abuse of power,  taking bribes, graft, smuggling and moral degeneration.    He said that after a year of hard work, corruptive practices  had been kept "within certain limits", which he believed should  "play an important role" in maintaining China's political  stability and safeguarding its reform and opening to the world.    China's anti-corruption drive is going the right way, he  said. "Better results will be achieved provided that it is  persistent," he added.    The central government cancelled 143 illegal fees and  charges  imposed on citizens last year, said the minister, adding that  "active measures" have been enforced to ban officials from  making personal trips abroad at government expense.    Moreover, Cao said, government officials above county-level  have been asked to collectively check their own corruptive  practices, if any.    Most of the problems checked out have been handled according  to the state laws and decrees; others are being investigated  under the supervision of the ministry, Cao said.    The minister promised that all supervisory bodies in the  country will continue to further the anti-corruption drive, in  line with decisions made by the Central Committee of the  Communist Party of China.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Venezuela rights threat President Rafael Caldera of Venezuela raised the stakes in his battle with Congress at the weekend, saying that the losing side in a proposed referendum - the administration or the Congress - should resign. The confrontation erupted last Friday when a joint session of Congress voted to restore five out of six constitutional rights which Mr Caldera had suspended 24 days earlier. Later on Friday, the executive said that it had suspended the same rights again. These grant protection against arbitrary arrest and police entry into private homes, the right to free movement in and outside national territory, the right to own property, and protection against expropriation without due process and indemnity. The administration asserted that conditions were not yet right for the restoration of these liberties, ordinarily suspended only during civil or military upheaval. In announcing the renewed suspension, Mr Caldera said he would be willing to call a national referendum on the suspension. After an opposition politician had said the government should resign if a majority rejected the president's line, Mr Caldera asserted that Congress should resign if the referendum supported him. This has annoyed Congress, which is controlled by three political parties (Democratic Action, Copei and Radical Cause) in opposition to Mr Caldera. One Democratic Action member warned that his party might call for a vote of censure against several members of the president's cabinet. With the constitutional rights suspended, the adminstration has raided food stores in search of 'profiteers' and 'hoarders', confiscated property alleged to be linked to bank fraud, seized merchandise over illegal price increases, and rounded up hundreds of suspected law-breakers in the cities.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Sutherland names deputies Mr Peter Sutherland yesterday announced the appointment of his three deputies, Frances Williams reports from Geneva. They are Mr Warren Lavorel, former US chief negotiator for the Uruguay Round, Mr Anwarul Hoda, special secretary for trade policy in the Indian Commerce Ministry, and Mr Jesus Seade, Mexico's ambassador to Gatt. Mr Sutherland had said on Wednesday the appointments would be based 'fundamentally on merit', but the need for balance between regions and between industrialised and developing countries would be heeded. One deputy has traditionally been a US national, the second an Indian. The new third post was widely expected to go to a Latin American, as part of the horse-trading over the appointment of the Irish Mr Sutherland.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Technology: The little guys think big / A look at how small companies can improve their R&amp;D strategies THE easiest way to check the freshness of the eggs you buy used to be to peer at them in a strong light. The latest option is to check the sell-by date stamped on their shells. The new freshness test is of particular interest to Linx Printing Technologies as a potential source of new business. Linx, based in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, is one of a handful of specialists in the Pounds 250m worldwide market for continuous ink-jet printers - machines placed at the end of production lines to print bar codes or sell-by dates on boxes or bottles. While ink-jet printing flourished in the 1980s with changes in European Community consumer laws on sell-by dates, both Linx and UK rival Domino Printing Sciences have recently warned that profits will not reach expectations this year, largely because of the recession in Europe and the impending maturity in the market - although Linx admits to what chairman Derek Harris calls 'structural problems on the marketing side'. That market maturity, twinned with the knowledge that many small companies go through a cycle of rapid development and then become ossified, has been the impetus behind Linx's decision to re-assess the strength of its research and development. To ensure it becomes more than just a one-product company, Linx is looking for new technology areas as well as exploring new markets for ink-jet technology. 'The future of our business lies in continuing to develop the technology,' Harris says. Six months ago the company, which now has a staff of 175, set up a pure research group of seven - the same number of people the company had when it started back in 1987. 'We're hopefully trying to recreate the environment which created the original product,' says Hillar Weinberg, Linx's technical director. 'We felt we weren't doing enough fundamental research. We felt we had to put in more research to stay ahead.' The development team has also been re-focused. 'In the first year development was easy,' Weinberg jokes. 'There weren't any disturbances: there weren't any customers.' But as the business grew Linx's development staff was pulled into the area of customer support, explains Weinberg, extending development times. The solution has been to set up a separate support team, and draw a line between the development and support activities. Elaine Pullen, engineering director, acknowledges that seven pure research staff to investigate both ink-jet printing and emerging technologies is small: 'Once there are some ideas that look promising then we can put more resources in.' George Weiss, chairman and managing director of medical equipment maker pneuPAC, a company with a turnover of Pounds 14m, says he has a completely different problem. 'We have more ideas than we can cope with. The real problem is to balance R&amp;D production and marketing.' Luton-based pneuPAC specialises in pneumatically controlled ventilation equipment for emergency use - 95 per cent of British ambulances carry the ventilators. Like Linx, which sells 80 per cent of its equipment overseas, pneuPAC is a big exporter, with 50 per cent of sales going abroad. And both companies cite Japan as one of their largest overseas markets - Linx even makes a machine with a Japanese keyboard. Compared with Linx's adventurous approach to R&amp;D, pneuPAC's product development is meticulously thought through. When a new product is mooted it is closely scrutinised in order to minimise the development costs. To do this Weiss and his colleagues break each product down into standard component parts. This also increases reliability in a sector where a faulty part can cost lives. 'We design the overall product range and then work backwards to individual parts. We look for the maximum number of standard elements,' Weiss explains. 'We have to ask: is this incremental, building on our expertise?' Because all the development work is done in-house, Weiss believes several advantages accrue. Competing products can be developed in parallel and the marketing department can work closely with those doing the R&amp;D. Weiss prides himself on listening to potential customers and building their needs into the next range of products. 'We're very conscious of market needs as they are implied or clearly stated.' Much of the 8 per cent of pneuPAC's turnover that is re-invested in R&amp;D is spent on the 'D' rather than the 'R'. But Weiss argues that although the company does not invent new principles, it does apply them effectively. As an example he points to the company's latest product, a neonatal transport ventilator. The design contains many of the standard parts but also incorporates a vortex amplifier, which measures how fluids flow through orifices, necessary for the resuscitation of new-born babies. Unlike Linx's Weinberg, who argues that small companies have to believe they will one day become a Microsoft or a General Motors, Weiss believes one of the big dangers for small companies is 'going over the top' and trying to develop a product it does not have the capability to market. He is speaking from experience. Three-and-a-half years ago Weiss bought a company that specialised in microprocessor-controlled anaesthesia equipment and he then spent Pounds 500,000 completing the development of a machine to measure the parameters needed by an anaesthetist in an operating theatre. The work complete, Weiss decided to mothball the project. His fears were that the company was not big enough to take on the multinational corporations that comprised the competition. 'It was a large market where the upside could be huge but so could the downside. I took the decision that we weren't big enough. As a small company we have to look at niche technical environments.' Linx faces few such problems. Because ink-jet printing is a niche technology that combines engineering with electronics and the chemical skills to develop specialised inks, it is an area that has been largely spurned by the big industrial manufacturers. Of the top handful of ink-jet printer manufacturers, all are specialist companies with the exception of the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi. For many small companies, though, it is simply a matter of time before the giant players in the market realise there is money to be made and enter the same field. Such was the case for S&amp;S International, which specialises in software to detect computer viruses. But, says operations manager David Banes, the company has seen off many of its larger competitors and is still the market leader in Europe. S&amp;S issues a new version of its Dr Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit every month. The latest release can detect 3,077 different viruses, whereas the equivalent product a year ago only needed to detect 2,160. Although the scope of S&amp;S's research programme is determined by factors outside its control - the number of new viruses created - like pneuPAC it relies on feedback from its customers and distributors to help focus its development programme and determine which viruses should be tackled. Once a new virus is targeted, researchers in S&amp;S's virus laboratory write a description of it using a specially developed language. This enables the engine at the heart of the anti-virus software to detect it when it appears in a company's software. S&amp;S also uses the virus laboratory as a marketing tool, taking potential customers there to show them how the product is developed. 'Ninety per cent of customers come out having bought our product,' Banes says. Banes believes the company's swift reactions in the development of new software should keep it ahead of the field. And, like Weiss, he thinks continued success will depend on the company carrying out innovative R&amp;D within the sector it knows best. The jury is still out on whether Linx's bolder approach will also prove the more successful.</p>

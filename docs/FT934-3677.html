			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Managers face tough task to persuade angry opponents Senior management at the Lloyd's insurance market will be hard-pressed to persuade Names to accept yesterday's settlement offer, judging by reaction from the leaders of Names' action group leaders. Copies of the 200-page offer document will reach 21,000 Names in the next few days and they will have just more than six weeks to consider its implications. Lloyd's said yesterday that a 'substantial majority' of Names would need to vote for the deal for it to go ahead. It is understood that this would need acceptance by Names whose claims represent more than 70 per cent by value of those considered in the offer. Early indications are against this. Names on syndicates specialising in liability business, which have been hit hard by claims from asbestosis and pollution, get least out of the offer and were predictably negative. About 4,000 Names on Merrett syndicate 418 have been offered only Pounds 44.1m against losses of nearly Pounds 170m - even though part of their case against agents was adjudged in the offer document to have a strong chance in court. Mr John Mays, deputy chairman of the Merrett 418 action group, said: 'We may well recommend they reject it.' He was particularly worried by the absence of any cap on future claims still arising on the syndicate's 1985 accounts. One prominent member of another long-tail syndicate - Pulbrook syndicate 334  -which has been offered about Pounds 2.5m compensation for losses of about Pounds 80m, said: 'They have irritated the long-tail groups by tilting the settlement offer in favour of the spiral Names. I fear they've blown it.' More worrying for Lloyd's is the tough response yesterday from both Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, and Mr Colin Hook, chairman of the Feltrim Names Association, whose members have most to gain from the deal. Both men successfully persuaded Lloyd's to load the settlement in favour of their action groups, and in statements yesterday refrained from outright condemnation. Even so it appears that the final offer - between 30p and 40p in the pound for most Gooda Names, for example - falls short of their expectations. Mr Deeny said: 'There has been an effort to mitigate the position of the Gooda Names. Our solicitors are considering the offer but I doubt very much whether we will be able to recommend it.' Mr Deeny is critical of the form in which awards will be made. Lloyd's will issue special credits, two months after the offer becomes unconditional, which would be used to discharge debts to the central fund, or be paid into balances for the Names to pass the 1993 solvency test this month. The credits would also be used to offset payments already made to Names by stop-loss underwriters. Mr Deeny was one of five Names' representatives, including two alternate members, who did not sign the report of the financial panel. Mr Hook, Mr Christopher Stockwell, the chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations Working Party, Mr Neil Shaw, chairman of the Association of Lloyd's Members, and Sir Adam Ridley were the others. Mr Hook said he was satisfied that the legal panel recognised that Feltrim had a strong case in law. Like Mr Deeny, however, he said the potential deterioration of the syndicates' results in future years was not considered. The deal gave protection to errors and omissions insurers but 'will not provide our members with a commensurate benefit'. In the end much may depend on the results of general meetings of both groups next month. Because of the constitutions of both Feltrim and Gooda Walker, the results of these could bind more than 5,000 of the worst-hit lossmaking Names to either accept or reject the deal. The omens are not auspicious.</p>

			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: FILLMORE;  </P> <P> CITY LOANS BRING HOUSES UP TO CODE  </P> <P> When Alice Villa-Gomez moved into her house on Fillmore's 3rd Street in 1982,  she and her husband planned to fix things little by little. The roof leaked,  the floors sagged, the plumbing and wiring needed repair, and the house had  neither heat nor insulation.  </P> <P> But as the couple's five children grew, so did their monthly bills, and the  family despaired of accomplishing its goals.  </P> <P> "We could see we weren't getting anywhere," Villa-Gomez said.  </P> <P> Today, thanks to Fillmore's housing rehabilitation program, which provides  low-interest loans to bring houses up to health and safety codes, the  remodeling is scheduled to be complete by October.  </P> <P> "It's going to be like getting a whole new house," Villa-Gomez said.  </P> <P> Fillmore's Redevelopment Agency initiated the program in April, 1989.  </P> <P> The Villa-Gomez house in North Fillmore is in one of three target areas that  include about 500 houses.  </P> <P> City Manager Roy Payne said loans of $15,000 at 5% interest are available to  families of four with a gross income of under $54,250 or couples with incomes  under $43,000. The city has budgeted $675,000 for the project.  </P> <P> Recipients of the loans may also qualify for a grant of up to $5,000 for  cosmetic improvements, including paint and landscaping, Payne said.  </P> <P> "We want to see people take pride in their neighborhoods," he said.  </P> <P> In some cases, larger loans have been given and there are a variety of  repayment schemes, including deferred payment of interest. "We try to tailor it  to the individual," Payne said.  </P> <P> Only six homeowners have applied for funding. Payne said that rehabilitation  programs are typically slow for the first 18 months, but that the city will  follow up notices sent to homeowners last year with reminders about the loans.  </P> <P> Chris Ellsworth was enthusiastic about work recently completed on her house.  Her loan paid for insulation, double-paned windows, new plumbing and electrical  wiring, a driveway and vinyl siding.  </P> <P> "I got everything I asked for," Ellsworth said. "It's the best thing that ever  happened to me." JANET BERGAMO  </P></p>

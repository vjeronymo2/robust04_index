			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Leading Article: A very American recovery A SECOND good month of consumer spending growth in the US, which reflects rising consumer confidence, gives some ground at last for believing the US recovery is here to stay. But even now, six months into the uptrend, there are grounds for caution. Consumer spending will almost certainly weaken this month, due to vile weather, and real disposable income is only one per cent up on the last full year. The housing market continues a vigorous bounce back from a very deep slump, but other sectors remain weak - commercial building, defence, and recently exports, the main driving force in the recovery, until recession began to depress overseas demand. Modified rapture, then. With one voice, the governors of the Federal Reserve have said that they expect future progress to be sluggish, and hinted that they are still alert to the possible need for further stimulus. There is still little sign of employment growth, which may be needed to sustain confidence; but inflation remains as subdued as ever, allowing the authorities some room for manoeuvre. In short, this is still, up to this point, a weak recovery by normal US standards, and certainly well short of the vigour which the president longs to see - hence the administration's renewed calls for further interest rate cuts. Cautious view However, this could well prove too cautious a view, reflecting only an over-correction by forecasters. The revised fourth quarter GDP figures contain the explanation: a considerable and no doubt unwanted build-up in wholesale and retail inventories. In other words, and not for the first time, the distributive trades jumped the gun on a forecast of recovery. As these stocks are cleared, demand should feed through more rapidly to output. The important feature of the employment figures is not that they still show no growth, as the pessimists have stressed, but that they have stopped getting worse. The fear of unemployment - the biggest brake on spending - is fading in most parts of the US. The south is already enjoying a much more vigorous upturn. And there are good reasons to hope that as the usual cyclical recoveries in consumer durables and investment gather force, this will be at least within the range of normal cyclical recoveries, which suggests a real growth rate of at least 3 1/2 per cent. Even if this is too optimistic, the present US outlook, as seen from Berlin or Tokyo, and above all from London, looks enviable. America's trade partners may be hoping that the traditional locomotive of world growth is once again getting up steam, but it is far too early to call this hope realistic. The structure of demand in the recovery, led by housing, household durables and cars, will have its main initial impact on US domestic industry, as soon as still excessive inventories are cleared, and on its geographically nearest partners - Canadian lumber, and the branch factories growing so rapidly in Latin America. Weak dollar Above all, the continued gross under-valuation of the dollar will make it difficult for exporters from Europe or Japan to get much benefit from rising US demand. The European motor industry, for example, had suffered heavy losses in market share before the recession. In some capital-intensive industries, such as pulp and paper, recovery may even make the competitive position still worse, as rising output lowers US unit costs. Indeed, the thinking which relies on US recovery to trigger growth in the rest of the world is dangerously out of date. It looks back to two misleading precedents - the Bretton Woods world of nearly fixed exchange rates, and the Reagan episode of heroic fiscal stimulus, which made the US the world's largest capital importer. The best precedent for the present conjuncture is neither of these, but the era of competitive devaluations in the 1930s. Japan is facing the consequences of a deliberate domestic disinflation, while Europe has collectively decided against following the US example of monetary stimulus in a free float - and would be joining in a zero-sum game if it tried. A US recovery is much better news than a US recession, but does not alter the fact that America's trade partners must work out their own salvation.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEARNING MATERIALS DONATED TO SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Acting on the premise that greater literacy is a key to fighting juvenile crime  and lowering school dropout rates, a Westside group is providing dictionaries,  books and other learning materials to Pacific Palisades elementary and high  schools.  </P> <P> The Eastside-Westside Concerned Citizens Committee donated 43 Spanish-English  dictionaries and 15 hand-held "Speak 'N' Spell" computers to Pacific Palisades  Elementary School.  </P> <P> Principal Terri Arnold said the equipment will be used to set up learning  centers for the school's 120 limited-English speaking students, most of whom  are bused in every day from Central City neighborhoods where there is no  classroom space for them.  </P> <P> The school recently added two bilingual teachers to work with an increasing  number of students who speak little or no English, "but we just haven't  sufficient resources to meet the needs of the large numbers of children we're  getting," Arnold said.  </P> <P> Alex Cota, 61, who heads the Eastside-Westside group, said supplies are  desperately needed by teachers who don't have the resources to deal with the  students whose command of English is limited or nonexistent.  </P></p>

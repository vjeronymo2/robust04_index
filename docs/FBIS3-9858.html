According to our  correspondent, PD President Petre Roman said that with Romania's  admission to the Council of Europe, the executive authority  assumed certain commitments that it has so far failed to fully  resolve. One of the major failings is the lack of independence  of the judiciary. Another prominent PD leader, Victor Babiuc,  said that there are extremist and chauvinist parties in many  democratic countries in Europe but that in none of them does the  executive rely on such parties, as is the case with Romania.    Continuing their meetings at Senate headquarters, the two  Council of Europe rapporteurs met in turn with the  representatives of the Romanian National Unity Party [PUNR], the  Greater Romania Party [PRM], and the Socialist Party of Labor  [PSM]. At the start of the meeting with the PUNR, Gheorghe  Funar, president of that political grouping, said that the  minorities should be indeed treated with goodwill, but he added  that the complaints and memoranda of the Democratic Union of  Hungarians in Romania [UDMR] are artificial, being aimed and  directed against the Romanian state, since a certain part of the  Hungarian minority is acting on the basis of suggestions from  abroad, whose aim is to destroy the Romanian state, which is  protecting this minority. Another PUNR leader, Valer Suian,  said that the reports, complaints, or other auxiliary documents  sent to the Council of Europe should first be made known to the  government or Parliament. PUNR official Adrian Motiu talked  about certain aspects of Romanian political life, with  particular reference to the UDMR, which he considered as a party  based on ethnic and not political considerations.    During the meetings with the PRM representatives, Corneliu  Vadim Tudor, president of that political grouping, agreed that  the minorities have the right to study in their mother tongue,  but said that this cannot yet apply to university education,  since a minority student nevertheless attends higher education  in order to become useful to Romanian society. The PRM  representatives said that they understand this desire of the  Hungarian minority to study in their mother tongue, but their  request is not for a right, but rather for a privilege, since  Romania has at least other 10 minorities that have not asked for  such a thing.    In his speech, PSM President Ilie Verdet expressed concern  over the revival of violence and of racist-nationalist movements  in Romania. In his turn, [PSM Vice President] Adrian Paunescu  said that certain requirements of the Council of Europe are  being used by certain political forces in Romania against the  stability of the Romanian state. Because the time allocated for  this meeting was exceeded, Gunnar Jansson asked the PSM  representatives to present their other comments in writing.    After this meeting, the two rapporteurs had a brief meeting  with the representatives of the Agrarian Democratic Party of  Romania [PDAR].    The last point on today's agenda of the two Council of  Europe  rapporteurs was their reception by the president of the two  chambers of Romania's Parliament. During the meeting Jansson  and Koenig emphasized the importance of Romania's observation of  the commitments assumed, since they contribute to the country's  political stability, international recognition, and the  attraction of foreign capital. In their reply, [Senate  President] Oliviu Gherman and [Chamber of Deputies Speaker]  Adrian Nastase said that Romania will choose the best pace for  the implementation of the commitments assumed, so that their  solution will be a real one, in full accordance with Romanian  legislation.    According to our correspondent Dan Preda, the two  rapporteurs' series of meetings will continue tomorrow morning  with the leaders of the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR].</p>

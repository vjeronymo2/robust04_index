			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolay Dolgopolov report: "Bill Will Carry Off No </F> Surprises"]    [Text] Clinton lands at Vnukovo-2 airport at 2235 today.  Early in the morning of 13 January the president has a  one-on-one meeting with B.N. Yeltsin in St. George's Hall, then  a walk around the Kremlin in the company of the Russian  president, talks, talks...and a meeting with the patriarch, and  in the evening a trip to Ogarevo, where he will be given supper  at Yeltsin's residence. In the morning of 14 January, after  laying the traditional wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown  Soldier, Clinton will set off for a far from traditional  tripartite meeting. His interlocutors will be two presidents:  the Russian and the Ukrainian, Leonid Kravchuk. By all  appearances, without quoting anyone, from this meeting  unexpectedly great things can be expected. Let us call it a  "breakthrough" beforehand. So Ukraine will acquire nuclear-free  status and become a nonnuclear state. That would seem well and  truly to put an end to a highly complex problem which, it has  now emerged, three countries have been working energetically and  without publicity to resolve.    No more sensations can really be expected. Except that we  are all to have a personal meeting with Bill Clinton on  "Ostankino" on 14 January at around 1530 (keep an eye on the TV  schedules). The president, in his customary manner, will not  address the audience of young people that has been assembled for  him, but will conduct an easy and elegant Clintonian dialogue  with them.    And so the collection of documents that is customary in  these  cases will be adopted and signed. A declaration, known,  naturally, as the "Moscow" declaration, is bound to be chief  among them. Its most important component is that the two  presidents signing it will note that relations between Russia  and the United States have entered the stage of mature  partnership.    What else is there of interest in connection with the summit  -- sorry, the official meeting? They will announce the demise  of COCOM [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export  Controls], which will come to an end in March, and the formation  of a new monitoring organization in its place, in which Russia's  rights are admittedly not fully defined. Most likely the total  sum of U.S. aid, or rather, assistance, will be $2 billion a  year. Russia will presumably put forward an unusual initiative  on the formation of joint armed forces with the States, under UN  auspices. At least, this matter has apparently been agreed at  the top Russian military level. On our part, we are prepared to  assign the 27th Motorized Infantry Division, with the 3d  Infantry Division on the U.S. side.    And in conclusion, for those who were expecting political  sensations in connection with the unexpected -- for the  Americans -- outcome of our elections: Although Clinton's very  busy schedule allows time for a few events that are not  indicated in the program, the president certainly will not meet  with Zhirinovskiy.    The scene of departure from Moscow for Minsk will be played  out at Vnukovo, at 1015 on 15 January.</p>

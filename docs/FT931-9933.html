			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Move to make Japanese groups more transparent A GOVERNMENT advisory panel has recommended that companies be required to appoint independent auditors, in an attempt to make corporate Japan more transparent and less prone to scandal. The Justice Ministry is likely to draft legislation to amend the commercial code based on the panel's recommendations, but the changes will be opposed by many companies, as auditing has traditionally been an in-house operation in Japan. A spate of securities industry scandals and demands for increased shareholder rights prompted the panel's review, which included a study of whether companies should be able to buy their own shares. No formal recommendation was made on this controversial issue. But the panel did recommend that shareholders should have improved access to company accounts. Under present legislation, shareholders must have at least a 10 per cent stake in the company before getting access to the account books, but the minimum shareholding needed is likely to be reduced to 3 per cent. That change, and a simpler court filing process for class actions, are in line with US demands for an improvement in shareholder rights in Japan. The demand was made during the bilateral Structural Impediments Initiative (SII) talks, designed to reduce the 'structural' obstacles to trade. The panel also recommended that restrictions on corporate bond issues be eased, in particular a requirement that companies must issue bonds to a total less than twice the net value of its assets. Corporate bonds are becoming increasingly popular among Japanese companies, but there are still strict limits on bond trading and issuance. These and other recommendations, approved yesterday by a sub-committee in the justice ministry, are scheduled to be formally presented to the justice minister later this month, and then to a cabinet meeting next month. If the panel's proposals are adopted, an auditor's term will be extended from two to three years, while companies capitalised at Y500m (Pounds 2.6m) or more, or with debts of Y20bn or more, must appoint three auditors, one more than is now required. But most controversial is the requirement that one of three auditors should be independent. Japanese companies have traditionally appointed auditors from among middle-managers passed over for promotion to the senior ranks or from among executives due to retire but wanting to maintain a presence within the company. Auditors still generally regard themselves as part of the company and it is highly unusual for them to find fault with financial statements. By the panel's standards, an independent auditor is an individual who has not worked for the company, or any of its subsidiaries, during the past five years.</p>

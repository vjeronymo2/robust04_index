			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: BMW chief sees rise in turnover TURNOVER at BMW, the German luxury car maker, is set to climb between 5 and 6 per cent to DM25.5bn (Dollars 16.70bn) in the 10 months to the end of October, the company's chief executive said yesterday. Speaking at BMW's Munich headquarters, Mr Eberhard von Kunheim said that the group had managed to defy the difficult conditions afflicting world car markets, and would continue to do so. Unit sales were set to reach 500,000 for the 10-month period, an increase of 8 to 9 per cent on last year. This compared with a 8 to 9 per cent drop in unit sales in Germany, the company's most important market, over the same period. However, Mr von Kunheim warned that the appreciation of the D-Mark over recent weeks would inevitably affect the company's prospects. The real effects of a stronger D-Mark would be felt in the next few months and they are likely to have a strong impact, he said. Mr von Kunheim would not quantify the likely effects of currency movements. However, Mr Bolker Doppelfeld, finance director, said that but for currency variations, profits for this year would have been 'superb'. Mr von Kunheim said only that profits would be 'satisfactory' this year. Last year, net profits were DM782.7m, up from DM695.9m in 1991. The production total for the year is likely to approach 560,000 to 580,000 units. models. Sales in the US are likely to rise to 65,000, an increase of 20 per cent since last year. Between January and September, deliveries in the German market rose by 8 per cent to 190,300. In the US, deliveries rose by 27 per cent to 49,200, and in the UK by 9 per cent to 33,700. In Italy they rose 21 per cent to 29,600. Total worldwide deliveries rose 9 per cent to 450,700.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MERYL STREEP  </P> <P> I was at the Screen Actors Guild's first women's conference held recently in  Los Angeles and felt inspired, as did many others, to address the image and  employment problems facing actresses today.  </P> <P> Five of us have started an organization called Women's Screen Image to effect  change in how females are portrayed and hence to stretch their value on and off  the screen. As a networking and support group for writers, producers, casting  directors, actresses and directors we believe we can make a difference.  </P> <P> Raising people's awareness is the first step. Your article certainly helps to  keep the dialogue going.  </P> <P> LYNNE HENDEL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

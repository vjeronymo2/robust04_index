			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Economists warn on solidarity pact THE proposed solidarity pact between the government, opposition, Lander and trade unions, will be insufficient to pull the east German economy out of stagnation, according to German economists. Eastern Germany will remain a burden on central government unless the Bundesbank cuts interest rates, the unions stop insisting on wage parity between the east and west Landers, and subsidies are extended to industries not yet privatised, according to Berlin's authoritative economics research institute, DIW. 'We cannot even begin to talk about eastern Germany catching up if these three elements are not included in a solidarity pact,' said Mr Heiner Flassbeck, one of the chief economists at DIW. The warnings coincide with economic forecasts by both the DIW and IWH, the economics research institute in the eastern city of Halle, showing how the gap between revenue and expenditure in east Germany is this year expected to widen to 29 per cent, an increase of 13 per cent compared to 1992. According to the DIW forecast, revenue is estimated to total DM312.5bn (Pounds 128.6bn), an increase of DM16.60bn on last year, while expenditure will rise to DM341bn, an increase of DM29.4bn. Figures for gross domestic product is expected to decline by nearly 1 per cent to 3.5 per cent this year. However, this figure does not reflect real growth when set against the sharp drop in GDP which fell by 31.4 per cent in 1991. The IWH estimates that unemployment is likely to settle at 18 per cent of the total labour force, although it is already as high as 40 per cent in some regions. Growth forecasts may, however, be revised downwards since the recession in west Germany could force its medium-sized companies to reconsider current investment plans for the east. As a first step towards attracting investment from the western to the eastern Lander, Mr Flassbeck says interest rates must be lowered, otherwise, 'we could see a stagnation of investment in eastern Germany. The eastern Lander would require an annual investment rate of DM120bn a year . . . only then can we talk about the region catching up.' Current annual western German private investment in the eastern Lander totals DM20bn - a fifth of west Germany's annual private investment.</p>

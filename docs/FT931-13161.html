			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas to axe jobs MCDONNELL Douglas, the US aerospace and defence group headed by chairman Mr John McDonnell, has announced plans to cut 4,000 jobs from its workforce because of slowing demand for commercial jet aircraft. The job cuts, which will be achieved through attrition and lay-offs, will all come at Douglas Aircraft, the group's commercial aircraft manufacturing unit based in Long Beach, California. Mr John Thom, a spokesman for McDonnell Douglas, explained: 'We'll be building fewer aircraft, so we'll need fewer people.' The cuts will leave the commercial aircraft division with a total workforce of about 15,000 people. The measures are being taken because of depressed orders from the airline industry. The drop in demand has forced the company this year to reduce planned production of its MD-80 aircraft by about half and production of its MD-11 jet by almost a third. The job and production cuts will not affect McDonnell Douglas's military aircraft division, which was split from the commercial aircraft business in a restructuring last year. The announcement of the latest job cuts came the day after McDonnell Douglas reported a sharp drop in 1992 profits. However, the company, was upbeat last week about the long-term outlook for earnings, predicting that the C-17 military transport aircraft would become profitable this year, that its wide-body MD-11 jetliner would generate a positive cash-flow, that margins on core businesses would rise, and that the group's debt would be cut by Dollars 1bn in 1993 through asset sales and use of existing cash reserves.</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE TAX BOARD IS ACCUSED OF DODGING BAD ADVICE PENALTY  </P> <P> In the final days of the 1988 legislative session, lawmakers approved a measure  that would severely penalize the state for giving individuals faulty written  advice on income tax questions.  </P> <P> Now the authors of the legislation claim the Franchise Tax Board is attempting  to circumvent provisions in the law that require them to waive additional  taxes, penalties and interest when the state's written advice is wrong.  </P> <P> The law was pushed through the Legislature by Assemblyman Elihu Harris  (D-Oakland) and Board of Equalization Member Conway Collis as part of a  Taxpayer Bill of Rights designed to make it easier for individuals to grapple  with the state's complex tax system.  </P> <P> While both federal and state law had previously provided protections against  penalties and interest when written advice was given in error, never before  have taxpayers been granted an exemption from additional income taxes if the  advice was wrong.  </P> <P> The provision could virtually wipe out a taxpayers' liability in the event of a  major error on the part of the state. For lawmakers, it seemed particularly  apropos at a time when the federal government's Internal Revenue Service was  being constantly criticized for giving wrong answers.  </P> <P> "I wanted to create a situation in which average taxpayers could rely on advice  given to them by their state government," Collis said Tuesday. "Income tax is  an area that is really scary to most taxpayers and I wanted them to be able to  write in and say 'I'm confused.' "  </P> <P> But when the law became effective in January, Collis said, the staff of the  Franchise Tax Board made no attempt to advise taxpayers of their new rights.  And guidelines drafted to implement the law, he said, were fashioned so that it  would be difficult for average taxpayers to avail themselves of the guarantees  against additional taxes, penalties and interest if the written advice from the  board was wrong.  </P> <P> "This isn't going to work if the board keeps it a secret," said Collis. "The  whole idea is to make the state tax system a little easier to deal with for  people. It's bad enough that we have to pay taxes. We ought not to put people  through the wringer to figure out what they're supposed to pay."  </P> <P> Collis said his complaints have since produced suggestions from the board's  staff for "major" revisions to the guidelines. Collis and Harris are scheduled  to air their complaints directly to the board at a March 23 meeting.  </P> <P> The present guidelines, patterned after the Internal Revenue Service system,  establishes several categories of written advice. The only category that  provides protection from additional taxes -- called a chief counsel ruling --  requires the taxpayer to present a written explanation and analysis of his tax  question. The category routinely used to answer taxpayer questions, called an  information letter, provides no protections.  </P> <P> Collis, who argues that the law was meant to apply to all forms of written  advice, said few taxpayers would ever know to ask for a specific category of  reply when they seek written advice.  </P> <P> In drafting the guidelines, Franchise Tax Board officials said they had taken  pains to ensure that protections against additional taxes only be extended when  the written advice was given by experienced lawyers.  </P> <P> "Let's assume a brand new employee in the department who has only a few weeks'  experience makes an error in judgment and provides the wrong data," said Jim  Reber, a spokesman for the board. "Is it reasonable then for the state of  California to forgive the tax although legally it may be owed?"  </P> <P> Nor did officials in the agency believe, he said, that the new law was  attacking a particularly egregious problem in California. He said studies have  shown the advice given taxpayers by the agency is in error less than 10% of the  time. By contrast, the IRS announced earlier this month that its own tests  showed taxpayers who called a toll-free line for advice were getting wrong  information 30.8% of the time.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Employees Monitored  </P> <P> Reber said employees who give oral advice to taxpayers are frequently monitored  by their supervisors and tested annually on their knowledge of the tax laws.  </P> <P> "The integrity of this department is recognized throughout the nation. The  majority of people can rely on and be confident that the tax forms and  information they get is accurate," he said.  </P> <P> Even so, Reber said the board does not consider the guidelines to be "in  concrete." Indeed, in a memorandum from executive director Gerald Goldberg, the  staff said it would support changes in the guidelines that would extend the  protections to taxpayers who get other forms of written advice. For now,  however, the board's policy remains in effect.  </P> <P> "While we do not agree with Mr. Collis with regard to his characterization of  what we have done, we have nonetheless taken a second look at our guidelines to  determine if we can be more flexible," Goldberg wrote.  </P> <P> Collis however, said he would ask the board to go even further and begin a  campaign to inform taxpayers of their right to obtain the legal advice.  </P> <P> Reber acknowledged that no mention of the new law was made in this year's  California Resident Income Tax Forms and Instructions, but said that was  because the tax information booklet was being printed just as the law was being  passed.  </P></p>

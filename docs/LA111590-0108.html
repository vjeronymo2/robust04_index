			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> American Loses Route Decision: American Airlines lost its pitch for a coveted  Chicago-Tokyo route as the U.S. Department of Transportation affirmed an  earlier decision to give it to United Airlines.  </P> <P> American said it was "extremely distressed" with the decision, which it  contends "slams the door on any hope of competition in the Pacific." United is  the nation's leading transpacific carrier; the DOT gave United the route  because it serves more destinations from Tokyo than American. The DOT also  affirmed a previous decision to award Delta a Los Angeles-Tokyo route.  </P></p>

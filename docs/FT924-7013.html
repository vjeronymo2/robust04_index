			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A DEFIANTLY firm opening on the futures market petered out in a dull afternoon session with the December contract again returning to trade at a discount to its fair value, writes Christopher Price. The dull opening expected by equity traders, on the back of poor overnight performances from Wall Street and Hong Kong, plus a negative Confederation of British Industry (CBI) derivatives trade survey, failed to materialise as bear closing was seen squeezing the December Footsie contract firmer in a busy morning session. December, which had hit its low of the day of 2,676 within minutes of opening, reached its high of 2,700 by lunchtime. Firmer short sterling and government bonds helped. However, the afternoon session saw a dearth of buyers and an indifferent Wall Street sent December drifting away until its close. It finished at 2,684, the same close as the previous session but at a much lower volume of 6,165 contracts. The contract traded at around or slightly below fair value for most of the session and at the close was at a discount of some five points to its fair value level of around nine. Traded options were subdued. Rolls-Royce was the top stock, trading 1,821 contracts which included one trade of 1,000 of the December calls at 7.5p. British Airways found buyers after its results with 1,272 traded. Total volume was 19,765.</p>

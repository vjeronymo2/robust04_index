Such prices are still 5.3 per cent lower than they were in June 1992, however. The average price paid by a first-time buyer in June was Pounds 45,465. Halifax said: 'As demand for mortgage finance continues to rise, this will feed through to a gradual rise in house prices. We expect prices to move on to a more consistently rising trend in the first half of 1993.'</p>

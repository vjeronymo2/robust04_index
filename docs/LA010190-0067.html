			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT&amp;T RINGS IN DECADE WITH STATE RATE CUT  </P> <P> The new year and new decade spell lower telephone rates, effective this  morning.  </P> <P> American Telephone &amp; Telegraph cut its prices for long-distance calling  within California by an average of 8.6%, an annual savings to AT&amp;T  customers of $113.3 million.  </P> <P> The company earlier announced a $300-million reduction in tolls for calling  between states and abroad, also effective New Year's Day.  </P> <P> Most local callers in the state also get a price break today.  </P> <P> The California Public Utilities Commission ordered Pacific Bell's rates cut  $391 million a year, effective Jan. 1, saving the residential customers about  $1.15 on the typical $26 monthly bill.  </P> <P> That reduction will appear as a percentage credit subtracted from January and  subsequent bills until the PUC gets around, later this year, to recalculating  the specific price changes for local services provided by Pacific Bell and the  state's second largest local carrier, Thousand Oaks-based GTE California.  (GTE's rates, which were sharply lowered a year ago, will start the new year  unchanged.)  </P> <P> The AT&amp;T rate cut will reduce the cost of a 5-minute, weekday call between  Los Angeles or San Diego and San Francisco to $1.06 from $1.20. A 10-minute  call anywhere in the nation will cost up to $2.50. Since Monday is a holiday,  daytime rates are discounted by 33% to 47% after 11 p.m.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T spokeswoman Linda McDougall attributed most of the reductions to state  and federal regulators. All but $7 million of the California cut stems from a  1985 order by the PUC that began a seven-year reduction in what long-distance  carriers pay local phone companies for completing calls and a corresponding  increase in what local customers pay Pacific Bel and GTE California.  </P> <P> The interstate reduction is based on a similar cost shift ordered by the  Federal Communications Commission, which regulates interstate service. Phone  customers now pay a $3.50-a-month "subscriber line charge" to compensate local  phone companies for revenue they used to collect from long-distance carriers.  </P> <P> In all, AT&amp;T rates for calling within California have dropped 45.5% in six  years, while interstate rates fell 40%. AT&amp;T's long-distance competitors  have generally cut their rates proportionately.  </P></p>

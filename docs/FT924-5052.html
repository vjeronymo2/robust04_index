			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Week in the Markets: Smelter closure boosts aluminium TAJIKISTAN WAS the word on every aluminium trader's lips this week as their market climbed to the highest level since mid-October. Until two years ago few London Metal Exchange traders had even heard of the small Soviet republic just to the north of the Hindu Kush. But since the collapse of the Soviet Union it had become something of a dirty word on the exchange as a major contributor to the flood of CIS aluminium in which the western market was floundering. This week, however, it was rumoured, reported, denied and finally confirmed that production at the republic's giant Regar smelter had ground to a virtual halt because of a lack of raw materials. The smelter, which has a nominal capacity of 520,000 tonnes a year, produced 370,000 tonnes of metal last year, virtually all of it going to swell exports to the west, which are estimated to have totalled between 800,000 and 1m tonnes. A month ago output had been cut to an annual rate of 200,000 tonnes because of a dispute about ownership, which dried up money for spare parts and shut down two of the three anode lines. What appears to have been the final blow was the cutting of rail links between Russia and Tajikistan, which is troubled by increasingly violent ethnic disputes. Russia has been the sole source of alumina (aluminium oxide) for the smelter since Azerbaijan cut off supplies some time ago, complaining that no aluminium was being shipped back in payment. A National Security Committee (formerly the KGB) official had a similar explanation for the loss of Russian supplies. He told the Reuter news agency that alumina shipments had been halted 'because of overdue debts'. That prompted analyst Nick Moore to comment in yesterday's issue of Ord Minnett's Daily Metal Market Monitor: 'One cannot help but wonder just how many of the other 14 (CIS) smelters are in a similar position'. He also recalled a speaker at the Oslo Aluminium Conference in September saying that 'no-one pays any bills in Russia any more'. Mr Moore calculated that the drying up of Tajik supplies was equivalent to western aluminium demand growing by more than 2 per cent. 'Now that's worth having,' he said. The market response was more cautious, understandably perhaps, in view of the long term problems of the aluminium sector. The three months price on the LME climbed to Dollars 1,222 a tonne at one point, before closing yesterday at Dollars 1,219.50 a tonne, up Dollars 33 on the week. Copper was another strong market as base metals traders responded to constructive US economic data. The three months price yesterday broke through resistance at the equivalent of Dollars 2,190 a tonne to close at Pounds 1,474.25 a tonne up Pounds 30 on the day and Pounds 43.75 on the week. Nickel continued the rally that began in the middle of last week with three months metal gaining another Dollars 597.50 to Dollars 6,075 a tonne. Dealers said Chinese buying encouraged the rise, and added that there was talk of production cuts in Australia and the Dominican Republic. Zinc's upturn was also maintained, with the LME's three months position rising Dollars 71 on the week to Dollars 1,138.50 a tonne. The market found good buying support after absorbing stop-loss selling early in the week and was later underpinned by renewed trade buying, which touched off covering purchases against short positions and triggered stop-loss buying orders. At the London Futures and Options Exchange the opening of a fresh round of talks in London on negotiating an international coffee agreement with price-stabilisation mechanisms did little for market sentiment. As the meeting got under way London's robusta coffee prices went into a gentle slide that took the January futures position down from Dollars 968 at the end of last week Dollars 938 on Wednesday. The market then picked up a little, for no apparent reason, before getting some encouragement yesterday from reports of modest progress at the producer-consumer talks, and the January price ended the week only Dollars 12 down on balance at Dollars 956 a tonne. The talks, which are to continue through to next Wednesday, have concentrated so far chiefly on the issue of 'selectivity' - allowing producers to choose in what proportions the various types of coffee should be allowed on to the market under an export quota scheme. Delegates are also considering the problem of dealing with under-shipment and declared shortfalls against quota allocations.  --------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  --------------------------------------- Aluminium      +6,825  to  1,458,075 Copper         +2,075  to  327,000 Lead             -925  to  197,525 Nickel           +810  to  62,676 Zinc           -1,525  to  377,275 Tin              +195  to  14,645  ---------------------------------------</p>

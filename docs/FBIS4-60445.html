			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Saddam Expels Senior Officials and </F> Military Figures Who Come from 'Izzat al-Duri's Village"]    [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- Iraqi opposition quarters have  stressed that President Saddam Husayn has launched a purge  campaign among the regime's ranks, focusing on prominent  figures, all of whom come from al-Duri (the village of al-Duri  is near the village of al-'Awjah in Tikrit, the president's  birthplace) -- from where 'Izzat al-Duri, his deputy in the  presidency, the Armed Forces command, and the ruling Ba'th Party  -- comes. In a statement distributed in London and a copy of  which AL-HAYAH has received, the Free Iraqi Council said that  Saddam accused a number of senior officials from al-Duri of  conspiring against the regime. They are: Tali' al-Duri,  military governor general; 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Duri, director of  public security and former member of the Ba'th Party Regional  Command, who was in charge of the Mosul organization in the  past; Khadr al-Duri, former deputy of former intelligence chief  Barzan al-Tikriti, Saddam's half-brother; and Sabir al-Duri,  former intelligence chief.    The council's statement said that 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Duri's  family has been expelled from its home in the exclusive  al-Mansur area, west of Baghdad, and that the house has been  turned into offices for one of the Ba'th Party's organizations.    Furthermore, a number of Army officers and party officials  have been pensioned off. Some of them are being investigated.</p>

Kamanin "Is Access to Outsiders Allowed?; Our </F> How We are Entering the World Space Market" the first paragraph  is an introduction]    [Text] The critical state of the national space industry is  approaching a limit beyond which its resurrection in the years  immediately ahead may become impossible. In striving to avert  the impending catastrophe, the Russian Space Agency (RSA) is  imparting maximum efforts for the commercialization of all space  activity in the country and to enter the world market. Recent  publications in the foreign press give eloquent testimony of the  "successes" attained by the RSA in this field.    To start off I will cite an article by J. M. Lenorovitz,  senior international editor of AVIATION WEEK AND SPACE  TECHNOLOGY, included in a special number of this journal in the  Russian language under the highly promising title "Russian  Commercial Launches Not Far Off."    "The United States has defined the conditions for entry of  Russia into the world market for commercial launches of boosters  and has notified West European representatives of the need for  concessions in the direction of development of free competition.  The fact that an American-Russian agreement was signed ... has  caused dissatisfaction among representatives of the American  aerospace industry..."    This same article states that one Dana Rohrabacher, a  Republican from California, tried to console the representatives  of the leaders of aerospace companies, declaring that it was  necessary "to perceive the appearance of a competitor in the  form of Russia to be a result of the collapse of the Soviet  Union, long awaited by the United States."    Just what are the conditions causing the dissatisfaction of  American entrepreneurs, who for some reason or another have  "forgotten" the principal precept of the businessman: "Whatever  you do in this world you have to pay for it?"    Under the adopted agreement Russia up to the end of 2000 can  conclude not more than one contract annually for the launch of  geostationary satellites by Russian carriers and contracts for  the launch of low-orbit satellites must be specially examined in  each individual case; the "bilateral agreement applies to all  satellites put into space regardless of where they were  constructed and by what countries they will be operated."  Businessmen in the United States have exhibited a touching  concern about the income of Russia: the amount of payment for  each commercial launch of the Proton carrier must not be less  than 92.5% of the price asked for similar launches by  American  or West European companies.    Moreover, the congressmen and representatives of the  American  administration are not without success playing the role of good  Samaritans, as if defending Russian interests against the  encroachments of evil West European commercial interests. The  latter, it goes without saying, are not delighted with the  attempts of "Russian agents" to intrude themselves into the  "trade ranks" of the world space market. But American  businessmen, in turn, are anxious about the considerable  fraction of Western Europe in profits from commercial launches  of satellites despite their own relatively small (35%)  share.  That is why they, relying on the protectionist policy of the  American government, are striving to dictate their rigid  requirements on the concluding of trade deals with both new and  well-known competitors. As declared by an assistant of the U.S.  Trade Representative, Peter Allgeier, ... the representatives of  Western Europe are trying to load the agreement, defining such  (fettering for Russia and other potential competitors -- L. K.)  rules, with simplification of the procedure for their obtaining  sanctions by the American government for carrying out launches.    What kind of profits can we count on in the event that the  bilateral agreement enters into force within the framework of  the restrictions set by them?    Yuriy Koptev, general director of the Russian Space Agency  (RSA), declares with assurance that participation of boosters in  commercial launches and the sale of rocket-space technology will  annually bring Russia not less than 200-220 million American  dollars. However, we take into account that in 1992 the total  world profits from the commercial use of space technology  attained 13.2 billion dollars; the income from the use of  boosters did not exceed 1.2 billion, that is, 9% of the  total  sum. This means that the country which was the first to blaze  the trail into space will be allowed to receive for making its  boosters available to other countries not more than 1/60th of  the total world "space profits." So that, pardon me for saying  so, is the net result of commercialization...    And then there's another "space ultimatum" which the  American  administration directed to the Russian government in connection  with the contract concluded in 1991 between the USSR Glavkosmos  and the Indian Space Agency on the delivery of cryogenic engines  to India. For the freezing of the two-million dollar contract  with India we were handed a "bird in the bush": increased  chances for Russia to participate in construction of the Freedom  orbital station were promised.    President Clinton, on the basis of expert evaluations, has  set a limit of 10.5 billion dollars on the financial  expenditures for constructing the Freedom station up to the end  of the 20th century, either independently or in collaboration  with Western Europe and Russia.    As already reported in the press, the Russian prime minister  Vladimir Chernomyrdin, in setting off for negotiations in the  United States, declared that the participation of Russia in  implementation of the Freedom project would enable the Americans  to come out ahead by more than two billion dollars. But what  would we receive? The directors of the Russian Space Agency  declare that for the assistance which Russia will give the  United States in constructing the station they will pay us  600-700 million dollars. We note: in the event of adoption of a  joint trilateral project a good half of the station modules will  be units developed for our future Mir-2 station and the American  laboratory will be occupied with not more than a quarter of the  total volume of construction.    Why, you may ask, do we place such a low value on our work,  our scientific and technical achievements? After all, the  minimum cost of the American "quarter-share" of the future  station is estimated by American specialists at 10.5 billion  dollars, whereas the Russian "half," if our prime minister is to  be believed, is only the 2 billion saved by the Americans due to  use of units from the Mir-2 station. And why can we, if the RSA  is to be believed, receive only a third of this obviously  understated sum?    From everything said above a conclusion follows which is as  evident as it is disconsoling for us: neither our West European  space partners, nor the Americans, are burning with desire to  have still another competitor in the space technologies and  services market. And therefore our penetration into the world  space market conforms to the Russian proverb: "he went for the  wool and returned with the clippings."    Editor's note. The author of the article has touched on the  most important aspects of the entry of Russia into the world  space market. We are sure that there also are other opinions on  this subject. Accordingly, we invite all interested readers to  continue the initiated discussion.</p>

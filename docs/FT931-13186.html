			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: Benetton may float clothing arm BENETTON, the Italian clothing group, may float its new Sportsystem sports goods and clothing arm on to the stock market. It could happen within the next two to three years, according to Mr Silvano Storer, a senior group executive. The company, which had sales of Dollars 608m last year, expects to be one of the world's top sports equipment groups by 1995, when sales should reach Dollars 1bn. At present the sports goods market is dominated by Nike, Reebok, Adidas and Mizuno of Japan. Benetton has identified sports as the next big growth area in retailing.' Sports today are a keystone to leisure time activities and will continue to gain greater importance in everyone's life', said Mr Gilberto Benetton, chairman of Benetton Sportsystem. The forecast came as Benetton displayed together for the first time the 10 brands acquired over the past three years. The subsidiaries, assembled under the new Benetton Sportsystem holding company, include Nordica ski boots, Prince tennis racquets and Rollerblade in-line roller skates. Sales for the group, which has now achieved its first aim of building up a portfolio of leading sports brands, would exceed Dollars 700m this year, said Mr Storer. The range covers winter and summer sports, but is still under-represented in footwear and clothing, two activities being developed internally. A flotation could allow the company, owned by Edizione Holding, the Benetton family's ultimate holding company, to copy the success of Benetton, which has around 20 per cent of its shares listed. The proceeds from a quotation would be used to repay debt. The remainder could be channelled into further purchases, or, possibly, a retail sports goods chain akin to that of Benetton in clothing.</p>

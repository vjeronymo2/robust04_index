			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Why Bill and Al need Paul: America Kennedy was obviously looking for a reassuring symbol of financial rectitude, and he made a calming, bipartisan choice.' I quote from Changing Fortunes (Times Books), where Mr Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, recalls President John Kennedy's inspired choice of Douglas Dillon as Treasury secretary in 1960. Dillon, writes Mr Volcker, was a Republican and a conservative: an investment banker with 'impeccable credentials in the financial and diplomatic communities'. It would be a strange, but far from impossible, twist of fortune if Mr Volcker were to find himself playing Dillon's role in a Clinton administration. With election day less than two months away, Mr Bill Clinton is playing his economic cards close to his chest. He and his choice for vice-president, Al Gore, rely on an eclectic mix of economic and financial advisers, none of whom is a certain bet for either of the two top economic posts - Treasury secretary and White House chief economist. The most frequently mentioned contenders for Treasury secretary in a Clinton administration include investment bankers Bob Rubin of Goldman Sachs, Roger Altman of the Blackstone Group and Felix Rohatyn of Lazard Freres. All are well regarded in financial circles, but none (with the possible exception of Mr Rohatyn) would add much ballast to a Clinton presidency. Mr Volcker is in a different class. He would be an instantly reassuring figure, not just on Wall Street but in central banks, finance ministries and bourses around the world. Imagine Mr Clinton arriving at his first economic summit with the large, cigar-smoking figure of Mr Volcker in tow: would anybody pine for the hamfisted economic diplomacy of George Bush and Nicholas Brady? At present Mr Clinton appears weak on macro and international economics. He is comfortable debating many of America's microeconomic problems, such as uncontrolled healthcare costs and poor job training. His economic plan, Putting People First, makes valuable suggestions for improving US productivity, mainly through higher investment in education, training and infrastructure. But its priorities are those of an intelligent state governor, rather than an international economic statesman, and they reflect the expertise of close advisers such as Mr Ira Magaziner, a business consultant and educational expert, and Mr Robert Reich, the Harvard political economist, neither of whom would claim macroeconomic credentials. Mr Robert Shapiro, another capable adviser, does have a macro background but lacks international stature. Mr Volcker would fill the macroeconomic hole in the Clinton team far more convincingly than financial experts such as Mr Rubin or Mr Altman. But could a former under-secretary at the Treasury during the Nixon years fit into a progressive Clinton administration? Disapproving references in Changing Fortunes to escalating healthcare costs, eroding infrastructure and educational shortcomings suggest Mr Volcker would have few philosophical differences with the Arkansas governor who, after all, is a decidedly conservative Democrat. Sources close to Mr Volcker say he feels underemployed as chairman of J D Wolfensohn, the investment bank, and would be delighted to get the phone call from a president-elect Clinton. The top job at the Treasury, at a testing moment in US economic history, would be a fitting finale for a life of public service. The drawback for Mr Clinton is that Mr Volcker would be too powerful. He might overshadow his president. Clinton advisers also fear that he might prove 'uncontrollable' - which is one reason why speculation about a role for Mr Volcker mainly occurs outside, rather than inside, the Clinton campaign. In all probability, Mr Volcker would prove implacable on certain issues. He would apply relentless pressure for a lasting reduction in the budget deficit. But this ought not to matter; Mr Clinton is reportedly much keener on deficit reduction than many of his advisers. And macroeconomic stability - Mr Volcker's strong suit - is precisely the environment required if Mr Clinton's long-term structural reforms are to bear fruit. If Mr Volcker were to go to Treasury, Mr Clinton would be wise to pick a complementary figure as chief economic adviser. A dynamic young academic would provide the perfect foil for elder statesman Volcker. Mr Clinton might opt for an economist he knows well, such as Mr Shapiro. But he would probably be tempted by one of the profession's young intellectual heavyweights. Mr Paul Krugman, a rising star at MIT, is a good bet. His academic expertise lies in the Clinton team's area of greatest ignorance: international macroeconomics and trade theory. Yet he has also helped mould the domestic debate, with a book that drew attention to people's diminished economic expectations and with controversial estimates of the growth of income inequality during the Reagan/Bush years. If Mr Clinton wants to shine economically, he could do worse than draft the two Pauls - Volcker and Krugman. But first he must win the election.</p>

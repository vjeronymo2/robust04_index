			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Daiei forges import buying link with trader Daiei, Japan's largest supermarket chain, has formed an import buying partnership with Marubeni, a general trading company, the first tie-up between a leading Japanese trader and retailer. Marubeni is to help Daiei, a pioneer in Japan's embryonic discount shopping industry, obtain access to cheap foreign goods such as food, clothing and sports goods, for sale in Daiei's stores. This is the latest stage in the strategy of Mr Isao Nakauchi, Daiei's chairman, to make use of the yen's strength to pass on discounts to customers. Daiei is also understood to be seeking a similar alliance to develop cheap cosmetics with a Japanese maker of beauty goods. The Marubeni accord, to take effect from April, is expected to lead to a more than threefold rise in Marubeni's sales to Daiei to Y100bn (Dollars 959m) in the next two to three years, representing 5 per cent of Daiei's estimated sales this year. Food will form a large part of the first transactions, including chicken from China, Brazilian coffee and Alaskan fish. This is part of Daiei's continuing efforts to bypass Japan's multilayered distribution system. The costs imposed by many layers of middlemen contribute to the fact that Japan's grocery prices are roughly twice US levels. A representative basket of 30 goods cost the equivalent of Dollars 138 in Japan and Dollars 68 in the US at 1992 exchange rates, according to Daiei's estimates. However, previous Daiei alliances have sometimes lacked substance, warned Mr Dean Perry, retail analyst at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo. Last month, Daiei announced a 'broad-ranging' tie-up with Ajinomoto, Japan's largest food processor, to gain access to low cost domestic and foreign food. Overall earnings for the six months to August at the leading Japanese supermarkets sagged. At the halfway stage Daiei along with other Japanese stores, such as Ito-Yokado, and Jusco, all suffered declines in profits, and they were pessimistic on prospects for the full year. Daiei said last October that its parent pre-tax profit fell 8.4 per cent in the first half of the year, as a rise in operating costs outpaced a sales pick-up.</p>

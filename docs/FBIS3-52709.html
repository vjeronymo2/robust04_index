However, Palestinian sources said that the wounded  person is a Lebanese civilian who happened to be driving his car  in the vicinity during the raid. He was wounded in the hand.    Our correspondent in al-Nabatiyah reports that the Iqlim  al-Tuffah hills, particularly Mlita, 'Ayn Bu Siwar, and  al-Luwayzah, came under intermittent bombardment from the  Israeli positions in al-Zaffatah. The Israeli artillery  emplacements on the hills of Sujud and al-Suwayda' raked  opposite positions. Two Israeli helicopters overflew the hills  facing the city of al-Nabatiyah.</p>

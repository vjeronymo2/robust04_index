Nor will he run in this fall's elections. The  reason is that he does not feel he has the party's support for  the tough, straightforward policies he wants to pursue.    "New Democracy is moving toward something we already have  too  much of -- vote maximization," he said in a television interview  on Saturday [5 February] evening.    By this he means that too many people in the party are  keeping an eye on the opinion poll figures. They are attempting  to put forward proposals that will win as many votes as possible  instead of pursuing the right policies.    He admitted that the criticism from Bert Karlsson, New  Democracy's deputy chairman, is one of the reasons for his  resignation.    "If you cannot lead the party in the right way then you  should resign."    Wachtmeister believes that New Democracy will run in the  election without him, but "it will probably be with what in part  at least is a different program."    Bert Karlsson does not want to lead the party himself. And  party secretary Marianne Ostlund is shocked.    "I have difficulty in envisaging a future of which Ian is  not  a part," Marianne Ostlund told DAGENS NYHETER.    In recent opinion polls New Democracy has been dangerously  close to the 4-percent threshold for representation in the  Riksdag.</p>

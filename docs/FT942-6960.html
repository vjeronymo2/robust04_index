			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Cable &amp; Wireless Cable &amp; Wireless shareholders will hope that Lord Young, group chairman, has greater success in the great China telecommunications lottery than he had in his UK lottery bid. The potential jackpot could be huge: a central role developing China's exploding telecommunications market. Lord Young was full of optimism at C&amp;W's preliminary results yesterday. China planned to expand the number of telephone lines from 40m now to 114m by the end of the century, he said. It was no longer a question of if but rather of when the market would be opened to foreigners. C&amp;W had been told it would be China's preferred partner when that happened. Still, the jackpot is not in the bag. Though C&amp;W hopes for some opening of the China market this year, the timing of liberalisation is uncertain. Though Lord Young continues to hob-nob with top Chinese politicians, the risk of that good relationship being damaged by the ongoing dispute between UK and China remains. And even if C&amp;W gets its foot through the door first, others such as AT&amp;T will be in hot pursuit. Outside China, the group's prospects are rather dim. Tougher competition and vigorous price-cutting will prevent profits at Mercury rising much in the current year. Given C&amp;W's low gearing of 12 per cent, stepped-up investment in new projects is likely in the next year or two. But C&amp;W still has to prove that it can earn good returns outside Hong Kong.</p>

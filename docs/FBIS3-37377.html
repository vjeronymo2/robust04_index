			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 15 TASS -- The politial face of the  New Majority Party, whose congress is now under way in Moscow,  can hardly be determined right away. There are no eminent  politicians among its organisers. It claims to represent the  interests of the middle class. But this is now done by  practically all the political organisations of Russia.    However, representatives of the leadership of the Democratic  Party of Russia, attending the congress as observers, believe  that the party is being set up for Yuriy Luzhkov, the mayor of  Moscow. In their opinion, this is borne out, among other  things, by the presence of representatives from the Moscow and  regional elites (no journalists were allowed to the congress  hall). Indicative also is the fact that the congress was opened  by a message of greetings from the mayor of Moscow. In the  opinion of representatives of the Democratic Party of Russia  Yuriy Luzhkov is thereby making his first preparations for the  next presidential elections.    Asked by ITAR-TASS, assistant head of the Russian  president's  administration Igor Kharichev, who was invited to the congress  as guest, said he had wary feeling about the new party.    The proceedings of the congress show that the delegates are  disinterested in such documents as procedural rules or party  charter. The selfsame representatives of the Democratic Party  of Russia believe that regional businessmen have gathered in  Moscow to settle their financial problems and that they are not  very much inclined to set up a new party.    Judging by the scope of the congress's organisation, the  initiators of the party obviously have much money at their  disposal. Quite staggering is the huge number of men from the  party's security service. Everybody is searched with the help  of metal-detectors. The cultural centre of the RIA-NOVISTI news  agency, where the congress is being held, is full of security  guards equipped with walkie-talkies. None of the party's  organisers were able to explain why such a strict police regime  was needed at a congress of a political party.</p>

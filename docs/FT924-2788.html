			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (6): Rapid route to creativity - Claire Gooding looks at the origins of computer aided design and how the latest systems are cutting the cost of technical design for industry / Computer aided design MOST computer users have PCs, workstations, or terminals: users of computer aided design (CAD) systems have 'seats.' While the computer world has a language all its own, the CAD world has a dialect more baffling than most (see buzzwords, below). Largely used by engineers, architects and designers, the measurement of CAD systems in seats goes back to the time when they were extremely expensive and demanded the purchase of dedicated hardware that would be unlikely to perform any other task. As the term implies, a 'seat' could be shared between several occupants, highly-qualified people who would have to acquire another skill, that of using a computer. In the early 1980s, CAD was 'standalone.' The hardware and software were 'dedicated,' and their users were in a world of their own. Presenting a picture on a screen was a heavy task for a computer: manipulating and rotating it involved the constant high-speed re-calculation of co-ordinates. In the past this was mainframe work, or at least involved a dedicated minicomputer. Suppliers such as Prime, ICL, with Perq systems and Apollo, with Domain systems dominated a small and specialist market. Now there is a much wider marketplace, reflected by its own thriving trade press (see references, page 10) and a trade show now in its ninth year - CADCAM 93, at Birmingham NEC from March 9th-11th, 1993, has already attracted more than 200 exhibitors. It includes software, hardware, services, and peripherals - another specialised CAD area because plotters for A1-size paper are unlikely to be used with any other application. The dominant names are now Autodesk, which has its own 'expo' at the show, and Sun Microsystems, the supplier of workstations, with its own 'village.' Cambashi, a Cambridge consultancy which specialises in computer-aided technologies and market research, identifies Autodesk, EDS, Hewlett Packard, IBM and Intergraph among the leading vendors (see table, page 10). The market is still concentrated in the hands of a handful of companies, in terms of products purchased. Cambashi also identifies a more complex marketplace, where middle-men and value-added resellers (VARs) play a much larger part in sales. It estimates that in 1991, end-users in the UK spent Pounds 445m on CAD systems; about half on hardware, and the remainder split more or less equally between software and services. This is some advance on the mid-eighties, when an internal IBM report on CAD marked the UK behind Sweden in the number of CAD installations. With falling hardware prices, CAD has been able to reach a larger marketplace. Large users such as Ove Arup, the engineering consultancy which developed its own CAD software at one time, have seen the price plummet, from around Pounds 80,000 to Pounds 6,000 per seat, in a few years. Rising maintenance charges on old kit fuels the spend on new, more powerful and essentially cheaper systems. Jenny Jacobsberg, consultant at Cambashi, makes a distinction in her measurements of CAD usage between penetration, (the number of companies buying CAD units), and 'saturation', the number of skilled people within the company using the system. By the end of 1991, there were 67,000 installations, (compared to 35,500 four years ago), with a potential 300,000 end-users: a saturation of 22.3 per cent. Applications using only two dimensional (2D) representation are stagnating, those using 3D are on the increase. 'The UK still has long way to go when it comes to spreading the usage inside the company' she says. 'To get to the stage where every user has a workstation dedicated to them alone, there will have to be a significant change of culture.' It is still rare to find large-scale projects like Ove Arup's Glaxo campus, relying entirely on CAD, with one workstation per worker. The advent of the PC changed people's expectations: they wanted faster, smarter, easier-to-use systems. Many Macintosh and PC-based solutions have enabled smaller companies to use CAD for the first time. The edges have even become blurred about what is - and isn't - CAD. If it's friendly and easy to use, it may not qualify as CAD, which tends to be associated with professional mysteries - 'anything that smacks of CAD frightens people,' says Mick Pitt, managing director of a company called Scimus whose Doodle product has been used in everything from lace design to fire reports and graphics of car crashes in insurance claims. 'The actual skills needed for technical design are quite high and time-consuming. We're trying to get people to understand that they needn't be frightened of making mistakes, they can change and reproduce things at will on the screen. Some people dispute that Doodle is a CAD product at all, but we see it as a link between CAD and desktop publishing, accessible to everyone from seven years old upwards.' Rather as the telephone, and more recently, the fax machine, gained in value as more and more people adopted the technology, CAD systems start delivering real value as more and more people use them. Users can swap dimensions, drawings, and volumes of information whose accuracy is vital to the job, via exchange of floppy discs, through the standard IGES (Initial Graphics Exchange Specification) transfer mechanism, or through EDM (electronic data management). This facility is so important that it has spawned a centre of expertise in Leeds: CADETSI (CADCAM Data Exchange Technical Centre). Standards, an issue that flickers and burns constantly throughout the computer industry, is already a concern among CAD users. 'It depends on the company' says Jenny Jacobsberg. ' The bigger the organisation, and the more customers or suppliers they deal with, the more important standards will be. Another factor in the exchange of information within one company is a mixture of hardware platforms and software packages. A smaller company which gone down the PC or IBM-specific route might find it less of an issue.' In specific industries, such as the automative industry, the move towards EDM has forced most suppliers down a standard route. Which 'standard' product they acquire, IBM's Catia or Computervision's CADDS product, will be dictated by their customer. The whole industry has moved forward through collaboration and agreement. The Husat Research Institute (Human Sciences and Advanced Technology) is involved in two such projects: RACE (Research and Development on Advanced Communications in Europe) and CAR, (CAD/CAM in the Automative Industry in RACE). In the architecture market, AutoCAD has achieved such penetration that it is spawning any number of independently produced add-ons and extensions. Yet, says Mrs Jacobsberg of Cambashi, 'there is no such thing as an industry standard.' There are however, favoured solutions in different vertical markets - 'there is an increasing requirement for industry-specific solutions, so vendors have identified the opportunities and are coming up with tailored packages.' Not surprisingly, the computer industry itself has been among the first to recognise and use the potential. Hewlett Packard, for instance, uses Genrad's SYSHILO products in the development of its latest Integrated Circuits, to model, simulate and verify these complex components before actual implementation. Users are beginning to realise that computer aided design is just the tip of the iceberg. Connected with other technologies - including quality control, robotics, and recently, with desktop publishing, (see case study on United Glass, page 16) - CAD can remove many of the overheads (but not the skills) of creativity.

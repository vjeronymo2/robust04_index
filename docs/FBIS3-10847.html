			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, 23 Feb (EFE) -- Peruvian Prime Minister  Efrain Goldenberg said today in Tokyo that Japanese investors  will gradually return to Peru because of the economic reforms  and the control over terrorism being implemented by the  government.    Goldenberg made this comment to EFE in Tokyo, where he is  attending a two-day seminar on investments in Latin America that  opened today. It is sponsored by the Nikko brokers firm.    Goldenberg spoke before 300 Japanese businessmen. He  recalled the "constricting squint" of previous governments which  ruined the country through bad administration and violence  until, late in the 1980's, the country became an "outcast" from  the international financial community.    Goldenberg predicted that the starting point for the return  of Japanese businessmen will be the meeting of the  Peruvian-Japanese Business Committee to be held next September  in Lima. This meeting will also be attended by a Japanese  business delegation headed by Kazuo Haruna, president of  Marubeni Trading Company.    Japanese sources showed interest in a greater presence in  Peru in face of the improved economic situation and social  stability, although they are still cautious.    Goldenberg admitted: "It is difficult to erase all traces of  terrorism" but assured that the government of President Fujimori  will do away with guerrilla groups in 1995.    Regarding his lecture on economic reforms, Goldenberg  highlighted the efforts of the Peruvian Government to conclude  the privatization of state companies with the sale of the mining  and oil companies next November.    Asked about the little interest shown by Japan to invest in  the privatization process, Goldenberg said "the doors are open  to all," and did not discard the idea that he may receive some  offers.    Goldenberg added: "We built the legal framework for reforms,  the pacification of the country continues, and we will continue  to work on the privatization process and on ways to achieve the  investments needed for our development."    He also thanked the Japanese for the formation of the  support  group which provided the bridge credits that allowed Peru to  negotiate with its creditors in the Paris Club. He added that  Peru will soon negotiate its debt with the private banks.    Goldenberg also thanked the Japanese for their "support and  understanding" over the political reforms introduced by  President Fujimori. Japan was one of the few countries that did  not threaten to withdraw its economic aid following the  "self-coup" by Fujimori in April 1992.    The seminar was attended by political leaders and bankers of  Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Uruguay as well as by  Inter- American Development Bank President Enrique Iglesias who  was present at the formation of the first support group for Peru  in Nagoya (Japan) in April 1991.</p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / BOC takes lead in giving more details on directors' pay The controversy surrounding top directors' pay has prompted BOC Group and other leading companies to give shareholders more information about executive packages. BOC's annual report and accounts, sent to shareholders at the weekend, gives full details for the first time of every director's remuneration package, including pensions and share options. The industrial gases company has so far moved furthest in providing pay details. The group's chairman, Mr Richard Giordano, is also chairman of British Gas, which has been at the heart of concerns over executive pay. Next month, Grand Metropolitan, the food and drink conglomerate, is expected to provide a similar level of detail in its accounts. 'We will go further than ever before,' Grand Met said yesterday. Mr Giordano also sits on the Grand Met board. Earlier this year, Dixons, the electrical retail group, and Reuters, the information services group, led the way by giving shareholders a far greater amount of information on directors' pay than necessary under company law. The government is examining the issue of executive pay after public anger at recent large increases. This follows the disclosure that Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, had received a 75 per cent pay rise. Mr Giordano has pledged British Gas will also give far more details on directors' pay in its next annual report and accounts. One leading BOC shareholder termed the new level of information the 'Giordano effect' and said: 'We can only welcome what he is getting companies to do.' The BOC report and accounts contains five pages of details on the directors' pay packages, including details of each director's pension, in line with information routinely given to shareholders in the US. For example, the total benefit accrued to date for Dr Debajyoti Chatterji, managing director of technology, has a lump sum value of Pounds 115,000. Meanwhile, the Institute of Directors confirmed yesterday that it would be issuing new guidelines on executive pay in the new year. It is likely to stress that companies should make full disclosure of directors' pay details and also recommend shorter service contracts.</p>

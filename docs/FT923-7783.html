			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Markets (At a glance): Dollar slips to year-low The dollar dipped to a new low for the year this week, when it fell to Dollars 1.93 against Pounds 1 sterling in London on Thursday's close. The US Federal Reserve bank and other central banks intervened by buying dollars for D-marks on Tuesday to limit falls against the German currency. Today's rate is a far cry from February 1985, when the dollar almost reached parity with sterling. It makes the US attractive for British holidaymakers, but those who want to speculate on a dollar recovery should note that US deposit accounts are paying a mere 3 per cent.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Part 431&blank;State Organization and General Administration <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to our proposed revisions to part 431, most opposing comments concerned the effect on ICFs/MR of withdrawing FFP during appeals. Some commenters noted that OBRA '87 specifically exempted ICFs/MR from its scope, and stated that it is not appropriate to change the ICF/MR rules in implementing a law that applies to other facilities. Some commenters stated that the discussion on ICFs/MR was lost within the SNF/NF regulations, and there was no discussion in the preamble concerning applicability to ICFs/MR. Some stated that HCFA provided no rationale for this change in the ICF/MR rules, and therefore a proposed rule should be published which allows for full notice and comment rulemaking. Some commented that if the proposal had been written in a more direct manner, more groups would have written to object. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree that it would be preferable to include the provisions applicable to ICFs/MR at a later date in rulemaking focused on ICFs/MR. Therefore, we are adopting the commenters' proposals that the 120 days of FFP continue for ICFs/MR until this issue may be more fairly resolved in such a rulemaking. Therefore, at this time, we are leaving the existing appeals system in place for ICFs/MR. There were other comments concerning ICFs/MR that are outside the purview of this regulation, and are therefore not addressed in this discussion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons stated directly above, we are revising &sect;&sect;431.151, 431.153, and 431.154 to delete reference to SNFs and ICFs as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;&sect;431.151 (``Scope and applicability.'') is revised so that subpart B of part 431 specifies the appeal procedures the State must make available to an ICF/MR for which the State denies, terminates, or fails to renew certification or a provider agreement for the Medicaid program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;&sect;431.153 (``Evidentiary hearing.'') is revised to state that <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _An ICF/MR whose certification or provider agreement is denied, terminated, or not renewed must be given an opportunity for a full evidentiary hearing on the denial, termination or nonrenewal; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _If the facility requests a hearing, it must be completed either before the effective date of the denial, termination or nonrenewal or within 120 days after that date; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The hearing must, at a minimum, include the provisions of &sect;431.153(e). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

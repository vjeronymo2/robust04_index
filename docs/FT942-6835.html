			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (17): Accent on 'aftercare' - The Midlands Johnson Controls, the US automotive components manufacturer, will be the first occupant of the Black Country Development Corporation's automotive components park at Wednesbury. The company figures on East Midlands Development's 1993-94 success list because it is investing in Mansfield. It already has a presence at Burton-on-Trent. Its investment decision emphasises a developing trend in the attempts by Midlands agencies to stiffen the indigenous economy by injections of new capital. It is the desire to sustain companies which have already made investments. The reasons are not hard to seek. The domestic recession has both reduced the capacity of British companies to expand and dimmed the desire to relocate. The operating cost differential between London and the south-east of England on one hand and the Midlands on the other has been eroded. Lower domestic activity has increased the importance of foreign companies in the economic mix of the Midlands. Indeed, Mr Chris Tillett, chief economist at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, accountants, in Birmingham, observes: 'If the rate of inward investment falls, the West Midlands' chances of growing at the national average will be much reduced.' But with less inward investment about, there is growing competition to attract it. 'Given the downward trend in inquiries, the principle of 'aftercare' has never been more important. Further investment by way of expansion of foreign-owned companies is becoming an increasing percentage of recorded investment successes,' noted the forward plan of East Midlands Development, the inward investment agency. Indeed, the 20 companies on its 1993-94 success list together account for about 2,300 jobs. Similarly, the West Midlands Development Agency reported that 56 per cent of the investment projects for 1993-94 resulted from expansion programmes. 'The 47 expansion projects generated Pounds 309m capital expenditure, created 2,100 jobs and safeguarded a further 4,000. The jobs created through expansion projects represent 66 per cent of all new jobs.' In total, there were 83 investment projects in the West Midlands. But only 14 were new and 19 were acquisitions of local companies by overseas groups. The investment involved was Pounds 652.7m, triple that of 1992-93. But it is doubtful if so high a figure will be repeated in the current year. 'The performance in 1993-94 reflected the relative buoyancy of the world economy the previous year,' says Mr Paul Richards, WMDA's chief executive. 'International companies coming to the UK have been more active than indigenous companies. They were slightly ahead of the upturn.' This has been most notable among North American companies. This year, though, the downturn in European economies is more likely to be reflected, suggesting that, in terms of economic development, expansion of existing operations should be more significant than greenfield investments. In this respect, the West Midlands is in a stronger position than its counterpart. With about 1,000 companies of overseas origin already, the volume of activity is creating its own dynamism. By contrast, the East Midlands has done badly in attracting foreign investment - only about 3 per cent of the national total. One reason has been the lack of a regional organisation and, allied to that, the fragmented effort to attract investment. East Midlands Development has been operating for just over six months, compared with West Midlands Development Agency, which has been in the business for 10 years. In trying to make up the lost ground, Mr John Finch, its chief executive, stresses the need to work with local organisations. 'The way I see that happening is that you say to the authorities: 'You have the knowledge and expertise about your area; our expertise is in promoting the region and getting industry to look at the region - see us as the overseas marketing arm, if you like'.' In the East Midlands the hope lingers that inward investors will provide an economic stimulus to offset the effects of coalmine closures. Incentives are available for a development area around Mansfield and an intermediate area for the north of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire. But, although the incentives are helpful, they are not likely to be of crucial importance in attracting new investment. KPMG Peat Marwick, accountants, in a recent survey of foreign companies in the East Midlands found that, 'when asked about their motivation for selecting their current site, only 2.3 per cent of respondents were attracted by available grants and incentives'.</p>

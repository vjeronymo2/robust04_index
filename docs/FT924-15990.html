			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Politicking may delay new cabinet in Brazil AN impasse over the formation of a new cabinet could leave Brazil without a president until Monday. Vice-President Itamar Franco had been expected to be named acting president by the Senate today, after the landslide congressional vote on Tuesday night to suspend President Fernando Collor from office while he is tried by the Senate on charges of corruption. But, to widespread surprise last night, Mr Franco asked the Senate for more time to assemble a cabinet. This reflected the difficulties he is having in reconciling the various parties which supported impeachment of Mr Collor. Party leaders and state governors spent the day in discussions at Mr Franco's residence, but with little result. However, Mr Paulo Haddad, an economist from Mr Franco's home state of Minas Gerais, emerged as planning minister and Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso of the social democratic PSDB, as expected, was named foreign minister. The biggest problem lies with the crucial new finance portfolio. Mr Orestes Quercia, leader of the Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), Brazil's largest, refuses to accept in the job anyone from the PSDB, vetoing the widely tipped economist Mr Jose Serra and preferring an unnamed figure from the Sao Paulo business community. In retaliation, the PSDB is threatening to stay out of the Franco government. Moreover, both these parties and the left-wing Workers' Party are objecting to inclusion in the government of friends of Mr Franco, warning that this could result in problems similar to those faced by Mr Collor. 'It is becoming a war of vetoes,' said one disgruntled participant in the negotiations. Mr Alexandre de Barros, a political consultant, said: 'It is very depressing to see such lack of political maturity in the division of the spoils.' Many senators were irritated by the requested delay, which might not be granted. Mr Franco is known to dislike speedy decision-making. Yesterday, he admitted that the new cabinet might not be ready until Monday. Meanwhile, Mr Collor's cabinet will remain as caretaker. The trial of Mr Collor, who is suspended for 180 days during the process, began yesterday afternoon, after the result of the vote in the House of Representatives and the formal request for Mr Collor's suspension from office had been handed by Mr Ibsen Pinheiro, House chairman, to Mr Mauro Benevides, Senate chairman, yesterday morning. The overwhelming 441:38 vote in the House of Representatives exposes Mr Collor to judgment by the Senate on charges of benefiting from an extensive corruption network during his term of office. If found guilty, he would be ousted from the presidency, and barred from public office for eight years. A spokesman for Mr Collor said the president had no plans to resign: 'The word resignation has not been mentioned by him.' His spokesman said Mr Collor would collaborate with the transfer of power: 'He wants the process to be civilised and to cause the minimum possible social agitation.' The festivity which greeted the impeachment vote has continued across the country. Demonstrator after demonstrator proclaimed: 'We're proud to be Brazilians.'</p>

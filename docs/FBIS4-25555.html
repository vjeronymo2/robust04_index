			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Hong Kong by staff reporter: "Chen Ziming </F> Suffers From All Kinds of Diseases and Ailments, Must Seek  Permission Before Going Out"]    [Text] Wang Zhihong, wife of famous mainland dissident  Chen Ziming, expressed a sense of relief over her husband's  return home on 8 June, but she also expressed deep concern over  the diseases her husband contracted in jail over past years. At  present, Chen Ziming must ask for permission from the  authorities concerned if he wants to go out.    Wang Zhihong yesterday accompanied her husband back to their  home in Beijing. Unlike before, their home was surrounded by  more than 10 uniformed and plainclothes policemen. Wang Zhihong  said that the present situation of her husband and herself was  delicate.    Yesterday afternoon, Chen Ziming's mother returned from her  son's place. She was deeply worried about her son's health, and  asked -- since her son had been allowed to seek medical  treatment outside prison -- why the authorities still did not  allow him to go out freely.    Chen Ziming is now suffering from heart disease, stomach  disease, high blood pressure (100-160), and skin disease.  According to his wife, except for the skin disease, all the  diseases were contracted in prison. The greatest hope of Wang  Zhihong is that her husband's diseases will be cured.    Chen Ziming is now living with his family, but he still  cannot go out and return to society freely. Wang Zhihong was  discontent with the fact that her husband had to "ask for  permission from the authorities beforehand" if he wanted to go  out. She is now negotiating with the authorities in a bid to  achieve her husband's freedom.    After living in prison for five years, Chen Ziming lost some  weight, but he was not dejected at having contracted many  diseases. Wang Zhihong said that her husband was in a good  mental condition and that the heavy mental pressure was  mitigated. "However, the first thing now is to give him medical  treatment." Wang also said that they were still facing the  pressure from the authorities concerned.    Wang Zhihong, who spoke prudently, said that in the current  sensitive period, it was inconvenient for Chen Ziming to say  anything, but she hoped to express their thanks to overseas  readers through this newspaper for their loving care.    It has been learned that after returning home, Chen Ziming  continued to be under full surveillance by the authorities and  could not come into contact with the outside world. In  addition, his family was short of money, and they are concerned  over their future livelihood. It is said that Chen's mother has  formally expressed this concern to the authorities.</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STANTON ANTI-PORN TACTIC COMMUNITY'S REAL THREAT  </P> <P> Sometimes the medicine is more deadly than the disease, which is usually the  case in most misguided attempts to stamp out pornography. The situation in the  city of Stanton's 4-year effort to drive an adult bookstore out of town was in  that category.  </P> <P> Fortunately, the state's 4th District Court of Appeal on Wednesday put an end  to Stanton's assault of the First Amendment by declaring the ordinance  regulating the business to be unconstitutional.  </P> <P> The decision was not so much a victory for the bookstore as it was for the  First Amendment right of free speech.  </P> <P> We can sympathize with the public officials, residents and clergymen who for  the past 4 years have been trying to force out the bookstore they believe  peddles pornography in the sexually explicit material it sells.  </P> <P> But neither government nor any individual, no matter how well-meaning, has any  business trying to determine -- or restrict -- what books or films adults can  read or see. That decision must always be left to the individual.  </P> <P> Whether or not the material the bookshop sells is pornographic is not the  question, or the danger. The books, magazines, toys and videotapes that the  store sells are available only to consenting adults who come to the store  seeking it out. The material is not foisted on any unsuspecting adult and is  not available to minors. The real issue, and biggest threat to the community,  was the city's attempts at censorship and restricting freedom of speech and  choice through a series of council actions that the appellate judges branded as  a "Keystone Cop legislative chase of (EarMark Books owner Ginger) Cox's sex  shop."  </P> <P> Cities have the right to set zoning laws. But they cannot be allowed to make  those laws so restrictive that they would make it virtually impossible for an  otherwise legal operation to remain in business. That seemed to be precisely  what Stanton was trying to do. And the appellate court rightfully would have no  part of it.  </P> <P> Ironically, most of the public opposes that approach. In a Times survey last  month, only 35% of the people polled favored a ban on the rental of X-rated  movies in home video stores. Pornography is not very popular, but even less  desirable are misguided efforts to restrict it through censorship.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Manila, May 16 (YONHAP) -- South Korea proposed  Monday to form a "special partnership" with the Philippines  accenting economic cooperation. The Philippines pledged to  support South Korea's bid for a non-permanent seat on the U.N.  Security Council in 1996-97 and said it will not seek diplomatic  normalization with North Korea before resolution of the nuclear  problem.    Seoul, meanwhile, promised to expand its Economic  Cooperation  and Development Fund (EDCF) to the Philippines and to improve  the status of the 8,000 Filipino workers employed illegally in  South Korea.    Starting the first working day of his Asian tour here,  visiting South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu made the  offers in talks with his Filipino counterpart Roberto Romulo,  Han's aides said.    The "special partnership" would be similar to that South  Korea established with Canada this year, but with Manila the  goal would be combining Seoul's capital and technology with the  resources and labor force available here, they said.    "The Philippines is the closest country to South Korea in  the  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)," Han told  reporters Sunday. "We share similar experiences in recent  political development, specifically in the democratization  process, and there is much we can offer to the Philippines in  terms of economic growth experience."    "We are thinking of forming a civilian forum between the two  countries to highlight other areas of exchange, such as culture  and business," said Han.    Bilateral trade is rising steadily and registered 1.25  billion U.S. dollars last year, with Seoul posting 934 million  dollars in exports.    Filipino soldiers, including President Fidel Ramos, fought  for the Seoul side during the fratricidal 1950-53 Korean war.    Romulo, recalling his country's past cooperation in trying  to  defuse the North Korean nuclear crisis, pledged continued  support, the aides said. He sought better conditions for the  estimated 8,000 "undocumented" Filipino workers in Korea,  requesting that they be allowed to stay longer or the quota of  3,000 who are officially accepted as foreign trainees be  increased.    Han said he will give the issue positive consideration, the  aides said.    On the economic front, Han asked Manila to allow active  participation by South Korean companies in developing Subic Bay,  the former U.S. Naval base now being turned mainly into a  tourist resort.    On EDCF, Han gave a favorable reply to the 35 million  dollars  worth of projects under review.    The South Korean foreign minister arrived in Manila Sunday  morning, his first stop on an 11-day Asian tour taking him later  to Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia.    Han called on President Ramos after his talks with Romulo  and  met with opinion leaders to promote private-level exchanges  between the two countries.</p>

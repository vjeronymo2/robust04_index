			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Right-wingers pose threat to Israeli coalition EXTREME right-wing members of Israel's government yesterday stepped up threats to quit Mr Yitzhak Shamir's coalition - a move likely to presage an early general election - in protest against negotiations on Palestinian self-government in the occupied territories. Two parties, Tehiya and Moledet, have long said they would leave the government, depriving Mr Shamir of his parliamentary majority, if the Middle East peace process reached the stage of negotiations on Palestinian autonomy, which they strongly oppose. News from Washington that Israeli and Palestinian negotiators had exchanged proposals covering autonomy prompted the leaders of the two factions to say they would quit the coalition by next week if it was confirmed that Israel had tabled an autonomy blueprint. Negotiators said that they had only exchanged proposals for an agenda for the talks. After a first bilateral meeting between Israel and Jordan, a Jordanian spokesman said his country had proposed an agenda including Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, water, borders and the refugee problem. Delegates reported little progress in separate bilateral talks Israel held with Syria and Lebanon. Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were due to meet again last night. Jordanian and Palestinian representatives called on the Israeli delegation to stay in Washington in a bid to make further headway, but Mr Yossi Ben Aharon, a senior Israeli negotiator, said his delegation was still scheduled to leave Washington tonight. He remained optimistic, however: 'What may seem like sterile deadlock is part and parcel of the process,' he said. US officials are also putting on a brave face, saying that these often hostile bilateral meetings are a necessary step in the evolution of Arab-Israeli relations. Meanwhile, Jewish settlers in the occupied territories, from whom Tehiya and Moledet draw heavy support, reacted angrily to reports of progress. Mr Benny Katsover, a senior leader of the settlers, threatened violence if autonomy was conceded. 'We won't recognise any government authority given to the Arabs. We won't accept it and the real meaning of non-acceptance would be confrontation, head to head.' Mr Shamir's office confirmed that only the agenda for detailed negotiations had been discussed in Washington. But Mr Yossi Achimeir, a senior aide to the prime minister, said it was clear that interim Palestinian self-government - a central aim of the US-Russian sponsored peace talks - would soon be on the table. He predicted the departure of Tehiya and Moledet from the coalition was 'very close'. Mr Achimeir said he expected a general election in three or four months as a result - six months ahead of the due date in November. He said the peace talks would continue in the meantime. Speculation that elections will be called early has been building steadily in the past two weeks. Yesterday Mr Yitzhak Rabin, a top Labour leader and former premier, said Mr Shamir's commitment to the Jewish settlers meant it was impossible for him to advance the peace process. An early election was necessary. Mr Shamir is not averse. His Likud party is ahead in the polls. He can argue that his tough stance in the peace talks had forced the Arabs to negotiate on Israel's terms. Domestically, rising unemployment, a growing political issue, is likely to be worse in November than in the spring.</p>

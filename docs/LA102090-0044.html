			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHALLENGER ASTRONAUT MONUMENT UNVEILED  </P> <P> With Buddhist blessings and bittersweet memories, a 27-foot-long replica of the  space shuttle Challenger was unveiled in Little Tokyo on Friday in honor of  Col. Ellison Onizuka, one of seven crew members who died in the shuttle  explosion more than four years ago.  </P> <P> One-tenth the size of the Challenger, the memorial stands in the middle of a  plaza named after Onizuka, the first Asian-American in space.  </P> <P> "With this project now fixed to the street that bears his name, all of you have  given my husband, Ellison Onizuka, a very proud sense of permanence here in the  City of Angels," said his widow, Lorna, before she pulled a cord unveiling the  fiberglass model with the help of Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and several  astronauts from the American and Japanese space programs.  </P> <P> "Thank you for remembering with me and my children and my family a man who  gently touched our lives in very special ways and then went away," said  Onizuka.  </P> <P> So true in detail is the monument that astronaut Col. Loren Shriver quipped  that "if we have too many more problems with (the space shuttle) Columbia and  hydrogen leaks, we may come and ask the committee if we can borrow this shuttle  and use it for a while."  </P> <P> Money for the $250,000 memorial is being raised by the local Japanese-American  community. The replica sits atop a black granite base with a bronze plaque,  bearing a large relief bust of Onizuka, and an inscription in English and  Japanese.  </P> <P> "Born and raised in a simple rural community, he walked a remarkable path that  led from the coffee fields of Kona, Hawaii, to miles above the earth," reads  part of the inscription.  </P> <P> The ill-fated Challenger launch was the second space flight for the 39-year-old  Onizuka. Less than two minutes after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986, the Challenger  exploded, killing all seven aboard.  </P></p>

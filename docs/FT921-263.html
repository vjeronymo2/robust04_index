			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Nellist's way - Ballot Box An interview by BBC Radio 4 in Coventry South East the other day went roughly as follows. 'Will you be voting for Dave Nellist in the general election?' 'Of course, he's always been a strong supporter of the Labour movement.' 'You realise that Dave Nellist is no longer the official candidate of the Labour party?' 'Oh, yes, of course.' 'So will you be voting for Dave Nellist at the general election?' 'Oh, no, of course not.' The confusion may continue all the way to the ballot box. An opinion poll in the Birmingham Post today suggests that Nellist, the man expelled from the Labour party for alleged Militant activities and now standing as Independent Labour, has 30 per cent of the vote, against 32 per cent for official Labour and 28 per cent for the Tories. When he was still a member of the Labour party at the last general election, Nellist won 47 per cent. He may now let in the Tories.</p>

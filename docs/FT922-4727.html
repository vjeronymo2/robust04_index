			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Profitable lessons for an outdated school system: Educational reform and plans to create a network of private schools are gaining momentum in the US If the dreams of reformers are realised, many 21st century Americans will not remember their first day at school. The futuristic 'campuses' planned by Mr Chris Whittle, a Tennessee entrepreneur, will be cradle-to-college institutions. Harried parents will be able to deposit their new-born children in day-care facilities. As the children grow up they will move into kindergarten and thence through the customary 12 grades of American education. A one-stop Whittle campus, smothered in the latest technology, will serve their every need. Starting school at age zero is just one of a host of innovations proposed by Mr Whittle. Like other reformers in the US, he believes every assumption underlying conventional schooling must be challenged. Why close schools before parents finish work? Why open them only five days a week? Why let students vegetate during the summer? Why slice the curriculum into 40 minute slots with artificial subject boundaries? Why expect 25 different students to learn at the same pace from one teacher? Why rely on textbooks in an age of computers and videos? To turn ideas into reality, Mr Whittle has launched the Edison Project. With Dollars 60m in seed money, a team will spend the coming year drawing up a blueprint for an entirely new form of American education. Mr Whittle hopes to open 100 new-style campuses by 1996, initially providing only day-care, kindergarten and elementary education. By 2010, he hopes to have 1,000 campuses spread across America, serving 2m students of all ages and backgrounds. He is not a philanthropist. Whittle schools intend to make a profit by charging parents fees of about Dollars 5,500 a year - roughly the per pupil cost of public (government-run) education. The profits will supposedly be made by using less bureaucracy than the public sector and by making better use of new technologies. When Mr Whittle unveiled these grandiose plans last year, he lacked credibility. He is best known for a satellite TV network that beams news (plus commercials) to classrooms. What, complained sceptics, does Mr Whittle  -a drop out from Columbia Law School - know about education? He has responded by hiring some big names. His greatest coup came 10 days ago when Mr Benno Schmidt, the president of Yale University, announced he was quitting to become chief executive of the Edison Project. This voluntary descent from the pinnacle of American education stunned colleagues. It was as if the Master of Trinity College Cambridge had abruptly declared his intention to run a chain of City Technology Colleges. Mr Schmidt will head a team that includes some feisty contributors to America's educational debate, such as Mr Chester Finn, a former adviser to Presidents Reagan and Bush, and Mr John Chubb, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and co-author of Politics, Markets and America's Schools, an influential book that argued for more competition and choice in US education. Mr Whittle's skills as a publicist are not in doubt. But does his plan have any hope of succeeding? Given the anxiety about standards in public schools, many affluent parents will experiment with Whittle schools. But whether the venture can succeed on the scale intended and serve as a model for the public sector is much less certain. Mr Whittle reckons he will have to raise about Dollars 2.5bn to cover the costs of opening 1,000 campuses. This is a huge sum for an educational project aiming to make a commercial return. The appetite of investors, moreover, may be reduced by the project's streak of apparent altruism. To counter charges of cream-skimming, Mr Whittle has pledged to: Reserve 20 per cent of places for needy students and fund them through scholarships. Forgo entry tests and select pupils randomly if there is excess demand for places. Hold charges per pupil at or below the level in public schools. The point of these conditions is to ensure that reforms pioneered in Whittle schools can be copied by the public sector. The Edison team wants to show that it can take the same raw material and provide a better education at a lower cost. But the cross subsidies will obviously reduce its overall return on capital. If the team really wants to improve public sector education, why doesn't it participate in the Bush administration's 'America 2000' initiative? The White House is awarding contracts for the creation of a new generation of public schools - at least one for each of the 535 congressional districts. Mr Schmidt hotly rejects the criticism. His aim in leaving Yale is to improve all schools, he says. He just happens to believe reform can be promoted more effectively from outside the public sector. Bureaucracies, he says, are just not good at 'innovation, risk-taking and paradigm leaps.' He draws a parallel with higher education. Support for a private college such as Stanford University, he says, does not constitute an attack on the University of California, a public-sector institution. In his view, American higher education flourishes because it is competitive and diverse; the same ought to be true of secondary education. Mr Whittle, meanwhile, sees no conflict in his dual role as entrepreneur and social reformer: 'You can do good and do well at the same time,' he says. His timing, at least, is good. After a decade of relentless criticism of public schools, the US seems ready for educational experiments. But the profitability of the Whittle project may ultimately hinge on a reform that remains intensely controversial. If US states were to introduce some form of voucher scheme - distribute their educational budgets directly to parents rather than to government-run schools - every family would be able to afford a Whittle school. The mould of American education would then be truly broken. Indeed, Mr Whittle would soon face an army of competitors. Opposition to vouchers remains intense, mainly on the grounds that they would accentuate existing educational inequality. In fact everything would depend on the rules: if every child got the same voucher and no topping up was permitted, inequality might be reduced. The Edison team, however, knows that extending the range of educational choices available will exert pressure for reforms that make choice easier - and hence that improve its prospects. Whatever the outcome of the debate, the momentum for reform seems unstoppable. The American high school is about a century old. In its day it was a world-beating social innovation, providing an unrivalled mass education that helped the US economy cruise past international competitors. In the face of today's quite different social and economic challenges, the US is becoming aware that its 19th century blueprint is hopelessly dated. Hence the pressure to 're-invent' schools. The Edison Project and similar public-sector ventures are starting with a blank sheet of paper, or rather a blank computer screen. If they succeed, America's competitors could find themselves leapfrogged for a second time.</p>

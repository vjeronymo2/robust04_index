			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Airtours looking for acquisitions after 32.7% profit rise AIRTOURS, the tour operator, announced full-year pre-tax profits up 32.7 per cent to Pounds 36.5m in the year to the end of September. It also disclosed that it was examining possible purchases of travel companies in the UK and on the European continent. Mr David Crossland, chairman, said the company carried 1.7m passengers compared with 1m in 1991. He said this gave Airtours a UK market share of 13-14 per cent, compared with 29 per cent secured by Thomson, market leader in UK package tourism, and 15 per cent by Owners Abroad, the second-biggest company by passenger numbers. Turnover was up 40 per cent to Pounds 405.6m. Mr Crossland said the reduction in profit margin was the result of price-cutting which had occurred in the holiday market last May and June. The final dividend is 6.7p (up from 5.25p), bringing the total to 7.25p (up from 5.75p). Earnings per share were 27.47p (up from 24.68p). There was no contribution from Pickfords, the UK's third largest travel agency chain, which Airtours bought from NFC, the transport group, for Pounds 16m last September. Mr Crossland said Pickfords made profits of Pounds 2.7m in the year to end-September. Airtours was investing in new technology at Pickfords to provide the group with more information about the state of the travel market, he said. At least 18 of the 150 rack spaces in the average Pickfords branch now displayed Airtours brochures, compared with four before the acquisition. Airtours' net cash balance fell to Pounds 65m at its lowest point last February and ended the financial year at Pounds 155m, compared with Pounds 103m last year. Airtours is interested in buying more UK travel agents to add to its 334 Pickfords outlets. The company is particularly keen to increase its network in the north of England. Airtours is also considering buying a travel business in Germany. Mr Crossland said that the tourism business in Germany was similar to that in the UK, but the average price paid for holidays was higher. Airtours would proceed cautiously. Mr Crossland said bookings for winter 1992-93 were ahead of last year. By the end of October, Airtours' summer 1993 bookings were up 3 per cent against a 3 per cent fall in the market.

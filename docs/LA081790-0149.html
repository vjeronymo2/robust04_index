			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN LOBBY CRITIC CHOATE OUT AT TRW  </P> <P> Pat Choate, a leading critic of Americans who leave top government jobs to  lobby for Japanese firms, has been forced to resign from TRW Inc. because of  controversy over an upcoming book on the subject, friends said Thursday.  </P> <P> Choate, a vocal trade commentator and policy analyst based in Washington, was  told by TRW that his continued employment was untenable given the publication  in October of "Agents of Influence," according to friends. The book is expected  to examine how 200 former U.S. officials have taken jobs as lobbyists for  foreign interests, primarily Japanese, and include details on payments made and  secret agreements to hide the true source of funds.  </P> <P> Choate has estimated that Japanese government agencies, corporations and  foundations spent $150 million in 1988 and $250 million in 1989 on lobbying and  other public relations efforts in the United States, far more than any other  foreign nation.  </P> <P> His supporters expressed concern Thursday that Choate's separation from TRW  would have a chilling effect on other critics of foreign trade practices or  lobbying.  </P> <P> "If Pat was forced out, it means it's going to be very difficult for people who  work for American companies to develop an independent viewpoint on U.S.-Japan  trade," said John B. Judis, senior editor of a Chicago-based political journal,  "In These Times." Judis wrote a widely publicized piece on Japanese lobbying,  "Yen for Power," for the New Republic magazine earlier this year.  </P> <P> TRW, a maker of auto and defense-related products with headquarters in  Cleveland, reportedly does $400 million in business a year with Japanese firms.  TRW Space &amp; Defense Sector is based in Redondo Beach.  </P> <P> Makoto Kuroda, a retired official with the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry, has acknowledged he raised the issue of Choate and his book with TRW  President Joseph P. Gorman last year, but denied asking for his dismissal.  </P> <P> One Japanese government official said it was "inconceivable" that pressure from  Japan had led to Choate's departure. But he said many Japanese were deeply  concerned that the book would worsen U.S.-Japan relations and that publication  of it immediately prior to mid-term elections would give candidates cause to  use Japan as a scapegoat in their campaigns.  </P> <P> TRW spokesman Mike Johnson denied the firm had fired or forced Choate out of  his job, and said his departure was "in no way" related to pressure from  Japanese interests.  </P> <P> "His leaving was a mutual agreement between Pat and TRW so that he could go off  and write and lecture full time," Johnson said. TRW will retain him as a  consultant.  </P> <P> Choate declined comment. Friends, however, described him as stunned over the  severance because the firm had known he was working on the book for the past 2  1/2 years.  </P> <P> U.S. Rep. Mel Levine (D-Los Angeles), who has worked closely with Choate on  issues of U.S. industrial competitiveness, called his departure from TRW  "perplexing" and "regrettable" and said Congress should look into it if there  were evidence of foreign influence.  </P> <P> "If he lost his job due to foreign influence . . . it illustrates what his book  is all about," said Roger Hickey, vice president for communications of the  Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank in Washington that favors more  direct government efforts to help industry compete with Japan.  </P> <P> Choate, a Texas native who picked cotton on his father's farm, joined TRW in  1981 as a vice president for policy analysis. A ubiquitous presence on talk  shows and task forces, in hearings and news reports, Choate is regarded as a  brilliant economist with a flair for transforming dense issues such as  infrastructure into hot national topics. In the mid-1980s, he drew national  attention to the issue of America's industrial competitiveness, with Ronald  Reagan making it the center of his 1987 State of the Union Message.  </P> <P> Interest in Choate's book is so high that its publisher, Alfred Knopf, has  increased the first printing run from 20,000 copies to 50,000 copies. The  Economic Policy Institute plans to hold a seminar on the book in Washington in  October. In addition, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, is planning a hearing on  foreign lobbying efforts this fall.  </P></p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / People: Upheaval at B Elliott Boardroom upheaval continues at B Elliott as the streamlined engineering group tries to restructure its way out of the recession and reduce its exposure to the depressed machine tool trade. The group has announced that Trevor Smith, group human resources director, resigned on January 8 'as a result of the recent restructuring'. Smith was not being replaced, because the smaller size of the group no longer warranted his position. His departure follows Jim Martin's resignation as director last week. In September last year, Eddie Addison resigned from the board to enable him to concentrate on subsidiary Addison Tube Forming. B Elliott is looking to sell its remaining machine tool operations, once its core business, to concentrate on specialist and electrical engineering. The group's market value has shrunk from Pounds 45m in mid-1991 to Pounds 11.1m after shares were relisted last month following the announcement of a refinancing package including a Pounds 16.3m debt-equity swap. Following the resignation of Sir Norman Fowler as non-executive director last May, the company has appointed another three non-executives to the board with effect from the beginning of the year. They are Neil Falkner, 65, chairman and chief executive of Falkner Moller Partners, an investment management company that after the restructuring holds 46.7 per cent of the equity; Chris Wood, 51, an executive director of FMS who was in the past on the board of Renold; and William Eccles, director of Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures which now holds a 16.8 per cent stake in B Elliott. ***** Coopers &amp; Lybrand Eugene Freedman, chairman of Coopers &amp; Lybrand in the US, has just been appointed chairman of the international Coopers &amp; Lybrand network. Coopers &amp; Lybrand (International) is an association of autonomous national professional accountancy and consulting firms, with 733 offices in 121 countries. Freedman replaces Brandon Gough, chairman of the UK firm who has completed his two-year term. He was selected by what he calls 'informal consensus' among the executive committee of the network. Freedman sees his role of chairman as 'setting the agenda, leading the business and causing things to happen. We want a heavy market client focus in the aggressive pursuit of business,' he says, focusing particularly on western and eastern Europe and the Far East. The firm will also concentrate on organising around 'world clients'. He hastily adds that profits for the partnership are also important, but will follow from his priorities for Coopers: 'Relevant, responsive, timely, efficient, value-added services. The provision of services is where the rubber hits the road,' he says.</p>

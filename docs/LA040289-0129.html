			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACADEMY STAYING PUT  </P> <P> Once and for all, can we please set the record straight? The Los Angeles Police  Department has no plans, and will never have any plans, to expand the grounds  of the police academy in Elysian Park. Perhaps, if (Sam Hall) Kaplan would have  checked with the department before he wrote his column (March 19), it would not  have contained so much erroneous information.  </P> <P> A major fact Kaplan missed was that in 1972 the issue of moving the academy out  of the park went before city voters. The enormous expense of moving the academy  and of not having a facility centrally located were extensively debated. The  result was that voters decided the academy should stay at the same location it  had occupied since 1935.  </P> <P> The article also failed to include the fact that no city official, elected or  otherwise, can act to have the current site enlarged. To add more acreage would  require the matter to be placed on the ballot for voter approval. I seriously  doubt that would ever happen. It is also important to note that the proposed  academy remodeling would, should Proposition 2 garner two-thirds voter approval  this month, be less intrusive upon the surrounding community because the  parking will be underground and the pistol ranges indoors and soundproof.  </P> <P> GREGORY R. BERG  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P> Sam Hall Kaplan replies:  </P> <P>  Capt. Berg is correct. The Police Department has no plans on record to expand  the grounds of the Police Academy in Elysian Park. What the department wants is  to expand the academy itself, tripling its size to an estimated 224,000 square  feet, according to preliminary plans.  </P> <P>  That includes increasing the parking from 400 spaces to 1,000 spaces in a two-  and three-story structure. Because of unstable soil conditions, the parking  facility would not be built underground.  </P> <P>  It must be obvious that such an expansion, costing about $40 million of the  $176-million bond issue to construct, will have an impact on Elysian Park.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Binder partners to go in merger Nearly 12 per cent of the partners in BDO Binder Hamlyn, the UK's eighth-largest accountancy practice, will lose their jobs before a merger with Arthur Andersen is finalised during the summer, it emerged yesterday. About 10 of the 86 Binder partners in the firm's London and Leeds partnerships will resign or take early retirement in the next few months before a merger with Andersen, the UK's fourth largest firm. Similar proportions of jobs will be lost in the other regional Binder partnerships merging with Andersen - Manchester, Newcastle and possibly Birmingham in some form of associate relationship. Binder stressed, however, that those who would leave already knew, and the job losses were unrelated to the imminent merger. Andersen entered talks for a merger with Binder earlier this year after developing plans in secret since last October. The merger will almost double the number of the firm's audit clients and should provide substantial opportunities for it to cross-sell its services. Andersen insists that Binder will remain a separate partnership, with some 'cross fertilisation' of management and shared training, but with Binder retaining its clients. Andersen believes it would destroy goodwill and lose clients if it simply tried to destroy the Binder name and subsume the partnership entirely within its own organisation. Under existing plans all Binder partners in the merged firm will continue to report to Mr Adrian Burn, Binder's current managing partner who helped broker the merger, - although nothing formal defining this structure has been put in the contract. Mr Jim Wadia, Andersen's managing partner in the UK, said: 'The intention is to retain the Binder brand name in the UK. Our experience of other mergers is to be flexible, nimble and to respond to the demands and needs of the market.' There will be no payment in the merger, but most Binder partners will be salaried partners of Andersen's UK firm. Some Binder partners will be shareholders in Andersen's worldwide partnership.</p>

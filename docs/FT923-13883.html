			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Court rules in insurance case ATTEMPTS by four companies in the London United Investments insurance group, which collapsed two years ago, to put together schemes of arrangement for the benefit of their creditors, have been boosted by a judgment of the Court of Appeal. The case concerned the powers of the Policyholders' Protection Board. The four companies - Kingscroft Insurance, El Paso Insurance, Lime Street Insurance and Mutual Reinsurance - are in provisional liquidation. Their gross liabilities total Dollars 2.5bn and their assets about Dollars 1.7bn. They believe the proposed schemes, which would enable them to run off their business in the normal way and pay a percentage of the claims, would be more beneficial to their creditors than liquidation. The court's ruling, the effect of which was to increase the board's ability to participate in the schemes, was that the board was liable to pay on contingent claims on the four companies as they materialise and not just on claims agreed at the date of liquidation.</p>

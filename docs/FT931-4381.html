			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Books: Braced for a loud grinding of gears THE FATE OF HONG KONG By Gerald Segal Simon &amp; Schuster, Pounds 16.99 234 pages Hong Kong will be returned to Chinese sovereignty at midnight on June 30 1997. However, that is virtually the only thing that we know with certainty about its future. As Gerald Segal points out, the transfer is one fixed point set upon an ever-changing canvas of wider events which will both affect and be influenced by the fate of Hong Kong. The three main players in the drama naturally tend to view it from their own perspectives. China's priorities have been to recover the territory first, and to ensure mutual prosperity second. Britain, having decided that it had no option but to give up Hong Kong, has been concerned to withdraw with as much dignity as is possible when handing over 6m flourishing capitalists to a ruthless communist regime. Hong Kong's people have had to decide how best to position themselves for their own prosperity and security. The value of Segal's book is that it stands back from these rather narrow and emotionally charged approaches and examines Hong Kong dispassionately as an international issue. Segal, a Canadian-born academic who is senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, attempts to look into Hong Kong's future beyond 1997 by reference to a range of external factors. By far the most important is the course of political and economic development within China. Segal postulates various possible outcomes, from mass exodus to smooth convergence with China. To focus on outside factors affecting Hong Kong is, by implication, to accept the premise adopted by negotiators in Beijing and London - at least until the recent more determined attitude taken by Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor - that Hong Kong's people themselves have little say. Segal comments, however, that they have shown little initiative over their own fate. Those that have, have chosen to leave. A low turnout in the 1991 Legislative Council elections made it hard to argue that they were struggling to avoid Chinese rule. The current battle over modest democratic reforms proposed by Mr Patten is important in this context in that the governor has challenged Hong Kong's people to stand up for themselves. If, out of deference to the future sovereign or simply out of apathy, they do not support an increase in representation, there would be little willingness in Britain to pursue the argument. The fate of Hong Kong, especially if it is unhappy, could touch many countries. Since it will be a very high-profile part of China, it will affect China's international relations, for example with the US. It could create pressure for mass immigration of Hong Kong people around the world. Attempting to assess the role of the other countries in Hong Kong's future, Segal gets bogged down in examination of emigration trends. But there is no denying that emigration has already sapped Hong Kong's dynamism. Canada's aggressive immigration policy underlines the fact that Hong Kong people are viewed by some countries (not Britain) as an asset for which to compete, possibly to Hong Kong's detriment. Hong Kong itself is likely to be an influence on the rapidly changing country which it is joining. Segal's analysis of how it will fit into China is the most interesting part of the book. China's growth, particularly in the areas around Hong Kong, is creating shifts in relations between Beijing and the provinces. Hong Kong's economy has become increasingly interdependent with that of neighbouring Guangdong province, and particularly the prosperous Shenzhen special economic zone across the border. If economic development is accompanied by decentralisation of political power, it is possible that the Hong Kong tail will wag the Guangdong dog. Under this rosy scenario, Beijing's pragmatism would allow 1997 to pass unnoticed, and Hong Kong would then lead a newly industrialising south China economic zone. Such optimism could be supported by China's pragmatic 'one country, two systems' concept, its blurring of the geographical boundary by developing the areas around Hong Kong, and its increasing investment in Hong Kong and use of it as a financial and trade entrepot. Segal, however, expects a more prosaic fate: not collapse, but 'a loud grinding of gears as the cog of Hong Kong fits into the larger China'. He suggests that Hong Kong's dynamism will slow, to the pace of an albeit accelerating China, partly because of the already high rates of emigration among skilled professionals. He judges that China's rulers, while wanting Hong Kong to be prosperous, are more concerned about a smooth political absorption and would therefore accept less economic dynamism in Hong Kong if that was the necessary price. This outcome could take many forms: Hong Kong could still lead a new growth zone, or it could gradually wither. Beijing's policies, and its relations with its provinces and with other countries, will certainly be the most important factors determining whether or not the necessary conditions exist for Hong Kong to prosper. However, Hong Kong is above all a centre for business. It is business people who will have to make individual judgments about those policies and their effects. Their decisions will determine Hong Kong's new role and the pace at which it develops. Segal is a specialist in international affairs and examines Hong Kong from that perspective. Analysis of what is likely to influence both Chinese and western businessmen in making those decisions is also necessary in order to guess the fate of Hong Kong.</p>

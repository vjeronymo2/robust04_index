"This Russian-Polish agreement is just the first step  towards  creating an all-encompassing system to counter organized crime  in Europe," the commander in chief of Russia's border guards and  head of the Russian delegation, Andrey Nikolayev, told a news  conference afterwards. "So far this has been done at regional  level, but in the very near future we intend to conclude similar  agreements with our counterparts from Lithuania and Belarus, and  Poland is also willing to join them. After that, there should  be an agreement at overall, pan-European level."    It was stressed at the news conference that while becoming  an  obstacle to criminal gangs, the Russian-Polish border should  remain as open as possible for economic and cultural cooperation  between the two states.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs despite rising bond yields Wall Street AIDED BY heavy program trading, US share prices posted solid gains yesterday as investors shrugged off rising bond yields and disappointing inflation and employment news, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 23.48 ahead at 3,663.55 and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 3.39 at 463.72, while the Nasdaq composite advanced 6.66 to 776.50. NYSE volume was 283.4m shares. Equity prices struggled from the opening as rising bond yields unsettled market sentiment. The bond market was reacting to strengthening commodities prices and the latest news on inflation - a 0.4 per cent rise in the October consumer price index. Although the increase was broadly in line with analysts' forecasts, after Tuesday's much better than expected producer prices data, the stock and bond markets had been hoping that the consumer prices figures would be equally encouraging. The increase in bond yields immediately fed through into lower equities, and investors were also troubled by a jump in weekly unemployment insurance claims. The early losses, however, were not substantial, and smaller-company stocks actually started the day with solid gains. By midday the markets had recovered their poise, and by the afternoon a series of buy programs had pushed stocks further into positive territory. Semiconductor issues were bought on reports of strong demand for the companies' products. Only last week the sector was hit by selling on concern about sales. Texas Instruments forged ahead Dollars 4 to Dollars 63 1/8 , Motorola Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 102 7/8 , National Semiconductor Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 17 7/8 and Storage Technology Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 29 1/2 . Paramount Communications fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 80 5/8 in busy trading after administrators handling the disposal of the business empire of Mr Robert Maxwell announced that his Macmillan publishing group would be sold to Paramount for just over Dollars 1bn. Telefonos de Mexico rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 52 3/8 as investors suggested that the chances of the Nafta pact passing congress in a crucial vote next week had been boosted by Tuesday night's televised debate between US Vice-president Al Gore and Nafta opponent Mr Ross Perot. Walt Disney lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 40 1/4 in early trading before recovering to end unchanged at Dollars 41 1/4 in volume of 3.4m shares after announcing that it would help fund its Euro Disney subsidiary while exploring a possible financial restructuring of the troubled theme park. Canada TORONTO hit a record peak in the second-busiest day of trading ever on the exchange. The TSE 300 index ended 18.1 higher at 4,269.5, with advances outpacing declines by 443 to 340 after volume of 99.3m shares valued at CDollars 698m.</p>

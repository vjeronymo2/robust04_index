			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HHS has been aware of this structural problem for some time, and established a task force to analyze nursing home compliance issues and develop strategies for dealing with compliance problems. The task force found that facilities in States which have comprehensive Medicaid coverage for nursing home services have the most difficulty finding eligible individuals to whom they can provide uncompensated services. Thus, the task force recommended increasing the eligibility limit for uncompensated services to three times the poverty level to increase the pool of individuals potentially eligible for uncompensated services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HHS then surveyed the regional offices of the Health Care Financing Administration, which administers the Medicaid program, to determine whether such a change in income eligibility would permit more nursing homes to meet their uncompensated services obligations by setting Hill-Burton income eligibility limits above Medicaid income eligibility limits. This survey indicated that 31 States and the District of Columbia have medically needy programs under which Medicaid covers all individuals who have annual incomes that are less than the cost of the nursing home services received and less than the Medicaid resource eligibility limits (usually, $2,000). Based on an average annual nursing home cost of $31,000 in 1992, an increase in the Hill-Burton income eligibility limit to three times the poverty level (to about $20,000) will not significantly increase the opportunity for facilities in these States to meet their uncompensated services obligations, since patient income is irrelevant unless it exceeds nursing home costs. However, even in these States, to the extent nursing home patients receive services not covered by Medicaid or are ineligible for Medicaid because they have resources exceeding the Medicaid limits, raising the Hill-Burton income eligibility limit would increase the pool of individuals eligible for uncompensated services. Moreover, in 16 of the remaining 19 States, a raise in the Hill-Burton individual income eligibility limit from the current $13,940 (double the poverty level) to the proposed $20,910 would result in a Hill-Burton income eligibility limit substantially above the Medicaid income eligibility limit of $15,192 that applies in these States. An increase in the income eligibility limit to three times the poverty level for nursing home services would thus greatly increase the pool of Hill-Burton eligibles in those States, and it seems likely that such a change would accordingly increase the opportunity to fulfill the Hill-Burton obligation for all 69 nursing homes in those States. While the remaining three States have Medicaid income eligibility limits that are below the current upper Hill-Burton individual income eligibility limit of $13,940, such a change would obviously increase the pool of Hill-Burton eligible individuals in those States as well. Thus, to the extent the compliance problems of nursing homes in those States are a function of a lack of eligible patients, an increase in the income eligibility limit to three times the poverty level for nursing home services would similarly assist them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

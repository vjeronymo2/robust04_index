			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 5 (XINHUA) -- The third national  council session of the Chinese People's Association for  Friendship With Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) opened here today.    President Han Xu of CPAFFC said in a work report at the  session that CPAFFC, as a non-governmental organization, has  established cooperative relations with more than 100  friendship-with-China organizations all over the world since it  was set up forty years ago.    He noted that CPAFFC, which is also in charge of  coordinating  the friendly bonding of Chinese cities with counterparts in  other countries, has so far helped 531 pairs of friendship  cities establish such a relationship.    "We have become more and more involved in economic work and  have made use of the already open channels for friendly  exchanges to pursue economic cooperation with other countries at  the central and local levels," the CPAFFC president said.    Among those attending the session were Chinese State  Councillor Ismail Amat, Qi Huaiyuan, director of the office in  charge of foreign affairs of the State Council, and some 250  CPAFFC council members.

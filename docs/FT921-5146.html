			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Insurgent Brown confounds pundits A CANDIDATE who restricts campaign contributions to Dollars 100 or less would seem likely to wilt in the intense heat of a US presidential race. So far, however, former Governor Jerry Brown of California is confounding the pundits. He won his first primary victory in Colorado on Tuesday, having come a close second to former Senator Paul Tsongas in Maine. Mr Brown is running what he calls an 'insurgency campaign'. He will not accept big cheques because he wants to 'give government back to the people'. He says the US is incapable of solving its domestic problems, not for lack of ideas but because special interest groups and an elite political ruling class block reform. To prove his credentials as an opponent of the system, Mr Brown strikes a casual pose while campaigning. Polo-necked sweaters replace the white shirts and ties of the other candidates. He also sports a red ribbon - a sign of solidarity with Aids victims. Part of his appeal lies in his strong environmental record while governor of California in the 1970s. He was one of the first political leaders to impose environmental restraints on US companies. The green movement is powerful in both Maine and Colorado, where Mr Brown scored heavily among Democrats rating the environment an important issue. On taxation, Mr Brown leans towards conservative 'supply-side' policies, favouring a 13 per cent flat rate income tax with virtually no exemptions. Yet on health care he supports a Canadian-style universal plan that wins support mainly among left-wing Democrats. By gaining 30 per cent of the vote in Colorado, Mr Brown has staved off the withdrawal of federal matching funds. Initially written off as a crank, he is now running a clear third behind Mr Tsongas and Governor Bill Clinton. Few analysts believe he can improve on this position, unless he makes more of his record as a former chief executive of America's richest and most populous state. His insurgency campaign, however, will plough ahead, tapping voter discontent with cash-driven conventional politics.</p>

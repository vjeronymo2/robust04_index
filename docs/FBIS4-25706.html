			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed Report: "Municipal Committee for Comprehensive </F> Management of Social Order Maps Out Plans for Improving Social  Order in the Summer and Calls For Intensified Efforts To Check  the `Six Vices'"]    [Text] The Shanghai Municipal Committee for the  Comprehensive Management of Social Order held its 12th plenary  session yesterday to map out plans for cracking down on criminal  activities by hooligans and for improving social order in the  summer. Wang Liping, deputy secretary of the municipal party  committee and chairman of the municipal committee for the  comprehensive management of social order, spoke at the meeting.    Wang Liping said: In recent years Shanghai has taken tough  and resolute measures to check activities in connection with the  "six vices," and we have received favorable comments from people  at home and abroad. However, in some places the activities have  continued despite efforts to check them. Therefore, all  localities and departments should pay attention to this  situation and intensify efforts to crack down on such  activities. Wang Li Ping stressed: Once discovered,  prostitution, gambling, drug abuse, drug trafficking, persons  engaged in spreading pornographic publications and products, and  owners of public entrainment facilities trying to seek customers  by means of sex must be resolutely investigated and punished  according to law. In dealing with criminal elements and gang  leaders who refuse to repent despite repeated education, it is  necessary to apply the principle of meting out severe punishment  promptly. The practice of replacing penalties with a fine or  replacing education with a fine shall not be permitted in  dealing with these people. Criminal elements who have been  found to assist or protect "six vices" activities, and party  cadres who participate in prostitution activities must be  investigated and severely punished. Law-enforcement departments  must resolutely resist the practice of pleading for mercy for  somebody and strengthen overall control over and day-to-day  management of public entertainment facilities. Resolute  measures must be taken to close down public entertainment  facilities that operate in violation of the law and that have  refused to reform themselves after repeated warnings. All  public entertainment facilities must observe and abide by the  provisions governing the management of social order. In  Shanghai, under no circumstance shall we allow the existence of  a place that is beyond the reach of the law. Participating in  the meeting were Zhu Daren and Gu Nianzu, vice chairmen of the  municipal committee for the comprehensive management of social  order, and leaders of various districts, counties, departments,  commissions, and offices who are also members of the municipal  committee for the comprehensive management of social order.</p>

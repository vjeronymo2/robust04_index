			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Western Army territory is the first military  community protected from a possible air attack. Today was an  unusual Sunday for the inhabitants of the Silvio Caro community  in Bahia Honda Municipality. At mid-morning, an air raid drill  broke the people's routine and daily chores. Without panic, well  disciplined, and well organized, each citizen occupied his or  her place in the people's tunnels. Students and the children  from a childcare center also demonstrated their preparation and  knowledge, finding safe shelter in a few minutes.    Silvio Caro, with 2,000 inhabitants, is the first military  community declared protected against a possible enemy air raid.  In an act of revolutionary reaffirmation, the Western Army  community staged an emulation action. Division General Nestor  Lopez Cuba [rank as heard], head of the Political Board of the  Revolutionary Armed Forces, congratulated the inhabitants of  Silvio Caro and asked them to keep up their efforts toward  readiness preparation.</p>

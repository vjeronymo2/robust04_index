			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 7 (CNA) -- Beijing has agreed to allow  40 Taiwan reporters to visit Mainland China to cover an  investigation into the March 31 murder and robbery of 24 Taiwan  tourists on Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang Province.    "We were told that two or three more applications could be  available if needed," Li Ching-ping, deputy secretary-general of  the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), told newsmen Saturday [7  May] morning.    Li said he received a phone call from Liu Gangqi, deputy  secretary-general of the Association for Relations Across the  Taiwan Strait (ARATS), saying Beijing has approved the entry of  40 Taiwan reporters, up from the previous quota of 30.    SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations authorized by  the two sides to handle private exchanges in the absence of  official contacts.    Liu was quoted as saying that the mainland authorities are  limiting the number of reporters because of transportation  difficulties.    The increase in the number of reporters has been perceived  as  a concession by Beijing to improve its image following a protest  by Taipei on Friday.    Mainland security authorities have accused three suspects of  arson, robbery and murder in the March 31 crime and arrested a  fourth suspect.    Meanwhile, H.Y. Hsu, SEF deputy secretary-general, is  scheduled to lead a 22-member delegation to Hangzhou on Sunday.  The group will comprise the victims' relatives, forensic  experts, and SEF staffers.</p>

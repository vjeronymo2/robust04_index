			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (16): Slide becomes more pronounced - Nissan and tiny Isuzu manage to steer clear of the downward trend - and gain market share / The Japanese in the US EVENTS of the past year demonstrate that Japan's carmakers are not invincible in the US. Many observers, following their performance in America during the previous two decades, were beginning to think they were. Japanese car brands - imports as well as those made locally - finished last year with an American market share of 30.1 per cent. Their slice of the total vehicle market, which includes pick-up trucks, off-roaders and people-carriers, was 24.3 per cent. Both kinds of market share were down, marginally, from the previous year's, but the slide became more pronounced during the first half of this year, when Japanese nameplates accounted for 27.6 per cent of the car market - 21.9 per cent overall. It was their worst performance in five years. Japan's only good news came from Nissan and tiny Isuzu: both gained market share against the trend. Even Honda, America's darling during much of the 1980s, faltered, as the Accord slipped from number one to fourth in the car popularity stakes. Not that European brands fared any better. Combined sales dropped more than 15 per cent in the first half of the year, and now account for little more than 2 per cent of the total US vehicle market. In other words, Japan outsells Europe in the US in a ratio of almost 10:1. Overall, the drop in Japanese car sales was much too large to be a statistical quirk. While Detroit's Big Three, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, between them found more than half a million more new customers in the first half-year compared with one year earlier, Japanese companies lost almost 15,000 sales. This is a particularly challenging period for Japanese car makers. The poor returns in the US come against a background of sluggish sales in Japan itself and a dramatic fall in demand in Europe. With the exception of sales to Latin America and south-east Asia, Japanese vehicle exports everywhere are stalled. At the same time, Japanese companies are committed to a costly build-up of transplant factories in North America and Europe. In the wake of the yen's apparently ceaseless appreciation, they may prove a long term salvation to some of the US's problems, by reducing its dependence on exports. The yen is hovering at about 100 to the dollar, compared with about 125 one year ago. While exporters managed to cope with adjusting from 250 yen to the dollar of the mid-1980s, the latest exchange rates are proving too much, even for a successful and wealthy company such as Toyota. It is easy to see what that degree of swing will do to prices of direct imports from Japan. But it also affects vehicles made by Japanese companies in the US. Many of their components are still imported. The rising yen will be a further incentive for Japanese companies to honour a commitment to raise the local component content of their American-made vehicles from about 55 per cent to 70 per cent. Japanese vehicle prices in the US are beginning to reflect the yen's strength, although the fight for customers in the market place means that actual purchase prices are a good deal closer to those of American products than the list prices suggest. Consumer belief that Japanese models are much more expensive than those of GM, Ford and Chrysler, contributed to the resurgence in Big Three sales. So did the distinct shift in public attitude about buying US products. Now that many Americans are hostile towards Japanese trade policies, it is almost chic to buy US cars these days. On the other hand, the US come-back is masked by the large proportion of fleet sales, perhaps more than a quarter of the total. This traditionally low - or zero - profit business is almost the Big Three's exclusive preserve. Japanese companies say their largely retail business has held up well. They also point to the slower economies along the west coast, where the Japanese have historically been strongest. Those regions are suffering in the wake of recent defence cuts. Nevertheless, the shift to US brands is understandable because the country's car companies responded positively to Japanese competitive pressure in the 1980s. Detroit made quantifiable improvements in vehicle quality in recent years, described in surveys by the independent JD Power market research group. While Japanese brands still come top of Power's annual initial quality and customer satisfaction surveys, US models are coming much closer. 'Quality is not an issue any more,' says a Power spokesman. Nissan's counter-trend improvement in sales stemmed largely from the addition of two new models, both of which are made in the us. Sales of other Nissans reflected the more general Japanese trend. The new Nissans are the Altima, a saloon manufactured at Smyrna, in Tennessee, and the Quest minivan, or people-carrier. Made by Ford for Nissan, Quest was designed in Nissan's California studios. Between them, Altima and Quest helped Nissan to a half-year sales increase of nearly one fifth, to just over 330,000. Given the general malaise among Japanese producers, that is impressive, but it only moves Nissan back towards the position it enjoyed during the mid-1980s. Nissan, together with its upmarket Infiniti marque, remains well behind Toyota and Lexus, which ended the first six months on 509,000 sales and a slightly reduced market share. Nissan was on fairly level pegging with Honda and Acura, whose 328,000 sales were achieved in the absence of any offerings in the increasingly important market segments for minivans, pick-ups and off-roaders. Technically, such vehicles are trucks, although they are usually used like passenger cars. They now account for three out of every five vehicle sales in the US. The trend continued this year. While traditional passenger car sales eased up 2.4 per cent, truck demand soared up 17.4 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Standpoint" column by Sabri Hammadi: "The Bankrupt Regime </F> and the Continuous Milking"]    [Text] Despite the continuous evidence about the bankruptcy  of the Saudi regime and the fact that it is going through a very  difficult economic situation this year, milking of that regime  has not stopped. U.S. President Clinton continues to order  Fahd's regime to conclude deals with U.S. firms involving  billions of dollars!    Following the conclusion of the $6 billion airliner deal  with  U.S. companies, which the Saudi regime had to pay through loans  from a consortium of local and U.S. banks, there are now reports  that Clinton has ordered the Saudi regime to grant a $4 billion  deal to the American Telecommunications Company despite the fact  that other international non-American companies have made  attractive bids which are far below the bid of the American  company!    Although the Saudi regime is going through the worst deficit  in its history and has been forced to cut its expenditures in  the 1994 budget by 20 percent after spending all the surpluses  it made in the eighties during the past four years, the U.S.  administration is still pressuring that regime in order to  extract its last penny. Otherwise, what is the meaning of  Clinton's personal intervention in favor of American firms as in  the airliner deal and now the deal to set up 500,000 telephone  lines.    At any rate, this is not all the Saudi rulers are disposing  of from the oil revenues with such utter insolence and  recklessness. There are also the bribes given by the agent  regime in order to prolong the blockade on Iraq, and the vast  sums which are spent on corrupting news media and those working  in them. More than that, there are the sums which are assigned  for plots and aggressions against everything nationalist,  progressive, and honest in the Arab homeland.    No doubt, U.S. milking of Fahd's regime will not stop at the  telephone deal. From time to time the Saudi regime, or the  Americans themselves, will invent new deals and projects in  billions of dollars. Yesterday it was the airliner deal, today  the telephone deal, and tomorrow it could be a submarine deal!  Yes, a Saudi official has announced that "Saudi Arabia" is  considering the purchase of submarines to guarantee its security  in the Gulf and the Red Sea. Naturally, the Saudi regime will  need U.S. submarines for that!    The main thing is to boost the depressed U.S. economy and  create job opportunities for unemployed Americans. Above all,  what is important is to please the American master even if the  Saudi regime has to spend its last penny.</p>

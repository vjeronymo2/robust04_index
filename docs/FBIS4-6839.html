			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 23 (YONHAP) -- The main opposition  Democratic Party (DP) decided Saturday to resist Unification  Minister Yi Yong-tok's appointment as prime minister at a  National Assembly session to approve the premier-designate, a DP  leader said.    Emerging from a meeting of senior party lawmakers, Acting  Chairman Kim Won-ki also told reporters that the DP would call  for the entire cabinet's resignation.    "The Constitution requires that the cabinet be appointed  through the recommendation of the prime minister. Moreover, the  resignation of Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, according to the  announcement of Chongwadae [presidential office], is something  like reprehension. So the cabinet must resign en masse in  consideration of the spirit of the Constitution and the mistakes  made by the incumbent cabinet," said Kim.    The major opposition party also decided to take issue with  the constitutional, political and even moral procedures of Yi's  resignation before dealing with the approval of the new prime  minister at the National Assembly.    According to Kim, the DP will demand that the National  Assembly convene a separate, full assembly session to discuss  Lee's resignation. The demand will be made during Monday's  National Assembly meeting, called to handle the Sangmudae  scandal involving suspected bribery in the relocation of  military facilities in Kwangju, the southwestern provincial  capital.    Kim also cited the poor performance of Prime  Minister-Designate Yi while serving as unification minister as  the party's reason for opposing his appointment.    DP Chairman Yi Ki-taek, now on a U.S. tour, will return to  Seoul Monday to tackle the volatile domestic political  situation, Kim said.</p>

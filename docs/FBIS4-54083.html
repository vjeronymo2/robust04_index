			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["`Let Us Defend Socialism of Korea'" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 24 (KCNA) -- Foreign political  parties and organisations expressed support to the just cause of  the Korean people to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula and achieve the reunification of the country.    Chairman of the for peace and socialism-the communist  Workers' Party of Finland Timo Lahdenmaki in his speech at a  rally celebrating May Day said the United States is the very one  which has divided Korea.    The United States has been opposed to all the proposals of  North Korea to settle the Korean question, seeking to perpetuate  the division of Korea, he noted, adding:    "The United States expects the socialism of North Korea to  collapse but the future of mankind lies in socialism.    "We should actively support the socialism of Korea with  might  and main. This is the only way of guaranteeing the victory of  the international working class movement and a brighter future."    Addressing a mass rally celebrating May Day, Preben Moller  Hansen, chairman of the Danish Workers' Party, Common Cause,  said the United States is scheming to isolate and stifle  socialist Korea under the pretext of the "nuclear issue". "We  express full support to and solidarity with the Korean people in  their struggle for just cause under the banner of socialism," he  stressed.    He supported the proposal of the DPRK for negotiations with  the United States to replace the armistice agreement with a  peace agreement and establish a new peace arrangement on the  Korean peninsula and demanded that the United States  affirmatively accede to this proposal.    Delegates of the Communist Party of Denmark  (Marxist-Leninist), the Danish Workers' Party, Common Cause, the  Communist Party of Denmark, the Metal Workers Trade Union of  Denmark, the Red Youth League of Denmark, the Denmark-the DPRK  Friendship Association and other political parties and  organisations expressed support to and solidarity with the  Korean people in their struggle for the reunification of the  country.    James Stewart, general secretary of the National Executive  Committee of the Communist Party of Ireland, said that to defend  the socialism of Korea and actively support and encourage the  just struggle of the Korean people today is the internationalist  duty of the communist and workers' parties of all countries.</p>

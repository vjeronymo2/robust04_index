			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 43 CFR 3833.1&hyph;2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the proposed rule published on May 11, 1994, a paragraph (c) was added to &sect;3833.1&hyph;2 to establish a basic process for compliance with Public Law 103&hyph;23 of April 16, 1993. This Act (107 Stat. 60) amended the Stockraising Homestead Act of 1916 (43 U.S.C. 299) by establishing new mining claim location and surface operations requirements for lands patented under the Stockraising Homestead with a reservation of the mineral estate to the United States. The Act became effective on October 13, 1993. To implement the Act of April 16, 1993, the Department has begun formulating regulations on locating claims and obtaining permission for exploration and mining on lands patented under the Stockraising Homestead Act. These regulations will be proposed as additions to 43 CFR subpart 3814.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A Departmental review demonstrates a need to have a basic location, recording, and notification procedure put into place as soon as possible in order to avoid legal problems between surface owners, mining claimants, and the Department over rights of location and entry on Stockraising Homestead lands under the Act of April 16, 1993. Therefore, as a logical outgrowth of the language included in the proposed rule, a new paragraph (d) is added to section 3833.1&hyph;2 to explain more fully the basic procedural requirements for locating and entering mining claims on Stockraising Homestead Act lands. This language reiterates, to a large degree, the language of the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment requested that paragraph (c)(3) of the proposed rule be reworded for clarity. The final rule has been amended to make it clear that mining claims located on lands patented under the Stockraising Homestead Act, as amended, will not be recorded unless the claimant complies with the requirements in &sect;3833.1&hyph;2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 43 CFR 3833.1&hyph;3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (c)(3) has been removed because the information appears elsewhere in the section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two comments said that &sect;3833.1&hyph;3 was confusing. The statute establishes payment deadlines for some types of fees, but allows payment deficiencies in other types of fee situations to be curable. The comments suggested that this section be made uniformly curable or non-curable to promote ease of administration. This section was developed in an effort to strike a balance among ease of administration, public service, and consistency with the law. Because of the statutory nature of the maintenance fee, it is not possible to make nonpayment of that fee curable. The fact that this deadline is firm is not an adequate basis for making other fee payment deficiencies non-curable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

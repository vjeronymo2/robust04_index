			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: FONDA CZECHS OUT DRAMA IN FALLEN IRON CURTAIN  </P> <P> PEOPLE ARE talking about Jane Fonda's recent trip to Europe. She's been moving  fast since the tumultuous events over there and plans a big movie which would  co-star -- the fall of the Iron Curtain!  </P> <P> Fonda recently spent time with Czechoslovakia's new president, playwright  Vaclav Havel, and sees his life story -- especially the five years he spent in  jail for dissident activities against communism -- as a heady brew for film.  Fonda herself would portray Havel's wife, Olga.  </P> <P> PEOPLE ARE gabbing over what got left on the cutting room floor in the Barbara  Walters "20/20" interview with NBC's Bryant Gumbel.  </P> <P> The "Today" show host made it perfectly clear where he stands on rumors about  taking a news anchor job, saying: "Tom Brokaw's doing a great job, so the job's  not available . . . if it was available, there's no guarantee they'd come and  ask me . . . nobody has asked me about it . . . I don't aspire to it . . .  absolutely not. No, it's not me, Barbara, it's not me. I'm not necessarily sure  I'd be good at it, because I think it's a different kind of talent than doing  the 'Today' program. And . . . it just doesn't interest me."  </P> <P> Is this definite enough for all you, we, us rumormongers?  </P> <P> PEOPLE ARE flipping over this week's "If It Ain't Broke, Break It" story in  Newsweek on the aftermath of the Jane Pauley-"Today" mess. They seem to be  asking -- is Jane the Ivana Trump of the airwaves? Notable question: "The  media's casting of Pauley as a kind of spurned wife has sent her popularity  soaring."  </P> <P> And here's another: "At least one NBC insider believes that Gumbel is trying to  distance himself from the wreckage. . . . The same source also claims that  Gumbel and Dick Ebersol have begun blaming Pauley for getting them into this  mess. They're telling people, 'If Jane had just accepted things like a good  soldier, none of this would have happened.' "  </P> <P> Ebersol is the producer who masterminded the importation of Deborah Norville --  he now claims he did it with Jane's acquiescence. And the "this" that happened,  of course, was falling ratings, media hoopla and unhappy fallout.  </P> <P> PEOPLE ARE gabbing over On the Avenue's article about "The Two Mrs. Trumps,"  meaning Blaine and Ivana. The magazine asks, "Is blood thicker than Poland  Spring?"  </P> <P> Society has always gossiped about the wife of Robert and the wife of Donald and  whether or not they are friends or rivals or what? Now I say -- give 'em a  break. Both women are victims in this turn of events. I'm sure both Blaine and  Ivana will "do the right thing" once and if ever they figure out what that is  supposed to be.  </P> <P> I haven't spoken to Ivana in several weeks. But I am told that she now has a  new, tougher attitude, has girded her loins for a real fight to protect herself  and her children, and is beginning to see the light -- that there could  possibly be life without Donald.  </P> <P> PEOPLE ARE flabbergasted by the New York Intelligencer's report on how Doris  Day wants murderers -- rather than small animals -- used to test new AIDS  drugs. "I can't bear anything innocent being used. I think they should  experiment on murderers. . . . Why not? They owe society something. Don't stand  aghast at that. They're sitting there having three meals a day, and we're  paying for it. What the hell are they going to do for society to pay us back?  They should do this for us."

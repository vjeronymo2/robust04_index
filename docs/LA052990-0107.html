			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RAIN CANCELS HOLIDAY EVENTS, CAUSES SLIDES;  </P> <P> WEATHER: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, WITH 1.5 INCHES, RECEIVED THE MOST RAINFALL IN  ORANGE COUNTY. THE RECORD MEMORIAL DAY DOWNPOUR THWARTED THE PLANS OF MANY.  </P> <P> An unexpected, wintry rainstorm swept through Southern California on Monday,  dumping record rainfall that unleashed mudslides and caught Memorial Day  celebrants unprepared and underdressed.  </P> <P> The morning storm dropped more than an inch of rain in some places, washing out  camping, picnicking and sun bathing and forcing organizers of a variety of  Memorial Day observances to alter their programs or cancel them altogether.  </P> <P> "We didn't see it coming down so far with such intensity," said Steve Burback,  a spokesman for WeatherData Inc., which provides weather information for The  Times.  </P> <P> Burback said the storm originated in the Gulf of Alaska and moved into Southern  California at about 3:30 a.m., bringing with it below-normal temperatures and  record amounts of rainfall.  </P> <P> In Orange County, San Juan Capistrano received the most rainfall, collecting  more than 1.5 inches, while Santiago and Modjeska peaks received 1.4 inches,  Burback said.  </P> <P> The high temperature in Santa Ana was 67 -- about 10 degrees cooler than normal  for this time of year, Burback said.  </P> <P> National Weather Service spokesman Jerry Steiger said that total rainfall in  Santa Ana measured 0.52 inches and Anaheim experienced a third of an inch of  rainfall.  </P> <P> Burback said a general clearing with scattered high clouds began Monday  afternoon and was expected to continue through today.  </P> <P> In downtown Los Angeles, 1.17 inches of rain fell -- a breakaway record, since  the best any previous Memorial Day could muster was 0.12 of an inch. "It's  acting more like wintertime," Burback said. Snow that measured as much as four  inches at Big Bear melted when it hit the ground elsewhere in the mountains, he  added.  </P> <P> None of this put much of a dent in the drought: For example, while the 1.17  inches brought Los Angeles' monthly total to 1.20 inches, this year's rainfall  so far amounts to 7.38 inches, not quite half of the normal 14.82 inches.  </P> <P> But the quenching rain at the same time dampened Memorial observances.  </P> <P> For 25 consecutive years, Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Cypress has remembered  the thousands of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who died in war. But  persistent rainfall Monday morning caused mortuary officials to cancel the 11  a.m. service, manager Darren Drabing said.  </P> <P> "We were all very disappointed that we had to break it off," Drabing said.  </P> <P> In Fullerton, however, the Loma Vista Memorial Park observance was held in  spite of a steady drizzle. Cemetery spokeswoman Sharon Adams said the ceremony  lacked only the 500 large American flags that were to line the main entrance to  the memorial park.  </P> <P> More than 500 people huddled under umbrellas and white canopies to listen to  Maj. Gen. Norris Einerston, chief chaplain of the Army, deliver a somber  address, Adams said. Small flags and crosses were then placed on the graves of  about 3,000 veterans buried in Loma Vista.  </P> <P> Throughout the county, beaches, campgrounds and parks were mostly empty as the  thick cloud cover and occasional downpour forced a mass exodus to warmer and  drier activities.  </P> <P> The pre-summer holiday, normally marked by sun worshiping and other outdoor  activities, was the bleakest in memory.  </P> <P> "I got only one color for you out here. That's gray," Newport Beach lifeguard  Jim Turner said of the dismal day that looked more like mid-January than the  start of beach season.  </P> <P> By mid-morning, the only sign of life in the normally crowded beach resort was  on the Newport Pier, where disappointed beach-goers wrapped in sweat shirts,  jackets and blankets forlornly watched the surf.  </P> <P> By contrast, Turner said, more than 90,000 people flocked to Newport Beach on  Sunday. But with winds reaching 25 m.p.h. on Monday, Turner said, air  temperatures dipped to about 48 degrees, and not a soul could be spotted on the  stretches of sand.  </P> <P> "Even the die-hards are gone," Turner said.  </P> <P> Camper Dick Cliver, however, counted himself as a die-hard, deciding to stick  out his San Clemente beach vacation despite chilling temperatures, soggy  clothes and a damp tent.  </P> <P> "We found out that the tent leaked and so does the camper," said Cliver,  sitting in an eight-foot camper atop a pickup truck at San Clemente State  Beach. Nearby, dozens of footprints in the soft mud led to a huge nylon tent  filled with the soaked belongings of family and friends.  </P> <P> "But it's not driving us out," said Cliver, a Buena Park resident. "We'll just  sit in here and watch it rain if we have to."  </P> <P> Carl and Lindy Spencer and their two children, who drove all night in the rain  from Las Vegas, spent the first part of a week's vacation at Doheny coping with  flooded campgrounds and the downpour.  </P> <P> They managed to erect two nylon tents and tied a clothesline from their car to  a nearby tree to dry out drenched clothes and towels.  </P> <P> Interstate 5 was hit hard early in the morning, with flooding causing closures  along the freeway at Junipero Serra Road in San Juan Capistrano and Red Hill  Avenue in Tustin, the California Highway Patrol said.  </P> <P> The CHP was also kept busy rushing to the scenes of more than a dozen traffic  accidents that slowed highways to a crawl in many areas. They attributed the  majority of accidents to slick roads.  </P> <P> "Generally on the first day (of rain), it's the craziest," said CHP Officer  Bryan Duquesnel. "They are just cranking on down the road and don't pay  attention (to water hazards)."  </P> <P> A stretch of Dana Point Harbor Road leading to the Dana Point Marine Institute  and a residential road near the intersection of Street of the Golden Lantern  and Camino del Avion in Laguna Niguel were closed temporarily due to mudslides.  </P> <P> "The water and the mud were up to my knees," said County Harbors Beaches and  Parks worker Brian Young as he worked to clear Dana Point Harbor Road, which  leads to the Dana Point Marine Institute. "It was a pretty big slide.  </P> <P> As the rain subsided later in the afternoon, thousands of Orange County  residents had changed their outdoor plans and opted to flock to area malls  instead.  </P> <P> "It's been busy like mad," said Mona Salameh, an employee at the May Co.  department store in South Coast Plaza. "I went out into the mall and it's the  busiest I've seen it since Christmas."  </P> <P> Typically, Memorial Day draws a fair amount of shoppers because many stores  advertise sale prices and stay open longer hours, but today was exceptionally  busy because of inclement weather, Salameh said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Patt Morrison contributed to this report from Los Angeles.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'THEY LIKE US, THEY REALLY LIKE US';  </P> <P> NOW NEW YORK ALSO LOOKS WEST FOR INSPIRATION IN FOOD AND FASHION  </P> <P> ANNIE Flanders is breathless, positively breathless, over L.A. "It's the most  exciting city," she gushes. "I look forward to eating there. The clubs are  great. The shopping is great. There's an energy we don't have.  </P> <P> "I love the hotels. We went out there with Cyndi Lauper, and we stayed at the  Sunset Marquis. It was wonderful. We shopped until we dropped. We went to  Melrose, we bought out half the store at Repeat Performance. It's great, the  shopping, the weather. Everyone I talk to now, even people determined to  despise it, can't anymore. The energetic, creative people -- they're there,  doing wonderful things. There's so much happening. And it's so easy to live  there."  </P> <P> You won't hear many New Yorkers going gaga over La-La like that. But the very  fact that this kind of talk is coming from one of Manhattan's leading arbiters  of hip -- Flanders edits "Details," a magazine for the nightclub set -- is a  sign that New Yorkers are taking new stock of the city they once wrote off as  Disneyland for adults. "People here are very attuned to what L.A. can offer  them," says Tom Julian, associate fashion director of the Men's Fashion Assn.  in New York.  </P> <P> This new respect -- and fascination with -- Los Angeles is reflected in the  pages of New York-based publications such as GQ and New York Woman, which have  started offering regular L.A.-watch columns. Flanders' Details is readying its  second full issue about the city (the first one included an extensive guide to  Melrose Avenue), as is Avenue, a New York magazine for the staid upscale set.  The October issue of HG devoted a 33-page section to "Living in L.A.," and  Metropolitan Home plans to publish its first special L.A. issue in August. Spy  magazine, the nemesis of Manhattan institutions, has decided that L.A.'s sacred  cows are nearly as entertaining to milk -- it has published a special issue and  runs a regular column.  </P> <P> While it is true that New Yorkers have taken notice of L.A.'s new museums and  burgeoning theater movement, overall, Manhattan appears to be quite content  with its own arts culture. What seems to interest New Yorkers most about L.A.  is the city's ambiance: Its food and fashion and life style.  </P> <P> "I find it visually invigorating to drive around L.A.," says Joan Kron, editor  of Avenue magazine. Adds Dorothy Kalins, editor of Metropolitan Home magazine:  "There are so many cultural signals coming from L.A. that are changing ways of  socializing, of living at home."  </P> <P> Architecture is a case in point. Increasingly, L.A. architects -- such as Frank  Gehry and his disciples -- are building national reputations, not in  skyscrapers but in homes and restaurants. "I would say that of the top 10 young  architects, a disproportionate number are in Los Angeles," Kalins says. She  adds that these architects are characterized by their "individual  conceptualization of every project. They have no rigid framework or formula. .  . . They are terribly inventive."  </P> <P> California cuisine, which also threw out the traditional rule book, has an even  stronger influence in New York. "Ten years ago, New Yorkers, tired of heavy  French food, were being told they should eat more healthfully," says restaurant  consultant Clark Wolf. "Suddenly here were these people from L.A. with baskets  of fresh vegetables and boxes of mesquite."  </P> <P> And strange concoctions like lobster and potato chip salad and roasted red  pepper pancakes with sweet corn sauce and caviar. "It was pretty  controversial," recalls chef Jonathan Waxman, who moved his California cuisine  to New York five years ago. But it was also popular: In short order, Waxman's  restaurant, Jam's, became the place to go, and Waxman himself became the city's  newest superchef. Waxman closed the restaurant after a partnership split and  opened up his own, less pricey, restaurant -- called simply Jonathan Waxman's  -- last spring.  </P> <P> L.A.'s Wolfgang Puck gained such prominence with New Yorkers that when  Manhattan restaurants couldn't lure him East, they started hiring away his  chefs and opening Spago clones.  </P> <P> It may be old hat by now to visit California-style restaurants such as Waxman's  or Melrose, the West Hollywood-style cafe run by former Spago chef Richard  Krause, or Big Kahuna, with its surfer decor. But the influence of California  cuisine goes beyond these specialty restaurants.  </P> <P> Mesquite grills, fresh herbs and vegetables and ingredients such as cilantro  are now common fare at New York restaurants. "California cuisine is now part of  the fabric of New York eating," says Wolf.  </P> <P> Increasingly, L.A.'s fashion world is gaining respect, and influence, on the  East Coast. Department stores are carrying more and more clothing lines by  California designers. In April, Bloomingdale's will launch a two-month-long  celebration of California, complete with a kickoff dinner created by Puck. The  Men's Fashion Assn. held one of its national press shows here for the first  time last year and plans a second one this month. "It has changed so  dramatically over the past two years," the association's Julian says of the  city's fashion business.  </P> <P> Young women showed up on Melrose Avenue wearing black stretch biking shorts,  black blazers and pumps; it didn't take long, Julian says, for that style to  become the rage in New York. More lasting influences can also be found: Dressy  sportswear with a soft construction and fabrics such as washed silk can be  traced to L.A., Julian says.  </P> <P> L.A.'s influence over East Coast fashion is centralized at the lower end of the  price spectrum: racks of colorful jams, fluorescent and black neoprene surfwear  by Body Glove and pastel T-shirts that are popular in stores throughout New  York.  </P> <P> "Body Glove is getting more and more popular," says Kalman Ruttenstein, senior  vice president/fashion direction at Bloomingdale's. "I saw a lot of it last  summer in the shops on Martha's Vineyard." But you don't need to go to the  ruling class's favorite vacation spot to see the influence of L.A. style: A  group of inner-city Brooklyn high school basketball players, featured recently  on "60 Minutes," was wearing -- guess what? Not gym shorts, but jams.  </P></p>

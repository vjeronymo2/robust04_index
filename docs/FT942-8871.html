			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Rochester Tel wins agreement on plan to split Rochester Tel, the New York state telecommunications group, said yesterday it had cleared an important hurdle in its unique and closely watched plan to split itself in two and voluntarily abandon its local monopoly around the city of Rochester. The scheme, unveiled in February last year, has been hailed as a possible model for other local phone companies wanting to make themselves more flexible and entrepreneurial in the face of growing competition from new rivals offering multimedia communications services. Rochester Tel said yesterday it had reached agreement on the package with staff of the New York State Public Service Commission, which oversees the utility, and with other interested parties. The deal still has to be approved by the full Commission, which is expected to consider it in the third quarter of this year. If it gets the green light, Rochester will open up its local market to far greater competition than that faced by other US telecommunications companies. Entertainment group Time Warner, which operates a cable television system in Rochester, plans to offer a rival switched business and telephone service in the area. It said yesterday that it had signed an agreement with Rochester Tel establishing the right to interconnect customers of the two systems. The agreement is the first of its kind between a cable operator and a leading telephone company. Rochester Tel's plan centres on the division into two separate businesses of its Rochester area telephone operations. One new company, R-Net, would take over the basic telecommunications transmission and switching network. It would become a wholesale seller of these services to other retail companies, although it would itself continue to offer some retail services. The other, R-Com, would operate as a retailer, buying network access from R-Net, and packaging those services with its own and others' product lines, such as voice-mail, data services, long distance and wireless. Initially, the only services assigned to R-Com would be those considered to be highly competitive, such as high-capacity private lines. Any other company would be able to compete for these services, or for customers of other services offered by R-Net. A holding company, set up above these two subsidiaries, would have far greater freedom from local regulatory oversight. It could issue securities, make any acquisition or enter any line of business. To win regulatory support for the scheme, the company has agreed to a seven-year plan of price stabilisation, which includes Dollars 21m of rate reductions. The commission has in turn agreed that while R-Net would remain subject to regulatory oversight, the price cap regime allowed it to be freed from the rate-of-return financial targets which are common in the telecommunications industry. This would allow the group to retain all the cost efficiencies it achieves, making its stock potentially more attractive to investors.</p>

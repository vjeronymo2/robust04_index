			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Blue Circle's advance fails to please investors Blue Circle, Britain's biggest cement group, yesterday announced a 46 per cent rise in underlying profits, but this was not enough to prevent its share price falling by 14p to 300p. Profit taking and concern that the recovery in UK cement demand will slow next year took the gloss off the half-year figures. Profits from continuing businesses rose from Pounds 60.5m to Pounds 88.4m. This represented a further substantial improvement on profit increases of 77 per cent and 31 per cent in the two preceding six-month periods, said Mr Keith Orrell-Jones, group managing director. However, a Pounds 40.3m provision - of which Pounds 35.1m was due to a goodwill write-off on the sale of the New World cookers business - depressed pre-tax profits which fell from Pounds 60.5m to Pounds 48.1m. Earnings per share, before exceptionals, rose from 5p to 7.5p. The interim dividend is being maintained at 3.75p. The UK cement division led the first-half improvement with operating profits more than doubled to Pounds 28.2m (Pounds 12.1m) on the back of an 11 per cent volume increase and a 1 per cent rise in prices compared with the first six months of 1993. Operating margins of 18 per cent on expected UK sales of 6.5m tonnes this year are now not far short of the peak of 22 per cent on 9m tonnes in 1989. Mr Orrell-Jones said the biggest reason for the improvement was cost-savings worth Pounds 2m a month, introduced in the previous two years. US cement, concrete and aggregates profits also rose sharply from Pounds 6.6m to Pounds 11m, helped by improved efficiencies and higher prices. Profits would have increased further but for bad winter weather. Cement and concrete profits in Chile had risen slightly to Pounds 17.6m (Pounds 16.5m) but reduced demand for high-rise buildings in Santiago meant that sales were likely to come under pressure. Elsewhere, African profits rose from Pounds 5.5m to Pounds 8.9m, while Malaysian profits slipped from Pounds 9.9m to Pounds 8.9m. Home products profits rose only slightly to Pounds 24.5m (Pounds 24.2m) but this masked improved profits from Italy, Sweden and France, as well as from UK bathrooms. Profits from Germany fell, as did those from UK heating. COMMENT Blue Circle has done a tremendous job in cutting costs. The pace of improvement, however, is likely to diminish with UK cement volumes expected to increase by about 2 per cent next year compared with 8 per cent in 1994. Construction recovery in the US is also likely to slow, while there is a limit on how much more margin Blue Circle's good housekeeping can generate in building materials. This may not be a problem if the home products business finally delivers, but this market remains tough in the UK. Pre-tax profits this year of Pounds 200m (after New World provisions) and Pounds 270m next places the shares on prospective multiples of 19 and 13, which looks dear enough.</p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Bonn and Paris 'now considering fast track to Emu' FRANCE and Germany are ready to step up monetary co-operation, including possible fixing of the franc-D-Mark rate, if the European exchange rate mechanism is threatened with collapse, according to a growing consensus in Brussels. Senior diplomats from France, Germany, Britain and other EC member states have come round to the view that a Franco-German initiative is inevitable if instability in the foreign exchange markets leaves the survival of the ERM in doubt. The Bundesbank's decision to shave half a percentage point off the Lombard rate and a quarter point off the discount rate helped to relieve tensions in the ERM on Thursday. But EC officials are looking for at least one full point off the discount rate within three months to revive the European economy and bolster confidence in the ERM as the vehicle to European monetary union. Reports that France and Germany have drawn up plans for a 'fast-track' move to monetary union have been circulating in Europe for several months, only to be denied vigorously in Paris and Bonn. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, dismissed the idea last week as incompatible with the Maastricht treaty. But instability inside the ERM - and fears about a devaluation of the franc against the D-Mark - have persuaded a growing number of diplomats and officials in Brussels that a 'fast track' to Emu is now a serious political option which would be justified as saving the ERM and Emu. A senior French official in Brussels yesterday raised the prospect of an inner group of 'hard-core' currency countries moving to 'something resembling monetary union' outside the Maastricht treaty. The official said the emergence of a 'fast-track' grouping would most likely take the form of a fixing of exchange rates, not a single European currency. Even such a move would pose political difficulties, notably how to keep the door open for EC countries with weaker currencies such as Spain with the peseta. The most serious obstacle lies in the Bundesbank's long-standing scepticism about Emu and a single currency. But the French official pointed out that, while Germany's central bank was in charge of day-to-day economic decisions, 'the politi-cians have the last word'. This week, Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, said if the ERM collapsed, 'something would emerge from the wreckage'. Observers believe his comments contain a warning to UK Euro-sceptics that they must not assume foreign exchange instability spells Emu's end. The increasingly public debate about a 'fast track' to Emu may also be driven by tactical considerations in Paris and Bonn to bolster the franc in the run-up to the French parliamentary elections. As one senior EC official pointed out, the more the currency markets believe there will be a Franco-German initiative to create fixed exchange rates, the less likely they are to attack the franc-D-Mark parity and the less likely the need therefore for a politically controversial move to a 'fast-track' Emu.

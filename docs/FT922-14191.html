			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Arts: Today's Television For most people the first question seems to be 'Where can I get away from these wretched politicians?' and the second 'What will make me laugh?' Tonight there are three comedy repeats: Only Fools And Horses (8.00 BBC1), in which Del is invited to a school reunion at Dockside Secondary Modern; a 60-minute edition of one of the best American comedies for 20 years, The Golden Girls (10.00 C4), featuring clips from earlier episodes; and the TV newsroom satire, Drop The Dead Donkey (11.00 C4), with Dave seeking psychiatric advice. The only new comedy is a special Spitting Image, which is devoted to the election (10.40 TV). This might well be the best night for such a programme, but alas the series is well beyond its peak. Other non-election possibles include the second of the Timewatch programmes about the weird Elizabeth Nietzsche, who returned from her Aryan ghetto in Paraguay in 1889 to become one of the most influential women in Hitler's Germany (8.10 BBC2). The documentary series Letters From St Petersburg returns to C4 (9.45) and QED considers the plight of the leaning tower of Pisa (9.50 BBC1).</p>

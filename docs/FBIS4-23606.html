			<p>BFN     [Text] In Burundi, now led by its second interim president  since Melchior Ndadaye was assassinated, the National Assembly  deputies are expected to elect the next president by 1 July.  This was announced by Foreign Minister Jean-Marie Ngendahayo.  Speaking to Christophe Boisbouvier he explained the objectives  of the government to end the institutional vacuum created after  President Ntaryamira died together with the Rwandan president.    [Begin recording] [Ngendahayo] The government decided to  make  1 July--Independence Day--as the deadline. It decided that by  that date we should have a president duly elected and sworn-in.    [Boisbouvier] Who will elect him?    [Ngendahayo] Deputies, the National Assembly, obviously.    [Boisbouvier] Which party will the candidate who will be  elected come from?    [Ngendahayo] According to the agreements signed in Kigobe  and  (?Kazagar) the candidate should come from within the ranks of  the Frodebu [Front for Democracy in Burundi].    [Boisbouvier] What if the Uprona [Party of National Unity  and  Progress] were to oppose this process? Do you have a sufficient  majority in the Assembly to force the issue through?    [Ngendahayo] In any case the Frodebu has a very large  majority in the National Assembly, enabling it to get a  constitutional bill through without too many risks. This is the  first point. The second is, the attitude adopted by the  national army in days to come: either it follows legality, in  which case the process is well under way, or it chooses the path  of adventure and we then experience problems of a putsch as we  did last October.

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Metra down heavily to FM65m Metra, the Finnish industrial group, yesterday reported profits after financial items of FM65m (Dollars 11.8m) in the four months to the end of April, down heavily from FM145m for the same period last year. However, Metra, whose main operations cover diesel engines, sanitaryware and security systems, said the figure was distorted by unusually large deliveries by the Wartsila Diesel unit, its biggest division, in the first four months of last year. It predicted profits for the whole year would be ahead of 1993's FM472m, in spite of the effects of the merger announced last week between its Abloy Security division and the locks division of Sweden's Securitas. The merger, the latest in a series of moves to narrow Metra's focus, will create Europe's biggest maker of cylinder locks. The surge in Wartsila deliveries early last year, combined with divestments, also led to a decline in Metra's group sales in the first four months, to FM3.4bn from FM4.2bn.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BOYARSKY'S MAGNOLIA COLUMN CRITICIZED  </P> <P> Bill Boyarsky's recent column presents a very one-sided view of a city effort  that is just now reaching a point where big things could happen.  </P> <P> I am the business person who paid for the bus bench slogan, "Look Out Melrose!  Magnolia Boulevard Is Soon to Arrive."  </P> <P> As a 20-year resident of North Hollywood, I put the slogan on the bench to  inspire others to see beyond yesterday. I am converting a rundown coffeehouse  on Magnolia into an upscale eatery precisely because the city, with CRA as the  operating arm, is bringing lasting improvements to the area.  </P> <P> I am hopeful that other business people have the vision to join with the CRA in  the improvement effort by digging deeply into their own pockets. One does not  expect this of the purveyor of $1.85 tires or the operator of the three  second-hand clothing stores Boyarsky mentions.  </P> <P> I am a member of the Universal City-North Hollywood Chamber of Commerce plus a  member of the Boyarsky-maligned Project Area Committee.  </P> <P> Leaving Magnolia alone, Boyarsky's prescription, would discourage me and the  efforts of others.  </P> <P> KEVIN McCARNEY  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

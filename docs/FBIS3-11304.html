Daily political violence in Port-au-Prince reportedly  has its epicentre in the slum neighborhoods, particularly Cite  Soleil where the residents wake up almost every day and discover  dead bodies of people shot or stabbed. The murders are  perpetrated at night by unidentified armed men, and the victims  are reportedly political militants according to some testimonies  gathered on the spot by Radio Metropole. On 17 March, the dead  bodies of three people were found in the streets of the  afflicted city, corpses attacked by dogs and pigs. Jean-Max  Blanc filed a report:    [Begin Blanc recording in Creole] The people of Cite Soleil,  one of the worst slums in Port-au-Prince discovered on 17 March  the corpses of three people in a vacant lot. No resident in the  Cite was able to give information on the author of the act, nor  did any group claim responsibility. Pigs started eating the  faces of two of them. Those corpses include a former sergeant of  the Haitian Armed Forces; the two others are hardly  recognizable. [passage omitted]    It is not the first time that pigs are eating people  murdered in Cite Soleil. A few weeks ago, the residents in the  Cite reported three similar cases. Long before some  unidentified men committed those acts, the UN/OAS international  civilian mission denounced the growing acts of violence in  Port-au-Prince. In a press release issued on 16 March, the  mission reported 50 cases of murder from January to February  that the Haitians pointed out to the mission. The victims  included 12 who were members of grassroots organizations and  another one was an officer of the Haitian Armed Forces who was  killed in Carrefour Feuilles on 20 February. The observers  asserted that they noticed several corpses with torn faces and  other amputated organs. [passage omitted].    The people that the residents in Cite Soleil discovered were  abandoned not too far from the area were a fire destroyed more  than 200 small houses three months ago. At that time, the  residents in Cite Soleil charged that the members of FRAPH  [Revolutionary Front for Haitian Advancement and Progress], the  neo-Duvalierist party, were responsible for the act.

A radical change in the panorama of Brazilian  telecommunications has begun almost without being noticed. Since  last month, two optical-fiber cables installed along the 450-km  Dutra Highway have been carrying telephone calls between Sao  Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Each cable is as thick as the neck of  a beer bottle. In it are the optical fibers--thin glass wires  with the diameter of a strand of hair. The new system was  designed to carry 124,000 telephone conversations  simultaneously, thus quadrupling the capacity for connections  between the two cities. Fifteen years behind the developed  countries, Brazil has entered the era of long-distance data,  sound, and image transmission using the optical system, which is  100 times faster than copper cables and has a useful life twice  that of a satellite. "If Brazil had waited a little longer to  invest in fiber optics, it would have found it difficult to talk  to the rest of the world by the turn of the century," says Eng.  Walter de Andrade Carvalho, a respected consultant in Sao Paulo.    Fiber optics is a system for transmitting information by  means of light signals that began to spread around the world in  the late 1970's. Three undersea cable systems are going to link  Japan with the West Coast of the United States, and three more  will connect the East Coast of the United States with Europe.  U.S. President Bill Clinton recently announced the adoption of a  plan--called the fiber optics superhighway--to link the chief  cities of the United States. Brazil is leagues behind, but the  reason for the nation's backwardness in this area is easy to  understand.    For many years, optical fibers were included in the package  of over 100 items whose importation was banned by Brazilian law,  and domestic manufacturers were protected by the market reserve  established for information technology. For years, Brazilian  government-owned telecommunications companies could buy only  fibers produced at the ABC Xtal factory in Campinas. Not even  Italian-owned Pirelli, which had started producing fibers in  Brazil before the market reserve was established, was allowed to  bid for government contracts. "We manufactured the fibers here  and had to sell them in countries such as Uruguay and Bolivia.  Fortunately, that time has passed," says Eng. Ludgero Patarro,  director of Pirelli's telecommunications division. Working in  partnership with Japan's NEC, which developed the project,  Pirelli produced the cables linking Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo.    Optical-fiber triangle: Until last month's inauguration,  most  of the optical-fiber lines existing in Brazil were urban. They  linked stations owned by Embratel, Brazil's government-owned  telecommunications company, and located within the same city.  There was also a medium-distance line between Sao Paulo and  Campinas that had been installed by Telesp, the Sao Paulo  telephone company, a few years before. That picture is changing  quickly. Next year an optical-fiber triangle linking Sao Paulo,  Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte will be in operation. To  complete the two missing sides of the triangle--the links  between Belo Horizonte and the two other cities--over 1,000 km  of cable will be installed. That stage of the project will cost  about $100 million.    Last week Embratel began examining competitive bids for the  installation of two other lines. The first will link the town of  Sao Mateus in Espirito Santo with Porto Seguro in Bahia. The  other will link Natal and Fortaleza. Those two sections  constitute the land component of a much more ambitious plan.  They will be interconnected by a system of undersea cables.  Scheduled for completion by the end of 1995 is the Brazilian  portion of a project that will link South America with the rest  of the world through fiber optics. The entire domestic network  is expected to cost $1.4 billion.    The only advantage Brazil gains by getting a late start with  fiber optics is that it will pay less for its lines. Technology  has evolved in recent years, and the fibers are better and less  expensive today than they were a decade ago. Ten years ago, it  cost exactly $1 to produce one meter of optical fiber. Now the  developed countries can produce one meter of fiber for $0.07. It  costs Brazilian manufacturers such as ABC Xtal, Pirelli, and  Abracel slightly more than that: from $0.10 to $0.11 per meter.  At present, any foreign company can participate in competitive  bidding in Brazil. The cost of installing a optical-fiber line  is relatively low compared to that of a conventional telephone  line.    Ipanema and Copacabana: A few years ago, the National  Highway  Department (DNER) installed a system of conduits along the Dutra  Highway. Those conduits carried the copper cables for the DNER's  internal communications system between Sao Paulo and Rio de  Janeiro. To install the optical-fiber line, the only thing  necessary was to draw the new cables through those conduits and  set up eight automatic relay stations along the way. The relay  stations amplify the signals and make it possible for someone in  Ipanema to hear the voice of a friend in Sao Paulo more clearly  than he would hear a call from Copacabana, an adjoining  neighborhood. In future links, the government-owned firm will  lay cables one meter deep alongside federal highways and  railroads. It will not be necessary to spend money to  expropriate land or to build complex civil engineering  structures.    "Optical fibers do not replace all communication methods,  but  they are unbeatable in the things that they can do better," says  Eng. Gilberto Viana, head of Embratel's Land Communications  Department. Satellites are still irreplaceable when it comes to  communicating with remote areas such as the Amazon Region. The  cost of installing and maintaining an optical-fiber cable  through the jungle would be very high in relation to the  benefits provided by such a system. Most long-distance telephone  connections and all international connections in Brazil are  handled by the satellite communication system. When the entire  system is in place, 75 percent of the traffic will be carried by  the fiber optics system.    Business opportunities: The Brazilian subsidiary of the U.S.  telecommunications company AT&amp;T estimates that on the day  when  the system is completely installed, Brazil will be able to  double the number of telephone lines with a quality of service  superior to that existing now. The country currently has about  12 million lines, and only seven out of every 12 Brazilians have  a telephone. That is one of the lowest averages in South  America. Besides helping to improve that score, fiber optics  will help open up the possibilities for new technologies such as  interactive television and multimedia services, which are  already being introduced in American homes by means of fibers.  "Thanks to fiber optics, telephone lines are no longer limited  exclusively to telephone calls; instead, they are starting to be  used to transmit a number of different signals," says Adley  Alves Pereira of Brazilian AT&amp;T. "They are becoming a two-way  channel through which the user can interact with the person  sending him the signals."    The same optical-fiber line can carry telephone calls, TV  pictures, and alarm systems simultaneously. The system also  carries messages exchanged between computers located kilometers  apart. The installation of those services alone should generate  business opportunities estimated to be worth over $1.5 billion  annually in the field of connections and new systems. In the  United States, all those services are within reach of most of  the population. Out of every group of 100 Americans, 60 receive  cable TV signals in their homes by way of optical fibers. In  Brazil, most of the existing cable TV services use their own  networks linked by copper cables.    Linking the big cities is the first step in bringing the  convenience already enjoyed by Americans closer to Brazilians.  After that, it will be necessary to adapt the urban networks to  the new system. The amount of money required is tremendous, and  it is unlikely that the government-owned system will be able to  finance the whole undertaking alone. A number of alternative  solutions are being considered, but implementing them will  require changes in the Constitution. "The speed at which the  country is incorporated into this system will have to be much  faster than it is now. Embratel and the telecommunications  companies owned by the states cannot afford to improve service  at the pace required by Brazil," says Eng. Raul Del Fiol, a  telecommunications expert at Promon Engineering. Embratel wanted  to invest a total of $4.6 billion this year, but the government  ordered a 25-percent cut in the company's budget. "If the law  did not prohibit it, private enterprise would have covered the  difference and also invested a lot more money in the country,"  says Del Fiol.</p>

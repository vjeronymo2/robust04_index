The officers have been taken  captives, when they tried to convey the 240 people Echmiadzin  military unit from the Armenian city of Vardenis to the Azeri  district of Kelbajar.    The captive officers (Asjpt Grigoriyan, Stepan Gevorkiyan  and  Razmik Grigoriyan) [names as received] are residents of the  Armenian town of Gyumri (former Leninakan). Trying to prove  ?hat they were involved in a military operation for the first  time, they said they wee peac?ful quartermasters of the 11233d  Unit of the 127th Division of the Russian Army stationed in the  town of Gyumri. Another evidence shown to journalists was the  order of a commander-in-chief of the Armenian armed forces. The  Russian battalion of the 9th Fortified Area marching from  Echmiadzin to Kelbajar got an order to guard the road to the  gold fields and to wait for the coming of the 7th Fortified Area  troops, the document says.    The captives called on their compatriots to stop the war of  conquest. This war is necessary to those who are in power in  Armenia. The people of Armenia do not want to wage war.  According to the officers, hushing people's indignation up,  Armenian authorities are ?rying to conceal the truth from the  world.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yi Tong-min] </F>   [Text] Seoul, May 28 (YONHAP) -- The North Korean nuclear  dispute became a life-or-death situation Saturday with Seoul  officials conceding the virtual failure of  Pyongyang-International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) negotiations.    IAEA Director-general Hans Blix reported to the U.N.  Security  Council that North Korea could finish unloading nuclear fuel  rods within days and thus destroy the chances of measuring what  went on at the 5-megawatt reactor during the past eight years of  operation.    The IAEA, the United States and South Korea have made clear  that if such measurement was not guaranteed, they would seek  countermeasures through the U.N. Security Council. The Security  Council already held informal consultation Friday evening and  will meet again early next week to discuss the situation based  on Blix's report.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu chaired a hastily called  meeting of vice and assistant ministers and his nuclear  negotiating team to discuss the latest report from Vienna.  Officials said the IAEA is likely to issue a final statement  sometime in the morning from Vienna. If the agency judges that  the chances of future measurement are ruined, it is certain to  request action by the Security Council.    The officials were clinging to the little hope that  remained,  saying two of the five IAEA inspectors currently in Pyongyang  will stay behind and monitor the progress in the discharge of  fuel rods from North Korea's 5-megawatt reactor.    These inspectors could restart negotiations with North Korea  on halting the unloading process so that the IAEA can select and  store the critical rods for future measurement. Measurement is  considered a must in determining how much plutonium North Korea  has stockpiled. "But it's definitely closer to a failure," said  one ministry official on condition of anonymity. "As to whether  the remaining inspectors can succeed in negotiations, we can't  be sure."    North Korea began discharging the 800 bundles of fuel rods,  each bundle containing 10 rods, from May 12. According to Blix,  Pyongyang has done 50 percent of the unloading and will be able  to complete the job within days.    Washington, in working-level contacts with Pyongyang over  the  past few days, has insisted that North Korea at least stop the  discharge. This would ensure that there was still a chance of  taking the necessary measurements. But North Korea has refused  to halt the work, demanding instead that the United States sit  down for the next round of high-level negotiations to discuss  how measurement can be guaranteed, apparently a tactic to  continue using the 5- megawatt reactor as a bargaining chip.    "North Korea never said it would not allow measurement. But  it's becoming obvious that Pyongyang is doing its best to keep  its past nuclear activities a secret, away from any analysis or  probe," said one analyst at the Foreign Ministry.    In truth, full access to the fuel rods and their measurement  would disclose the majority of North Korea's nuclear development  program, and giving it away would dramatically weaken  Pyongyang's nuclear card.    Foreign Minister Han had repeated that guaranteeing  measurement is "the line" that decides whether diplomatic  efforts continue or end. North Korea is close to crossing that  line and officials say that by next week, new circumstances may  arise that demand a confrontation with Pyongyang.</p>

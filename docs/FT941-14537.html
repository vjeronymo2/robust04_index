			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / BCCI 'had help in overstating profits by Dollars 30m' The former property entrepreneur, Mr Nazmudin Virani, helped the Bank of Credit and Commerce International carry out its massive international fraud by signing bogus documents enabling the bank to overstate its profits by Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.2m), an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday. The assistance given by Mr Virani, the former head of Control Securities, the property and leisure group, enabled BCCI to deceive the Bank of England into renewing its banking licence. It could therefore continue taking deposits from the public long after it was insolvent, Mr Anthony Hacking QC told the court. Mr Hacking was opening the third prosecution brought by the Serious Fraud Office over the collapse of BCCI. Mr Virani denies one count of conspiring to defraud BCCI depositors, 11 counts of furnishing false information to Price Waterhouse, the bank's auditors, one count of theft and one of false accounting. Mr Hacking said Mr Virani's co-conspirator in the fraud was Mr Mohammed Haque, the former head of BCCI's property division in the UK. After the collapse of the bank in July 1991 Mr Haque fled to Pakistan from where he could not be extradited to the UK. Mr Hacking said that Mr Virani was the largest customer of BCCI's property division. He and Mr Haque developed a 'you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours' relationship. Together they embarked on a fraud that benefited both BCCI and Mr Virani's private property empire, Mr Hacking said. As BCCI's financial troubles increased in the mid-1980s Mr Virani signed a series of bogus documents to help 'plug the gaps' in the bank's accounts and hide the truth about its financial position. The documents, sent to Price Waterhouse, stated that Mr Virani's companies owed substantial sums to BCCI - loans which the auditors treated as BCCI assets. In fact his companies had no such loans with BCCI and the device was simply a means of fooling the auditors and inflating the bank's profits, Mr Hacking said. In return BCCI afforded Mr Virani extra banking facilities and played a substantial role in the expansion of Control Securities by underwriting its share placings. The bank also gave Mr Virani cash payments totalling at least Pounds 1.6m, he said. On one occasion Mr Virani picked up Pounds 200,000 in cash from BCCI's London offices. In 1988 Mr Virani was granted a Pounds 1m loan but made no repayments before the bank collapsed three years later, he said. Mr Hacking told the jury: 'You will have to decide whether the Pounds 1m received in June 1988 was a genuine loan or a sham which may be described as a reward for services provided or as a sweetener for future co-operation.' He said the jury should not be deflected by criticisms made of Price Waterhouse and the Bank of England. 'Mr Virani was the willing and essential partner in a fraud by his bankers on their system and potential depositors,' Mr Hacking said. The trial, expected to last about three months, continues today.</p>

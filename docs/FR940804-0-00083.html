			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (6) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, nothing in this section will prohibit the Administrator from determining through notice-and-comment rulemaking that in specific circumstances the highway sanction, rather than the offset sanction, shall apply 18 months after the Administrator makes one of the findings under paragraph (c) of this section, and that the offset sanction, rather than the highway sanction, shall apply 6 months from the date the highway sanction applies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Available Sanctions and Method for Implementation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Offset sanction.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) As further set forth in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii)&hyph;(e)(1)(vi) of this section, the State shall apply the emissions offset requirement in the timeframe prescribed under paragraph (d) of this section on those affected areas subject under paragraph (d) of this section to the offset sanction. The State shall apply the emission offset requirements in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 7503 and 7509(b)(2), at a ratio of at least two units of emission reductions for each unit of increased emissions of the pollutant(s) and its (their) precursors for which the finding(s) under paragraph (c) of this section is (are) made. If the deficiency prompting the finding under paragraph (c) of this section is not specific to one or more particular pollutants and their precursors, the 2-to-1 ratio shall apply to all pollutants (and their precursors) for which an affected area within the State listed in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section is required to meet the offset requirements of 42 U.S.C. 7503. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, when a finding is made with respect to a requirement for the criteria pollutant ozone or when the finding is not pollutant-specific, the State shall not apply the emissions offset requirements at a ratio of at least 2-to-1 for emission reductions to increased emissions for nitrogen oxides where, under 42 U.S.C. 7511a(f), the Administrator has approved an NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exemption for the affected area from the Act's new source review requirements under 42 U.S.C. 7501&hyph;7515 for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or where the affected area is not otherwise subject to the Act's new source review requirements for emission offsets under 42 U.S.C. 7501&hyph;7515 for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, when a finding under paragraph (c) of this section is made with respect to PM&hyph;10, or the finding is not pollutant-specific, the State shall not apply the emissions offset requirements, at a ratio of at least 2-to-1 for emission reductions to increased emissions to PM&hyph;10 precursors if the Administrator has determined under 42 U.S.C. 7513a(e) that major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the affected area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) For purposes of applying the emissions offset requirement set forth in 42 U.S.C. 7503, at the 2-to-1 ratio required under this section, the State shall comply with the provisions of a State-adopted new source review (NSR) program that EPA has approved under 42 U.S.C. 7410(k)(3) as meeting the nonattainment area NSR requirements of 42 U.S.C. 7501&hyph;7515, as amended by the 1990 Amendments, or, if no plan has been so approved, the State shall comply directly with the nonattainment area NSR requirements specified in 42 U.S.C. 7501&hyph;7515, as amended by the 1990 Amendments, or cease issuing permits to construct and operate major new or modified sources as defined in those requirements. For purposes of applying the offset requirement under 42 U.S.C. 7503 where EPA has not fully approved a State's NSR program as meeting the requirements of part D, the specifications of those provisions shall supersede any State requirement that is less stringent or inconsistent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) For purposes of applying the emissions offset requirement set forth in 42 U.S.C. 7503, any permit required pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 7503 and issued on or after the date the offset sanction applies under paragraph (d) of this section shall be subject to the enhanced 2-to-1 ratio under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Highway Funding Sanction.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The highway sanction shall apply, as provided in 42 U.S.C. 7509(b)(1), in the timeframe prescribed under paragraph (d) of this section on those affected areas subject under paragraph (d) of this section to the highway sanction, but shall apply only to those portions of affected areas that are designated nonattainment under 40 CFR part 81. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18572 Filed 8&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

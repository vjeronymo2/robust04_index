			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Car chiefs see no sign of upturn RECOVERY HOPES were dismissed by motor industry leaders yesterday after UK new car registrations in August, the most important sales month of the year, rose only slightly by 1.7 per cent compared with last year. Rover, which has introduced a three-day week on Metro and Mini assembly at Longbridge, Birmingham, last night announced further reductions in output of its Rover 200/400 series. Overall new car registrations last month rose to 373,804 from last year's depressed level of 367,646, but demand remained well below industry forecasts for sales of around 400,000. Sales have failed to rally in spite of heavy marketing by car makers including widespread dealer discounting, manufacturer cash rebates and offers such as free insurance, free road fund licence and low-cost finance.

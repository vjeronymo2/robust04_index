			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DRIVER SENT TO PRISON FOR CARRYING 6 BOMBS  </P> <P> A Northridge trash-truck driver was sentenced to two years and eight months in  prison Friday for having six pipe bombs in his pickup truck and pointing a gun  at another motorist.  </P> <P> Frank John Salado, 40, was convicted March 24 by Van Nuys Superior Court Judge  Raymond Mireles, who sent Salado to prison.  </P> <P> Salado was found with the bombs July 1. Los Angeles police closed a section of  Topanga Canyon Boulevard near Saticoy Street for about six hours while police  explosives experts destroyed the bombs.  </P> <P> Authorities said the bombs were powerful enough to cause death or serious  injury, but they said they did not know what Salado planned to do with them.  </P> <P> Salado had pointed a gun at a car whose driver called police and led them to  Salado's pickup, where officers found the bombs and two loaded handguns,  authorities said.  </P> <P> According to a probation officer's report, Salado contends that he found the  bombs on top of a trash truck he was cleaning while on the job earlier that day  at a garbage-hauling firm in Simi Valley. He said he did not know the devices  were bombs, the report said.  </P></p>

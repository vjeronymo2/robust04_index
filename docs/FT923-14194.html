			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: MTM to reorganise with staff cuts and Pounds 30m disposal plan MTM, the troubled chemicals group, yesterday announced a board reshuffle, organisational restructuring and redundancies. Mr Ken Schofield, recently-appointed chief executive, also said the company expected to raise between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m from disposals, although he admitted it was a tough time to sell businesses. The reorganisation follows pre-tax losses of Pounds 20.6m last year and the resignation of Mr Richard Lines, executive chairman, and Mr Tom Baxter, finance director. Mr Schofield said he had three businesses that generated 35 per cent of sales and 85 per cent of profits. He planned to base the company around these three, which included Hardwicke in the US, the Lancaster research operations, and the AP speciality chemicals business at Leek in the UK. 'Otherwise we have a lot of non-performing businesses,' he said. 'There is no reason why we should be in intermediates for agrochemicals, specialised coatings or packaging. We need to keep it simple and end up with a structure that we can manage.' He added that he expected to dispose of the specialised coatings operations within the next few days. Following the disposals he expects to have reduced the workforce from 1,100 to 600. In addition the numbers employed at the Rudby Hall headquarters near Middlesbrough will be cut from 44 to 16. These changes should achieve savings of about Pounds 1m this year and Pounds 3m next. They will cost Pounds 500,000 this year. Mr Schofield said the company had made available to the Serious Fraud Office the report from Binder Hamlyn, the group's auditors, on how MTM had come into its present difficulties. However, the SFO had indicated it did not believe the matter warranted its attention. Meanwhile, MTM announced it was restructuring its operations into three divisions: research chemicals, fine chemicals and performance chemicals. Mr Schofield said this would give greater orientation towards profit centres. The company said Mr Kenneth Carter would join MTM this month from British Fuels as finance director. He will also be responsible for the performance chemical division. Mr Neville Newson, former head of European operations, has left the company and the board. Mr James Freiderichsen takes over the fine chemicals division and Mr Alec Ingram assumes responsibility for the research chemicals division.</p>

Discussing Sino-Brazilian ties, Jiang noted that the  frequent  exchanges of visits and direct dialogues between leaders of the  two countries are of great importance to deepening mutual  understanding and promoting friendly cooperation.    He also briefed the visitor on China's economic development  drive.    Amorim hailed Jiang's Brazil tour as a new landmark in Sino-  Brazilian relations.    He held that the fruitful cooperation between the two  countries in science and technology, hydro electric power and  agriculture has set an example for other developing countries.    China's experience in pushing forward its economy is useful  reference for Brazil, he added.

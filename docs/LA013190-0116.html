			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> D.A. ELEVATES DEPUTY TO HEAD HIS SPECIAL OPERATIONS OFFICE  </P> <P> John D. Conley, who created the sexual assault and gang units for the district  attorney's office, was named Tuesday as assistant district attorney in charge  of special operations, a move which essentially makes him the No. 3 prosecutor  within the office.  </P> <P> Conley replaces Maurice L. Evans, who was recently named by Dist. Atty. Michael  R. Capizzi to Capizzi's former post of chief assistant. Capizzi was appointed  by the Board of Supervisors less than a month ago to replace longtime Dist.  Atty. Cecil Hicks, who accepted a judgeship. On paper, the chief deputy  district attorney, James G. Enright, is second in line of authority, should  Capizzi be out of the county. But Enright is a political opponent of Capizzi,  and most attorneys within the office consider Evans -- and now Conley -- the  two most powerful prosecutors in the office under Capizzi.  </P> <P> The special operations office is responsible for writs and appeals, fraud,  narcotics, special assignments, training, consumer and environmental  protection, and the family support sections.  </P> <P> Conley received the prestigious Outstanding Prosecutor award in 1988 from the  state district attorneys association. The award was given partly because of his  successful prosecution of Virl Earles, the driver of a boat which crashed into  a concrete buoy in Anaheim Bay in Seal Beach, killing five people. Conley won  the case at a second trial after nine jurors had voted to acquit Earles at the  first trial.  </P> <P> Conley also has gained recognition for setting up and managing the office's  first sexual assault and gang units. Before, prosecution of those crimes simply  fell within the felony and homicide panels in the office. Conley's most recent  assignment has been the dual role of running the juvenile and gang unit  divisions.  </P> <P> "We were fortunate to have many qualified applicants," Capizzi said in a news  release about Conley's appointment. "John was picked because he is not only an  experienced trial lawyer, but a fine manager."  </P> <P> At the time of Capizzi's appointment by the supervisors on Jan. 2, legal  pundits at the courthouse predicted that it would mean promotions for Evans and  Conley, who have both been close to Capizzi.  </P> <P> Capizzi, however, still has a hurdle left to clear. Enright and Deputy Dist.  Atty. Thomas Avdeef have filed a lawsuit challenging the supervisors' authority  to appoint Capizzi to the district attorney's post. They claim that the  district attorney's duties should go to Enright -- as chief deputy -- until the  June 5 election decides a new district attorney.JERRY HICKS  </P></p>

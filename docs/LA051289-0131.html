			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEMORIAL GOLF TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> FINAL-HOLE BIRDIE GIVES ZOELLER THE LEAD OVER STEWART, COUPLES  </P> <P> Fuzzy Zoeller birdied the final hole Thursday for an opening-round 69 that gave  him a one-stroke lead in the Memorial golf tournament at Dublin, Ohio.  </P> <P> Zoeller, who has just one top-10 finish in 10 tournaments this year, almost  holed an eight-iron from 144 yards out on the par-four closing hole. He then  made a four-inch putt to move ahead of Payne Stewart and Fred Couples.  </P> <P> Another shot back at 71 were David Edwards, Bob Tway, Morris Hatalsky, Kenny  Knox, Mark Wiebe, Jim Carter, Brad Bryant, Corey Pavin and Keith Clearwater.  </P> <P> Jack Nicklaus, who founded the tournament and has won it twice, led a long list  of players at par 72.  </P> <P> Sunny skies and blustery winds helped dry the Muirfield Village course after  four days of rain had left it soft and saturated.  </P> <P> Zoeller, whose best finish at the Memorial was third 11 years ago, made the  turn at even par but had five birdies and a double-bogey on the back side.  </P> <P> Stewart, who won the Heritage tournament a month ago, was three-under at the  turn but overcame three bogeys on the back nine to finish at two-under.  </P> <P> Defending champion Curtis Strange struggled to a 78, while Greg Norman finished  at 75 along with Masters champion Nick Faldo. Former Masters and British Open  champion Sandy Lyle shot a 76.  </P></p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / (CORRECTED) Bricklayer wins Pounds 1,500 harassment award Correction (published 8th January 1993) appended to this article. A BRICKLAYER has won against a London council one of the highest recorded settlements in compensation for sexual and racial harassment at work, Catherine Milton writes. Ms Tracie Simpson, 28, told an industrial tribunal that local officials from one union had participated in her harassment while Ucatt, the building union, had been slow to give effective support. Greenwich Council agreed to pay Ms Simpson Pounds 1,500. She lost her job in October 1991 and is now unemployed, with no plans to return to construction. The settlement came after the tribunal decided her case should be heard even though she failed to raise her claim within the three-month time limit. The tribunal accepted that she had experienced 'considerable sexual and racial harassment', some of which was perpetrated by the 'lower tiers of management' and that the council had failed to take 'effective action' to stop it. CORRECTION MS TRACIE SIMPSON won Pounds 15,000 compensation for sexual and racial harassment from Greenwich council in London and not Pounds 1,500 as reported yesterday.</p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / China hints at trade link with HK row CHINA indicated yesterday that it was prepared to link its dispute with Britain over Hong Kong with the two countries' future economic relations. The warning was contained in a speech to the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London by Zhu Rongji, the vice premier who is chiefly responsible for carrying out China's economic reform programme. He was recently promoted to the Communist party Politburo. Zhu, who is due today to meet Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, was unexpectedly forthright in publicly raising the Hong Kong issue and insisting that proposals for greater democracy by Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, breached agreements between London and Beijing. 'We regard it as a matter of principle, and the Chinese government has always been firm on matters of principle,' he said. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, yesterday firmly endorsed Mr Patten's proposals, saying after a meeting in London with the governor that they fitted into the framework agreed in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong's future. Mr Hurd met Zhu separately, and last night hosted a dinner at which Zhu and Mr Patten were guests. Zhu's speech, after emphasising the need to adhere to agreements on Hong Kong, went on immediately to stress recent growth in trade with Britain. Asked whether he meant to imply that the two issues were linked, he replied simply: 'Let's wait and see.' The Joint Declaration had heralded the best ever period in Sino-British relations, Zhu said. However after Mr Patten's proposals, China had to ask itself whether agreements with Britain should be cast to the winds. The proposals, he said, contravened the Joint Declaration and what he described as an agreement on convergence of Hong Kong's political system with the Basic Law, Hong Kong's Beijing-drafted post-1997 constitution. This appeared to refer to recently published correspondence in 1990 between London and Beijing, which Beijing says constituted a secret agreement. Britain says it contained no such accord. Zhu said: 'We want co-operation and not confrontation. But no one should expect confrontation to force us into concessions, and no one should make any wrong judgment about this.' He hoped the Hong Kong government could return to the consultation process stipulated in the Joint Declaration. He claimed that the proposals were unpopular in Hong Kong. Asked about opinion polls indicating that they were popular, he said: 'We have seen all kinds of polls. They have different results and they vary from time to time.' Mr Major is expected to make clear Britain's view that China should discuss the proposals for the 1995 Legislative Council elections, around which the dispute centres. Mr Patten has repeatedly challenged Beijing to come up with alternative proposals. Ivo Dawnay, Political Correspondent, adds: Mr Major unequivocally endorsed Mr Patten's Hong Kong policy last night claiming there was 'no one better' to lead the colony through to the handover to China in 1997. In a speech to the annual Lord Mayor's banquet at London's Guildhall, the prime minister said the governor's initiatives were entirely consistent with the 'one country, two systems' strategy outlined by Mr Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader.</p>

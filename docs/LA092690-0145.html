			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE;  </P> <P> STEPPING OUT OF A CORPS INTO A LEGACY  </P> <P> The last time the New York City Ballet performed at the Orange County  Performing Arts Center, four years ago, Margaret Tracey and Ben Huys were among  the newest company members. Both had made a strong impression at the School of  American Ballet's annual workshop the previous spring and had joined NYCB  immediately afterward. But in October, 1986, they were dancing in the furthest  reaches of the corps, and Orange County audiences were hardly likely to single  them out.  </P> <P> This week, Tracey and Huys, both 23, arrive as soloists who have accumulated a  considerable repertory of important roles. While a one-week engagement can give  only a small sampling of those roles, each has some plum assignments. Tracey  danced George Balanchine's "Tarantella" on opening night and will perform the  featured role that Peter Martins created for her in his most recent ballet,  "Fearful Symmetries," on Friday and Saturday nights. Huys was in the First  Theme of Balanchine's "The Four Temperaments" on opening night and will be seen  as the Man in Green in Jerome Robbins' "Dances at a Gathering" on Thursday and  at the Saturday matinee.  </P> <P> New York audiences have been witnessing the flowering of these two young  talents in recent seasons as each took on demanding assignments with aplomb.  The petite, confident Tracey has tackled bravura lead roles in Balanchine's  "Square Dance" and "Donizetti Variations"; appeared as both the Sugar Plum  Fairy and Dewdrop in "Nutcracker"; exerted an air of quiet mystery in Robbins'  "Afternoon of a Faun" and Balanchine's "Ivesiana" and originated roles in  several Martins ballets as well as Robbins' "Ives, Songs."  </P> <P> Huys has demonstrated an air of quiet authority and innate elegance partnering  leading ballerinas in "Swan Lake," "Cortege Hongrois" and "Nutcracker" and made  an impressive debut in the lead role of the Divertimento from "Le Baiser de la  Fee," one of Balanchine's most intricate male roles.  </P> <P> Given the sizable and diverse repertory available at City Ballet, both dancers  would seem to have an impressive array of challenges awaiting them, and both  are likely to be prominent when the company stages its first "Sleeping Beauty"  next spring.  </P> <P> During breaks between recent rehearsals at the New York State Theater, Tracey  and Huys each took time to look back on the route that led them to NYCB and  their careers thus far. Both had to travel a considerable distance (in opposite  directions) to get to New York and to overcome initial discomfort at finding  themselves alone in the city at a very young age.  </P> <P> Tracey, one of four children of a family in Pueblo, Colo. (her young sister,  Kathleen, also is in the company), came to the NYCB-affiliated School of  American Ballet at 15 after auditioning in Colorado. She studied there for four  years, although she had not particularly set her sights on New York City Ballet  before her arrival at the school.  </P> <P> Huys, a native of Ghent, Belgium, who received his ballet training in Antwerp,  had longed to join the company but been frustrated that NYCB does not hold  auditions. His success at the Prix de Lausanne competition won him a  scholarship to the School of American Ballet in 1985. After a year of studying  there, he achieved his long-held goal.  </P> <P> "I was dying to get out of Pueblo. I know that if I wanted to be a  professional, Colorado had nothing to offer me," recalled Tracey, who received  most of her early training from her mother.  </P> <P> At the School of American Ballet, she found an especially inspiring teacher in  Stanley Williams, the Dane whom Balanchine invited to come teach in 1964: "We  had wonderful Friday night pointe classes with him. He has an amazing  understanding of pointe work. And my fondest memories of the school are of  working with him on ballets for the workshop. I like his manner. He's very  gentle and encouraging. He gave me strength and precision and inspired a lot of  confidence."  </P> <P> After four years at the school, Tracey found that she took naturally to the  Balanchine repertory upon joining the company. "You automatically feel  comfortable when you step into his pieces," she said. "They're amazing. They  just seem to work, musically and physically."  </P> <P> Huys' first months at the school were frustrating ones. His Soviet-based early  training was at odds with the speed and attack emphasized there, and his early  memories of Williams are of being repeatedly told, "That's wrong."  </P> <P> Huys was ready to head back to Europe but was persuaded to stick it out and  soon found things going more smoothly. "They started rehearsing for the  workshop, and I was cast in 'Cortege Hongrois,' (Bournonville's)  'Konservatoriet' and a new pas de deux by Peter Martins," he said. "All of a  sudden, I got inspired. I had a great foundation from my studies in Antwerp,  but I had to adjust and learn. I'm still learning. It was very difficult: The  musicality is different; you use different muscles; I got injured. Now I've  found my own way of working, so I haven't had so many injuries."  </P> <P> Quiet and reflective in conversation, Huys demonstrated assertiveness when he  took matters into his own hands in gaining his first prominent role. After two  years in the company, "nothing was happening," he said. "I started to rehearse  the 'Nutcracker' pas de deux on my own, and I asked Peter (Martins) to come  look at it. He watched and said, 'Great,' and put me on. I don't know if they  ever would have put me out there that year. Sometimes you have to do it  yourself."  </P> <P> Both dancers have known the challenge of learning and performing a role within  a matter of days, as well as the luxury of having lengthy preparation. Tracey  learned "Square Dance" in four days. "At first I didn't think I could actually  do it, but I was extremely busy that season, so I didn't have time to think  about it, which was a blessing. If I'd had had two or three weeks to brood over  it, I could have psyched myself out of it," she said.  </P> <P> By contrast, Robbins, known for the meticulousness of his rehearsals, worked  daily with Tracey and Jeffrey Edwards for two weeks before their debuts in  "Faun."  </P> <P> Huys had a similarly intensive process with Robbins when "Dances at a  Gathering" was revived last spring. "He started two months before we did it. .  . . He talked about the quality of dancing together, something he said the  ballet had lost over the years."  </P> <P> Tracey received some coaching from the source on "Tarantella" when she asked  Patricia McBride, the longtime NYCB ballerina on whom Balanchine had  choreographed the 1964 ballet, to make suggestions.  </P> <P> "I was rehearsing it for Patty's special retirement performance, and I saw her  walk by. I asked her if there were things she'd like to change. I really wanted  her to be happy with the way I did it. She fixed little things, and the way she  fixed it at that rehearsal is the way I've left it, and I won't touch it  because I feel that's my small way of honoring Patty. I also learned a lot from  watching tapes of her dancing the role. She just had so much fun with it."  </P> <P> Tracey and Huys are part of the new generation, who never knew Balanchine in  any personal way and are now entrusted with his ballets. Both dancers seem to  recognize the significance and uniqueness of this legacy and of the extensive  challenges the NYCB repertory holds for them.  </P> <P> Each also is out to break some molds, as well. Huys said he is concerned that  he not be "stereotyped as a danseur noble. I would like to do as many different  kinds of roles as I can. Otherwise, you don't develop into a complete dancer."  </P> <P> He has his eye on several of Balanchine's knottier Stravinsky ballets, such as  "Agon" and "Duo Concertante."  </P> <P> Tracey mentioned "Stravinsky Violin Concerto" as a ballet others might not  picture her in but that she hopes to try. She also hopes to find her way into  repertory traditionally considered the property of "tall girls" -- something  she already has done with her roles in "Square Dance" and "Donizetti," which  mostly have been the domain of such tall ballerinas as Merrill Ashley and Kyra  Nichols.  </P> <P> Without ever working with Balanchine, Tracey has acquired one of the primary  traits associated with his dancers -- a boldness and energy on stage, a  willingness to take chances and give a little extra. "I don't know how to hold  back on stage," she said. "If I did, I'd feel I was cheating not only myself  but also the audience, and I wouldn't have as much fun."  </P> <P>  The New York City Ballet appears through Sunday afternoon at the Orange County  Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, in Costa Mesa. Tickets: $14 to  $49. Information: (714) 740-2000 or 556-2787.  </P></p>

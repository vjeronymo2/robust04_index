			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EDBERG DEFEATS SREJBER, BUT WILANDER IS OUSTED  </P> <P> Stefan Edberg advanced but fellow Swede Mats Wilander didn't in Wednesday's  second-round singles matches of the ATP Championship at Mason, Ohio.  </P> <P> Edberg came back to beat Czechoslovakia's Milan Srejber, 6-4, 6-7 (7-5), 6-4.  </P> <P> Wilander, still rusty from a four-month layoff, lost to Australia's Darren  Cahill, 6-3, 6-2.  </P> <P> "I knew it was going to be up and down from the beginning," Wilander said.  "Obviously, this is a down. You don't come out and play 75% of your ability  right away; you play 100% one day and 20% the next. You just have to keep  playing to get it back."  </P> <P> Wilander has a 12-7 record on the ATP Tour this year and has not won a  tournament in two years.  </P> <P> In the night's featured matches, eighth-seeded John McEnroe beat Jean-Philippe  Fleurian of France, 7-6 (6-3), 6-2, and defending champion Brad Gilbert  defeated David Wheaton, 6-3, 6-2.  </P> <P> "I volleyed pretty well, and I felt as if he were playing my style of game,"  McEnroe said. "I was picking up the ball better than I have in the last month  or six weeks."  </P> <P> Edberg has been bothered by a sprained left ankle that he injured Sunday during  the final of the Los Angeles tournament.  </P> <P> "I was not 100% today, not even close to it," he said.  </P> <P> Edberg also had to overcome a 3-4, love-30 deficit in the third set.  </P> <P> "Even when I was down a break in the third, I never thought it was over,"  Edberg said. "It's always hard to serve a match out."  </P> <P> Andrei Chesnokov of the Soviet Union, seeded ninth, was eliminated by Scott  Davis, 6-3, 6-2.  </P> <P> Advancing were No. 5 Aaron Krickstein, who beat Sweden's Johan Carlsson, 6-2,  7-6 (8-6); No. 6 Jay Berger, who defeated Nicolas Pereira of Uruguay, 6-2, 6-7  (7-5), 6-4, and No. 7 Michael Chang defeated Israel's Amos Mansdorf, 6-0, 6-4.  </P> <P> Eighth-seeded Anne Minter defeated Kathy May-Paben, 6-3, 6-4, during the second  round in a $150,000 tournament at Albuquerque, N.M.  </P></p>

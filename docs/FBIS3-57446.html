Only  some newspapers and journalists entertained doubts on this  score, he declared on Tuesday [25 January] at a meeting with his  Belgian counterpart, Leo Delcroix. The Belgian defense minister  expressed satisfaction in this connection, since, as he put it,  Grachev presents "a stabilizing factor" in Russia.    Grachev and Delcroix, who came to Moscow for an official  visit, intend to discuss military cooperation between Russia and  Belgium, the results of the recent meeting between the Russian  and American presidents, problems connected with European  security, the role played by NATO in this, and ways to heighten  the effectiveness of nuclear non-proliferation.    Addressing journalists, Grachev said that he intends to  exchange views on the American Partnership for Peace concept  with his Belgian counterpart. This initiative is interpreted  differently in the world, he stressed. Some people believe that  all the countries can join Partnership for Peace, others  maintain that the concept is acceptable only to specific  countries, and there are those who claim that the concept is  designed to unite several countries against some third party, he  noted.    Grachev called for determining this issue once and for all,  and said he hopes that Delcroix will present Russia's attitude  at a session of NATO's Security Council.    The two defense ministers also discussed the possibility of  a  joint visit to the former Yugoslavia. As Grachev said, the  Russian and Belgian peace-keeping contingents deserve high  praise from the international command.    During his two-day trip to Russia, Delcroix is expected to  visit Russia's strategic troops. He will be the first foreign  defense minister, particularly representing NATO, to see  Russia's strategic troops and their combat installations,  Grachev said.</p>

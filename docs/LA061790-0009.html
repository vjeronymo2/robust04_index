			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: ** 1/2 HOTHOUSE FLOWERS "HOME" LONDON: ALBUMS ARE RATED FROM FIVE  STARS (A CLASSIC) TO ONE STAR (POOR).  </P> <P> Anyone who saw the Flowers' Los Angeles shows in '88 and '89 knows that the  Dublin lads have got the boogie in their soul -- their live roof-raisers  sometimes rivaled the Southern romps of classic Leon Russell or Delaney &amp;  Bonnie from an earlier rock era. But the gospel-influenced rave-ups that  punctuate the band's second album call into question how much soul it can  squeeze from the boogie.  </P> <P> Such manic exercises as the opening "Hardstone City" and a slow-then-speedy  version of Johnny Nash's "I Can See Clearly Now" gallop along without  direction. You expect more from a band that was hailed as a leader for the '90s  following its 1988 debut.  </P> <P> On the other end of the scale are a handful of folk-soul hybrids, most notably  "Christchurch Bells," that show off Liam O'Maonlai's rich voice (equal parts  Irish forebears Bono and Van Morrison) and convey an earnest, though vague,  intent to inspire. But they hardly approach similar efforts by the Waterboys,  not to mention Morrison himself. What works best is the middle ground: "Give It  Up" and the Middle Eastern-ish "Water" canter seductively, the music fleshing  out the otherwise sketchy lyrics that characterize the record.  </P> <P> A sophomore slump? Only a coming tour and third album will tell. STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

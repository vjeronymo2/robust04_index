			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fahrudin Becic from Gorazde] </F>   [Text] Overflights by NATO planes were again registered  sometime before 2200 hours. The activities of the aggressor  have significantly diminished compared to this afternoon and the  early hours of this evening, but tank and howitzer shells are  from time to time landing on the town. Firing from infantry  weapons has also diminished in intensity compared to what it was  an hour or so ago. However, there are no indications that the  aggressor is withdrawing, something that is demanded by the NATO  ultimatum. But there is evidence that attacks on the Rogatica  and Pale areas of the battlefield are intensifying. Fresh and  stormy events are probably in store in this area.</p>

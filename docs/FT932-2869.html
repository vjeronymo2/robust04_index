			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Rao denies getting cash from Mehta INDIA'S political and financial communities were shaken yesterday by sworn allegations from Mr Harshad Mehta, the stockbroker at the centre of the Bombay securities scandal, that he made a Rs10m (Pounds 210,000) secret payment in 1991 to Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister. Mr Rao yesterday denied receiving money from Mr Mehta. Senior figures in the ruling Congress party also dismissed the allegations, and two of Mr Rao's main rivals within the party - Mr Arjun Singh, union minister for human resource development, and Mr Sharad Pawar, chief minister of Maharashtra state - described it as a conspiracy to topple the government. An emergency meeting of the Congress working committee has been called for this morning, with many chief ministers flying into the capital from the states through the night. At a press conference in Bombay, Mr Mehta, who faces charges of currency violations, fraud and bribery arising from the Bombay financial scandal which broke in April last year, released a sworn affidavit. It described in detail how he had personally delivered the money in two instalments to the prime minister's office in order to gain political patronage. Mr Mehta's statement said that while he had been 'painted the author of a scam' and made out to be 'a person who had misappropriated national wealth to the extent of Rs50bn and badly damaged the country's economy,' he was now seeking to clear himself and expose 'the real culprits' of the scandal. Mr Mehta, quoting an affidavit notarised by the Bombay High Court on February 24 this year, detailed his alleged meeting with Mr Rao. In it he says: 'On the 4th of November 1991, I met Prime Minister Narasimha Rao at about 10.45 in the morning, in the company of my brother Ashwin and a Congress Upper House member, the late Mr Satpal Mittal, at the Race Course Road residence of the prime minister. . . we had brought to the prime minister's residence, a suitcase containing cash amount of Rs6.7m. This suitcase was brought into the prime minister's house and handed over to the prime minister himself, who instructed that it should be retained in the charge of his personal assistant, Mr Khandekar.' According to Mr Mehta, the remaining Rs3.3m, which he could not immediately muster, was delivered to Mr Rao's assistant the following day, at the instance of the late Mr Mittal. The Bombay stock exchange index closed 2.33 points lower at 491.43 yesterday as rumours spread that Mr Mehta was to unleash a political bombshell at his press conference.</p>

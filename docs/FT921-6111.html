			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Commission to appeal against court ruling on decision-making THE European Commission is to appeal against Thursday's unprecedented court ruling which cast doubt on the validity of the EC executive's internal decision-making process and quashed fines imposed on 14 chemicals companies for operating a cartel. Several large EC groups are examining the judgment by the EC's Court of First Instance (CFI) to find out whether they, too, have grounds for challenging fines imposed on them. The Commission will appeal to the European Court of Justice, the EC's supreme judicial body. '(The Commission) does not share the lower court's interpretation of its internal rules,' said a spokesman. There is still debate among EC lawyers about the scope of the judgment. At worst, Commission legal experts fear the ruling could undermine past decisions in all areas of its activity, not just competition, and allow aggrieved companies to challenge fines going back years. Normally, complainants have only two months to appeal against a Commission decision. The Dutch builders' federation, the SPO, had already intended to lodge an appeal against a fine imposed by the Commission earlier this month for operating an illegal cartel. Mr Louis van Lennep, the federation's lawyer in Brussels, said yesterday the SPO was more interested in attacking the substance of the Commission's decision. But he added: 'We will look at (the ruling) of course, and if there is mileage in it we will use it.' Aer Lingus, the Irish airline fined Ecu750,000 (Pounds 525,000) this week for operating a restrictive ticketing system on the London-Dublin route, said the judgment sounded 'extremely interesting'. The airline has not yet decided whether to appeal against Wednesday's Commission decision. The Commission is particularly concerned about the CFI's suggestion that the official versions of all its decisions, which can appear in up to nine languages, should be signed by Mr Jacques Delors, the president, and Mr David Williamson, the secretary general. To ease the bureaucratic load, the president and secretary general usually sign only the minutes of the Commission meeting in which the decision took place.</p>

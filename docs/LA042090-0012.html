			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROFIT RIGHTS FOR PATIENTS  </P> <P> After reading the article about John Moore ("Case Argues Rights Over Tissue  Used in Research," Part A, April 11) appealing to the state Supreme Court after  his cancerous spleen was removed which saved his life, to grant medical  patients the right to share in profits from the commercial use of their tissue,  I decided that if he wins, he is setting a weird precedent.  </P> <P> Picture this: When people have surgery, they tell their doctor that any organ  removed from their body belongs to them and that they are to be kept informed  as to what is done with it.  </P> <P> So the scientific community discovers, as in Moore's case, that the diseased  organ has valuable properties that would greatly aid humankind. What happens  next? Do the doctors and medical research center implement their medical  findings or do they first figure out the monetary value of the patient's organ?  </P> <P> In the meanwhile, I have elected to donate my organs upon my death. Perhaps I  should qualify this by stating that if they find anything of value to notify my  heirs.  </P> <P> JEANNE LONDE  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Turkey appoints banks for Tofas sale TURKEY has appointed J. Henry Schroder Wagg, the UK merchant bank, and Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, to sell the government's stake in Tofas, the Turkish car assembly arm of the Italian Fiat motor group. The share issue is expected to raise around Dollars 500m. It will be the largest international offering ever by a Turkish company. Schroder will link with Turkey's Interbank and Lehman with Finanzbank. The French Indosuez group is understood to have bid to handle the issue. The government is selling 21 per cent of manufacturer Tofas Fabrikasi and 18 per cent of its marketing arm, Tofas Ticaret. Both companies' shares are traded on the Istanbul stock market. The offer, which would be made on Turkish and international markets, is expected to be concluded by the close of this year. Turkey's car market is currently growing at 25 per cent a year, in marked contrast to the trend elsewhere in Europe. The banks are considering three options - a full registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission in New York, a restricted listing through American Depositary Receipts, or a private placement with US institutions. Bankers are also considering the possibility of listing Tofas on the Luxembourg bourse. Pennzoil, the US oil group, is to offer 5m common shares in the US and internationally to raise around Dollars 333m. Proceeds will be used to reduce borrowings, Reuter reports from Houston. The group said the offer would be priced next week. Underwriters will also be granted over-allotment options to buy an extra 500,000 shares. Net proceeds, together with Dollars 10.9m of cash on hand, will be used to redeem Dollars 111m principal of 10 per cent debentures due 2011, Dollars 120m of 10 1/8 per cent debentures due 2011 and as much as possible of the outstanding Dollars 100m of 9 per cent debentures due 2017.</p>

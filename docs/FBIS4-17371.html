			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Own correspondent's report: "Andrey Kokoshin: Robust </F> Economy and Industry Are the Foundation of Russian National  Security"]    [Text] Russia's national security should be founded on a  developed economy with a robust financial system, Andrey  Kokoshin, first deputy defense minister, stressed in his address  at the Fourth Congress of the Russian Commercial Banks  Association. He pointed out the need to accelerate the process  of setting up formidable financial-industrial groups in Russia  and the CIS in order to manufacture science-intensive industrial  products for both civilian and military purposes that will be  competitive on the world market.    The creation of financial-industrial groups will make it  possible considerably to ease pressure on the government budget  and to boost investment in industry. Back in 1991, Andrey  Kokoshin, who headed a group of economists, historians, and  industrialists at the time, put forward the initiative to create  such groups and powerful companies drawing on rich foreign  experience. The main elements of these "locomotives" of the  domestic economy would be enterprises of the former USSR's  military-industrial sector that are undergoing conversion to  civilian uses and diversifying their area of expertise.</p>

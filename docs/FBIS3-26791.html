			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] United Nations, February 14 (XINHUA) -- Russia's UN  Ambassador Yuliy Vorontsov today said that a "proper decision"  by the Security Council is necessary to back up its previous  demands for a settlement of conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.    His remarks came at a Security Council meeting which the  Russian Federation, Bosnia and Hercegovina and Pakistan  requested to convene to discuss the situation in the former  Yugoslav republic.    "In view of the fact that previous ceasefire agreements and  other agreements between the parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina  in the past have frequently broken down," Vorontsov said, "it is  obviously extremely important for the Security Council to back  up its demands by a proper decision" for a cease-fire and a  withdrawal of heavy weapons in and around Sarajevo.    "We believe that it is essential to time and again spell out  our support for the negotiating procedure in order to reach a  settlement to the Bosnian conflict as a whole," he said.    Stating that it is now very important to urge all three  parties to the conflict to reach a compromise, the ambassador  said "we will continue to cooperate with the European Union and  the United States in an attempt to find a peaceful settlement.    On February 5, a mortar shell explosion in an open market in  Sarajevo killed 68 civilians and wounding 197, worsening the  situation in the Bosnian capital, which had been besieged by  Bosnian Serbs for 22 months.    Last Wednesday, NATO agreed to a request by UN  Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to use air-strike to  silent heavy weapons in and around Sarajevo.</p>

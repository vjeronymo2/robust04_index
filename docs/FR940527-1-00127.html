			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 3. Budget Neutrality Adjustment Factor for Changes in DRG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Weights and the Geographic Adjustment Factor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Section 412.308(c)(4)(ii) requires that the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate be adjusted so that estimated aggregate payments for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fiscal year based on the Federal rate after any changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting from the annual reclassification and recalibration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the DRG weights and changes in the geographic adjustment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factor equal estimated aggregate payments that would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been made on the basis of the Federal rate without such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes. We used the actuarial model described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix B to estimate the aggregate payments that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been made on the basis of the Federal rate without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in the DRG classifications and weights and in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geographic adjustment factor. We also used the model to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate aggregate payments that would be made on the basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Federal rate as a result of those changes. We then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used these figures to compute the adjustment required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintain budget neutrality for changes in DRG weights and in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the geographic adjustment factor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For FY 1994, we calculated a GAF/DRG budget neutrality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factor of 1.0053. In this proposed rule, we are applying a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factor of 1.00115. The GAF/DRG budget neutrality factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are built permanently into the rates; that is, they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied cumulatively in determining the Federal rate. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follows from the requirement that aggregate payments each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year be no more than it is estimated that they would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been in the absence of the changes from the annual DRG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reclassification and recalibration and in the geographic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment factor. The incremental change in the adjustment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from FY 1994 to FY 1995 is 1.00115.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We note that this factor accounts for DRG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reclassifications and recalibration and changes in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geographic adjustment factor. It also incorporates the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects on the geographic adjustment factor of FY 1995  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geographic reclassification decisions made by the MGCRB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compared to FY 1994 decisions. However, it does not account  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for changes in payments due to changes in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disproportionate share and indirect medical education  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment factors or in the large urban add-on.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 4. Budget Neutrality Adjustment Factor to Assure Aggregate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Payments Equal 90 Percent of Reasonable Cost Payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Section 1886(g)(1)(A) of the Act requires that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aggregate payments made each year in FY 1992 through FY 1995  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for hospital inpatient services be reduced in a manner that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results in payments equal to 90 percent of the amount the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary estimates would have been payable on a reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost basis for inpatient capital-related costs in that year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No retroactive increase or decrease is made if aggregate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments are greater than or less than 90 percent of actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare inpatient capital-related costs for that year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 412.352 of the regulations provides that HCFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines an adjustment to the hospital-specific rate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Federal rate proportionately, so that the estimated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments for capital in each year from FY 1992 through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FY 1995 will equal 90 percent of what would have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payable that year on a reasonable cost basis. The effect of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this provision is that the reduction required under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1886(g)(1)(A) of the Act is realized entirely through a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction in the prospective payments for capital costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (that is, no reduction is made for this purpose in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable cost payments for old capital) in FY 1992 through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FY 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For FY 1994, we determined that a budget neutrality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factor of 0.8947 was required so that estimated aggregate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments for inpatient capital-related costs would equal 90  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of what would have been payable on a reasonable cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis in that year. For FY 1995, we are proposing a budget  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neutrality factor of 0.7986.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As we explain in Appendix B, we determine the budget  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neutrality adjustment factor on the basis of a projected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FY 1995 capital costs per case budget neutrality target. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop this target from available data on average Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital costs per case for all short-term acute care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals subject to the capital prospective payment system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (that is, data from excluded and waiver hospitals were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminated). For the FY 1995 proposed rule, we have actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data for FY 1992 from the December 1993 HCRIS update. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also have revised estimates of the rates of increase in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare capital costs per case for the years FY 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through FY 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the time of the final rule for FY 1994, we had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated that there would be a 30.53 percent increase in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare inpatient capital cost per case between FY 1992 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FY 1995. In this proposed rule for FY 1995, we estimate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that there will be a 12.83 percent increase in Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inpatient capital cost per case between FY 1992 and FY 1994,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a decline of 13.56 percent (1.1283/1.3053=.8644, or ^13.56  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent) in the estimated rate of increase since the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule for FY 1995. The following chart shows how the rate-of-increase estimates for FY 1992 through FY 1995 were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated in the final rule for FY 1994 and in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule for FY 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

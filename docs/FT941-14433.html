			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Eastern to supply power to 500 McDonald's Eastern Electricity yesterday took a high profile bite in a new competitive section of the power market when it announced a deal to supply 500 McDonald's restaurants in England and Wales from April. It said the contract, estimated to be worth Pounds 12m annually, is the biggest and most comprehensive deal announced in the market for users of between 100 kilowatts and 1 megawatt. Eastern's shares rose 9 1/2 p to 674p, although part of the increase was attributable to its move this week to buy back some of its equity to boost earnings per share. From April the 45,000 England and Wales consumers of between 10kw and 1MW of electricity will for the first time be able to pick which company to take their supplies from. Previously they have been able to buy only from the monopoly distributor which supplies their region. The change will not affect the physical source of the electricity which is generated by separate companies. This is because suppliers trade rather than generate electricity. Virtually all of McDonald's stores fall into the 100kw to 1MW category. Mr Keith Smith, McDonald's chief building services engineer, said Eastern's offer would provide the company with savings of about Pounds 1.4m on its total UK bill, including franchise stores, of Pounds 18m. Eastern was chosen after quotes from 14 suppliers, including most of the other regional electricity companies.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: BP gains from UK buying THE PROSPECTS for BP, due to announce first-quarter results next Thursday, led to divided opinions among UK institutional investors, who have recently taken a very dim view of the stock. Yesterday, one leading stockbroker bought 5m shares on behalf of a large institution. Because of double counting the deal represents 10m of the 21m shares traded. BP closed 2 firmer at 268p against a weak market and a sluggish sector. The shares have fallen steadily from the mid-350s since last autumn as the market has become increasingly worried about the oil company's ability to maintain its dividend. They have picked up recently because US investors decided they were cheap, but UK buyers have tended to stay on the sidelines. BAe slips A cautious annual meeting at British Aerospace left the shares 6 lower at 345p after a volatile session. Turnover rose to 4.6m shares. Sentiment was also affected by unconfirmed reports that BZW had downgraded its 1992 profits forecasts for the company by about Pounds 35m to around Pounds 185m. Further revisions from other brokers are expected. There were also some fears that Delta Air Lines, of the US, which announced on Wednesday plans to cut more than Dollars 5bn from its capital expenditure programme by reducing aircraft deliveries, may abandon Airbus orders. BAe has a 20 per cent stake in AirBus Industrie, and builds the wings of the Airbus aircraft. Wellcome bounces Encouraging news at a presentation to financial analysts by Wellcome prompted a bounce in the stock, which has fallen sharply since the general election. It rallied 24 to 1060p. Specialists were particularly cheered by the suggestion that earnings per share growth for this year could be as high as 20 per cent, compared with market estimates of around 15 per cent. There was also reassurance that a number of products in the research stage were going well, particularly the replacement for Wellcome's high earning anti-viral drug Zovirax, which represents almost 30 per cent of drug sales and is approaching the end of its patent lifespan. First-quarter results from ICI were encouraging but the shares fell 19 to 1362p on profit-taking. Troubled chemicals group MTM recovered 7 to 64p after appointing a new chief executive. Glaxo regained 6 to 744p on announcing that it had won UK approval for the oral form of its migraine drug, Imigran. An announcement that Fisons intends to sell its consumer health and horticulture units to raise between Pounds 200m and Pounds 400m initially helped the shares. They climbed 13 but fell back with the market to close unchanged at 384p. Granada Group rose as Smith New Court upgraded its figures. The securites house is looking for Pounds 114m this year, up Pounds 4m, and a further rise of Pounds 15m in 1993 to Pounds 139m, after being impressed by Granada's rationalisation programme. The shares put on 4 to 266p. There was hefty turnover in Queens Moat Houses, up 1 1/2 at 87 1/2 p, as one investor switched convertible stock into 5.3m ordinary shares. A cash call from Resort Hotels left the shares 7 down at 76p. Transport Development Group shed 8 to 271p after Smith New Court successfully placed the 19.6 per cent stake in TDG owned by Proventus, the Swedish group, with institutions at 263p a share. British Airways rose 10 to 289p on reports that UBS Phillips &amp; Drew had upgraded the stock. Eurotunnel improved 10 to 381p as bargain hunters continued to favour the stock following its recent decline. The company said yesterday it would pay Pounds 50m to TML, the Channel tunnel contractor, as ordered by a disputes panel. Sources close to TML were optimistic over a final set-tlement being agreed with Eurotunnel shortly, and said that no further provisions would have to be made by the construction group this year over the costing dispute. BICC was off 2 at 344p after graded its figures for the electricals group and moved to a sell stance, citing worries about BICC's borrowings. Utilities remained strong, ahead of the reporting season. Thames Water climbed 5 to 442p and Severn Trent 6 1/2 to 390 1/2 p following recent suggestions by analysts that the sector is undervalued. Troubled property company Mountleigh said negotiations to sell a large shopping mall had collapsed. The stock declined 1 1/4 to 5 3/4 p. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi saw heavy turnover of 40m shares and firmed 1 3/4 to 19 3/4 p. Overseas investors are said to be particularly keen on economic recovery hopes, although one observer said the shares did not look cheap at this level. Kingfisher lost 12 to 542p as UBS Phillips &amp; Drew lowered its current year profits forecast by Pounds 5m to Pounds 235m, on doubts about the performance of B &amp; Q, its DIY subsidiary. Dalepak Foods gained 8 to 363p on the appointment of a new chairman. Discount food retailer Kwik Save strengthened 19 to 600p on encouraging first-half profits, which were within market forecasts. Mr Graeme Seabrook, group managing director, predicted faster profits growth in the second half. Albert Fisher was very active following recent US presentations. It was one of the most heavily traded stocks on the London market, with turnover of 17.1m shares. The price rose 1 to 72p as a large selling order was easily absorbed. Talk of a profits upgrading for Siebe by BZW failed to halt the stock's decline, which ended 13 lower at 690p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (271).

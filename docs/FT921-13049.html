			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / British Coal director gets Commons voting MR Malcolm Edwards yesterday received a vote of support from MPs representing all three main parties when an early day motion deploring his 'effective ousting' as commercial director of British Coal was tabled in the Commons. The motion called on Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, to make sure Mr Edwards' present position was 'confirmed immediately'. It was 'widely recognised' that Mr Edwards was 'the best negotiator British Coal has got'. The motion was sponsored by six MPs, including Mr Michael Clark, Conservative chairman of the Commons energy select committee.</p>

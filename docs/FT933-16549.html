			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses slow after Buba cuts THE INITIAL, enthusiastic reaction among bourses to the Bundesbank's cut in key interest rates, and those elsewhere which preceded and followed it, was reflected in a rise of 12.69, or more than 1 per cent in the Eurotrack 100 index at midday in London. But the gains were mostly dissipated as the afternoon wore on, writes Our Markets Staff. Fine words from German politicians and bankers were tested, and found wanting: the economics minister, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, said that the cuts would boost the economy of Germany and of its EMS partners; but Mr Julian Callow, an economist at Kleinwort Benson, said that Germany's planned financial retrenchment will sap strength out of the economy, 'suggesting that 1994 and 1995 will be very sluggish years for economic growth'. This outcome, too, would reflect on the performance of other EMS countries. There was a corollary. 'For the markets', said Mr Callow, 'this in turn implies that German short term interest rates have substantially further to decline. . .' However, he added, given that the discount rate cut was twice the 25 basis points mostly widely cited, yesterday's cuts might well be the last for another couple of months. FRANKFURT went both ways in the official session and down in the post-bourse. The DAX index reached a high of 1,715.25 on the rate cut news but subsided to 1,706.63, up 9.00 at the close. In the afternoon, it followed the bond market down, with a late indication of 1,699.06. The big carmakers, chemicals and most banks registered subdued share price performances, although Dresdner rose DM8 to DM385 during the session, on a rumoured joint venture agreement with an English investment bank. Thyssen slipped for the second day, down DM4.00 to DM185.60 following a meeting in which it told analysts that, in addition to the 9,000 layoffs in its steel unit previously announced, a further 5,400 jobs would be cut in 1993/4. PARIS, too, enjoyed an initial early boost following the news from Germany, with the CAC-40 index rising to a day's high of 1,994, before falling back sharply to close down 11.72 at 1,960.15. Turnover was a firm FFr3.7bn. Some brokers attributed the bourse's decline to a weaker Matif market, as well as US institutional selling and a slightly weaker franc. However, expectations are that the French authorities will cut domestic rates again on Monday. The market might also have given some thought to trade data released yesterday: while showing a widening in the trade surplus in March it also revealed a significant fall in both exports and imports on a year-on-year basis. James Capel, commenting on the figures, note that this appears to reflect the impact of currency movements. Eurotunnel advanced 45 centimes to FFr35.60 on news that resolution of its dispute with contractors could be nearer. AMSTERDAM saw a year's high in the CBS Tendency index during the session before the market eased back gently to close 0.2 higher at 112.7. As expected after the close the central bank cut key domestic rates. MILAN performed strongly following the Buba rate cut, before easing later. However, domestic interest remained concentrated on Fiat, following Wednesday's warning of a L1,000bn operating loss in 1993. The Comit index ended down 1.37 at 534.78. Fiat fixed down L330 at L6,160 as investors reacted to the statement from Mr Giovanni Agnelli at the annual meeting. Some analysts commented that the market had, to some extent, been taken by surprise by the news, as it had been concentrating less on fundamentals in recent weeks. The Fiat share price has gained 50 per cent since the start of the year on a number of speculative stories. One of these involved expectations of asset sales by the group, confirmed by Mr Agnelli at the annual meeting. As a result, Rinascente, one of the non-strategic divisions expected to be sold, leapt L101 to L8,900. There was considerable activity in possible privatisation candidates after the government said on Wednesday night that it hoped to begin the privatisation of seven groups within the next month. Among those on the list, Credito Italiano rose L130 to L2,611, BCI by L163 to L5,098 and Stet by L70 to L3,610. ZURICH moved on an early, and unexpected domestic rate cut, with good buying of banking stocks; but it saw a wave of profit-taking later, and no response to the Bundesbank move. The SMI index closed 0.2 lower at 2,376.0. Union Bank rose SFr11 to SFr1,111, while Surveillance gained SFr17 to SFr1,748 on the firm dollar. MADRID waited for Buba, then rose and fell to close with the general index just 0.47 higher at 260.31. Turnover was healthy at Pta19.6bn. BRUSSELS, bullish already, took the day's news as an excuse to hit a second consecutive all-time high, the Bel-20 index closing 12.83, or 1 per cent higher at 1,292.36. This was the Bel-20's 19th higher close in succession, adding up to a rise of more than 9 per cent since the rally began on June 4. OSLO also ended at a new high, the all share index rising 7.83, or 1.6 per cent to 495.32 in turnover of NKr395m. Shipping stocks were again strong on hopes of an upturn in chartering rates. ISTANBUL advanced some 3.4 per cent after Wednesday's 2.9 per cent fall on hopes that the new cabinet would win a vote of confidence scheduled for Monday.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- July 1               THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1213.83     1214.92     1215.69     1221.68 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1270.19     1270.62     1271.93     1277.12  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1218.02     1216.38     1213.83     1213.21 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1275.11     1272.99     1271.88     1270.98  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jun 30    Jun 29    Jun 28    Jun 25    Jun 24  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1208.99   1207.97   1210.15   1202.12   1199.58 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1266.14   1263.58   1265.02   1254.67   1251.56  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1221.68; 200 - 1280.89 Low/day: 100 - 1212.84  200 - 1269.61  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

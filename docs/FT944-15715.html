			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / International Company News: Electrolux to expand in Asia Electrolux, the world's biggest manufacturer of household appliances, said that it aims to double its revenues from Asian countries to SKr10bn (Dollars 1.37bn) within five years as part of its expansion drive in the region. 'Our target is to be one of the major players, corresponding to our position in Europe and the US,' said Mr Leif Johansson, Electrolux chief executive. The company also said that it was planning to open five new factories in the region within three years at sites still to be finalised. Following its purchase of AEG's household appliance unit, Electrolux has switched the focus of its expansion strategy to Asia. It has recently launched a Dollars 50m investment programme in the Asean region and said that it intended to spend Dollars 100m in China over three years. The moves anticipate a substantial rise in disposable incomes. 'We expect China to emerge as the world's largest market for refrigerators by the end of this year and will be exporting more fridges than Japan,' said Mr Johansson.</p>

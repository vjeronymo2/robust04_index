			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Oriel to raise Pounds 4m for expansion Oriel Group, the USM-quoted insurance broker, is raising a net Pounds 4m by way of a rights issue to pay for expansion. It is also acquiring David Shapiro and Insurance Administration Consultants for a total of Pounds 3m. It is offering 4.15m shares at 105p on a 2-for-11 basis. Commitments to accept in respect of 7.1 per cent of the offer have been received and the balance has been underwritten. The shares were unchanged at 112p. The company said that following its acquisition of Warranty Holdings last year, which was partially funded by debt, it was in a period of rapid growth which was being hindered by debt levels. Of the consideration for the purchases Pounds 1.5m will be paid on completion with the balance paid a year later. The total consideration will be satisfied by Pounds 2m cash and shares. Oriel also announced that Mr Richard Hill, recently chairman of Insurance Service, a Royal Insurance subsidiary, is joining the board and becoming chief executive of CGA Direct (Insurance Brokers), an Oriel offshoot.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Appraisals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Rule included a requirement that State Savings Banks intending to convert to stock ownership submit to the FDIC, along with the other required materials, a full appraisal report on the value of the converting bank and the pricing of the conversion stock. As discussed in the Proposed Rule, many states require that a converting mutual savings bank sell its capital stock at a total price equal to its estimated  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro forma <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  market value, based on an independent valuation. Despite this requirement, many converted institutions have exhibited significant increases in the immediate post-conversion trading market price for the stock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As explained in detail in the Proposed Rule, the FDIC is concerned that the history of increases in market prices resulted from appraisal reports (submitted in connection with these conversions) that significantly undervalued the stock_the effect of which has several ramifications. If an appraisal is too low and the shares of stock are underpriced, the institution receives less of an increase in capital than it should from the sale of conversion stock and the deposit insurance fund is provided with less of a capital cushion than would have resulted if the stock sales price was based on a proper and adequate appraisal. Also, an underpriced appraisal enriches the insiders who purchase or are granted a significant interest in the converting institution by enticing them to undertake a conversion (in order to acquire shares below their fair value) that may not be in the best interest of the institution. Sophisticated investors also are able to benefit, undeservedly, from the sale of underpriced conversion stock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As also noted in the Proposed Rule, appraisers historically have set the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro forma <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  market value of the converting institution at a significant discount to a defined peer group. This gives rise to problems involving selection of an inappropriate peer-group, inconsistencies between the assumptions in the appraisal report and the business plan and unfounded justification for substantial new-issue discounts in stock offerings that have been well oversubscribed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, the FDIC proposed requiring that a full appraisal be provided to the FDIC in a proposed mutual-to-stock conversion of a State Savings Bank, and that the appraisal report be prepared by an independent appraiser and include a complete and detailed description of the elements that make up the report, justification for the methodology employed and sufficient support for the conclusions reached therein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FDIC received several comments on the proposed appraisal requirements. Most who commented on this issue favored the required submission of a full appraisal report. Some expressed concern, however, that an over-emphasis on immediate post-conversion share price increases might force appraisers to overvalue the stock of converting institutions, resulting in a detriment to the institution and its stockholders. They also suggested that there must be some expectation of an early increase in stock price to entice investors to purchase stock of a converting mutual. A few of those commenting said the FDIC should publish the standards it will use in judging appraisals. One suggested that the OTS and the FDIC should issue joint appraisal standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A state savings association noted that one of the basic problems with conversions is the appraisal of the institution. It stated that ``the FDIC needs to be satisfied that the various states are as well equipped [as the OTS staff] to perform a definitive analysis of the appraisals as well as know with certainty that the appraiser is qualified to assess a financial institution's value''. The commenter also noted that fairness and moderation are the keys to governing stock conversions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the comments received and the FDIC's view that the proper valuation of a converting mutual savings bank is a crucial factor in assuring an equitable mutual-to-stock conversion, the Board has decided to adopt the appraisal requirements in the Proposed Rule. Thus, the FDIC will continue to review appraisal reports to ensure that converting institutions are properly valued and will continue to object to proposed conversions supported by unacceptable appraisal reports. In reviewing appraisal reports, the FDIC also will continue to consider the appraisal standards and guidelines, if any, of the applicable state and/or the appraisal guidelines issued by the OTS. The FDIC believes that it is unnecessary to develop and implement a separate set of appraisal guidelines inasmuch as the various state and the OTS guidelines are sufficient to provide the depository institutions' and the appraisal industry with parameters necessary to prepare and furnish an acceptable appraisal report. In addition, the FDIC is aware of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP), especially Standards 9 and 10 which relate to business appraisals. The Business Valuation Committee of the American Society of Appraisers commented that the USPAP standards are an appropriate frame of reference for mutual-to-stock-conversion appraisals especially when such transactions directly impact safety and soundness or involve issues of fundamental fairness to depositors and other stakeholders in insured institutions. Adherence to those standards is expected in the appraisal process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

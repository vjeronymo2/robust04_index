			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / National &amp; Provincial ousts chief executive Mr David O'Brien resigned yesterday as chief executive of National &amp; Provincial Building Society, after being told that the board wanted to replace him with the society's finance director. His successor is Mr Alistair Lyons, aged 40, who was brought into N&amp;P as finance director by Mr O'Brien soon after his own arrival four years ago. 'We really felt we were moving from a stage where David's skills were very valuable to a stage where Alistair's would be more appropriate,' Lord Shuttleworth, N&amp;P chairman, said. 'When I communicated this to David, he decided to resign.' Mr O'Brien had a strikingly unconventional style of management in a sector which is noted for a more traditional approach. Last year a clash of cultures was cited as the reason for the collapse of the planned merger between N&amp;P and Leeds Permanent, which would have created the UK's third largest society. In 1990 he had started a programme to re-design the society's operations, and had developed a style based on teamwork and emphasising the focus on the customer rather than the product. While he is widely credited for turning around the performance of a society which had been in some difficulties before his arrival, he was also seen as someone who created a potentially unsettling climate of constant change. N&amp;P's pre-tax profits increased 51 per cent in 1993 to reach Pounds 121m, but at the same time its cost/income ratio rose sharply at a time when some other large societies were seeing the ratio fall or remain broadly stable. Lord Shuttleworth said N&amp;P, the eighth largest society, had gone through a considerable time of change and saw the next stage as one of 'implementation and consolidation of what we had achieved'. Mr Lyons played down suggestions that his appointment would mark a significant shift in direction for N&amp;P, but said he expected the pace of change to be slower in future. Most of the building blocks for the society to provide a wide range of financial services had already been put in place, he said. Mr O'Brien's abrupt departure means that he will qualify for severance pay in compensation for loss of office, but the society said details had not been agreed.</p>

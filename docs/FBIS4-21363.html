These issues should be left to the international  organisations that are already dealing with them, Mr Suphachai  said.    Dr Suphachai was speaking at the 21st meeting of the U.S.  Information Service's annual economic seminar entitled  "Regionalisation of Thai-U.S. Economic Relations".    He told Business Post that it is possible to look at trade  issues on their own merits by decoupling them from side issues.    "Trade should be treated on its own merits, linked with real  macroeconomic issues, and side issues that are now coupled with  trade such as human rights, workers' rights and the environment  should be left to international organisations that are already  dealing with them," he said.    He said a country that is trying to achieve greater economic  development will try its best to improve standards of human  rights and labour relations.    "Through trade development expansion we can facilitate the  process of paying adequate attention to human rights  development," he said.    If some of the major side issues are put in the forefront,  such as the U.S. linking of the Generalized System of  Preferences with labour rights, it may not bring results in the  end, he said.    The GSP was conceived to help developing countries' exports  by granting concession terms, and is not supposed to be linked  with anything, he said.    He said he understood the good intentions of the U.S.  administration which has a sense of humanity and is justifiably  concerned with rights.    But he questioned whether its policy is the most effective  way of conditioning the whole world to move in that direction.    Dr Suphachai said the more we want to promote trade and  economic relations throughout the world the more we must work  toward depoliticising trade issues.    This will benefit not only the private sector but also the  newly emerging countries, as at least world economic growth will  be more predictable than in the past, he said.    Dr Sean Randolph, the managing director of RSR Pacific  Group,  a consulting firm specialising in business development in Asia,  Latin America and the Pacific, presented a report on a U.S.  perspective on the Asia Pacific economy.    Dr Randolph, the former international director-general of  the  Pacific Basin Economic Council, said after the seminar that the  U.S. may not be able to take full advantage of the tremendous  growth potential of Asia if the U.S. does not extend  Most-Favoured-Nation trading status to China.    The extension of MFN will help China get equal treatment  from  the U.S. with other members of the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade, he said.    U.S. President Bill Clinton must certify to Congress by June  3 that China is making "significant overall progress" on human  rights before deciding to extend MFN to China for a further year.    Dr Randolph said the US business community strongly supports  the extension of MFN to China.    The American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing estimates that  167,000 American high-technology jobs are linked to exports to  China.    U.S. law should be changed to completely decouple the issues  of trade and human rights, Dr Randolph said.    "I personally share the U.S. business community's view that  engagement with the Chinese and expansion of the market economy  is a more effective means of improving human rights than the  laying down of political markers," he said.    He addressed the issue of the U.S. Trade Representative's  recent suspension for six months of its formal workers' rights  review in order to give the Indonesian government time to  implement adopted labor regulations and to take future measures  in the labour field.    He said the US business community wants the U.S. Government  to continue granting GSP to Indonesia unconditionally.    Asia is becoming an interesting region for the U.S. because  of its rapid growth in terms of real trade and investment.  Asia's share of global commerce has doubled from 7.5 percent to  14 percent over the past decade.    The economic growth of countries in the region, excluding  the  U.S. and Japan, is expected to be 5.9 percent this year  according to the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council.    Asia is important to U.S. business for many reasons,  including the massive demand for infrastructure, electricity  generation, telecommunications and aircraft, particularly in  China.    Retailing has great potential because consumer spending in  Asia is expected to grow three times faster than Europe or the  U.S.    The potential for investment in China, which has now become  the world's fourth "growth pole" after Europe, North America and  Japan, is great.    The capitalisation growth of regional stock exchanges,  excluding Japan and China, is expected to be US $3.3 trillion by  2000, up 433 percent on today's level.    However, Dr Randolph pointed out that Asia faces difficult  issues including political crisis, the policies of the big  economies like the U.S. or Japan the mismanagement of the  nuclear issue in Korea, and the possible suspension of MFN  status to China.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Major General [previous two words in English] Nasr  Yusuf, commander of the Palestinian police force in Gaza, said  today that the police has no intention of clashing with the  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] military arm, 'Izz-al-Din  al-Qassam. He made the remark in response to a question on  whether the Palestinian police would prevent acts of terror by  Hamas. Nasr Yusuf added that he had reached full understanding  with the leaders of Hamas whom he met over the past several  days. Our correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports that Yusuf made  the remarks at a news conference held at the Ansar-2 detention  facility which was handed over to the Palestinians this morning.</p>

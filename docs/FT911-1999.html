			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Philadelphia SE plans cross-rate options THE PHILADELPHIA Stock Exchange plans to launch three cross-currency option contracts later this month. The contracts - D-Mark/yen, sterling/yen and sterling/D-Mark - are expected to receive Securities and Exchange Commission approval shortly, once clearing problems have been ironed out. Because they are the first non-dollar based currency options in the US, clearing and settlement process are more complicated, according to the exchange. The D-Mark/yen and sterling/yen contracts will be based and settled in yen, with contract sizes of DM1m and Pounds 500,000 respectively. The sterling/D-Mark contract is based in D-Marks, with a Pounds 500,000 contract size. 'By taking the dollar out of the equation, (our) cross-rate options allow you to hedge the currency risk you're trying to manage, without adding an extra level of risk,' said the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has delayed the launch of its futures and options on futures contracts on three cross-rates - D-Mark/sterling, D-Mark/yen, and D-Mark/French francs - which had been approved by the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The contract specifications have been re-submitted for CFTC approval to allow for changes in the settlement dates to coincide with the expiry of existing contracts. The CME decided to stick to dollar-based contracts, because they are more complementary to existing products, facilitating trading and arbitrage between contracts, an official said. The over-the-counter market in foreign exchange derivatives still dwarfs exchange-listed trading in these products. However, the declining credit-worthiness of many bank counterparties has helped edge some currency option users towards exchange-listed products. Further, the exchanges hope to benefit from increased use of currency options by investment managers. Companies, substantial users of the market to hedge cash-flows, are more likely to need specially tailored products which match particular cash-flows. Again trying to capture business from the over-the-counter market, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange is looking at the possibility of introducing longer-dated options in the most liquid contracts. The exchange is considering adding 18-month or two-year options to the current 12-month maximum. The size of the over-the-counter market is notoriously hard to estimate, but turnover is believed to be around Dollars 25bn-a-day equivalent, compared with Dollars 6bn or Dollars 7bn in exchange-traded products worldwide.</p>

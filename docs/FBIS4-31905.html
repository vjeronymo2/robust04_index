			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bratislava June 11 (CTK) -- The "temporary"  Slovak Government is preparing a sell-out of the state to the  foreign capital and therefore it is no wonder that the world is  applauding the Moravcik government while, at the same time, it  is warning Slovakia "against the bad Meciar," the pro-Meciar  daily SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA writes today.    The cabinet of Jozef Moravcik is planning to privatise the  gas and power industries without bothering about the fact that  only a rich foreign entity can gain these strategic industrial  branches which involve practically no profit risk, the paper  stresses. It adds that the government has also approved  standard-method privatisation projects for spas while it is  beyond doubt who will be given priority in the sell-out of the  natural wealth.    The author of the commentary claims that Jan Carnogursky,  Milan Knazko and other politicians "have information" that  foreign countries will not support Slovakia's integration into  the European Union if Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) wins the autumn early elections. All  of them are warning the Slovak public -- do not vote Meciar,  else Europe will not accept Slovakia.    The temporary government wants to place this country again  in  the hands of foreign lords. "Won't we become tenants in our own  country after the half a year of its rule," the paper asks.  [passage omitted]</p>

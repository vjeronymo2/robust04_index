			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND QUAKE INSURERS FEEL NO JOLT  </P> <P> Despite the devastation and destruction left by the Bay Area earthquake,  homeowners in Southern California are not rushing out to buy earthquake  insurance, industry officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> Theresa Bedoy, Allstate underwriting manager for Southern California, said her  company's local agents are only getting about "one or two" inquiries a day  about earthquake insurance.  </P> <P> "We got more calls after the (1987) Whittier quake, but that was because of the  earthquake's proximity," said Bedoy, who works out of Orange County. "We have  surveyed several of our 550 agents in Southern California. They're getting  about one or two calls a day. People don't usually call and ask for earthquake  insurance, but it's happening now."  </P> <P> Lynn Knierim, part-owner of the Hartley, Scott &amp; Knierim Insurance Agency  in San Diego, agreed that local homeowners have not shown a sudden interest in  earthquake coverage.  </P> <P> "There has been no big rush to buy earthquake insurance in San Diego. At least,  not with our company. Most people know that earthquake coverage is available to  them. The law in California says that, if you write a homeowner's policy, you  have to give the buyer the option of buying earthquake coverage, too," Knierim  said.  </P> <P> Although earthquakes are a common, and, some would say, routine, phenomenon in  California, earthquake insurance is not a popular item. One reason for that is  its high cost. In San Diego County, premiums cost $1.80 to $4 per $1,000 of  coverage, depending on the company. Earthquake premiums in San Diego County are  cheaper than in Los Angeles County, industry officials said, because the  chances of a severe temblor are greater there.  </P> <P> In fault-riddled Imperial County, premiums cost up to $12 per $1,000 of  coverage, Bedoy said. That is the highest rate in California, she added.  Deductibles on earthquake policies are usually 10%, whereas deductibles for a  regular homeowner's policy usually run from $200 to $1,000.  </P> <P> Statewide, about 1 out of every 5 homeowners have earthquake insurance, said  Debbie Rosenzweig, spokeswoman for the Western Insurance Information Service  office in Orange County. In the Bay Area, the rate is a little higher, with 1  out of every 4 homeowners having earthquake coverage. Figures for San Diego  County were not available.  </P> <P> Homeowners often assume incorrectly that they are not covered for damages  incurred during an earthquake, Bedoy said.  </P> <P> "There are some situations where a homeowner can be compensated even if he  doesn't have earthquake insurance. If your house burns down because of fires  started by a quake, you can be covered. If it's damaged by burst water pipes,  you can be covered," Bedoy said.  </P> <P> Rosenzweig said wood frame houses are cheaper to insure against earthquakes,  while brick homes are more expensive.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the day after the quake, most insurance companies imposed a  30-day moratorium in the Bay Area on the sale of earthquake policies. Jeff  Beyer, a spokesman for the Farmers Insurance home office in Los Angeles, said  his company's moratorium covers 20 counties around the Bay Area.  </P> <P> Allstate lifted its moratorium in 17 Bay Area counties Thursday morning, Bedoy  said. The company authorized its agents to begin writing new policies, but only  after physically inspecting the home or vehicle to make sure there is no  existing damage, she said.  </P></p>

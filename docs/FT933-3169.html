			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Fishing for compliments Kingfisher's passionate adoption of everyday low pricing is certainly a marketing success. The 'key DIY' initiative from B&amp;Q has put a stop to the blitzkrieg price battles of last year. Since B&amp;Q has by far the largest sites and is striving for high productivity, it is well placed to win the trench war it has started instead. Significantly, B&amp;Q increased its first half profits while Texas slipped back and Do It All's losses ballooned. Yet while it has sold the message, Kingfisher has a long way to go before it fully implements the low price philosophy. Only some 20 per cent of B&amp;Q's sales are explicitly covered by it and the company is clearly still tinkering. The jump in sales at Woolworth suggests it may have been a little too aggressive in cutting gross margins. Superdrug's poor performance shows how its weak market position makes it even more vulnerable to supermarkets than Boots, however much Superdrug hypes its promotions. The weak service element in several Kingfisher chains also needs correction, while the tardy roll-out of electronic point of sale equipment makes streamlining operations more difficult. Perhaps the arrival of Mr Alan Smith from Marks and Spencer will help. He brings experience of innovation, systems and of grinding out consistent performance gains. As Kingfisher is having most of the right ideas, however, it does not do to carp. Its strategy may slowly throttle some groups which are currently better placed. In the longer term, Kingfisher's cash generation bodes well and even the French romance with Darty may not end in tears.</p>

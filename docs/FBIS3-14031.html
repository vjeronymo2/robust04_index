			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mukhtar Hasan: "Progress Towards Kashmir's </F> Independence"]    [Text] On 5 February, the people of Pakistan will celebrate  to show their solidarity with the people of Kashmir, and will  declare their firm demand that the Kashmir issue be resolved  according to the UN resolution, by holding a plebiscite in  Jammu-Kashmir. Since 1990, this is the fifth Solidarity Day to  support Kashmir's struggle for freedom. It was started on the  appeal by Qazi Hussein Ahmed, leader of the Tehriq-i Islami.  Mian Nawaz Sharif's state government in Punjab and the Azad  Kashmir government had announced their full support for it, and  soon the Benazir government at the Center had to follow suit. As  a result, 5 February has attained the status of Kashmir's  national day. The first 5 February Day, in 1989, was in memory  of the more than 200 unarmed citizens who were killed by firing  in Indian-occupied Kashmir. This was the beginning of people's  movement against the oppressor, India.    In occupied Jammu-Kashmir, this people's defiance movement  has spread fully to 10 Muslim-majority districts out of a total  of 14. These include all of the six Muslim majority districts in  Kashmir; three of the six Muslim majority districts in Jammu;  and three districts in Laddakh, one of which is a Muslim  majority district. The three districts of Jammu--Udhampur,  Kathua, and the Buddhist majority district of Laddakh--are not  fully peaceful now. Thus, the city of Jammu itself is not free  of this movement. The same situation exists in Udhampur and Leh.  From these 14 districts, Kathua is the only one where the  mujaheddin have not made any remarkable achievement toward  freedom. District Doda in Jammu area, which is a Muslim majority  district settled on both sides of the River Chenab, is very  important because of its strategic location. It is also the  center of the movement, just like the Kashmir valley. One can  judge how serious the movement here is from the fact that during  the Indian home minister's visit to this place, freedom fighters  attacked the helicopters of oppressive India, in which the  minister went to Doda. The Indian army had a hard time  protecting its home minister.    These incidents and details explain the situation of the  movement in Jammu and Kashmir. This fact is clear to India, the  United States, which claims to be the leader of the world, and  its ally and advisor in world affairs, Great Britain. In  addition to massacres and ravages in Kashmir, they have ignored  the resolutions ordering a plebiscite and are now starting the  mischief called the "third option" in order to sabotage the  Kashmir issue, which is on the UN's annual agenda. This trick is  actually encouraging the freedom struggle. India and the United  States are looking for a way to make Amanullah Khan, who lives  in the Gilgit district of northern Kashmir, the leader of all of  Kashmir. The arrest and release of Amanullah Khan in Belgium  recently was part of a game played by India and the United  States. But Amanullah Khan's third option slogan and his own  personality do not have enough clout to attract the people of  Jammu-Kashmir toward themselves. None of the active  organizations in occupied Kashmir agree with Amanullah Khan's  "third option."    The third option is actually an Indian option because, in  the  arena of plebiscites, the Indian option has failed compared to  the Pakistan option. It has failed so badly that one cannot find  a Sheikh Abdullah or a Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed anymore. Further,  even Farooq Abdullah, who served India as his father did for  years, is nothing more than a political skeleton there. Thus,  India is controlling this region with its armed forces, and  India and its supporting world powers know that this kind of  military occupation by spreading soldiers in every lane and  village cannot be continued for many years. Therefore, these  countries--the United States of America and Great Britain--have  joined India and are trying to sabotage the freedom struggle in  Jammu and Kashmir through the third option. The idea of the  third option is so fallacious that when Amanullah Khan was  recently asked why, after struggling so long to join Kashmir  with Pakistan, he was talking about an independent Kashmir?  Could he mention even one Hindu who had fought side by side  along with the mujaheddin against the Indian army? Did the Hindu  population ever join the freedom struggle, as the Muslim  population did? In a situation when not even one Kashmiri Hindu  has joined the struggle for independence from India, how can you  establish an independent Kashmir? This third option seeks to  divide the struggle for freedom and to put Jammu and Kashmir  permanently under Indian slavery. The Muslims will be divided  and will start to fight among themselves. The old imperialist  formula of divide and rule is being labeled the third option in  Kashmir. Amanullah Khan is talking in his naivete, or perhaps he  wants to play the role of a new Sheikh Abdullah. This cannot  remain hidden for long.    An independent Kashmir is just not possible. It would just  become an imperialist base between China and the Muslim  countries of south and central Asia. But this will be an even  more artificial nation than is Israel, and it will have no  ideological, geographical, ethnic, or religious coordination.  The three regions of Kashmir, from the Sindh valley to Chalas,  from the Kashmir valley to the Jammu hills and the semi-hill  district, are all separate from each other. But each of them is  bound to Pakistan. Jammu and Kashmir can survive only by  becoming a state of Pakistan and part of Pakistan. It cannot  become a separate country, just like Sarhad or Sindh could not  because of the inner strife these areas face. Nawabzada  Nasrullah Khan, veteran leader of the Kashmir committee in the  National Assembly, recently declared the third option  unrealistic and illegal. He said, "The people of Kashmir want to  join Pakistan and Pakistan only. They are making sacrifices for  this purpose, and Pakistan is their only goal."    At this time, despite all kinds of political differences in  Pakistan, the Kashmir committee has formed a very strong  platform here. This time, the strike on 5 February and the  Solidarity Day to show support for Kashmir's freedom struggle  are being organized under the Kashmir committee. This is the  most appropriate opportunity to prepare this national platform  for its next step in order to get independence for Kashmir. This  is a good time, because there is a lot of interest in Nawabzada  Nasrullah Khan, who can help formulate and implement a national  policy on Kashmir. Further, Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan is not  suffering any delusions about the Kashmir issue.    The platform of the Kashmir committee should be made the  focal point of the concerted effort of the whole Pakistani  nation. This is a very important national issue, and it cannot  be left on the government alone, regardless of which party leads  it. In the context of this concerted effort, it is also  important that everyone contribute whatever they can to this  purpose. Madam Benazir Bhutto is trusted by the West, and her  Western connections should also be used for this purpose. The  Jamaat-i Islami has close relations with the freedom struggle in  Kashmir, and it should be part of this effort. Mian Nawaz Sharif  should spend all his energy on this goal. Other leaders of our  country should mobilize the country's people and change world  opinion at the political and diplomatic levels. They should try  to make progress in whatever way they can and, under the Kashmir  committee, make these efforts organized and powerful.    Instead of making the success of the 5 February strike a  goal  into itself, we should look forward to the goal of freedom for  Kashmir. In this context, we have to make some decisions about  this national platform among ourselves and within this country,  and some of these steps will be external and at the  international level.    The internal decisions are:    1. We must make Azad Kashmir the base camp for our freedom  struggle. We have to establish unity there that is above  political and group loyalties. It does not matter if there is  the government of one-party or national government in Azad  Kashmir; the government must be formed to reach our goals of  independence. The Azad Kashmir government should copy the  methodology employed by the mujaheddin.    2. To make the people part of the struggle for freedom, they  should be given military training in Azad Kashmir and be armed.  They should be given light weapons at the line of control so  they can protect themselves. The armed people in Azad Kashmir  will have the ability to respond to India's aggression. Only  then can Azad Kashmir be the base camp for the independence  struggle.    3. A united and potent leadership of independence movements  should be encouraged in occupied Kashmir. This leadership will  come from occupied Kashmir and not from Azad Kashmir. The  leaders of the Pakistani government should not repeat their  Afghanistan jihad mistake in Kashmir, and the formation of a  political leadership for Kashmir should start now. In this  context, one should rise above party loyalties and, at this  point, Sayyed Ali Gailani, former opposition leader, can emerge  as the sole leader in Kashmir. He should be considered the  political leader of occupied Kashmir. By rising above political  party loyalties and acting in the greater interest of Kashmir's  freedom, a political struggle should start under his leadership.  One should never even think that he is the leader of Jamaat-i  Islami of occupied Kashmir and that therefore, Pakistan's  Jamaat-i Islami will get credit. The question here is not of  getting credit, but of freeing this region, without which  Pakistan's existence cannot be protected or stabilized. When a  person from a specific party is accepted at that level, he does  not belong to that party. In our recent history of Pakistani  politics, Maulana Mufti Mehmood is the best example of this  process. We can all agree on Sayyed Ali Gailani. His sacrifices,  continuous jailing, and political background have made him the  only person in Kashmir whom everyone can trust. Now Pakistan and  Azad Kashmir are also expressing an interest in him. He can be  included in negotiations with India or with any international  group as a representative of occupied Kashmir for its freedom.  Until now, the independence movement in occupied Kashmir has  been like a chicken with its head cut off. When the time for  negotiations comes, we will need a leader, and that leader is  Sayyed Gailani.    The steps to be taken at the international level are:    1. Muslim countries, especially Iran and the Gulf countries,  must be made aware of India's expansionist designs. Pundit Nehru  decided that the goal for India was to control from east of the  Suez to the Pacific Ocean, or from Iraq to Indonesia. Every  Indian government makes this its national goal and is moving  toward this. An economic boycott of India over the Kashmir issue  will be a big blow to its expansionist designs. Not only will  the path for Kashmiri independence be paved within a few months,  but also, India would be cut down to size. In the ocean of the  Muslim world, it is the only non-Muslim country, and it cannot  continue living there like a crocodile.    2. The moral support for Kashmir's struggle for freedom does  not mean help in words only. The real moral support is the kind  the Muslim world provided during the Afghan struggle for  freedom. Kashmir is a disputed territory where India has led  aggression. The people of Kashmir, under the UN charter, had a  right to individual and group defense. This is the stand that  the government of Pakistan, through the Kashmir committee, can  publicize at the international level.    3. From human rights issues to UN resolutions, there are  many  items that can be used to change world opinion about Kashmir.  The aggressor India could be defeated at every step with these  points. It is imperative, however, that all political powers in  Pakistan promise to work closely and cooperatively.    4. Preparations must be made to present this issue at the  United Nations at the diplomatic level, and to pave the way for  establishing peace in this region through a UN resolution. The  goal should be to make sure that the international community has  no other alternative but to follow up on the resolution passed  in the Security Council.    5. The last aspect of this is that India, seeing its defeat  in Kashmir, might start a war against Pakistan. India's past  record also points to this. But India's military grasp is not  powerful enough to make such a mistake. This is not 1987, when  Pakistan was occupied in Afghanistan and the people there had  not challenged its occupation of Kashmir. Still, if India makes  this mistake, and if the Kashmir committee and the Pakistani  government make preparations inside the country and at the  international level, then India will not only be defeated badly,  but the Indian union will also come asunder like the Soviet  Union. The end of the Indian union is possible just like the end  of the Soviet Union, because both were established unfairly and  by force. After the British left, instead of making this a free  subcontinent, it has become a skeleton of nations in the form of  an Indian union. The situation is conducive to Kashmir's  freedom, and if our government leadership still sees Kashmir's  independence in the American plan, then it would be a major  blunder.

			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WONDERING WHERE WASTE WENT;  </P> <P> SUNSHINE CANYON: THE LOW TURNOUT OF TRUCKS ON THE FIRST DAY OF CUTBACKS AT THE  BRIMMING LANDFILL LEAVES ITS OPERATORS PUZZLED.  </P> <P> Where has all the garbage gone?  </P> <P> That was the question landfill operators were asking themselves Monday, the  first day that dumping at the Sunshine Canyon Landfill was scaled back 77% to  conserve space at the rapidly filling landfill. Despite the cutback, operators  of other landfills reported no appreciable increases in truck traffic at their  facilities.  </P> <P> And at Sunshine things were so quiet that operators scratched their heads and  wondered where someone might hide more than 2,000 tons of garbage.  </P> <P> Officials at Browning-Ferris Industries, which operates the landfill above  Granada Hills, said they were forced to reduce the daily dumping from about  3,000 tons to 700 tons, because Los Angeles officials recently killed a company  proposal to expand the facility.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the company is pushing a separate proposal to expand the landfill in  Los Angeles County territory.  </P> <P> Dean Wise, district manager for Browning-Ferris, had feared last week that  chaos might erupt Monday morning as haulers competed for the right to deposit  trash at Sunshine Canyon. Wise envisioned long lines outside the dump on San  Fernando Road shortly after the gates opened at 6 a.m.  </P> <P> It didn't work out that way. And Wise was at a loss to explain why.  </P> <P> Before Browning-Ferris announced the cutbacks Sept. 13, the dump typically  received about 1,000 tons of refuse by 8:30 a.m. each day. But by 9:30 a.m.  Monday, said a clearly surprised Wise, only 600 tons had been left at the  landfill.  </P> <P> Warning letters sent to the landfill's regular customers apparently worked. "I  think we scared everyone off," he said.  </P> <P> Truck traffic remained light all day, and Wise closed Sunshine Canyon shortly  before 2 p.m. after receiving 900 tons of garbage, slightly more than the 700  tons he had planned. Wise said the tonnage levels may fluctuate until his staff  adjusts to the cutbacks.  </P> <P> In previous years, Sunshine Canyon had remained open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. For  the first time, following the 2 p.m. closure, work crews posted yellow flags at  the gate and near freeway off-ramps as a sign to customers, ranging from  municipalities to private companies, that the dump was closed. BFI is routing  its own trucks to a landfill in Azusa, but its trucks account for only 8% of  the total amount of garbage dumped in Sunshine Canyon, Wise said.  </P> <P> Officials at the three landfills closest to Sunshine Canyon -- Calabasas,  Chiquita Canyon and Bradley -- said they had expected to see extra trash trucks  backed up at their facilities. But nothing unusual happened.  </P> <P> "We haven't seen anything today," said Bob Asgian, site engineer at the  Calabasas landfill.  </P> <P> "I think it is too early to tell," said Paula Becker, spokeswoman for the  Bradley Landfill in Sun Valley, of the cutbacks' impact. The Bradley Landfill,  which receives between 2,000 and 3,000 tons a day, had been prepared to accept  extra trash, she said.  </P> <P> But Becker, Asgian and other landfill officials agreed that the cutbacks at  Sunshine Canyon eventually would start a domino effect that will influence the  practices and perhaps prices of municipal and private trash haulers searching  for a place to dump their loads. Already the city of Santa Monica has diverted  some of its trash trucks from Sunshine Canyon to the other Browning-Ferris dump  in far-off Azusa.  </P> <P> County sanitation officials and landfill operators said they are cautiously  watching to see how the scaled down operations at Sunshine Canyon will affect  the industry. The uneventful turnout Monday may have been an anomaly, said  Nazareth Chabonian, owner of Blue Barrel Disposal in Santa Clarita.  </P> <P> "The trash is going somewhere," he said.  </P></p>

The party was urged to unite  with the masses and was told it has become separated from the people because of  "bureaucracy, subjectivism, formalism, passivism, corruption and other serious  phenomena," the official New China News Agency reported. Diplomats described  the statement as a return to language inspired by Chairman Mao Tse-tung during  the 1960s, when people did not dare challenge the authority of the party.  </P></p>

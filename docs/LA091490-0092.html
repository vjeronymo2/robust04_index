			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAN TO REWARD DRUG-FREE STUDENTS AROUSES CONCERN;  </P> <P> PREVENTION: ANTELOPE VALLEY 'CLUB' THAT WOULD OFFER FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO  YOUTHS FACES CRITICS WHO QUESTION ITS EFFECTIVENESS AND THREATS TO CIVIL  RIGHTS.  </P> <P> A proposal under which Antelope Valley high school students would be rewarded  financially by local businesses for taking voluntary tests showing them to be  drug free is being attacked by critics as ineffective and a threat to civil  liberties.  </P> <P> The proposed "drug-free youth" program, which has been carried out in other  states but never before in California, has gained support from Antelope Valley  political, business and educational leaders since it was suggested two weeks  ago by Billy Pricer, a minister and retired sheriff's deputy.  </P> <P> Under the plan, students with membership cards -- granted after the youths  passed random drug tests -- would be given discounts on clothing, movies, food  and other goods and services by participating merchants.  </P> <P> Pricer, who runs several anti-drug and gang programs that have received  Lancaster and Palmdale city funds, has asked the Antelope Valley Union High  School District to help sign up students and administer urine tests in the  schools. School board members will discuss the issue next week as Pricer  continues fund-raising efforts.  </P> <P> Critics said Thursday that they believe the involvement of the schools is  inappropriate and that they plan to challenge the proposal at next week's  school board meeting.  </P> <P> Opposition has come from black leaders -- who say the program could lead to  harassment of minority students who do not join -- and members of the medical  community. Some who run drug treatment programs say they regard the idea of a  "drug-free club" complete with identification cards, discounts and other  rewards as a waste of anti-drug resources.  </P> <P> "It's a superficial approach to a complex problem," said Sue Crimin,  spokeswoman for the Road to Recovery, a chemical dependency program at Antelope  Valley Hospital Medical Center. "I'd rather see the resources used for therapy  programs."  </P> <P> The Rev. Samuel Hooker, president of the Antelope Valley chapter of the  National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, said he believes students  who choose not to take part will be harassed and stigmatized. He also said the  proposal is part of a backlash against black and Latino teen-agers in a  fast-growing community alarmed by increasing gang and drug problems.  </P> <P> "It seems that this would infringe on people's rights," Hooker said. "This is  what I consider Big Brother tactics. . . . The root of this stems from some  sort of prejudice."  </P> <P> Pricer responded: "I see no basis for a statement like that. I believe it is so  fallacious and ridiculous that I would not even lend any credibility to the  comment. Drugs have no racial lines."  </P> <P> Pricer said he was inspired by the Drug Free Youth in Texas program in Smith  County, Tex., where as many as 95% of students in some schools have joined  drug-free clubs in the last three years. But some parents, students and civil  liberties groups in those communities objected, saying students who chose not  to join were unfairly stigmatized as drug users.  </P> <P> Some opponents in the Antelope Valley raise similar objections.  </P> <P> NAACP spokesman Mike Kirkland said, "We feel compelled on the behalf of the  youth in our community to oppose even the concept that this is the most  effective way to fight drug use."  </P> <P> Pricer called the criticism exasperating.  </P> <P> "It will be voluntary," he said of his proposed program. "Anybody who knows me  and has followed my track record knows what my motivations are. Who's going to  complain next, drug dealers saying their rights have been violated?"  </P></p>

Burlyay arrived in our country  during the afternoon of 22 March, and will present his  credentials at a ceremony to be held 24 March at Government  House. The ambassador will also officially submit to the  government a list of products that Russia wishes to offer  Paraguay.    Regarding cotton, he indicated that the textile could  produce  interesting results in his country, especially for Russia's  foreign trade enterprises that work with large quantities.    Burlyay also indicated that Russia wants to cooperate with  our country in the implementation of a trolley bus  transportation system, and in the oil area.    He also highlighted the fact that he had brought a list of  Russian products with him that could be offered on the  Paraguayan market, such as metallurgical equipment, machinery,  tools, presses, electric motors, industrial electrical  equipment, generators, freight elevators, highway construction  equipment (road levelers, bulldozers up to 50 hp), tractors,  agricultural machinery, automobiles, airplanes, airport  equipment, sport airplanes, watches and clocks, photographic  equipment, ammonia sulphate, and potassium chloride, among  others.    Regarding the operation for the exchange of goods, he stated  that Russia is offering fertilizer in exchange for our country's  agricultural and livestock products.    Upon presenting his credentials to the government, Burlyay  will be the first concurrent ambassador to Paraguay with his  seat in Buenos Aires (Argentina). Our fellow countryman Igor  Fleisher has been honorary Russian consul since 1993.    "I am sure that thanks to the formalization of our  relations,  cooperation between the two countries will be given an  additional push to the benefit of the peoples of the two  countries," the diplomat said.    He indicated that his naming as concurrent ambassador to  Paraguay will be the first step toward installing a resident  ambassador in our country, as is the case with Germany, France,  or Great Britain, just to cite a few European countries.    The new ambassadors from Thailand, India, and Iran, who  arrived in our country on 22 March, will also present their  credentials together with the concurrent Russian ambassador.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool There are no wool sales to test auction demand and price changes before the Easter recess gave no entirely definate lead on market direction. Most international observers seem to think that competition for available supplies will be sufficient to feep prices rising for the remainder of the season, until the end of June. Demand from China has been good this season and is believed likely to remain so for the rest of the season, helping to offset severe problems in the old Soviet Union and Eastern European areas.</p>

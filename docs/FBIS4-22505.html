			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Federation Minister of Labor </F> Gennadiy Melikyan by Galina Valyuzhenich; place and date not  given: "It Is Better To Pay Salaries In... Teapots: Back Pay  Owed in Russia Amounts To More Than 2.1 Trillion Rubles"]    [Text] Imagine this situation: On payday you do not  get your pay. (Imagined?) And the next month, too. And another  month. (Difficult?) One-third of Russia's population, however,  do not have to strain their imaginations. For them, this is  certainly not a hypothetical situation.    Interesting: What would Russian Federation Minister of  Labor Gennadiy Melikyan do if he found himself in this  situation? So we asked him this question.    [Melikyan] It all depends where I would be working. If at an  enterprise, first and foremost I would try to put pressure on  its administration. All state enterprises are now independent.    Each employee signs a labor contract with the  administration,  which specifies the terms of paying wages. So please take it  first to your own bosses. Of course, the situation is different  everywhere, but it does frequently happen that wages are not  paid, while enterprises have foreign currency accounts or own  shares of large banks. Sell them and pay your employees. They  are crying that there is no money, and the next thing you see is  the directors getting themselves foreign-made cars and even...  aircraft. Which means that some do have money. But the  management is sitting on it, trying to "make it grow." Such a  situation may be seen not only at industrial state enterprises.  Directors of science institutes or institutions of higher  learning frequently behave this way. They rent out a building,  for instance, putting the profit in a foreign currency account,  while instructors go without pay for months.    The easiest (and most lucrative) way is to direct the wrath  of discontented people toward the government. Although, of  course, its fault cannot be denied, either. Wages are not being  paid (or are partially paid) at almost 40,000 enterprises. Which  means that some mechanisms of the economic system are not  working.    [Valyuzhenich] Gennadiy Georgiyevich, labor remuneration is  guaranteed by labor laws, which so far have not been repealed.  Why is nobody held responsible for violation of the law? While  holding back pay for two or three months, does it not occur to  anyone, for instance, to index it in keeping with price rises?    [Melikyan] There is no law that says that back pay should be  indexed. For not paying wages on time, however, the managers of  some enterprises may be held responsible and even face court  action for administrative violations. We still have trouble  accepting that the court is an opportunity to resolve the  problem in a civilized way. For many people it is only a  complex, tiresome, and torturous procedure. It is so much easier  to put pressure on the government, put out pickets, organize a  strike... To tell you the truth, I even tried once to talk trade  unions into initiating one such case. Offered our experienced  lawyers. But we are too passive, friends, too passive.    [Valyuzhenich] Does it mean that those in the  budget-financed  sector, whose salaries are guaranteed by law by the state, have  a right to file a court suit against it?    [Melikyan] This is exactly the way it should be in a  law-based state. If I as a minister would be left without pay  for three months, this is probably what I would do. If the state  is at fault, it should be held responsible.    [Valyuzhenich] And who would in such a case be a respondent  in court? Perhaps Gennadiy Melikyan, the minister of labor?    [Melikyan] I think that this is the administrative  responsibility of those who are in charge of the budget. Our  ministry not only is not in charge of the budget--it does not  have any ability to influence the way it is formed. All  important decisions are discussed and made by only a small group  of people close to the prime minister and the president.    [Valyuzhenich] Are you not afraid that after this interview  is published the courts will be flooded with claims?    [Melikyan] No. We would be happy to set at least one  precedent. By the way, this would help us discover the  shortcomings in the legislation.    Still, we are trying to somehow correct the situation with  respect to wages now. But let us see first why they are actually  not being paid. Today the main obstacle is that there is no  money in enterprises' accounts. And the money is not there for a  variety of reasons. Some simply do not earn it, they are idle.  Others are not being paid for products already shipped.    Add to this the system of clearing. If some money does come  into an enterprise's account, it is automatically disbursed to  cover priority compulsory payments: taxes, contributions to  nonbudget funds (pension), and to their main suppliers--for  instance, the power generation sector. By the way, this clearing  system pushed some enterprises managers into paying wages in...  teapots, saucepans, irons, etc. If they sell these products, the  money received will immediately go to pay taxes, but you cannot  tax a teapot.    We submitted a proposal to "lock" in enterprise accounts a  certain amount of money that must be used to pay wages. We have  reached a compromise with the Ministry of Finance: Up to 50  percent of money that should go into federal taxes may (and  should!) remain at the enterprise to pay wages. This decision  has already been made.    [Valyuzhenich] On 1 March the minimum wage and the  first-category rate of the budget pay scale were supposed to be  increased. It is already the beginning of April, but there is no  change in salary.    [Melikyan] Our proposal to raise salaries was not supported.  So the minimum wage today is still 14,620 rubles [R]. There is  no money in the budget.    [Valyuzhenich] Few care that there is no money in the  budget,  People have to live on something. It is as if the state  deliberately is pushing a person to steal, drink, degrade. How  can one live on a R14,000 or even R30,000 salary today if the  subsistence minimum already exceeded R60,000 in March?    [Melikyan] Well, first, nobody lives on R14,000 in the first  place. Only about 0.4 percent of the population get the minimum  wage.    [Valyuzhenich] Are those 0.4 percent not people, too?    [Melikyan] But as a rule they have more than one job or also  get a pension. So in reality they have more than that. In  February, as a result of paying out back wages for January,  increased supplements to pensions, and a lower rate of  inflation, 16.7 percent of the population found themselves below  the subsistence minimum; overall over the entire last year 30-35  percent (about 50 million) were below the poverty level.    Generally, I have to say that statistics on our income are  very flawed. How do you count, for instance, the income of the  immense number of people who are standing everywhere selling  cigarettes, vodka, clothes... I am not saying that we live well  now. But in reality it is indeed better than in some figures of  statistical reports.    [Valyuzhenich] But this capacity for survival on the part of  the people--which, by the way, requires a lot of effort and  time--does not relieve the state of responsibility for  fulfilling its direct obligations to the population.    [Melikyan] Of course not. Now, for instance, we have serious  income differentiation. The top 20 percent of the high-income  population account for 42 percent of all income, and the bottom  20 percent--only 7 percent. In order to find the money to go,  for instance, into the impoverished budget sphere, we proposed  to introduce restrictions on the growth of the payroll fund at  those enterprises where wages are very high. This proposal has  not even been considered yet. A decision was made recently,  however, to bring in line the pay of directors of state  enterprises and joint-stock companies where the controlling  share of stock is owned by the state.    Right now they practically set their own salaries. Quite  often -- as high as they wish. Their earnings sometimes reach  R10 million or more. That is why we proposed to make their pay  commensurate with enterprise size and most importantly,  operational indicators--first and foremost net profit.    [Valyuzhenich] Still--will wages be indexed or not?    [Melikyan] They will. This is definite. It is only a  question  of timing and rate. Right now everybody is trying to exert  maximum pressure...    [Valyuzhenich] This brings to mind the analogy of a  tug-of-war. But if the rope breaks, someone inevitably falls  down.</p>

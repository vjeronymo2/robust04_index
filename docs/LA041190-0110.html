			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Heinz Will Use Recyclable Plastic Bottles: H. J. Heinz Co. said it will begin  making ketchup squeeze bottles from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which can  be recycled, rather than the existing composite of polypropylene and adhesives.  Environmentalists generally supported the move while cautioning that until  plastic recycling markets are in place, the new bottles will continue to meet  the fate of the old: burial in a landfill.  </P></p>

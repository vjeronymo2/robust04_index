			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Observer: Piers ploughman The die is cast. Clearly Alan Clark - whose sexual exploits with two women and their mother have vitalised an otherwise enervated week for the British tabloid press - will be made to wriggle awhile on the hook. For the acting editor who 'broke' - or is it brokered? - the story in The News of the World, Britain's largest circulation tabloid newspaper, youthful Piers Morgan, 29, has been promoted to full editor. Patricia (ubiquitously known as Patsy) Chapman, 45, who has been on sick leave since January, is stepping down permanently. Evidently Rupert Murdoch, who owns the paper, likes what he sees in Morgan.</p>

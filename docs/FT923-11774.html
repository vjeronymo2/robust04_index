			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / People: Grove hands over water to Pitcher Dennis Grove, chairman of North West Water, the former regional water authority which has had to implement the biggest programme of improvements in the privatised industry, is to retire next spring; he reaches 65 this month. He will be succeeded by Sir Desmond Pitcher, the current NWW deputy chairman who has recently announced his intention to step down as group chief executive of the Littlewoods pools and retailing group. Grove, chairman and chief executive of Sonoco Europe and a vice president of Sonoco International before he became chairman of NWW in 1985, says that the company will soon be half way through its massive Pounds 5bn capital spending programme, and that it is a good time to hand the challenge on to someone who could take it through to completion. 'Sir Desmond is widely experienced in the north west, nationally and internationally, and is ideally qualified for the job; his business background has given him the closest practical knowledge of new technology. As an added bonus he has an intimate knowledge of and commitment to the north west of England,' Grove says. Sir Desmond, who will become non-executive vice chairman of Littlewoods when he ceases to be chief executive next March after 10 years in the job, said it was time for him to take a different role. 'What could be a more natural move than to an organisation which is doing more than any other to improve the environment of north west England?'</p>

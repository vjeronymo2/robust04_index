			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / McAlpine in row on power station SIR ROBERT McAlpine and Sons has been taking legal advice on a dispute with the Hong Kong family that took over the mortgage of Battersea Power Station from Battersea Leisure. The construction company, which has a Pounds 20m debt on the site, found that its contractors were locked out of the area yesterday and refused access to their office and machinery. Mr Simon Broackes, McAlpine's group property and special projects manager, said: 'We have very large quantities of material on the site which belong to us. We have been in discussions with the solicitors all morning. There is a separate question of whether their (the family's) title is valid.' The Hwang family of Hong Kong, which holds the site as mortgagee through its Park View company, had hoped to achieve the takeover through a voluntary arrangement with secured creditors of Mr John Broome's Battersea Leisure, which owned the site. Wandsworth council accepted 1p in the pound on its Pounds 300,000 debt on the site but McAlpine refused a similar offer. The family said it was not aware of doubts on the title. McAlpine would be able to take away its plant if it produced a schedule of what it owned.</p>

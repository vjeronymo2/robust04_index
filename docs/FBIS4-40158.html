			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Sergey Dorenko; from the "Vesti" </F> newscast]    [Text] [Russian Foreign] Minister Kozyrev said today that  to unilaterally lift the embargo on arms deliveries to Bosnia  could lead to a world war. Previously, only Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy had made such a gloomy forecast about the Yugoslav  crisis.    Kozyrev's sharp statement was prompted by the fact that only  President Clinton's possible veto separates the United States  from lifting the embargo on arms deliveries to the Bosnian  Muslims. The [U.S.] Congress and Senate have already voted to  lift the embargo. If Minister Kozyrev obviously fears that the  U.S. gesture may provoke a reciprocal decision from Russian  legislators, his guest today -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan  Karadzic -- evidently expects just such a response from Russia.    [Begin recording] [Karadzic] There is no embargo [for the  Muslims], they receive weapons every day, very good new weapons,  and sometimes I think it might be better for the Serbs if  America lifted the embargo on weapons because other countries  might lift the embargo against the Serbs.    [Dorenko] Can you name specific channels?    [Karadzic] They have been receiving them by parachute drops;  they have been receiving them from Croatian territory, and some  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] elements are also working with  the Muslims. I cannot say that there are high-level orders, but  the field commands make unlawful deals with the Muslims and they  get some very good weapons and if they did not have them, the  war would be over in several months. [end recording]    [Dorenko] I met with Radovan Karadzic in the Yugoslav  ambassador's residence after he returned from a meeting with  Kozyrev. Russia is insisting on a new meeting of the foreign  ministers of countries interested in the Yugoslav events in  order to advance a new plan for dividing up Bosnia. This plan  is supported reluctantly today, even by the Bosnian Serbs, among  others.    [Begin Karadzic recording] We have 64 percent of our  territory, we now control 73 percent, and it would be very  painful for us to agree to 49 percent. [sentence as heard] But  if we get good quality territory, perhaps, we could discuss  this. We shall see how things go in Geneva. [end recording]    [Dorenko] Karadzic is afraid that the least valuable  territories will be palmed off on him. At tomorrow's meeting in  London with his Western counterparts, Vitaliy Churkin, among  others, will decide what lands should be given and to whom.    Vitaliy Churkin is once again playing the role of diplomatic  ambulance. He did not find time, however, to receive Radovan  Karadzic after their latest quarrel, when Churkin accused the  Bosnian Serb leaders of treachery.    [Begin recording] [Dorenko] Are you still on bad terms with  Churkin?    [Karadzic] No, I do not think we are on bad terms. The thing  is that when dealing with the Gorazde crisis we failed to agree  on one point, but we achieved great successes since we managed  to solve the crisis around Sarajevo. And for this we are  grateful to Churkin, who brought a letter from President  Yeltsin. This was a real solution to the crisis. I think we  will work very successfully with Mr. Churkin in the future, too.  We are not enemies. We are friends; we understand him.  Working together, one can quarrel only with a friend, not with  an enemy. [end recording]    [Dorenko] Karadzic hoped to meet the president, but he is in  Blagoveshchensk. He still counts on a meeting with [Prime  Minister] Chernomyrdin, but it is uncertain if Chernomyrdin can  deal with Serb affairs after his recent kidney stone operation,  especially considering the fact that this time Karadzic came as  a private individual at the invitation of Yuriy Bondarev  [chairman of the Russian Writers' Union]. As always he speaks a  lot about his affection for the Russian Government, but can be  seen most often in the company of the Russian opposition.    [Begin recording] [Dorenko] Are you not afraid that your  contacts with the opposition here may compromise you in the eyes  of the Kremlin?    [Karadzic] Each Russian is very important to us. First of  all, we are working with the government and we are very grateful  to the government, but I believe that this is one and the same  thing, it is Russia, Russian people. [end recording]    [Dorenko] One of the reasons Karadzic came to Moscow was to  receive a literary prize for his poetry from the Writers' Union,  and not from the Writers' Union which is for democrats but from  the one which is its opposite. In addition to Karadzic, prizes  will be given to the chairman of the prize commission, his  deputy, and a member of the board.    Meanwhile, it is not only the future of Karadzic but, to  even  greater degree, of the Moscow authorities that is being decided  in Washington today. If the U.S. Administration, despite the UN  and Moscow, permits the airdrop of weapons to the Muslims, we  shall be able to see how big an American pill Moscow can swallow  without taking active anti-American actions. Only a little time  ago it seemed that the most difficult thing in the Yugoslav  question was pacifying Karadzic and the Bosnian Serbs and now  here is the outcome: They are pacified, and the main danger for  Moscow's position comes from Washington.    All the best to you.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Tobacco advert curbs to be unveiled The health department is expected to announce soon that voluntary controls on tobacco advertising are to be tightened following discussions with the industry. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, launched a fresh round of talks with cigarette companies in December after concern grew that parliament might impose an advertising ban. The voluntary controls are believed to include a ban on poster advertising, tight controls on advertising in women's magazines, an end to shop-front advertising and bigger health warnings on cigarette packets. The talks followed an announcement that Mr Kevin Barron, Labour MP for Rother Valley, intended to introduce a private members' bill banning all cigarette, cigar and pipe tobacco advertising except at the point of sale. Mr Barron, who won third place in a backbench Commons ballot for the right to introduce legislation, claimed the support of more than 200 MPs of all parties, giving his bill a chance of becoming law. The government could probably have found procedural ways of killing the bill, but would prefer to be able to demonstrate to MPs that tougher voluntary restraints are on the way. The government is firmly opposed to legislative controls on tobacco advertising, which ministers believe are less effective than voluntary curbs. About Pounds 60m is spent annually by the industry on advertising.</p>

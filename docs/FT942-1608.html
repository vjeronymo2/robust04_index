			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Wagon slips less than expected to Pounds 15.6m Pre-tax profits at Wagon Industrial Holdings last year declined less than the materials handling, engineering and automotive products group had predicted as productivity rose and trading conditions improved in the UK and continental Europe. In the 12 months to March 31, pre-tax profits were Pounds 15.6m, against Pounds 18.1m. The group last June warned that its results would be similar to those of the previous year before meeting restructuring costs of Pounds 3m at Forkhardt, its German power chuck subsidiary. Although earnings per share dipped from 29p to 19.58p, the dividend is slightly increased and only just covered; the final is 11.5p, making a total of 17.825p (17.308p). Wagon would like to have the dividend twice covered by the end of the next financial year. That implies an increase in profits over two years of 33 per cent. There has been a strong start to this year, reported Mr John Hudson, chief executive. Trading conditions started to improve last year. 'The important thing was an acceleration of the improvement towards the end of the year, which is exactly the opposite of the previous year,' he said. Turnover was Pounds 279.9m, of which Pounds 9.07m came from acquisitions, against Pounds 247.6m. But operating profits, largely because of Forkhardt, fell from Pounds 16.5m to Pounds 14.7m. In the automotive division, where recently Wagon has been concentrating its expansion, operating profits fell while turnover increased. This reflected a tailing-off of profits in France. But, said Mr Hudson, 'we see the automotive division being our strongest division this year'. COMMENT Wagon rode the UK recession with aplomb. Everything it might have done it did: kept cash in the bank, reorganised management, raised productivity, made acquisitions to build up market position. It was Europe which made it look more ordinary: takeover of Polypal in Belgium only to see the markets tumble, capacity at Forkhardt far too high for reduced demand. Last year it grasped the European nettles. Manufacturing sites for materials handling equipment have been concentrated and Forkhardt is back in profit, albeit small. With its European markets starting to bounce back and demand in the UK rising, recovery should be swift enough to justify the company broker's prediction of Pounds 22m pre-tax and earnings per share of 30.8p for the current year. On a price, up 3p yesterday, of 479p, that would put the shares on an unchallenging prospective multiple of 15.5.</p>

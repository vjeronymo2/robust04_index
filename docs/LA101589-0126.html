			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION: IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> IOWA;  </P> <P> MORE PARTS FROM JET FOUND IN CORN FIELDS  </P> <P> About 100 people, many of them using metal detectors, combed corn and bean  fields in northwest Iowa and found more missing pieces of United Airlines  Flight 232, the jet that crash-landed in Sioux City in July. The search was  organized by General Electric Co., which manufactured a jet engine suspected of  exploding and damaging the DC-10's hydraulic lines, causing the flight crew to  lose almost all control of the aircraft. A number of small pieces of the jet  engine were found. Janice Sorenson earlier in the week was given a $116,000  reward by General Electric for finding a titanium engine disk.  </P></p>

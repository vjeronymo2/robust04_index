			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Have a prawn, mate HAVE YOU ever met Rupert Murdoch? If you haven't, you can take it from me that what they say about him is true - that to your face he can be charming and bashful, almost boyish, even though his skin is now cracked by age and his voice has turned raspy. It is only after he has left that it dawns on you that what he really wanted to do was reach for you like a Cape York croc and rip your head off. I met him again this week, for he summoned me to the Savoy and fed me prawn sandwiches. The purpose of the interview was to establish whether I was suitable to fill the new Rupert Murdoch chair of language and communications at Oxford University. News International has contributed Pounds 3m to create the chair, and the name of the first professor is expected soon. 'Now then, mate,' said the aged proprietor. 'Let's start with a vocabulary test. Nothing snooty-nosed. Plain and simple language, that's what I like to hear. What is rocking-horse manure?' 'Rocking-horse manure,' I said, 'is a term for any non-existent commodity. It's what they found in Robert Maxwell's pension funds after he was gone.' 'Jolly good,' beamed the famed proprietor. 'Ratbag?' 'A foolish person.' 'Pie-eater?' 'Person of no importance.' 'Possie?' 'Position or place, as in 'Not a bad possie, eh mate?'' 'Bull's wool?' 'A tall tale.' 'Whacko,' said the dreaded proprietor. 'Now give me a few examples of similes in general use. Nothing elitist, mind.' I smiled winsomely. 'Dressed like a pox doctor's clerk,' I said. 'Awkward as a Chow on a bike. Lousy as a bandicoot. Mad as a meat-axe. As game as Ned Kelly.' 'Ripper,' said the awesome proprietor. 'Now tell me this: who is Clive Soley, and why do I loathe him?' 'Clive Soley,' I replied, 'is a Labour party housing spokesman. He is absolutely troppo (one who acts as if mentally disturbed). He is introducing a private member's bill in the House of Commons which seeks to compel newspaper editors to balance news stories by giving at least two sides of an argument. 'More proof of his madness is that he wants to limit how many newspapers a proprietor can control, as well as how much satellite and terrestrial television he can own. 'According to this dingbat: 'It is not good enough, in a monopolistic situation, to run opinions as news stories without balancing them with other opinions.' Clive Soley is sinister and dangerous. The full might of the media must be directed at hounding him from public life.' Rupert Murdoch roared with laughter and clapped his hands. His chin was stained with prawn juice. 'And who,' he asked playfully, 'is David R Jones?' I was now suffused with confidence. Good old Rupe, I thought, he's bowling me easy balls. I frowned with appropriate gravitas. 'David R Jones,' I said, 'is another sinister and dangerous man. He is deputy managing editor of The New York Times. 'Recently, discussing trends in the US press, he said that too many US newspapers 'have refused to take less return on their investment. They are not prepared to invest in their future.' 'A year ago, said Jones, The New York Times had spent Dollars 5m expanding its sports coverage in the midst of a recession. 'I cannot point,' he said, 'to one extra reader or advertiser that we got out of it, but we knew we had to do it to keep improving the newspaper. Unless you spend more, and accept that you'll take less profit, you give the opposition a chance to do you down . . .'' We sat there, Rupe and I, as stunned as mullets; ashen were our faces. Finally, the feared proprietor cleared his throat. 'Just two more questions,' he said weakly. 'What do you think of the Queen?' 'Ripper,' I said. 'The police?' 'Ripper.' 'Whacko,' said Rupert Murdoch. 'You are a most impressive young man. My people will be in touch.' And then he swirled away, just like a Queensland croc, leaving me immobilised by a black, implacable terror.</p>

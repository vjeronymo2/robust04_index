			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Helping Somalia AS SOMALIS continue to die in their thousands and their country descends ever deeper into chaos, leading United Nations members are properly considering how they might intervene to ease the suffering. The need for action to improve the effectiveness of relief efforts is pressing. Nevertheless, the UN needs to tread carefully, both in determining the form of short-term intervention and in defining its long-term objectives. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, has made the gravity of the situation clear. In a letter to the Security Council last week he said that attacks, looting and harassment by warlords meant 'the humanitarian assistance which reaches its intended beneficiaries is often barely more than a trickle'. The world needs to ensure that shipments of food are protected, convoys escorted and distribution centres guarded so that supplies reach the needy. The existing UN force of 650 troops is clearly inadequate; and even at its projected strength of 4,200 it will be unable to guarantee delivery. That may change if the UN accepts Washington's offer of up to 30,000 troops to support such an exercise, a response to growing public anguish. But the public must also be prepared to accept the consequences of a 'fight to feed' policy. The two warlords who control the capital, Mogadishu, appear prepared to accept intervention. It may be a different matter, however, when their followers find themselves prevented from making an easy living out of extortion. Resistance by rag-tag armies might soon be broken, but the public must realise that US soldiers may have to kill teenagers to keep the aid flowing. Also to be considered are the objections of several leading aid organisations in Somalia. They oppose intervention, arguing that aid workers may themselves number among the casualties, or run the risk of becoming hostages. Nor is military intervention on its own likely to provide Somalia with more than temporary relief. Success would be short-lived if the task force then withdrew, leaving Somalia to its fate. The economy is shattered, social structures in ruins, the administration non-existent. Mr Boutros Ghali must make clear that intervention can only be the first step in a broader political and economic reconstruction of the country. At the outset, that is bound to place a heavy responsibility on outside powers. The logic of the aid effort points to the UN being forced to assume some form of trusteeship for Somalia. Just as important, the Somalis themselves will need to be consulted. A conference outside the country under UN auspices would provide a forum at which prominent Somalis could debate their future and assist in the transition. Deeper military intervention in Somalia is likely to be risky, but it is a risk worth taking - provided the UN simultaneously takes political and economic action to help the country towards a more stable future.</p>

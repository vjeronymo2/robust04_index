			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 1 (KNS-KCNA) -- Han Tok-su, chairman of  the Central Standing Committee of the General Association of  Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), supported the appeal  published by the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for  the Reunification of the Fatherland [DFRF] as regards the  exposure of the Korean peninsula and the Korean nation to the  grave danger of nuclear war caused by the criminal acts of the  U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique.    The appeal dated March 29 called on the Koreans in the  North,  South and overseas to turn out in the struggle to remove the  danger of nuclear war and pave the way for peace and  reunification of the country.    Han Tok-su in a statement March 31 said if the nuclear war  provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean  puppet clique are tolerated, the whole territory of Korea will  be laid waste and the Korean nation with a long history of five  thousand years will suffer an irrevocable nuclear disaster in  the present era.    He urged the Japanese authorities to refrain from joining in  the war provocation moves of the United States and the  anti-national acts of the South Korean authorities, renounce the  hostile policy toward the DPRK and immediately give up the  repressive scheme against Chongnyon and the Koreans in Japan.    He called on the compatriots under the influence of the "ROK  Residents Association in Japan" to reject the treacherous forces  and outside forces and join Chongnyon on the patriotic road,  irrespective of ism and affiliation.    "We will firmly unite with the compatriots in the North,  South and overseas under the banner of `10-point programme of  the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the  country', a great charter of national unity, and more vigorously  fight to remove the danger of war and pave the way for peace and  reunification of the country," Han Tok-su stated.</p>

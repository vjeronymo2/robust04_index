			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Hungary devalues forint HUNGARY yesterday devalued the forint by 3 per cent and raised a key interest rate by 3 percentage points. The currency is linked to a basket divided equally between the dollar and the Ecu, and the central bank passed off the devaluation as a 'technical step' in response to the dollar's rise against European currencies. This devaluation follows one of 1.9 per cent last month, adding to speculation that the exchange rate policy is softening. Pressure for a fundamental shift has been growing as Hungarian exports have fallen and the external trade balance deteriorated. Exports in the first four months were down 27.2 per cent compared with a year earlier, depressed by recession in Hungary's main markets of Germany and Austria. The current account deficit amounted to Dollars 423m (Pounds 282m) for the first two months, leading some analysts to estimate that the shortfall for the year could be as high as Dollars 2bn, about 8 per cent of gross domestic product. The central bank is financing the deficit with a record spree on international capital markets. Yesterday it announced two more bond issues - a five-year Y50bn (Pounds 307m) bond in Tokyo and a Pounds 100m bond in London. The bank's borrowings so far this year total Dollars 2.7bn. Recent bond issues have sold relatively well, despite the external balance deterioration.</p>

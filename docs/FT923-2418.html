			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / France and Maastricht: Mitterrand faces more speculation FRENCH President Francois Mitterrand yesterday left hospital after surgery on a cancerous prostate gland to face a fresh wave of speculation over his future. The president's doctors, announcing the discovery of cancerous tissue, reassured the public that prostate cancer is not dangerous in men of 75-year-old Mr Mitterrand's vintage. Business will be as normal, stressed his government. 'The president of the republic will exercise his functions to the full,' said Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, who yesterday chaired the weekly cabinet meeting in Mr Mitterrand's absence. Even so, all this has refuelled speculation that France is heading for political upheaval, irrespective of the outcome of Sunday's vote on European monetary and political union. Times have moved on since Mr Georges Clemenceau's quip that the French presidency was as superfluous as the prostate gland. Physically, Mr Mitterrand will be able to go on much as before, according to medical reports. The president will spend the next few days convalescing before returning to work as normal next week. Politically, Mr Mitterrand's choices are much the same as they were before his operation. They hinge on the outcome of Sunday's vote, which was as unclear as ever yesterday. The all-embracing powers accorded to the presidency under the fifth republic mean that he alone has the power to decide whether or not to stay, the timing of his departure and whether or not to call an early general election. On this subject Mr Mitterrand has revealed nothing since his September 3 television appearance, when he was characteristically enigmatic about his future. Then, he said he would 'take the responsibilities which fall to me' a day or so after the result was known. Broadly, he faces the following options. In the event of the narrow Yes indicated by opinion polls, he could either continue until his term runs out in spring 1995, or retire at a convenient earlier date. The official line is that he will stay to the end of his mandate. Yet Mr Mitterrand is said to be weighing with his close advisers the pros and cons of early retirement. An opportune moment would be in the next few months, in time to hold a presidential election before the March 1993 parliamentary election. This would give the Socialists a chance to field a winning presidential candidate against a weak and divided opposition, reducing the Socialists' chances of losing the parliamentary election. A No on Sunday night would obviously be a serious blow to Mr Mitterrand's national and international credibility and that of his administration. His resignation and dissolution of the government might seem the only option if the gamble fails. Yet Mr Mitterrand could still hold on to power after a No vote. He would be helped by the fact that the opposition's credibility would be equally damaged, since the right-wing RPR and centre-right UDF leadership are both pro-Maastricht. At worst, the Socialist government might face a censure motion in the National Assembly after parliament reconvenes on October 1. But it has survived 15 censure motions since the last general election three years ago. However, come the general election the electorate would make the Socialist government pay heavily. Mr Mitterrand could distract attention from a Maastricht debacle by calling another referendum, as he once said he would, on reducing the seven-year presidential mandate. But that would be another gamble. Yet Mr Mitterrand knows that even if Sunday's result shows he has walked into his own trap, he has not run out of stratagems yet.</p>

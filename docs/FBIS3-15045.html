This Is Only the Beginning...."]    [Text] In a democratic system you get surprises. One such  surprise was the appearance of the State Duma's decision about  the amnesty. Stories as to how this came about have been  weighed up but it is impossible to weigh up everything,  especially as this did lie in the power of those participating  in the analysis. This is how the president's representative in  the Federal Assembly A.M. Yakovlev evasively explained the  release of the October mutiny's instigators and the pardoning of  the members of the State Committee for the State of Emergency in  accordance with the State Duma amnesty. He, together with his  colleagues from the Russian Federation president's entourage Yu.  Baturin and G. Satarov, held a briefing 28 February at the  Kremlin, which was almost entirely devoted to an analysis of the  situation which has developed over the State Duma's decree on  the amnesty.    A.M. Yakovlev drew journalists' attention to the  legislation's flaws which, according to him, were the reason for  the presidential team's insufficiently clear and coordinated  actions in response to the State Duma's decree on the amnesty.  Apart from this, information was received claiming that work  was in progress in the State Duma's apparatus with a view to  amending the decree's text, and this factor was not taken into  consideration. Moreover, a letter from General Prosecutor A.  Kazannik was sent to the State Duma. It contained six basic  points which essentially were aimed at removing the bias of the  decree on the amnesty. Here, G. Satarov expressed himself more  categorically: According to him it is actually the  inconsistency in the stance of the Prosecutor's Office which has  been a key element in this whole story.    The general prosecutor sends a letter to the State Duma  saying that its decree on the amnesty violates Russian  legislation, and then, with unprecedented speed for this  department, adopts a decision about releasing this group of  well-known people from custody.    G. Satarov was asked a question about the accuracy of  reports  that M. Gorbachev entertains the possibility that the document  was submitted for President B. Yeltsin's preliminary approval.  G. Satarov replied: "This issue could not have been submitted  for the president's approval, which I. Rybkin confirmed in  conversation with me 26 February."    Nevertheless, the briefing's participants assured us that  they had expected such a turn of events, though they did not  produce any arguments backing up what they said. According to  Satarov, the president has planned corresponding actions  concerning the defense of human rights which will be announced  in the near future.    The journalists regarded the report that Federal  Counterintelligence Service Director N. Golushko had been  dismissed from his post (the president signed the relevant edict  28 February) as a sensation.</p>

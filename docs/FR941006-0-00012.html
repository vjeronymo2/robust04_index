			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rule proposed that for State agencies that serve migrants, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of the grant be designated for service to the migrant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population. The designated amount would be based on prior year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> migrant participation reported by each State agency. By  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designating a target funding level, the migrant grant will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distort subsequent grant allocations, yet will establish service to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this needy population as a priority. This is an approach similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the one employed to target expenditures for breastfeeding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promotion and support.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department believes that State agencies must estimate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodate such changes according to the information available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from State and local sources. Therefore, it was proposed that, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> planning purposes, expenditure targets would be established for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both food grants and nutrition services and administration grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to insure that 9/10 of one percent of the appropriation is  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> for service to migrants. State agencies would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to plan for migrant participants as now required in their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State Plan of Operation and give priority service to migrant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participants that arrive from another State agency seeking WIC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of the commenters supported this provision. However, two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters thought the proposed change was unclear and implied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional reporting requirements. In addition, it was suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the methodology to be used be clarified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is not imposing any additional reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements regarding migrant participants. State agencies will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to report migrant participation as in past years. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of clarity, the Department has deleted the last sentence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in section 246.16(c)(3)(iv) of the proposed regulation which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> erroneously implied that migrant funds would be deducted from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agency's stability allocation. Since this was not the intent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the regulation, this language was removed for clarification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The remainder of section 246.16(c)(3)(iv), which designates a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> migrant service expenditure target, is adopted final as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Section 246.16(c)(3)(ii) Allocation of residual funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the current rule, any funds remaining after stability grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are allocated are ``residual funds''. Residual funds are allocated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under two components_``targeting'' and ``growth''. The Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed eliminating the targeting component and modifying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> growth component as discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> ``Targeting'' Component for Food Funds (Section 246.16(c)(3)(ii)(A))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As explained in detail in the preamble, the targeting component is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no longer needed to encourage service to Priority I participants,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and is a barrier to achieving funding equity among State agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Department proposed the elimination of the targeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component to simplify the formula, and ensure greater funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equity based on each State agency's eligible population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All of the commenters on this provision supported it, and the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule retains the provision that would eliminate targeting as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration in funds allocation. However, five commenters stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that they would oppose the provision unless all States were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guaranteed prior year funding levels plus full inflation if funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are available. In the event that funds are insufficient, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters wanted a prorata reduction for all States. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns were addressed above in the discussion of the stability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation (Section 246.16(c)(3)(ii)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> ``Growth'' Component for Food Funds (Section 246.16(c)(3)(ii)(B))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the current formula, after targeting funds are allocated, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remaining half of residual funds are allocated for ``growth'' within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agencies that have less opportunity to serve their eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population compared to other State agencies. Growth funds are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocated based primarily on a ``fair share'' concept similar to that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed earlier. To determine fair share funding, FNS used a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mathematical equation to create an estimate of each State's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible WIC population. The estimate began with each State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's number of income eligibles, currently extracted from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decennial census data. The estimate is adjusted slightly to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account for State agency variations in infant mortality and low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> birth weight rates (``health indicators''). Also, women, infants and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children served by the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are subtracted from this estimate for those States in which CSFP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As explained below, the Department proposed retaining the ``growth''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component of the formula using only the estimate of income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibles (with some adjustments) and deleting the use of health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicators. It was believed that this best defines each State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's actual need for program funds and greatly simplifies the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``fair share'' equation. Each component and revision of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibles database for the fair share allocation provided in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 246.16(c)(3)(ii) is discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATVIANS RALLY OVER LANGUAGE ISSUE  </P> <P> About 250,000 Latvians rallied Sunday in the Soviet republic's capital of Riga  to press for official recognition of the Latvian language and voice support for  political and economic reforms, organizers said.  </P> <P> Sarmite Elerte, head of information for Latvia's Popular Front organization,  said speakers at the rally backed proposed legislation that would entrench the  Latvian language in day-to-day affairs.  </P> <P> Many carried the red and white national flag of the Baltic republic and  placards supporting Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of economic  reforms.  </P> <P> "Never before have I seen so many of our flags in public," Elerte said by  telephone from Riga. "People wanted to show their support for our language.  They also wanted to say that democratization cannot be stopped in Latvia."  </P> <P> Elerte said that although the language law has raised tension recently in the  republic, there have been no incidents.  </P> <P> Some participants, she said, carried posters lampooning Interfront, a group  representing mainly Russian speakers which has opposed the new language law in  Latvia.  </P> <P> Interfront, in an open letter to a Latvian newspaper last week, denounced the  planned legislation, saying it incurred needless costs and ignored the rights  of what it said was a majority of non-Latvians in the republic.  </P> <P> According to 1979 figures, Latvians make up 53% of the republic's population  after mass immigration of Russians in recent years.  </P></p>

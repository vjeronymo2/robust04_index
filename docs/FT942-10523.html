			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: Advisers seek higher offer for Kemper Advisers to Kemper, the US investment group, were contacting other possible bidders for the company yesterday in an attempt to elicit a higher price than the Dollars 60 a share offered by GE Capital. Kemper's board bowed over the weekend to pressure from GE Capital to agree a sale, after the financial services arm of General Electric raised its bid from Dollars 55 a share. 'We are hoping that we will get more than Dollars 60 a share - possibly much more,' the company said. It added that it had received 'several approaches' from potential bidders after GE Capital first announced in March its interest in acquiring the company, though it was premature to judge whether any of these companies would make a formal bid. In a sign that few stock traders think the investment group will attract a higher offer, however, Kemper's share price failed to rise above Dollars 60 yesterday. It reached GE's bid level in the morning, before closing at Dollars 59 1/8 , a gain on the day of Dollars 1 5/8 . The mix of Kemper's business, and the fact that GE Capital has offered Dollars 2.4bn in cash, has left many traders convinced that the GE financial services arm will win control. Kemper's prize assets are its life insurance business and its mutual funds, but its Dollars 1.7bn property portfolio and a struggling stockbroking network make it unattractive to many financial groups, which are still shaking off the effects of the late-1980s property crash. Travelers, the financial services group headed by Mr Sanford Weill, has been seen as the most likely rival bidder. Mr Weill recently said he foresaw further consolidation among US insurance and fund management groups, and did not rule out Travelers out as a buyer. However, the company is still digesting two big acquisitions made recently - Shearson, the retail broker, and the shares it did not already own in Travelers insurance. See Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Airtours expected to raise bid for Owners AIRTOURS IS today expected to increase the terms of its hostile all-share bid for rival holiday group, Owners Abroad, to 135p a share, 20p higher than the market price at Friday's close. The new bid will value Owners Abroad at about Pounds 270m, up from Pounds 225m. The new terms are likely to involve Airtours raising its three-for-eight share offer to 15 of its own shares for 24 Owners Abroad shares. Airtours is not, however, expected to increase the partial cash alternative unless the Owners Abroad board recommends the bid. Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad chairman, and Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, met last Wednesday - as did their advisers on Friday - but failed to agree terms for a recommended bid. Airtours is understood to believe its target is holding out for too high a price. Owners Abroad's advisers say its rival has failed to appreciate the value of the proposed tie-up with Thomas Cook, the travel agents and financial services company controlled by the German state bank, Westdeutsche Landesbank. On Friday Owners Abroad posted its last defence document to shareholders. This followed the decision by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, not to refer Airtours' bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Airtours must post its last document including any substantial new information to Owners Abroad shareholders by this Friday.</p>

The opening was attended not only by Commander in Chief  Fidel  Castro, but by leaders of the continental coordinating  committee; [Communist Party of Cuba] Politburo members Jose  Ramon Balaguer, Pedro Ross, and Abel Prieto; and other leaders  from Cuban mass and political institutions.    Over 1,100 delegates from all over the region are attending  this meeting, including, for the first time, the Caribbean,  Central America, the United States, and Canada.    As a sign of solidarity and support for this forum of the  social and people's organizations of our America, greetings from  various prominent regional figures and from regional workers and  peasants movements were received at the plenary session.    Solidarity With Cuba: the Great American Task [source's  subhead] We love Cuba because it is the star of dignity, the  star that lights the way for the men of America; and that is why  we are calling for continental unity and organization to support  it and to hold imperialism in check. With those words, an  Ecuadoran representative to this fourth Camilo Restrepo meeting  [name of meeting as heard] opened today's forum session at the  Convention Center. The forum ends next Friday, 28 January.    For his part, Brazilian senator Amir Lando called for unity,  with a view to promoting a new international order, the basic  premise of which would be solidarity among men, or else, Lando  pointed out, the human race will watch itself become extinct.    For Cuba, Jose Ramon Balaguer reported at this meeting on  the  Cuban people's ability to come out ahead, and stressed that an  important sociopolitical process is in gestation in Latin  America today.</p>

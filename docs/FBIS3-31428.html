			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, leader of the Alliance </F> of Free Democrats, SZDSZ, by correspondent Jozsef Barat in  Budapest; date not given; from the "Foreign Political Observer"  program -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Barat] [passage omitted] Where is consensus in  Hungarian foreign policy, and where is there not consensus? How  does the SZDSZ think we should represent our often-mentioned  national interests in a different, more effective way?    [Szent-Ivanyi] [passage omitted] There are a few important  areas where consensus among political parties has fractured --  primarily between the government and the opposition and the  government and the SZDSZ. The most important is Hungary's  foreign policy with its neighbors. In this field, we think that  the Hungarian Government's policy has not achieved its aim. It  could not effectively contribute to the improvement of the  situation of Hungarians beyond the borders, while our relations  with several neighbors have significantly deteriorated--which  has served neither Hungary's interests nor the interests of  Hungarians who live there.    Therefore, we have been proposing for more than a year to  put  this policy with our neighbors on a new basis, to reestablish  balance between the protection of minority rights, the support  of minorities, and bilateral ties. This is a point where  revival is needed by all means.    We could not entirely agree with the government's security  policy endeavors either. Fundamentally, of course, we agree  that Hungary needs security, and it has to be found somewhere  within the existing European structures. It has not been  debated. However, the government has strongly concentrated on  the acquisition of external guarantees. It would not have been  wrong on its own, if they had managed to acquire these external  guarantees--for example, NATO membership or a guarantee  undertaken by NATO. It would have really contributed to  Hungary's security.    Unfortunately, it was clear that NATO, the leading European  countries, and the United States are not ready to give these  guarantees. So it follows that we have to reconsider our  security policy and lay emphasis on new elements--for example,  in Hungary's foreign policy conduct, in our relations with  neighboring countries, in Hungary's economic integration with  European institutions and with European countries.    A rather strange debate has evolved about NATO membership.  Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky said that all those who want  Hungary to be a NATO member should vote for the MDF [Hungarian  Democratic Forum]. Gyula Horn, chairman of the socialists wants  a referendum on the matter. In the meantime, it has became  quite clear the NATO does not want to admit us at all.    [Szent-Ivanyi] As regards Jeszenszky's remark, I cannot  consider it anything else but a campaign trick. [passage omitted]    Horn's opinion could be worth considering, but we are very  far from a referendum for the time being. It would be  ridiculous to hold a referendum about Hungary's joining NATO  when NATO has no willingness to accept us. [passage omitted]    [Barat] In your view, what sort of policy should be followed  in connection with NATO's role in Bosnia?    [Szent-Ivanyi] The truth is that Hungarian foreign policy  has  no clear line in this issue, and this confuses our partners.  Earlier on, the Hungarian Government very resolutely took the  position of urging strong intervention and tough sanctions. I  think that this was a slightly stronger position than we should  have adopted considering our special situation. [passage omitted]    Now, it seems as if Hungarian foreign policy has taken a  different direction, thereby endangering the image of being  reliable. Jeszenszky's visit to Belgrade and his statements  there in connection with sanctions caused doubt regarding  Hungary's political reliability.    The statements of [Prime Minister] Peter Boross about the  AWACS planes are also similar. Boross wanted to formulate  correct objectives but put it in a way that can be very easily  misinterpreted. We have to bear in mind three objectives:  First, we have to reassure the Hungarian public that Hungary  will not get involved in a crisis. This is correct.    Second, it is worth making a gesture toward Belgrade, for  the  interests of the Hungarians living there require this. However,  there is also a third objective, which has been ignored by both  Jeszenszky and Boross. We wish to cooperate with the European  organizations and the United Nations, and it is not expedient to  confuse the image formed about us. [passage omitted]    If NATO wants to extend the original mandate it does indeed  have to turn to us, to the Hungarian parliament and not to the  prime minister, and the parliament has to make a decision.  [passage omitted]    Let us not forget that the AWACS planes mean the first and  only concrete military cooperation between Hungary and NATO.  Since Hungary wanted the Partnership for Peace and expressed  willingness for cooperation, it is a confusing signal that she  wants to cancel the only existing cooperation, in fact, without  any particular reason.    [Barat] Well, yes, but Partnership for Peace is not a war  partnership, either in name or in content.    [Szent-Ivanyi] I agree. If NATO wants to transform this  assignment to a warlike partnership, then NATO cannot oblige us  to agree, and we must not accept it either.</p>

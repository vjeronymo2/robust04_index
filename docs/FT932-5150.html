			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / US may alter line on chip market share US semiconductor manu-facturers are ready to reduce their reliance upon specific market share targets to open up the Japanese market, US executives said yesterday in Tokyo. The US industry's shift from market share goals as a tool to open the Japanese market comes as the Clinton administration is preparing proposals to reduce Japan's rising trade surplus. These are expected to rely heavily upon market share targets, possibly modelled on the 1991 semiconductor accord between the two countries. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, and Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, have repeatedly praised the semiconductor arrangement which centres on a US expectation that its chip manufacturers will achieve a 20 per cent share of the Japanese market. US producers achieved a share of more than 20 per cent in the final quarter of last year. At a meeting between representatives of the US and Japanese semiconductor industry in Tokyo yesterday the two sides did not reaffirm the 20 per cent goal nor did they set a higher target. Mr Pat Weber, president of the components division of Texas Instruments said of the market share goal: 'We are moving beyond that. We will not rely upon it so heavily in future. We will move forward through co-operation and trust with our Japanese partners and customers.' US industry executives said they hoped to consolidate the 20 per cent share achieved late last year and make continuous improvements in penetrating the Japanese market. The Japanese side is committed to improving market access but not necessarily market share. US executives insist the two are synonymous because improved market access is meaningless unless it leads to higher market share. The US producers are hopeful that after temporarily relying upon the market share goal autonomous forces will help to support the US share. Mr Weber said growing technological dependence between semiconductor makers, the increasing sophistication of US semiconductors and the growing number of cases in which US chips have been designed into newer products should help to support the US share. Mr Hadehiko Yoshida, senior executive vice president of Toshiba concurred: 'We need alliances because semiconductors are becoming so diverse, we need mutual interdependence to develop them.' However, the rise in the US share last year was partly because of extraordinary efforts undertaken by the Japanese industry late in the year to increase their use of US components as well as the slump in the Japanese consumer electronics market. This is dominated by Japanese semiconductors, while the US share is higher in areas such as computing. As the consumer market improves in Japan, as it is expected to do later this year, the US share is likely fall.</p>

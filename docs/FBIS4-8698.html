			<p>BFN     [Text] During the night of 17 April, an hour earlier than  scheduled, the UN convoy with military equipment for the Blue  Helmets in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  -- FYROM] arrived from Romania at Ruse central train station.    The contradictory information about the transit route  through  Bulgarian territory and the hour at which the train will depart  from Ruse prompted us to contact our reporter in Ruse, Natasha  Dimitrova.    [Begin Dimitrova recording] The UN convoy, which arrived  yesterday night at Ruse central train station, departed this  morning at 0148. The reason for the delay in the departure was  related to 25 wagons being unsealed and the accompanying  documents missing.    According to the Bulgarian railroad authorities, receiving  the convoy in this form from the Romanian colleagues was  irregular. After a long dispute and clarifications, the two  sides signed a protocol and prior to the departure the equipment  was sealed with Romanian seals. No information about the  precise amount of missing contents has been published. [end  recording]</p>

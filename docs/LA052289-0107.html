			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BUYOUT DEAL UPS HOLLY FARMS STOCK  </P> <P> Holly Farms Corp. shares rose sharply today after it agreed to a sweetened  $1.3-billion buyout by agricultural products conglomerate ConAgra Inc.,  apparently ending a long-running takeover saga for the chicken producer.  </P> <P> Holly stock jumped $3.875 to $66.50, reacting to the new ConAgra offer,  announced Sunday, which works out to about $70 per share.  </P> <P> Another bidder, Tyson Foods Inc., the nation's largest seller of chickens, said  it will press forward with its lower buyout offer of $63.50 a share but did not  signal any immediate plans to try to top ConAgra's higher offer.  </P> <P> ConAgra came in as a white knight for Holly after Tyson made its uninvited bid  in October.  </P></p>

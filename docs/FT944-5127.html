			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Survey of Thailand (6): A diet of dung beetles - Poverty in the north east To liven up dreary nights Bangkok bars will sometimes hire a bizarre cabaret act: a couple of grossly overweight transvestites who stagger on to a makeshift stage, writes William Barnes. Although this is a familiar routine the crowd roars with laughter as the two performers - with impressive imitations of advanced drunkenness - brightly explain the various unprintable things they will do for a pittance. Welcome, you might say, to Isarn - the north-east of Thailand. What makes this cruel lampoon so dangerously funny for many Thais is that it contains more than a hint of the truth about the realities of life in Isarn. For behind the rapid industrialisation of Bangkok and other urban areas there is another Thailand, one where - far from capital's gridlocked Mercedes, Volvos and BMWs - people sometimes supplement their meagre diet by eating such local delicacies as dung beetles and tadpoles. Official statistics show that Thailand as a whole has done well in eradicating poverty, infected water and the other symptoms of third world misery. Latest figures show that the average per capita income in Bangkok is more than Bt13,000 per month. But in Isarn, the figure is only Bt1,244. No area of the country is poorer than the arid north-east which accounts for a third of the land area and a third of the population. The Bangkok authorities only exercised effective sovereignty over this area of the country - historically a part of the Lao Kingdom - towards the end of the 19th century. Over the last three decades economic planners have vaguely assumed that the local economy would prosper as a result of the dams and roads that Bangkok built. Yet many inhabitants' lives appear as difficult as ever. The traditional rice farming supplemented by a little hunting and fishing has been badly disrupted by environmental damage. Forest cover in Isarn has dropped from 43 per cent to 15 per cent in 25 years; salt mining and bad irrigation has spoilt much good land. Farmers - who rarely have proper land title - are sometimes thrown off the land to make way for eucalyptus plantations. It is a sign of the population's frustration that communist insurgency in Isarn ended only in 1980, and that some villagers in this predominantly Buddhist country have converted to Christianity. The failure of the Thai educational system is nowhere more painful than in Isarn. In Thailand as a whole, only a third of workers have more than the compulsory six years of what critics say is often mediocre schooling, but in Isarn the real figure is believed to be much lower than the national average. The education system is seen as having little relevance to life's harsh realities. Illiteracy is high. Yet almost every villager nowadays has access to a television set which emphasises how good life is in Bangkok. Villagers will often borrow money - not from banks to whom they can offer no collateral - but from money lenders. The result is more misery. Most children are packed off to work by their middle teens as labourers, factory workers or worse, only to be discarded in their mid-20s when they can no longer gut chickens or polish gems fast enough. Barely educated, unsophisticated in the ways of the city and dark compared with the pale-skinned Sino-Thais, many Isarn migrants are prey to prejudice and entrepreneurial vultures. There could be 2m Isarn workers living in Bangkok slums or on the eastern seaboard industrial complex; no-one really knows because they remain on the electoral roll of their old village. Even Thailand's modestly sophisticated economy appears to have a limited use for an undereducated workforce: over the last six years of very high economic growth the total number of Thais working overseas has climbed sharply from 268,000 in 1988 to 430,700 this year. Last year, Isarn workers abroad channeled Dollars 300m back to the north-east through the banking system; at least as much will have been carried back by hand. This money is important but it simply serves to emphasise Isarn's role as a cheap labour pool and a 'home' for workers (who may in any case never return to live in their old villages after so many years away). The post-communist opening up of Indochina should bring more trade and business to Isarn although the current proposals for new transport links - such as a highway from Isarn through to Danang on the Vietnamese coast - may not be the panacea that is sometimes suggested. The current Thai government is pouring billions of baht into economic development in the region, but private investors are harder to attract. There seems little hope that more than a handful of big manufacturers will be lured into the region soon given its dearth of skilled labour; half the Dollars 2bn private investment that went into Isarn last year went into Nakhon Ratchasima, a town on the edge of the region and the nearest to Bangkok. 'The villagers complain that the manufacturers we bring in only want to exploit them. But frankly what do they expect - I don't think we are going to see many aerospace manufacturers down here,' says Mr Sukich Maneethirapattanakul, director of the Regional Development Centre in Khon Kaen, a government think tank. In Khon Kaen, a bustling Isarn market town, several local businessmen proudly said that this was the fishing net manufacturing centre of Thailand. This is a dubious honour: the Isarn Friends of Children, a charitable organisation, recently found children working in the fishing net factories for less than Dollars 2 a day. Mr Amnuay Viravan, a former deputy prime minister and banker who will contest the next election in Khon Kaen on behalf of his newly formed Nam Thai political party, is more optimistic. 'I knew the north-east 35 years ago - believe me things have improved enormously. Now I think Isarn can join the economic mainstream - its people are tough enough and hardworking enough to overcome the problems,' he said. For centuries before Bangkok claimed control of the region power lay in the hands of the most influential local families. Little has changed, and the rural poor cannot look to Thailand's corrupt police force for support. In election after election, political parties have bought their way into power by bribing the desperate and malleable voters in the north-east with cash or promises. One Khon Kaen social activist, who asked not to be named, said that education was the key to unlocking the grip of corrupt local government on Isarn's future: 'How can someone who doesn't even read decide which politicians will do more than try to fill his own pockets?'</p>

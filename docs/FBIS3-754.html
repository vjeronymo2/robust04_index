			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria March 13 SAPA -- SA Foreign Affairs  Minister Pik Botha told Bophuthatswana leader Lucas Mangope  Saturday [12 March] night that his presidency was no longer  recognised by the South African Government.    Mr Botha, accompanied by senior African National Congress  negotiator and Transitional Executive Council (TEC) member Mac  Maharaj, told Mr Mangope he could not continue as head of the  Bophuthatswana government.    In a statement sent to SAPA early Sunday morning, Mr Botha  said the SA Ambassador to the homeland, Prof Tjaart van der  Walt, had as an interim measure been placed in charged of the  administration of the territory. This would be until the SA  Government and the TEC had agreed on "an appropriate form of  government" and until elections had led to new government  structures being established.    Referring to the number of wounded and killed in the  homeland  this week and the looting which has taken place, Mr Botha said  it was clear Mr Mangope was no longer in control. The situation  was in danger of deteriorating into anarchy and the lives and  property of South African citizens were threatened.    "The time has now arrived to take steps to ensure law and  order as well as the free and peaceful participation of the  people of Bophuthatswana in the election process," he said.    Accompanied by SA Defence Force Chief Gen George Meiring, Mr  Maharaj and National Party and TEC representative S.S. van der  Merwe, Mr Botha had in this light "personally informed President  Mangope...that his presidency was no longer recognised by the SA  Government and the TEC, and that in the circumstances he could  not continue as head of the government of Bophuthatswana."    SA and Bop security forces would continue to jointly  maintain  law and order, said Mr Botha. Bop civil servants, including  those recently dismissed, should be assured their pensions,  salaries and positions would not be detrimentally affected.    The historic move to dismiss Mr Mangope follows an earlier  call by the African National Congress for the TEC to replace the  homeland leader with an interim SA Government/TEC Administration.    It also follows on an appearance by the Bop leader on  National Television on Saturday, during which he said he and his  government were "undoubtedly" still in charge of the homeland.</p>

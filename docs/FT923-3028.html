			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Unctad reverts to Keynes for reflation recipe - More government investment and interest rate cuts top UN forum's priority list THE United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) could be excused for feeling a bit upstaged by yesterday's cut in German interest rates. Its annual report, prepared in July but only published today,* advocates just that. Unctad wants 1980s monetarism abandoned and a return to Keynesian policies on an international scale in an effort to pull the world out of recession. Higher government investment spending and a big cut in German interest rates top its list of recommendations. Without such measures, Unctad says, the 'debt deflation' afflicting the world's leading economies, notably those of the US, Japan and Britain, could ensure another 'lost decade' in the 1990s. Unctad, a forum for north-south dialogue, emphasises that third world development depends on the economic health of the industrialised world. Timing the publication of its report ahead of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank later this month, Unctad challenges the IMF orthodoxy that cutting budget deficits is the key to world economic well-being. Unctad believes that, without a radical change of course, recovery from the most severe global recession since the second world war will be feeble at best. Its economists argue that standard economic models have failed to capture the impact of debt on spending behaviour, causing policy advisers repeatedly to be over-optimistic about the timing and strength of the upturn. Where asset prices are tumbling and interest rates are at high levels, households and businesses are scrambling to cut indebtedness. Banks, constrained by tougher capital requirements and bruised by bad loans, are equally reluctant to lend. In these circumstances, Unctad argues, the private sector cannot lead the way out of recession. Governments must 'resume their responsibilities by acting to foster a return to financial stability and to stimulate the level of economic activity'. Unctad's prescriptions sound less iconoclastic today than only two months ago when the report went to press. The report calls for higher government spending to boost incomes, focused on investment and designed to be withdrawn once expansion is under way to minimise the impact on inflation and interest rates. Last month, Japan announced a massive Dollars 87bn package to boost the Japanese economy, the bulk of which comprises public spending on investment projects. Even in the US, where the budget deficit is running at more than Dollars 300bn a year, pressure is growing for a short-term fiscal stimulus to jump-start the economy. The report urges reductions in German short-term interest rates to Japanese and US levels, to permit a general cut in rates throughout Europe and ease tensions within the European Monetary System. It also calls on the US Federal Reserve Board to revert to pre-1979 policies of targeting interest rates instead of the money supply. Moves by the Fed to cut short-term rates - with no fewer than two dozen cuts since mid-1990 - have left long-term rates high because investors fear rates will rise again once the recovery begins, it says. The world economy is in a 'danger zone,' in which recovery is threatened by financial fragility 'brought about by a combination of financial liberalisation, tight monetary policies and bank deregulation' in the 1980s. Financial deregulation encouraged households and businesses to go deeper (and more riskily) into debt, in the expectation that asset prices and incomes would continue to rise. Debtors now face not only falling real incomes but falling asset values at a time of historically high interest rates. Attempts by the private sector to reduce debt, for instance, by trying to sell their houses or other assets, simply reduces asset values further, lowers incomes and prolongs the recession. Mr Kenneth Dadzie, Unctad's secretary-general, says: 'If the 1980s were dominated by the debt crisis in the developing world, the 1990s have started under the shadow of one in the developed.' Lowering short-term interest rates has averted full-scale debt deflation in the US and Japan, the report says. But it is not sufficient to stimulate recovery because no one wants to borrow more while incomes and asset prices remain depressed. With no single country strong enough to act as locomotive for a global recovery, Unctad harks back to the 1970s with a plea for co-ordinated reflation by the leading economic powers. The report predicts that present policies will lead to only a sluggish revival of the world economy. Its forecasts of 3 per cent output growth next year after 1.5 per cent this year already look over-optimistic. World trade is expected to rise by 6.2 per cent in 1993 from 5.2 per cent in 1992. Long-term projections for the 1990s suggest little improvement on 1980s growth rates for the industrialised world, while higher growth rates in developing countries will be largely offset by a rapidly increasing population. Unctad says most of the increase in per capita incomes will be in Asia (2.7 per cent a year), while in Latin America they could rise by 1.4 per cent. In Africa, per capita incomes will again stagnate or fall. *Trade and Development Report 1992 (UN, New York; available from UN booksellers, Sales No.: E92. II. D7)</p>

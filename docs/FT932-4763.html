			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Former teacher will fight seat for Lib Dems THE Liberal Democrat campaign for the Christchurch by-election began yesterday with the selection of a 48-year-old Southampton councillor as the party's candidate to overturn the Conservatives' 23,000 majority. The choice of Mrs Diana Maddock, a former teacher and the Liberal Democrat candidate for Southampton Test at the last general election, followed a weekend opinion poll suggesting that the government is heading for a humiliating defeat in what traditionally has been one of its safest seats in England. Tory party officials said that no date had yet been agreed for the poll  - made necessary by the death of Mr Robert Adley - in spite of suggestions that Mr John Major favours July 8 or July 15. With the mood of the Conservative party at Westminster distinctly fragile, some ministers believe that the by-election should be delayed until September. A defeat in Chistchurch might be the occasion for another crisis of confidence comparable with that after the loss of Newbury last month. Right-wing opponents of the prime minister on the Tory back benches believe it might provide the trigger for an autumn challenge to Mr Major's leadership. In spite of the weekend NOP poll which predicted that the Tories' general election majority would be replaced by a comfortable 7,000-vote margin for the Liberal Democrats, the general view is that the government will opt for next month. Speaking after her selection, Mrs Maddock said the Liberal Democrats intended to turn the by-election into a 'referendum' on the recent record of the government.</p>

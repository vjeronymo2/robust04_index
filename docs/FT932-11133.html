			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Nadir's flight wrecks fraud case: Britain unlikely to secure fugitive businessman's return from northern Cyprus ANOTHER high-profile British fraud prosecution appeared in ruins yesterday as attempts to secure the return of the fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir from the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus seemed set to fail. Mr Nadir's flight to Cyprus on Tuesday night prompted instant recriminations in the UK. The Serious Fraud Office, which had led the fraud investigation after the collapse of Polly Peck International, Mr Nadir's fruit and electronics group, took the unusual step of issuing a formal statement, saying it had argued strongly for Mr Nadir to be kept in custody because it had feared he would abscond. Bankers, owed more than Pounds 1bn following the collapse of Polly Peck, also reacted with dismay. One banker on the Polly Peck creditors committee said: 'We always thought he would leave, but what can you do about it? You can't keep him in prison for years (awaiting trial).' One reason Mr Nadir may have decided to leave Britain is because he could have faced imprisonment for failing to comply with court orders. Mr Neil Cooper of accountants Robson Rhodes, who is trustee in bankruptcy to Mr Nadir, said there were only a few days left for Mr Nadir to comply with a series of orders requiring him to give details of transactions and the location of assets. Last night, Lord Mackay, the UK attorney-general, was expected to meet Mr Rauf Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader, in Northern Cyprus to discuss Mr Nadir's case. Mr David Dain, UK high commissioner in Cyprus, earlier crossed the green line dividing the Turkish north from the rest of the island to appeal to the authorities to send the businessman back. The request was turned down. The UK has no extradition agreement with Northern Cyprus. Mr Nadir, who faced 13 charges of theft and false accounting at Polly Peck involving about Pounds 34m, was due to stand trial in September. He had surrendered his British and Turkish passports to police and had personally put up Pounds 2m of his record Pounds 3.5m bail. Mr Nadir's solicitors in London said last night he had been unwell and 'very concerned about various aspects of the judicial process' and whether he would have time to prepare his defence. Mr Ramadan Guney, the Turkish businessman who put up a Pounds 1m surety for Mr Nadir, yesterday said he met Mr Nadir on Monday. He had given no indication that he intended to flee. Mr Guney, speaking at his Turkish music shop in north London, denied any involvement in the flight. His lawyer, Mr Rick Sherman, said his client had a very great shock. Mr Guney was now 'not in good health'. Mr Sherman said that Mr Guney had held regular meetings with Mr Nadir and at all times had been assured by Mr Nadir that he would attend his trial. Asked if he expected his money to be recovered, Mr Guney said that was a matter for the court. However, he denied that he would be left bankrupt or ruined by the affair, and refused to comment on Mr Nadir's behaviour. Mr Nadir spent his first day in more than two years on Turkish Cypriot soil behind closed doors, together with his family. After meeting Mr Nadir yesterday morning, Mr Mentes Aziz, his lawyer, said: 'He is here to stay.' Mr Aziz added that Mr Nadir was in 'good spirits'. However, he expressed some surprise at Mr Nadir's sudden arrival on the island: 'I saw him only 10 days ago in the UK and he seemed so determined to fight his case in the courts.' Mr Mehmet Ali Akpinar, managing editor of Mr Nadir's Turkish language daily newspaper, Kibris, said: 'He is back in his country and he is very happy to come back to his people. He may make a very substantial statement next week.' Mr Akpinar was among a wel-coming party which raced to greet Mr Nadir at the VIP lounge at Ercan airport with members of his family and local politicians. The private twin-engine jet touched down at 10.25pm. The aircraft was understood to have been piloted by two Britons. Mr Denktash later explained his reasons for turning down the British request for extradition: 'Legally we cannot do it because he is protected under our constitution. We cannot apprehend him because he has committed no crime in Cyprus.' Mr Denktash said there was no problem between the state and Mr Nadir. The issue, he said, had to be decided by the government. 'Any decision must come from the government. They have to make clear what they will do . . . Asil Nadir is our citizen and there is no country in the world where it is not a government's duty to protect its citizens.' Police chief Ali Cetin Karahan said that Mr Nadir was 'not a criminal before our law and there is no case against him here'. Mr Nadir's departure to Cyprus and his breach of bail will be discussed in front of a judge at the Old Bailey tomorrow. A warrant for his arrest will amost certainly be issued, though serving it will be impossible while he remains in Northern Cyprus.

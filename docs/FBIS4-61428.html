			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report in the "Provincial Chronicle" column] </F>   [Text] Kazan -- President Shaymiyev has stated that a  high- level bilateral commission will soon be set up to examine  the implementation of treaty-based obligations between the  Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan. He stressed  that without assistance from Russia the economic situation in  Tataria would have been substantially worse. "At present we are  receiving much more from the federal budget for current expenses  than we remit. To conduct spring agricultural work alone the  republic has received an easy credit of 65 billion rubles, which  exceeds our contribution to the Russian budget by almost 10  times."</p>

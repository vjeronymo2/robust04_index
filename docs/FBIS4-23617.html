			<p>BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 13 Jun (AFP) -- Etienne Tshisekedi, leader  of the Zairian radical opposition, was released last night after  he had been arrested in the afternoon while driving within the  premises of the Kibomango military camp, about 60 km from  Kinshasa. Joseph Mukendi, political adviser to the opposition  leader, told AFP that Mr. Tshisekedi returned to his house  yesterday at midnight.    Mr. Mukendi did not comment on the incident which led to Mr.  Tshisekedi's arrest or talk about the circumstances under which  Tshisekedi found himself inside the military premises. "For the  moment, we are happy that he has returned home," he said. Mr.  Tshisekedi told reporters yesterday afternoon: "I am a victim  of a conspiracy here, and I won't say anything again."    According to the official version of the events as reported  by Colonel Nsankete Kumimgama, commander of the Kibomango  training camp of the Presidential Special Division, Mr.  Tshisekedi, who was driving in a car with four people, sneaked  into the military camp. Kibomango camp is near the road leading  to the presidential estate at Nsele, east of Kinshasa.  According to these sources, arms and ammunition including an  Uzi rifle, a pistol, and two magazines were on board the vehicle.    Mr. Mukendi pointed out that Mr. Tshisekedi usually "takes a  walk for health reasons every Sunday" on the Nsele road. "We  cannot understand that people accompanying Mr. Tshisekedi with  no military training should have weapons," he said.</p>

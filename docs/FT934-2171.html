			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar on dry Land Longstanding shareholders in Trafalgar House have reason to be grateful to Hongkong Land. Had it not ridden to the rescue with the backing of its old friends at HSBC, the company would by now almost certainly be in the throes of a painful debt rescheduling. So it may be impolite to ask too many questions. Two are worth considering anyway. Did Hongkong Land know what an expensive business it was buying into? And does it matter that Hongkong Land has taken effective control while owning just 25 per cent of the shares? Only Land knows the answer to the first. If it still believes in the long-term rewards, one must suspect after yesterday's provisions and write-downs that it was unprepared for the short-term pain. Otherwise it could have waited until the shares were cheaper. The second question may matter little at present. That will change as the company recovers. Land's interests and that of other shareholders will not then necessarily converge. Land's minority stake would then look increasingly incongruous. Take the dividend, for instance. Land does not need the cash. It should be more naturally interested in boosting Trafalgar's earnings by seeing the company pays a minimum in ACT. The new convertible issue looks attractive in terms of yield - watch out for switching when the shares go ex-rights - but the ultimate appeal depends on the conversion rights. That in turn requires a rapid build-up of the dividend. If there is a grand scheme behind its involvement, Land has yet to reveal it. But it is already too late for anyone to complain.</p>

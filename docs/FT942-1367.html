			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Observer: Flight of fancy So it seems the Queen's Flight is no more. When it is amalgamated with 32 Squadron and renamed the Royal Squadron, the Queen will be charged for the use thereof. But it need not threaten the family finances. After all, if commercial airlines can offer customers double Air Miles for club class and quadruple for first, royal class should be worth at least 10 times the going rate from the Ministry of Defence. If that doesn't keep the bills manageable, perhaps the Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales could obtain a rebate when they take the joystick themselves. And if the MoD doesn't play ball, there's always the possibility of a competitive tender. Step forward, Monarch Airlines?</p>

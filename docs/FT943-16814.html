			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Dockers lose redundancy case Twenty-six workers sacked from Goole docks on Humberside after industrial action lost a four-year battle for redundancy money yesterday. Three Court of Appeal judges dismissed by a majority an appeal aimed at reinstating the workers' entitlement to compensation from the Limb group, their former employer. The 26 were dismissed in April 1990 after an overtime ban in protest at a new bonus scheme and said that their sackings were a 'set-up' to avoid paying redundancy. The company, which had been taken over by the EIC Group, then decided not to re-engage its own direct labour force. Lord Justice Dillon, giving yesterday's majority decision, said that the industrial action in support of the bonus generated both the dismissal and the decision to use contract labour.</p>

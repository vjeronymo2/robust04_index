			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Mackie heads for USM with Pounds 17.3m valuation Mackie International, the west Belfast-based textile machinery manufacturer, is joining the USM later this month after a placing valuing the company at Pounds 17.3m. The Pounds 9.6m raised will transform Mackie's balance sheet which has been weighed down with debt and scarred by years of losses. The proceeds will pay off loans from Northern Bank and Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a US Government agency, which are writing off Pounds 7.6m. The result will be to turn Mackie's negative net worth of Pounds 852,000 at June 30 into shareholders' funds of Pounds 16.3m. The flotation is possible because of the dramatic trading recovery since Mr Pat Dougan was brought in as chief executive in October 1991. Turnover, which collapsed from Pounds 30m to Pounds 6m in the two years to 1991 reached Pounds 13.2m in 1993 and Pounds 9.38m in the six months to June. After a profit of Pounds 950,000 in the first half Mackie is forecasting at least Pounds 1.9m for the full year. On a pro forma basis and assuming a full tax charge earnings per share would be 13.2p giving a notional multiple of 13.6 at the 180p placing price. The notional yield is 4.2 per cent. Founded in the 1840s Mackie is a world leader in the manufacture of machinery for flax, jute, hemp and sisal fibre producers. To help counteract the cyclical nature of the core business, Mr Dougan set up a water treatment plant division last year which has won a Pounds 25m order from Argentina. Mr Dougan's stake will be diluted to 20 per cent, but none of the existing investors are selling shares in the placing. It is sponsored by English Trust with stockbrokers Teather &amp; Greenwood.</p>

			<p>931101 FT  01 NOV 93 / Britain bans Polish carrier in flights row BRITAIN yesterday suspended flights by the Polish national carrier LOT to the UK following the breakdown of talks over flight allocations between British Airways and LOT, writes Paul Betts. The UK Department of Transport said LOT's permit for air services to the UK was not being renewed because the airline had refused to honour existing agreements between the two countries. But Mr Boguslaw Liberadzki, the Polish transport minister, said the talks had broken down because BA was seeking to double the number of flights between London and Warsaw at least for a trial period. LOT believes an increase in BA flights to Warsaw would undermine its European and transatlantic business because passengers might switch to the cheaper route via London to the US and Canada.</p>

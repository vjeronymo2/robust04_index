			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikhil Chakravarty: "Winner in the Round-Robin"] </F>   [Text] Once again Ms. Robin Raphel has attacked the  government of India. Though a state department underling she, it  is said, has a lot of clout in the United States administration  because she is supposed to be close to the U.S. president, Mr.  Bill Clinton.    Last October, Ms. Raphel had attacked the Indian position on  Kashmir by saying the U.S. administration did not take as final  the state's accession to the Indian Union. That time Ms.  Raphel's revelation had come as part of a background briefing to  the media. In four months, she has come back to the very same  theme of Kashmir, saying that it is as bad as Afghanistan. But  this time it was a public speech at the Asia Society's  Washington branch. Ms. Raphel went further to warn that Kashmir,  like Afghanistan, has "the potential to mutate into wider  regional conflicts."    This bombshell from the head of the South Asia bureau of the  state department was unexpected for U.S watchers in India. In  fact, most of them had tried to dismiss Ms. Raphel's earlier  statement questioning Kashmir's accession to India as the  outburst of an individual in the U.S. government and not the  latter's considered view. Explanations were even sought and  received from official quarters in Washington. It was given out  that Ms. Raphel did not represent the official U.S. viewpoint.    This time no such alibi can be forthcoming since the lady  herself has been quoted as saying whatever she had said was  backed by the "full authority" of Mr. Clinton. She added that  all her remarks reflected the U.S. administration's policy and  were not personal observations.    A careful analysis of the present state of the U.S.  government's attitude to India makes it abundantly clear what  Ms. Raphel said both now and earlier could not possibly be  dismissed as the impudent remarks of a U.S. official airing her  personal opinion and thereby breaking protocol. In a sense, Ms.  Raphel has done India a good turn by leaving very little scope  for any illusions about the U.S. administration's attitude to  India.    Some in India feel the U.S. approach towards India has  radically changed for the better. They argue old prejudices  about India as a camp follower of Moscow no longer exist since  the Soviet Union itself has disappeared and the world has  emerged out of the superpower rivalry of the Cold War years.  This argument is buttressed by the theory that since India has  scrapped the Nehruvian model of development, is willing to toe  the World Bank's free market line on the economic front and has  invited multi-nationals to invest in the country, the United  States has come to regard it not only as a good friend but as a  virtual camp follower.    Not only on the economic front but in defence as well,  Washington must have -- or should have -- noticed New Delhi's  readiness to comply with its injunctions. This was evident by  the fact Indian military authorities extended their cooperation  to the U.S. Pacific command, and then, more pointedly, agreed to  send forces to Somalia as desired by Washington.    The expected results turned out rather discomforting for  this  pro-U.S. lobby in India. Mr. Clinton's speech on Kashmir before  the United Nations general assembly last year made it abundantly  clear he saw the situation in the state as a civil war. Over the  last two months, he has demonstrated which way he leans by  responding with a touch of affectionate sympathy to a letter  from one of the militant organisations in Kashmir demanding  secession from India. As if this were not enough, he has  sympathised with a Khalistani outfit as well.    Mr. John Mallot to Ms. Robin Raphel with Mr. Clinton's  rather  unorthodox interjections in between -- it is clear Washington is  hardly reconciled to New Delhi's stand that Kashmir is part of  India. While a number of Western governments have in recent  times expressed their misgivings at the violation of human  rights in Kashmir, none has questioned the validity of Kashmir  being part of India.    When Mr. Clinton in his address before the UN general  assembly referred to Kashmir as having a civil war situation, he  implied the legitimacy of the Indian government's authority over  Kashmir was in question. If it was only a case of human rights  violations on the part of the Indian security forces, then one  does not have to use the term civil war. The concept of civil  war itself implies that rival forces are contending for state  power. In other words, the two sides, namely the Indian security  forces and the armed militants, are to be looked at as being on  par in their respective claims to state power.    In this context, Ms. Raphel's October observation sought to  provide a historical justification for the U.S. official  position, that is, Kashmir's accession to the Indian Union  itself could not be regarded as final and irrevocable. Her  latest remark that Kashmir is in the same category as  Afghanistan is all the more ominous.    What is the situation in Afghanistan today? It is admitted  by  all that there is no state authority in that country, torn as it  is between rival factions fighting one another to extend their  respective domains by sheer use of force. There is no central  authority in Afghanistan. It cannot even be said that he who  controls Kabul rules the country. The three contending leaders  -- Mr. Abdul Rashid Dostum, Mr. Ahmad Shah Mas'ud and Mr.  Golboddin Hekmatyar -- are all equally matched and none can  claim to be superior to the other.    When someone in all seriousness compares Kashmir with the  Afghan situation, it is clearly a case of inciting the Kashmiri  militants against the authority of the government of India. It  is an announcement the Indian government is as effete as  President Borhanoddin Rabbani, and no superior than Messrs  Hekmatyar, Dostum and Mas'ud.    Washington's position has thus moved very far from  expressions of concern at the violation of human rights. It is  often pleaded by the U.S. administration and its cohorts that  what really bothers Washington about the present unrest in  Kashmir is that it might spark off a full scale war between  India and Pakistan. In this war, it fears, both countries might  at some stage be desperate enough to use nuclear weapons.    Nuclear weapons, the U.S. authorities are convinced, both  India and Pakistan possess or are capable of producing at short  notice. So the real U.S. concern, it is argued, is the danger of  a nuclear war breaking out in south Asia, particularly when both  countries have not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.    But the Indian perception is that the nuclear war danger is  being used as a excuse for U.S. intervention in the world after  the Cold War. The United States tries to justify its persistent  inroads into Iraq's sovereignty by saying Mr. Saddam Husayn  might build the nuclear bomb. This is taken as an example of the  U.S. cooking up an alibi for direct intervention -- next time in  the affairs of south Asia with the Kashmir crisis being played  up beyond recognition.    It is time New Delhi woke up to these new realities. To  expect that the Clinton administration will pull up Pakistan and  thereby ensure arms supply to Kashmiri militants is stopped is  to misread the U.S. objective in Kashmir. The U.S. has in fact  no interest in curbing militant secessionism in the valley. It  needs to be stressed that both Ms. Raphel's and Mr. Clinton's  pronouncements must have acted as a tonic to the Kashmiri  militants.    New Delhi's campaign last year beseeching the U.S.  administration to declare Pakistan a terrorist state was  unrealistic. For those in the Indian government who tried to do  so, the U.S. official pronouncements must have come as a shock  from which they will take a long time to recover. One can guess  from their pathetic position how unreal it would be to expect  the prime minister, Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao, to pay an official  visit to Washington, which is what some of his officials have  been trying hard to arrange this summer.  *</p>

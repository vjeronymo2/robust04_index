In a news conference, al-Iryani ruled out the  possibility of signing that accord in Jordan next week.  Al-Iryani said that no agreement has been reached on the  arrangements for the signing of the accord, in Jordan or in  Yemen. He said that this is because there are conditions that  have been set by the Yemeni Socialist Party.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report; from "NHK News 7" program] </F>   [Text] NHK TV conducted a nationwide poll of 1,800 people  aged 20 or over on 5, 6 March and got answers from 1,162 of  them, or 64.9 percent. Results of the poll show that 84 percent  of those surveyed said the government's economic stimulation  measures were inadequate while only 4 percent said the measures  were adequate. Asked what they expected the government to do to  stimulate the economy, 32 percent said the government should  expand public works projects, and 22 percent said taxes should  be cut.    Asked about the first Hosokawa cabinet budget bill for  fiscal  1944, 38 percent said it contained no characteristics of the  Hosokawa cabinet because it had no economic stimulation plan and  had been compiled by bureaucrats; while 22 percent it did have  Hosokawa cabinet characteristics in that it planned to increase  funding for public works projects to stimulate the economy and  attached importance to consumers.    The government has decided to cut 6 trillion yen in taxes  for  one year in 1994, and to draw a conclusion within this year on  post-1994 tax cuts and ways to secure financial resources to  compensate for the shortfall incurred through tax cuts.    Asked about this plan, 44 percent said they thought highly  of  it, while 45 percent said they had no strong feelings for or  against it. This showed a clear division of support for the  tax-cut plan. Asked how they would use the extra income from  the proposed tax cuts, 35 percent said they would spend more on  consumer goods and tourism, while 32 percent said they would  save the money.    Asked to comment on the national welfare tax that was  scrapped soon after Prime Minister Hosokawa announced it, 54  percent opposed it, saying it was merely a replacement for the  consumption tax, that it had been abruptly announced without  full debate, and that the existing tax rate was already high.  However, 29 percent expressed support, saying the new tax  system was needed to support an aging society, to ensure  financial resources to compensate for the planned tax cuts, and  to improve the people's welfare.    Asked about the relationship between the level of social  security and burden on society of senior citizens, 63 percent  said the present social security system should be maintained  even if the people's burden increased a little, while 20 percent  said Japan should build itself a high-level social security  system even if it greatly increased the tax burden on the people.    Asked about foreign rice imported after Japan suffered a  shortage, 75 percent said they felt uneasy or very uneasy about  eating it, while 23 percent said they felt quite happy about  eating it.    Asked about government measures for farmers following its  decision to partially open the Japanese rice market, 33 percent  said the government should reduce protection for them and that  the farmers should strengthen their management through free  competition. Meanwhile 28 percent said government funds should  be used to consolidate the foundation of agriculture, while 19  percent advocated the need for the government to subsidize  losses in farmers' incomes.</p>

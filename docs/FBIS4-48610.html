			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bronwen Jones] </F>   [Text] The biggest thing Mr Joe Slovo has ever built is a  sand-castle. Now, as Minister of Housing, he's moving on to  grander schemes as he aims to oversee the construction of  several million houses. Asked why he got the job, he's  embarrassed, but jokes: "Maybe because I've got a pretty face."    Drawing on a short, slim cigar, his tone turns serious: "I  took what I was asked to do. I feel honoured that I've been  chosen for this. Housing is the most important element in the  socio-economic development of a country."    He explains that for every 1 million rand invested in  housing, 120 jobs are created -- five times better than the  employment benefit of investing in, for example, textiles.  Housing creates a consumer market for electrical goods and  there is accompanying development of roads and water systems.  "It has a multiplier effect, in a way no other sector has," say  Mr Slovo.    He spend his first weeks as minister talking to the  country's  captains of industry, the Council for Construction in South  Africa and all the bankers and mortgage lenders. He told them  new housing must form viable communities in places where there  is easy access to jobs, health care, education and social  ammenities.    He says each householder needs a permanent residential  structure, secure tenure, privacy protection against the  elements, potable water, adequate sanitary facilities and waste  disposal and electricity.    His priority is affordable housing for the very poor, with  the government's subsidy scheme aimed at people who earn R2,500  a month or less. Provision will also be made for the homeless  and jobless by the creation of rental housing stock.    Unemployed people's ability to pay rent depends on a  still-to-be designed system of social welfare that will provide  the basic minimums of life. Mr Slovo says: "The whole  reconstruction and development programme will have to be  co-ordinated with housing as a key element."    Big ideas are difficult to carry out without skilled people  and Mr Slovo is angry about the current level of builder  training. He says: "The Building Industries Federation of  South Africa is only producing about 500 people a year."    He will immediately raise the R20-million annual training  budget, which comes from a levy on employers, to R200-million.    Mr Slovo says 10,000 men and women must be trained in  building skills in the next two to three years. To do this, the  R1.6-billion housing budget must be increased, and probably the  employers' levy too.    In the past five years, the annual average was 23,991 new  houses built. Mr Slovo is looking at 370,000 houses a year. He  estimates that at the end of the first year of the new  government, there will be 100,000 new houses; the next year  double that, and in three years, up to the 370,000 average.    Included in housing strategies is a plan to increase the  population density in some areas. While tower blocks are  unlikely, new dwellings will include three to five-storey blocks  of flats.    In the coming months, the housing ministry will put together  financial and other infrastructures needed to start building.    The mortgage indemnity scheme is expected to end business'  reluctance to invest in housing, and banks are collaborating to  form the National Housing Bank.    The minister predicts training will start to produce enough  labour for a visible thrust to the housing programme in about  six months.    Mr Slovo is hugely proud of his portfolio and the new  government. He says: "For 50 years I've been involved in the  struggle for political and economic liberation. Now the  challenge is to deliver up that liberation."</p>

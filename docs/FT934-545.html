			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / DTI acts to boost television industry Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has set up a DTI branch to boost UK broadcasting at home and abroad. It is the first time that broadcasting has had a specific branch to study its competitiveness and encourage programme exports. The branch, which will be headed by Mr Neil Warman, an assistant secretary, reflects Mr Heseltine's conviction that broadcasting in all its forms represents a significant industrial opportunity. The move follows last month's meeting of top broadcasters called by Mr Heseltine and Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary. Apart from looking at the competitiveness of Britain's broadcasters Mr Warman's branch will also be responsible for pulling together the DTI view on issues such as further de-regulation of ownership rules and the promised review of cross-media regulations. Work has already begun to establish an inter-departmental committee to review the rules on cross-media ownership. At present, for instance, newspaper groups are forbidden from holding more than a 20 per cent stake in a commercial broadcaster. Newspaper groups such as Lord Rothermere's Associated Newspapers, The Telegraph group and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, have all been lobbying for a relaxation of the restrictions. The ownership committee will have representatives from the DTI, the Treasury and the Cabinet Office. After the recent government decision to allow a company to hold two ITV licences, there is a growing feeling that relaxation of the cross-media ownership rules may happen.</p>

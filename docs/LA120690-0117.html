			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> 1 COUNT DISMISSED IN ALCOHOL DEATH CASE  </P> <P> An accessory-to-manslaughter charge against a Newbury Park woman accused in the  alcohol poisoning death of a 14-year-old boy was dismissed Wednesday by a  Superior Court judge.  </P> <P> Priscilla Vernon, 21, had previously been ordered by Malibu Municipal Judge  Lawrence J. Mira to stand trial on the felony charge and five misdemeanor  counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.  </P> <P> But Santa Monica Superior Court Judge Robert T. Altman said there was not  enough evidence presented during the preliminary hearing to make Vernon stand  trial on the accessory-to-manslaughter charge arising from the death of Leland  Scovis of Thousand Oaks, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Scott Gordon said. The  delinquency charges against her were not affected by the judge's decision.  </P> <P> Leland was the youngest of five teen-age boys on an April 14 camping trip  chaperoned by Vernon, her fiance, David Campbell, 29, and his brother, Patrick  Campbell, 23.  </P> <P> During the trip to Leo Carrillo State Beach, David Campbell gave the boys  alcohol, and Patrick Campbell bet Leland that he could not drink two to three  inches of alcohol left in a half-gallon jug of whiskey without getting sick,  according to testimony given during the preliminary hearing in August.  </P> <P> Leland collapsed after drinking the whiskey and his breathing worsened during  the next two hours, witnesses and authorities said. He was taken by helicopter  to Westlake Medical Center in Westlake Village, where he died two days later.  </P> <P> Patrick and David Campbell were charged and later ordered to stand trial on one  count of involuntary manslaughter, four counts of furnishing alcohol to a minor  and four counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.  </P> <P> However, the Campbells and Vernon made motions to dismiss the charges,  asserting that the evidence heard in Municipal Court was insufficient to  support the findings, Gordon said.  </P> <P> Altman on Wednesday upheld the Municipal Court's decision to try Patrick and  David Campbell, Gordon said. The trial date has not been set, and the brothers  remain free on $5,000 bail each, he said.  </P> <P> Gordon said he disagreed with Altman's decision but that he believes that the  bulk of responsibility for the death rests with the brothers.  </P> <P> Gordon said he will decide this week whether to refile the  accessory-to-manslaughter charge against Vernon, prosecute her on the five  misdemeanor counts in Municipal Court or drop those charges.  </P> <P> Vernon's attorney could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

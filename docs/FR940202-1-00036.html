			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The California red-legged frog is the largest native frog in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> western United States (Wright and Wright 1949), ranging from 4 to 13  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> centimeters (1.5 to 5.1 inches) in length (Stebbins 1985). The abdomen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and hind legs of adults are red; the back is characterized by small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> black flecks and larger irregular dark blotches with indistinct outlines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a brown, gray, olive, or reddish background color. Dorsal spots  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> usually have light centers (Stebbins 1985). Dorsolateral folds are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prominent on the back. Larvae range from 14 to 80 millimeters (mm) (0.6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 3.1 inches) in length, and the background color of the body is dark  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brown and yellow with darker spots (Storer 1925).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several morphological and behavioral characteristics differentiate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California red-legged frogs from northern red-legged frogs. Adult  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California red-legged frogs are significantly larger than northern red- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legged frogs by 35 to 40 mm (1.4 to 1.6 inches) (Hayes and Miyamoto  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1984). Dorsal spots of northern red-legged frogs usually lack light  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> centers common to California red-legged frogs (Stebbins 1985), but this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not a strong diagnostic character. California red-legged frogs have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paired vocal sacs and call in air (Hayes and Krempels 1986), whereas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> northern red-legged frogs lack vocal sacs (Hayes and Krempels 1986) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> call underwater (Licht 1969). Female California red-legged frogs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposit egg masses on emergent vegetation so that the egg mass floats on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the surface of the water (Hayes and Miyamoto 1984). Northern red-legged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frogs also attach their egg masses to emergent vegetation, but the mass  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is submerged (Licht 1969). California red-legged frogs breed from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November to March with earlier breeding records occurring in southern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> localities (Storer 1925). California red-legged frogs found in coastal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drainages are rarely inactive (Jennings et al. 1992), whereas those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found in interior sites may hibernate (Storer 1925).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The California red-legged frog occupies a fairly distinct habitat,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combining both specific aquatic and riparian components (Hayes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jennings 1988, Jennings 1988b). The adults require a dense, shrubby or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergent riparian vegetation closely associated with deep (>0.7 meters)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> still or slow moving water (Jennings et al. 1992). The largest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> densities of California red-legged frogs currently are associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deep-water pools with dense stands of overhanging willows ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Salix <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  spp.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and an intermixed fringe of cattails ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Typha latifolia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) (Jennings 1988b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Well-vegetated terrestrial areas within the riparian corridor may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide important sheltering habitat during winter. California red- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legged frogs estivate in small mammal burrows and moist leaf litter up  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 26 meters (85 feet) from water in dense riparian vegetation (Rathbun  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> et al. 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Egg masses that contain about 2,000 to 5,000 moderate-sized (2.0  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 2.8 mm (0.08 to 0.11 inches) in diameter), dark reddish brown eggs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are typically attached to vertical emergent vegetation, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bulrushes ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Scirpus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  spp.) or cattails ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Typha <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  spp.) (Jennings et al.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992). Eggs hatch in 6 to 14 days (Jennings 1988b). The most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant mortality factor in the pre-hatching stage is water salinity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Jennings et al. 1992). One hundred percent mortality occurs in eggs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposed to salinity levels greater than 4.5 parts per thousand (Jennings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Hayes 1990). Larvae undergo metamorphosis 3.5 to 7 months after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hatching (Storer 1925, Wright and Wright 1949, Jennings and Hayes 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the various life stages, larvae probably experience the highest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mortality rates, with less than 1 percent of eggs laid reaching  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metamorphosis (Jennings et al. 1992). Sexual maturity is reached at 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 4 years of age (Storer 1925, Jennings and Hayes 1985). California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> red-legged frogs may live 8 to 10 years (Jennings et al. 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The diet of California red-legged frogs is highly variable. Hayes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Tennant (1985) found invertebrates to be the most common food items.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vertebrates, such as Pacific tree frogs ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hyla regilla <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mice ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Peromyscus californicus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), represented over half of the prey mass  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eaten by larger frogs (Hayes and Tennant 1985). Hayes and Tennant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1985) found juvenile frogs to be active diurnally and nocturnally,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whereas adult frogs were largely nocturnal. Feeding activity probably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurs along the shoreline and on the surface of the water (Hayes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tennant 1985). Larvae probably eat algae (Jennings et al. 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California red-legged frogs have sustained a 75 percent reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in their geographic range in California as a result of several factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acting singly or in combination (Jennings et al. 1992). Habitat loss  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and alteration, combined with overexploitation and introduction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exotic predators, were significant factors in the California red-legged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frog decline in the early to mid 1900s. California red-legged frogs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were extirpated from the Central Valley probably in the 1960s.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Remaining aggregations of California red-legged frogs in the Sierran  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foothills became fragmented and were later eliminated by reservoir  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction, continued expansion of exotic predators, grazing, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drought. The pattern of disappearance of California red-legged frogs in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> southern California is similar to that seen in the Central Valley,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> except that urbanization and its associated roadway, large reservoir  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (exotic predators), and stream channelization projects were the primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors causing population declines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

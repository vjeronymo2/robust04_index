			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RAMS MAY BE BAD, BUT CAN EDDIE DOUCETTE CALL A DECENT GAME?  </P> <P> The only thing worse than watching the Rams this year is listening to Eddie  Doucette call the play by play.  </P> <P> Is it just us or does anyone have a clue as to what's happening on the field  when Eddie is calling the game? He is a disgrace. An NFL franchise in a major  market such as Los Angeles should have competent announcers.  </P> <P> KMPC must have the same philosophy as do the Rams and John Shaw, find the  cheapest guy available.  </P> <P> BRUCE DUDLEY, PHIL JELSMA and STEVE YOUNG, San Diego  </P></p>

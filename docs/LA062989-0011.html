			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS THROWN FOR LOSS BY DAVIS  </P> <P> They were just six pitches. A few curveballs, a few fastballs.  </P> <P> But in the eighth inning Wednesday night, with San Diego Padre reliever Mark  Davis pitching and the Dodgers attempting the hitting, they were six pitches  that illustrated a season.  </P> <P> With the bases loaded and one out and the Dodgers trailing by a run, Dodger  pinch-hitters Mickey Hatcher and Mariano Duncan stared at, and hacked at, and  ultimately struck out on the six pitches as the Dodgers lost, 2-1, in front of  33,708 at Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> With the Padres scoring in the eighth on a two-out, bases-loaded single by Tony  Gwynn, once again the other team made the comeback.  </P> <P> "We get the bases loaded and one out and you see what happened," Dodger Manager  Tom Lasorda said. "But they get the bases loaded with two out and what happens?  They get the runs. I wonder how many late-inning comebacks we've made this  year."  </P> <P> If a late-inning comeback is one that happens in the eighth inning or later,  the answer is three. Overall, the Dodgers have lost three in a row and blown  two consecutive chances to gain ground on the National League West-leading San  Francisco Giants. Instead of looking ahead, they must now look back, as the  Padres have caught them in a tie for fourth place, 8 1/2 games behind the  Giants.  </P> <P> Also hitting them with the approximate force of a Davis fastball Wednesday was  the news that the team's leading hitter, second baseman Willie Randolph, will  miss at least a couple of games with a strained right hamstring. He irritated  it on the turf in Cincinnati last weekend and then aggravated it by playing  nine of 17 innings in Tuesday night's 5-3 loss to the Padres.  </P> <P> Entering Wednesday night's game, Randolph's .298 average was fifth in the  league, and he was just getting better, having hit in seven straight games.  </P> <P> "With a hamstring the scary part is, you just don't know how bad it is, and you  don't know how much to test it," said Randolph, who was replaced Wednesday by  Dave Anderson. "I'd rather take a few days now and makes sure it's right."  </P> <P> The Dodgers can only hope he will hurry back. Then again, against a reliever  such as Davis, maybe he wouldn't have been much help anyway.  </P> <P> The Dodgers did many things right Wednesday night against the Padres, including  getting good starting pitching from Mike Morgan (who still leads the league  with a 1.69 earned-run average), three more hits from Alfredo Griffin and one  of the best catches Jose Gonzalez will ever make. But it came down to the  bottom of the eighth, after the Padres took a 2-1 lead in their half of the  inning on a two-run single by Gwynn against reliever Ricky Horton.  </P> <P> With one out in the eighth against Padre reliever Greg Harris, Mike Scioscia  reached first base on a grounder that went between the legs of first baseman  Rob Nelson, a defensive replacement. Jeff Hamilton singled to left and Gonzalez  also singled, loading the bases.  </P> <P> Out went Harris and in came Davis, who is second in the National League with 19  saves and who has 43 strikeouts in 39 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> What happens when a poor hitting team meets Davis? "It's a nightmare," Padre  pitching coach Pat Dobson said. "Even teams that are hitting good, when he's  on, he's unhittable."  </P> <P> With the Dodgers needing just a flyball to score a run, Hatcher, batting for  Anderson, came to the plate. He took a called strike. He fouled off a pitch.  And then he took a half swing at a dipping curveball for strike-three.  </P> <P> Time for Duncan, pinch-hitting for reliever Alejandro Pena. Duncan looked at  strike-one. He swung at strike-two. Then he swung again for strike-three to end  the inning.  </P> <P> "He has that big breaking curveball," Duncan said. "I don't know if he's the  best in the league, but he's good."  </P> <P> Said Lasorda: "He got his curveball over. And they missed it."  </P> <P> That the game ended an inning later when Eddie Murray looked at a called third  strike with Kirk Gibson standing on first base was anti-climatic.  </P> <P> And how about poor Morgan (5-7), for whom the team has scored just three runs  in his last three starts. In the eighth, fueled by the Dodgers' fifth-inning  run on Griffin's RBI single, Morgan was looking at his first complete game of  the season.  </P> <P> But Benito Santiago started the inning with a single to right. Tim Flannery  followed with another single to right, putting runners on first and second.  Neither ball was hit particularly hard, so Morgan was allowed to stay in the  game to face pinch-hitter Bip Roberts, whose bunt did nothing but force  Santiago at third. Marvell Wynne flied out and it seemed as if Morgan would be  fine.  </P> <P> But then he threw three straight balls to Roberto Alomar, who had not hit a  ball into the air against Morgan all night. Two pitches later, Alomar walked to  load the bases for Gwynn.  </P> <P> "That walk really hurt him," said Lasorda, who promptly took Morgan out.  </P> <P> Enter Horton, who had allowed just two of 14 his previous inherited baserunners  to score. After getting Gwynn to look at a strike, and then a ball, Horton then  threw a good sinker. But Gwynn, hitting a league-leading .361 at the time,  picked it off and grounded up the middle, under the glove of diving second  baseman Anderson.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> John Tudor spoke with both anger and determination Wednesday in evaluating his  season debut on Tuesday night. In the Dodgers' 5-3, 17-inning loss to the  Padres, Tudor allowed two runs on five hits in 4 1/3 innings. It was his first  start since undergoing extensive surgery on his shoulder and elbow this winter.  "I pitched bad, pure and simple," Tudor said. "No, I wasn't tired. I made bad  pitches. I made pitches Little Leaguers could hit, and these guys weren't  Little Leaguers." When asked if he was being a bit hard on himself, considering  that his performance earned good reviews from both Fred Claire, Dodger vice  president, and team doctor Frank Jobe, Tudor said: "That's the way I am, that's  the way I'll always be. I won't settle for anything less than pitching well."  Dodger physical therapist Pat Screnar said Wednesday that Tudor's arm recovered  well from his start, noting he was able to do all of his usual pregame  exercises and should be ready for his next start. Tudor agreed, but said that  while his elbow felt fine, his shoulder was still a bit tender, a feeling that  set in last week as soon as he said he was ready to return after two minor  league rehabilitation assignments. "As soon as I said I was ready, my shoulder  said, 'Hey man, maybe you're not ready.' " Tudor said. "I think it has to do  with all the sitting around I've been doing on flights lately. Hopefully, the  shoulder will come back next time." Next time should be Sunday against  Pittsburgh at Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> Two days after being sent to triple-A Albuquerque despite a 2.73 earned-run  average in 33 innings, Dodger pitcher Tim Crews has formally requested to be  traded if he's not back in the big leagues within 20 days. Crews met Wednesday  with Claire and said he was pleased with the response. "He said he's going to  give it his full effort to take care of me, and I believe him," said Crews, who  will join Albuquerque Friday in Edmonton, a day later than the usual 72-hour  deadline for reporting to a minor league team from the major leagues.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Claire said, "If Tim Crews tells me he is unhappy, I'll certainly  hear that."  </P></p>

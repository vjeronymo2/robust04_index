			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Interest rate hopes assist in Dow recovery Wall Street HOPES OF another cut in interest rates enabled US stock markets to recover from early losses caused by the steep fall in Tokyo equities and an unexpectedly weak July housing report, but price gains were limited to a minimum, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.59 at 3,329.48. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained a slight 0.60 on balance at 421.34, but the Nasdaq composite ended 1.60 off at 570.87. Turnover on the New York SE remained thin, but at 171.7m shares exceeded Monday's 153m. July housing starts fell by 2.8 per cent, contrasting with analysts' expectations of a modest increase. The figures confirmed that the housing market remained weak in spite of the lowest interest rates in almost 30 years. The market began to recover just before midday as speculation mounted that the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee, which was meeting in Washington DC, might respond to continued economic weakness by sanctioning another reduction in interest rates. Sentiment was also helped by the generally positive reviews given to the opening night of the Republican convention in Houston  - a good convention is required if President George Bush is to have any chance of making up ground in the polls on his Democratic rival, Governor Bill Clinton. Hewlett-Packard fell Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 57 1/4 after the big computer group reported fiscal third-quarter profits of 74 cents a share, virtually unchanged from a year ago and at the low end of expectations. Kroger dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 11 1/2 on 3.3m shares traded after the supermarket and stores group warned that third-quarter earnings per share, excluding charges, will only just break even. At the same stage a year ago Kroger made a pre-charge profit of 18 cents a share. On the American SE, American Exploration rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 3 in active trading after a joint venture in which the company holds a 40 per cent stake discovered oil at its first exploration well in Tunisia. On the Nasdaq market, Dell Computer advanced Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 25 3/8 on second-quarter net income of 57 cents a share, up sharply from the 34 cents registered a year earlier. Durr-Fillauer put on Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 33 3/8 after Bergen Brunswig settled litigation with Durr and raised its bid for the company from Dollars 26 a share to Dollars 33. Canada TORONTO stocks settled back to a mixed finish as market participants mainly held the sidelines ahead of further political developments. Both the Republican convention in the US and talks on the constitution in Canada are being watched closely. The TSE 300 index ended just 1.96 off at 3,377.82 after modest volume of 21.2m shares. Rises and falls were almost even at 265 to 264. Air Canada advanced 25 cents to CDollars 4.55. After the close it surprised the market by announcing an alliance with UAL's United Airlines. PWA let pass a deadline for a merger offer with Air Canada last weekend, but it was unclear whether the two were still negotiating. PWA ended 3 cents easier at CDollars 2.87.</p>

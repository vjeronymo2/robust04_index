			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / IBM profit fails to spur shares International Business Machines reported a small profit for its fourth quarter, after six consecutive quarters of losses. Yet with revenues and gross profit margins continuing to decline, the results provided little evidence of a turnround by the world's largest computer company. IBM's share price fell sharply, trading at Dollars 55 7/8 at midday in New York, down from Monday's close of Dollars 58 5/8 . It regained some ground in the afternoon but closed down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 58 1/4. Fourth-quarter earnings were Dollars 382m, or 62 cents a share, in line with analysts' expectations. In the corresponding period IBM recorded a net loss of Dollars 45m, or 8 cents a share, before pre-tax restructuring charges of Dollars 7.2bn which increased net losses to Dollars 5.5bn, or Dollars 9.57 per share. Sales declined in the fourth quarter from Dollars 19.6bn to Dollars 19.4bn. However, computer hardware sales fell by 5.4 per cent to Dollars 10.4bn. Revenue declines in software, maintenance and financing were offset by a 32 per cent increase on the service side. US sales rose by 9 per cent, but Europe and Asia decreased by 1 per cent and 4 per cent respectively. Gross profit margins slipped by 1.1 percentage points to 38.2 per cent. Expenses were down 9 per cent, excluding restructuring charges but including interest costs. Research and development spending was cut by 20 per cent. Analysts said the results, although encouraging, did not necessarily signal a recovery for IBM. The revenue decline was disappointing because IBM typically did about 30 per cent of its business in the last quarter. 'IBM was profitable in the fourth quarter despite tough business environments in Europe and Japan,' said Mr Louis Gerstner, who joined as chairman and chief executive last April. Progress was being made both on profitability and on business and technology strategies. IBM said personal computer revenues rose strongly in the quarter and computer workstation sales increased. However, revenues from the flagship mainframe computers and related disk drive products declined. For the year, IBM reported a net loss of Dollars 8.1bn, or Dollars 14.02 a share, after restructuring charges. Net losses for 1992 were Dollars 5bn, or Dollars 8.70, after an accounting change and restructuring charges. Revenues for the year declined from Dollars 64.5bn to Dollars 62.7bn, with non-US activities down 7.2 per cent at Dollars 37bn.</p>

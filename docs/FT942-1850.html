			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Pensions point to clash in capital market styles Last week's formal abandonment of the moribund draft EU directive on cross-border pension fund investment emphasises the continuing gulf between the capital market styles of the UK and most of the rest of the EU. The single market in investment and financial services seems as far away as ever. The directive was the less ambitious of a pair introduced two years ago to open up pension schemes. The first, aimed at facilitating cross-border membership, collapsed because it challenged the tax sovereignty of EU states. Northern countries feared they would hand out tax relief on lifetime earnings only for the workers to disappear to the Costa del Sol, where a grateful but undeserving Spain would gather income tax on the pensions. The second directive aimed to harmonise investment rules and open the way for investment management firms to compete throughout the EU. But few member states have been willing to relax their grip on institutional investment strategies when captive domestic investors are urgently needed to help absorb EU governments' borrowing, recently running at an annual rate of Dollars 400bn. Hence the 'prudential' rules which require heavy investment in bonds and domestic currency assets. Germany and France, holders of the next two EU presidencies, have no interest in opening up the scope for international funding of pensions. They are strongholds of unfunded schemes, with German companies generally retaining their liabilities on their balance sheets and France relying on pay-as-you-go systems (although these are increasingly threatened with insolvency). German companies are regaining their nerve as the economy begins to recover after what was, in the event, not all that deep a recession. There have been shocks, such as last year's decision by Daimler-Benz to adopt US accounting principles and seek a New York listing, and the crisis at Metallgesellschaft. On the other hand, BMW has absorbed Rover and Jungheinrich has grabbed control of the forklift truck businesses of the collapsed British group Lancer Boss. German executives are quick to criticise the short-termism of British companies, with high dividend payments - also criticised by Mr Stephen Dorrell, the British Treasury minister investigating savings and investment flows - low fixed investment and short payback horizons. But these high dividends are the other side of the coin of the enviably strong British occupational pension schemes, which own more than 30 per cent of the shares of British companies. Continental observers also find it hard to understand the success of the London Stock Exchange in attracting new company listings at a recent rate of more than 200 a year. New listings on continental bourses are tiny by comparison; for cultural and tax reasons most continental businesses prefer to stay (very) private. But executives at the London exchange are wondering whether it might be possible to market the attractions of a UK flotation more widely on the continent. Is this just another aspect of British short-termism? In the late 1980s the City's financial vultures made money through corporate raids and takeovers. Now they are luring quite small and often young companies to early flotation through a get-rich-quick promise. The obsession, continentals feel, is with 'exit' rather than long-term commitment. On the other hand, the stream of flotations and dividends also promotes a dynamic recycling of wealth. Money piles up less readily in big, dull businesses, but is diverted through contributions and dividends into their own and other companies' pension schemes. Growth is achieved through the development of smaller, focused companies rather than the sideways expansion of big, rambling groups. The British government's reluctance to promote the UK's capital market style is disappointing and puzzling; indeed, there has recently appeared to be a hankering after the German approach. The failure to open up a Europe-wide investment market is also very damaging to British interests. No wonder the British business community is becoming disillusioned with continental Europe. The UK is a global centre of excellence for portfolio management, but more business is to be had in the US than in the remainder of the EU.</p>

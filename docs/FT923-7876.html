			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Fund managers see profit recovery PROFITABILITY in the fund management industry recovered last year, reflecting an increase in funds under management and better cost control, according to Price Waterhouse's Investment Management Survey, Norma Cohen writes. Price Waterhouse found that less than one fifth of the fund management organisations made a loss last year. In 1990 a third of all managers incurred losses. Median profitability - defined as net profits as a percentage of revenues - rose to 14.4 per cent last year from 7.3 per cent in 1990. The survey covered 34 organisations with more than Pounds 300bn under management, representing about 40 per cent of all managed funds in the UK. Among retail products, authorised unit trusts were the most profitable. For wholesale products the traditional institutional domestic fund continued as the most profitable.

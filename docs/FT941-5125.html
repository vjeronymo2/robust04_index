			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Badgerline more than doubles to Pounds 6.9m Badgerline Group, the Avon-based bus company, yesterday reported profits broadly in line with the forecast made when it came to the market in November. The group's shares, floated at 115p, closed 5 1/2 p higher at 125 1/2 p. The year to end-December saw pre-tax profits more than double to Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 3.2m) from a turnover Pounds 5m higher at Pounds 132m. Mr Trevor Smallwood, executive chairman, said all the group's operating companies had performed well. He expected last month's Pounds 23m acquisition of PMT Group, the Staffordshire-based bus company, to be earnings enhancing. The purchase pushed Badgerline's gearing above 150 per cent, but this was expected to be reduced significantly by cashflow during the current year. The group said a recent Office of Fair Trading report into the activities of its Thamesway subsidiary at Southend had cleared the company of anti-competitive practices. Its main competitor in the town had been sold by the local council, which would stabilise the market. Thamesway had made a meaningful contribution as a result of improved trading conditions in the Southend area in the second half of the year, and full-year benefits were expected to continue into 1994. Badgerline expects a decision soon on the public inquiry concerning its Kensington depot in Bath, where Safeway wants to build a supermarket. Should the planning application be blocked, Badgerline would write down the depot's value in its balance sheet by Pounds 5.2m. If the plan goes ahead, the group will relocate to a new depot and gain Pounds 7.5m in free cashflow. Mr Smallwood said that while it was too early to make any predictions about trading during the current year, he was satisfied that the policies Badgerline had pursued would enable the group to continue the progress of the past few years. Earnings per share rose to 8.6p (4.1p) compared with the prospectus forecast of 7.9p. The group said it would start paying dividends in the current year. Had it been listed from the beginning of last year, the board would have recommended a notional net dividend of 4.1p.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by European Union [EU] Commissioner Jacques </F> Delors at Corfu news conference at the end of EU Summit--live in  French with simultaneous translation into Greek]    [Text] Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: In order not  to speak too long, I will start by saying that it is impossible  for me to give you a full account of the Greek Presidency.  Although the text that you see is a 16-page text, 16 pages that  prove the successes of the Greek Presidency as against what we  have read here and there and which I did not like at all because  they are contrary to the truth.    It is enough to remember that the Greek Presidency quickly  managed to conclude negotiations with four new countries in the  European Union's expansion. It also held negotiations that  resulted in the signing of a partnership relationship with  Russia and Ukraine, although in December 1993 we also  established that there were great difficulties in concluding the  agreement with Russia. The Greek Presidency also successfully  entered the second phase of the economic and monetary union, and  on a number of other issues many great and successful steps were  made. For this, I would like to thank European Council  President Mr. Papandreou, as well as [Greek Deputy Foreign  Minister] Mr. Theodhoros Pangalos, [Greek National Economy  Minister] Mr. Ioannis Papandoniou, and all the Greek Government  ministers who contributed to this great success.    I say all this because if this council is marked by the fact  that no new president of the European Community Commission has  been named, the blame certainly does not lie with the Greek  Presidency which made every possible effort to find a solution.  All this because one country exercised its right of veto, which  every member state has, against the candidate who was preferred  by the other 11 member states.    First, with regard to assessing the future of Europe, the  Greek Presidency made every possible effort, and, I will add,  that we can say the Brussels message [words indistinct] that the  white paper remains a framework for the development and future  of the member states, it constitutes a live and dynamic  framework. During the course of my work, I have recorded the  progress made at the national and Community level in  strengthening the European competitiveness, to find a model for  development, something richer with regard to employment, a  framework of thought in order to change the manner of  development so that there will be more employment without  changing the philosophy of our European communities.    Second, in the conclusions of the European Council you will  find all those elements that will allow us to continue this work  at both national and European levels. On a European level I  particularly note the pledge concerning the list of priorities  for the big infrastructure projects, and continuation of the  works regarding the big networks of energy and other big  infrastructure networks. Also the general ideas and  orientations concerning the society of information and  establishment of the decisionmaking procedures--with one  minister in charge of coordinating these in every member state.  These will express a joint decision and will allow us to  continue a social, developing, and functional task because the  appearance of these information networks will also change the  organization of work and the organization of our societies.    Third, we attach a high a priority to the small- and  medium-size businesses. Here we have the jurisdiction of the  national, regional, and local authorities, but at a  Community-level we have a program of social initiatives  supplementing those orientations that would facilitate the  strengthening of all these businessmen, of all these small and  medium businesses that create employment. Concerning the  employment systems, the Commission's orientations have been  accepted, [words indistinct] for equal opportunities and to give  everyone the chance to adjust technological changes. We need a  change of employment systems so we can facilitate finding people  employment or vocational training, giving priority to the  youths; every youth who graduates from school should not be  unemployed, instead we should give him a job, we should offer  either training or work. We should also formulate the working  time so as to exploit the technological development, we should  attach particular importance to options for the use of time, and  finally to formulate a means of development that would include  the protection of environment, options for the use of time,  development of the countryside, and formulation of [words  indistinct] in such a manner that we may respond in the best way  possible to both the new needs of society and the creation of  new employment positions as well as to the distribution of the  fruits of development by assigning every priority to employment.  This is the new concept of solidarity in Europe between those  who have and those who do not have a job. This is best for the  future because if by the end of the century we have the same  current unemployment levels, then the repercussions on a  political and social level in Europe will be terrible.    The white paper lives and the European Council, I believe,  will devote to the white paper many six-month periods and many  presidencies. Those works will allow us to reach the means to  formulate this new world at its birth.    We have also determined a series of text with regard to  foreign policy. We have prepared the summit conference of the  industrialized countries so that there may be a strengthening of  the efforts by the industrialized countries with regard to  nuclear safety in order to appease public opinion. We do not  have to face the negative consequences from the bad operation of  certain nuclear units. This program also includes closing down  the Chernobyl unit by giving to Ukraine the necessary means to  cope with its energy needs.    Ladies and Gentlemen this is all I can say today about the  European Council. I repeat my thanks to President Mr.  Papandreou.</p>

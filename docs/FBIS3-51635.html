The  body has informed the public, via a press release, that informal  meetings have taken place between members of its technical  office in charge of organizing the national conference and  several political personalities of the country, who have decided  to work for the success of this inter-Haitian summit under the  auspices of the most representative sectors of the civil society.    This week CARENA has invited the Parliament to take into  account the upcoming resolutions of the national conference in  Haiti and to get in touch with the United Nations and the OAS in  order to request of the UN Security Council an immediate halt to  the plan to reinforce the new sanctions against Haiti.  Regarding this subject, a fruitful conversation has taken place  between the members of the committee and the head of the French  diplomatic mission to Haiti, Charge d'Affaires (Philippe Seltz),  who has promised to pass this request on to his government. He  showed himself particularly interested in the holding of this  national conference in Haiti. The United States, Venezuela, and  Canada have shown the same interest and received similar  requests from the committee in order to stop any actions by  international organizations which could aggravate the situation  in Haiti.    The entire General Staff of the Haitian Armed Forces  received  the CARENA members, discussed the plan, and asked pertinent  questions, while encouraging this objective and unbiased  initiative of the key sectors of civil society, with no  preconditions. By the way, a letter has been sent to President  Aristide and to resigning Prime Minister Robert Malval for them  to send a representative of the executive to this conference. A  national conference appears to be an urgent subject for both  sides, says CARENA. On that basis, the CARENA members deem it  necessary today to ask all invited sectors to inform them of the  names of their delegates by writing to the office of the  national conference at the Holiday Inn in Champ-de-Mars.    This note is signed by Attorney Fritz Bissereth, coordinator  in charge of the technical office; Attorney Bruny Raphael,  coordinator in charge of the administrative affairs; and  Adyjeangardy, coordinator in charge of communications.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Cochabamba tropical region peasant leader </F> Evo Morales by Jaime Murillo in El Chapare -- live]    [Text] [Murillo] We are talking with peasant leader Evo  Morales. Can you tell us what is going on in Villa Tunari? We  heard that many people are worried because traffic to Santa Cruz  has been interrupted.    [Morales] Yes, since 0200 yesterday all national roads have  been blocked. It is true that traffic to many places, that is  to Santa Cruz or San Pedro de Cochabamba, has been interrupted.  Within this framework, I heard that the [word indistinct]  passengers are holding Villa Tunari mayor, who belongs to the  MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] hostage in demand for a  solution to this problem, that is, they are helping him find a  solution. [as heard]    Evidently other people, including women and children, are  worried about this. We are seeking a solution to the problem of  people who must urgently travel to Santa Cruz and Cochabamba.    [Murillo] We have heard that some pregnant women are not  receiving medical attention in the Villa Tunari health units.    [Morales] This is totally false. We are the ones who are  making the medical attention possible. Fortunately, the doctor  of Villa Tunari is my friend. He attended me after I was  attacked by Umopar [Mobile Police Unit for Rural Areas] agents  in 1989. He is a great friend of mine and therefore he is  giving medical attention in the most direct and practical manner  in the area.    [Murillo] Will traffic be opened for people who have an  emergency?    [Morales] We are authorizing transshipments to Santa Cruz  and  Cochabamba, but nothing more can be done. Yesterday it was  still possible to travel because the Cochabamba-Villa Tunari  road was not blocked. Blockades began last night. [words  indistinct] There are some drivers who want to continue with  their personal business rather than to protect the lives of  women and children and they are trying to discredit and force  the lifting of road blockades.    [Murillo] What is the situation now in tropical Cochabamba  region? We understand there are 20 injured individuals as  consequence of a clash that took place yesterday.    [Morales] I have heard nothing from Bulu Bulu and  Ivirganzama. However, there was a clash in Sinaota at about 1700  or 1800 yesterday when the Sole Federation of United Centrals  and the Sinaota people began blocking the roads. Two U.S. DEA  vehicles were stopped. They were carrying DEA members, that is,  gringos. They asked for reinforcements to recover their  freedom. Umopar agents came to help them and the DEA agents  were freed. The road blockade was later reinstated in Sinaota.  I have no information about injured people. In Villa Tunari,  the Federation of Tropical Region Peasants is totally optimistic  regarding the road blockades. They are proud and have stamina  to continue imposing the road blockade. We will meet at 0800 to  plan and organize many more actions. We will establish shifts  to guarantee the road blockade. [end recording]</p>

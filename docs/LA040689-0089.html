			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASSAULT GUN SALES BAN WINS INITIAL OK IN LONG BEACH  </P> <P> LONG BEACH-The city this week took steps to join the list of Los Angeles County  communities that have outlawed the sale of rapid-fire assault weapons in the  wake of the schoolyard slayings of five Stockton school children by a gunman  firing a semiautomatic AK-47 earlier this year.  </P> <P> Less than a month after two of its committees voted to shelve the proposal, the  City Council gave preliminary approval to an ordinance banning the local sale  of the military-style guns, increasingly used in drive-by gang shootings that  often claim the lives of people who are not gang members.  </P> <P> After listening to more than two hours of testimony from a parade of opponents  and proponents, the council voted 8 to 1 in favor of the ban, even while  terming it a weak law that does not go as far as those recently adopted in a  number of other cities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Possession Legal  </P> <P> While the ordinance would make it illegal to sell the weapons, it does not  outlaw their possession -- as do ordinances passed by Los Angeles, Compton,  Whittier and Carson.  </P> <P> The chief council proponents of the ban seemed content to restrict the  prohibition to sales, a measure more easily enforced and less volatile than one  that would require existing gun owners to give up their assault weapons.  </P> <P> Gun owners nonetheless condemned the ban as a dangerous first step toward total  gun control. They insisted law-abiding citizens have a right to buy the weapons  to protect themselves against criminals and terrorists, and argued that the  measure would do nothing to thwart random gang shootings involving  semiautomatic weapons.  </P> <P> "In my opinion it is nothing short of idiocy. . . . It can't possibly work,"  said Gene Snyder, one of 30 people who spoke against the ordinance at Tuesday's  council meeting. "It's an emotional knee-jerk reaction to the publicity in the  newspaper."  </P> <P> To the surprise of council members who were expecting opponents to far  outnumber supporters, nearly as many people spoke in favor of the measure as  spoke against it.  </P> <P> "It's certainly a step in the right direction," said Frank Berry, president of  the Long Beach branch of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored  People. Berry and others argued that whatever rights people have to buy  semiautomatic weapons are outweighed by the right to live in a peaceful  environment.  </P> <P> "We recognize when the rights of some should be given more consideration over  the rights of others," said Berry, one of 26 people to testify in favor of the  ban.  </P> <P> Councilman Jeffrey A. Kellogg, who cast the only vote against the ordinance,  said he was opposing it, not because he favored assault weapons, but because he  thought the ban would be ineffective. Statewide legislation is the answer, not  a local ordinance, Kellogg insisted.  </P> <P> But Councilman Les Robbins, who last month voted with Kellogg not to draft an  anti-assault weapon ordinance, this week voted to approve it.  </P> <P> "The more I thought about it, the more I thought there are a significant  majority of people out there, who say, 'Assault rifles, who needs them?' "  Robbins said after his vote.  </P> <P> Councilman Thomas J. Clark indicated that the council was probably satisfied  just to ban sales -- rather than the possession -- of military-type weapons  because members assumed statewide legislation will soon be enacted, overriding  any local bans. "We were making a statement. We feel there's a good chance this  will be moot," commented Clark, who said the ordinance was "about the weakest  you could have" and still show support of a state ban.  </P> <P> The ordinance, which would go into effect 31 days after final approval, makes  it a misdemeanor to sell semiautomatic rifles with a detachable magazine  capacity of 20 rounds or more, including such guns as the AK-47, Uzi, Colt  AR-15 and the Beretta AR-70. The sale of shotguns with a folding stock or  magazine capacity of more than six rounds is also forbidden.  </P> <P> City Atty. John R. Calhoun, who drafted the measure, said it was modeled after  other cities' ordinances, making it more likely that the Long Beach law would  be affected by court rulings either upholding or overturning the legality of  local bans.  </P> <P> While the state has clearly preempted the authority to regulate the licensing  and registration of firearms, precluding cities from doing so, Calhoun said  state law is considerably murkier when it comes to the regulation of the sales  and possession of firearms, leaving the door open for a local ordinance.  </P></p>

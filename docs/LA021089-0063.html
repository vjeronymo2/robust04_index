			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: VIDEO NEWS;  </P> <P> REVIEW  </P> <P> *** 1/2 "Point Blank."  </P> <P> MGM/UA. $79.95.  </P> <P> Irresistible rage; immovable object. A haunted, doomed, hard guy (Lee Marvin,  at his best), shot down during an Alcatraz robbery, tracks down his betrayers  mercilessly, inexorably -- through gleaming L.A. offices, vast white storm  drains, sterile penthouses, hillside bungalows -- only to find that his enemies  are faceless, unaccountable, buried within the recesses of a huge, impersonal  organization. This movie plays like some weird mixture of Kafka and Jim  Thompson, Alain Resnais and Don Siegel ("L'Annee Derniere avec les Killers"?),  and back in 1967, many critics were bewildered by it. It's an obvious morality  play: five years before "The Godfather," it posits that big business and big  crime are identical in their methods. It's also a dreamy rumination on anomie,  film noir, modern architecture, vendettas and the links between desire and  death. Director John Boorman fills it with haunting, unforgettable, often  astonishing images. (Wide screen, cropped.)MICHAEL WILMINGTON  </P></p>

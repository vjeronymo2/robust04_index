			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. TELLS OF MEXICAN GIFTS TO ORTEGA PARTY  </P> <P> In a covert political operation that could prove pivotal in Nicaragua's hotly  contested election, the ruling party of Mexico has secretly contributed more  than $11 million in cash and supplies to the reelection campaign of leftist  President Daniel Ortega, U.S. officials said Friday.  </P> <P> The contributions, which are said to include thousands of T-shirts, posters and  gifts for voters as well as cash, were more than three times as valuable as the  estimated $3.3 million in U.S. government aid that has gone to opposition  candidate Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the officials said.  </P> <P> Moreover, they charged, the Sandinista campaign failed to report the  contributions from Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) to  Nicaragua's Supreme Electoral Commission, as required by the country's election  law.  </P> <P> Mexican officials refused to comment on the U.S. officials' charges, but  Nicaraguan Vice President Sergio Ramirez, Ortega's running mate, denied them.  </P> <P> "This is a falsehood," Ramirez said in Managua on Friday evening. "We have  declared all the donations we have received. . . . We have received nothing  from the Mexican government or the PRI, except advisers."  </P> <P> But U.S. officials insisted that their charges are true. They said Mexican  officials privately admitted the contributions -- although they contended that  their value was far below $11 million.  </P> <P> "It is a very solid report," said Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary of state  for Latin America. "The Sandinistas appear not to have complied with the very  rules that they established."  </P> <P> Aronson and other Administration officials emphasized that the reported  contributions -- and the Sandinistas' failure to report them -- cast additional  doubt on the fairness of the campaign leading to Sunday's election.  </P> <P> Under Nicaraguan law, the Sandinistas would be required to report any foreign  contributions and to give the Supreme Electoral Council half of any foreign  cash donations.  </P> <P> A senior U.S. official said the State Department is informing the leaders of  the major international observer groups in Nicaragua -- former President Jimmy  Carter, former Atty. Gen. Elliot Richardson, and Organization of American  States chief Joao Baena Soares -- of the report "so they know that something  wasn't square."  </P> <P> The Mexican donation, which was first reported by the New York newspaper  Newsday, could also cause an unexpected strain in the Bush Administration's  so-far friendly relationship with Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.  </P> <P> "There's no desire on our part to muddy the Mexicans with this," one State  Department official was quick to say. "We're trying to keep the focus on  Nicaragua."  </P> <P> Still, other officials said, the incident was reminiscent of the early 1980s,  when Mexico actively sought to thwart U.S. policies in Central America.  </P> <P> "The Mexicans have always seen themselves as a major power in Central America,  and the PRI has always had a close relationship with the Sandinistas," said  one. "That may never have changed."  </P> <P> Mexican officials told U.S. aides that the PRI made the contribution without  the knowledge of Salinas or other government officials in Mexico City -- an  assertion some officials said was difficult to believe if the donations were as  large as $11 million.  </P> <P> U.S. officials noted one irony in the discovery that the PRI has also sent  advisers to Nicaragua: The PRI is widely held to have stolen Mexico's last  presidential election by stuffing the ballot boxes.  </P> <P> The reported contribution would at least explain one phenomenon in the  Nicaraguan election campaign: the sudden appearance in Managua of thousands of  handsomely printed Sandinista T-shirts, coffee mugs and other trinkets.  </P> <P> Nicaraguan Vice President Ramirez acknowledged that the Sandinista campaign  received about 60,000 T-shirts from Mexico, but he said they had been donated  by private "solidarity groups," not by the government or the PRI.  </P> <P> "Why would they accuse us of getting money from Mexico?" he asked. "I would  think they would say it came from Libya, or from the Ayatollah."  </P> <P> The Sandinistas appear to have easily outspent the opposition during the  campaign, but they have reported only about $300,000 in foreign contributions.  </P> <P> Congress has provided $9 million in U.S. aid for the Nicaraguan election, but  earmarked most of the money for officially nonpartisan voter registration and  election monitoring groups. Approximately $3.3 million of the fund went to the  Chamorro campaign and a group closely associated with the campaign.  </P> <P> McManus reported from Washington and Miller reported from Managua.  </P></p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Cry of 'censorship' against proposed spike SIR Frank Rogers, chairman of the Newspaper Publishers' Association, which represents national newspapers, said a number of leading publishers would not oppose action being taken against telephone tapping and other forms of physical intrusion, Raymond Snoddy writes. But Sir Frank, who is deputy chairman of The Daily Telegraph, warned: 'The government would be extremely unwise to frame an act of parliament specifically directed against journalists.' Mr Andrew Neil, editor of The Sunday Times, said: 'If the government were to implement all of this it would be the most draconian censorship rules faced in peacetime ever.' He said the measures would 'enormously increase injunctive power', but did not oppose the law being brought up to date on electronic surveillance, as long as there was a public-interest defence. Mr Peter Preston, editor of The Guardian and a member of the Press Complaints Commission, accused Sir David of having a closed mind and being 'a terribly biased witness' because proposals he made after his 1990 inquiry had not been implemented. The Newspaper Society, which represents regional and local newspapers, said the government should have rejected outright Sir David's 'authoritarian measures'. Mr Dugal Nisbet-Smith, director of the Newspaper Society, said: 'Freedom of expression in Britain remains under threat.' Earlier in the day, before publication of the Calcutt report, Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, editor of The Independent, told the national heritage committee that the media had 'unduly and wrongly' invaded people's privacy. He backed new laws against trespass, electronic eavesdropping and 'peeping Tom pictures'.</p>

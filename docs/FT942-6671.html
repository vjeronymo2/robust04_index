			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Survey of Residential Property (5): Are all top schools in top-class areas? - School catchment areas / Can you put a value on the extra price you must pay for a house in a good school's catchment area? The Financial Times' studies of state education over the last two years have discovered a new phenomenon - 'education by mortgage'. Put simply, when the FT attempted to assess schools' academic strength, it found that the good schools tended to be in areas where house prices were highest. In 1992, our survey of A-level results found that the two top performing counties in the state sector - Hertfordshire and Berkshire - had house prices respectively 45 and 51 per cent above the national average. A look at the top achieving comprehensive schools again suggested a strong link with wealthy localities, and high house prices. The highest placed was Hasmonean High, serving the Jewish community in Hendon, north London, followed by Cherwell, which includes north Oxford - home of many university lecturers - in its catchment area. An initial reaction is that this is a social phenomenon - wealthy parents tend to live near to each other and lavish extra support on their children. They then tend to perform better than the average regardless of the quality of the schools' teaching staff. Hence the 'best' schools are in the most expensive areas. But there is evidence that this also works in reverse. Anxious parents try to find out where the best schools are and then pay whatever is necessary to live within the right catchment area. Recent government education measures have allowed more choice, and the so-called 'Greenwich judgment' established that parents could send their children to school across borough or county boundaries, but it is still best for them to live within easy reach of a preferred school. League tables, which neither newspapers nor the government can resist publishing, and spiralling independent school fees have also encouraged parents to shop around for state schools. That means moving to the 'right' area. Buckinghamshire provides a strong example. It has retained a traditional 'grammar school' system, and pupils are selected on the basis of competitive examinations. Multi-national companies now tend to steer executives relocating in Britain towards the county because of its schools' strong reputation. This then becomes a virtuous circle. Head teachers at grammar schools in High Wycombe - including the Royal Grammar School, which was the country's top state boys' school last year, according to the FT's survey - all report that parents move to the area just to give their children what they hope will be a better education. David Levin, the school's headmaster, reports that parents frequently move to the area just to get a chance of the good, cheap education. Estate agents routinely entice potential buyers with the town's schools, and expect to extract extra value for it. But quantifying it is more of a problem. Similar trends are at work in Greater London, where the quality of schools is reputedly more variable. The effect on values is also variable. Paul Webb, of the estate agent Barnard Marcus's Richmond office, in south-west London, says the borough's popular schools have a big impact on buying intentions. Neighbouring Hounslow's schools do not have as strong a reputation, and many parents 'simply will not look at schools in Hounslow'. But he adds: 'There will just as easily be young couples or single professionals who won't be phased by a poor catchment areas at all. It's not great enough to influence the value of someone's home.' Bexley, in south-east London, has, like Buckinghamshire, held on to grammar schools. That, according to David Blake, director of corporate affairs for the Woolwich building society, means that 'a lot of people choose to move into Bexley and it has an effect on certain localities within the borough. It's not as important a factor as it used to be since the Greenwich judgment, but there was a time when estate agents would actually list schools on their particulars and identify them.' But Blake's final judgment is unequivocal: 'There's a very definite connection between where people choose to live which obviously has an effect on values and where state schools are placed. I'm sure parents are prepared to pay extra to live in a good school's catchment area.' In north London, schools can be even more variable, and Barnard Marcus's Barnet office reports that parents frequently lay down a catchment area as a pre-condition when first starting their property searches. Junior schools, as well as the area's numerous well-known secondaries, can exert this pressure. But again, putting a price on a school is tough. According to Paul Grover, of Barnard Marcus: 'There is definitely an effect in north London. But when it comes down to the price it's very difficult to fix the difference.' He thinks that catchment areas impact on demand, but not directly on prices. When the market dips, this can be a big advantage. It remains very questionable whether catchment areas have such an impact on property values that house-hunters should take them into account if they do not have school-age children themselves. According to Gary Marsh, who researches the residential property market for Halifax building society: 'Quality of schools varies through time as well. Anecdotally there's a lot of evidence for this from estate agents, but it's not an easy effect to pick up on any data-base.' So catchment area effects, when they occur, are difficult to quantify, and might prove transitory - it only takes the retirement of a head, or the opening of a new city technology college a mile away, to destroy a school's local pull. Marsh thinks it would be 'misleading' to put any value on the extra price you must pay for a house in a good school's catchment area. The effect exists. Parents who shudder at independent school fees would be crazy not to take it into account. But do not imagine that by buying a house in a sought-after catchment area you are acquiring a guaranteed saleable asset.</p>

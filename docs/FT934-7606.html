			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Calm greets Nigerian takeover GENERAL Sani Abacha, Nigeria's former defence minister who assumed power on Wednesday, was last night expected to announce the formation of a new military-backed government. But army officials suggested that Gen Abacha, who deposed Chief Ernest Shonekan, the civlian head of state, would seek a broader base of civilian support especially amongst elder statesmen than that enjoyed by the interim government. The strikes and protests of early this week gave way to calm in the half empty streets of Lagos yesterday as Nigerians awaited the outcome of talks between the top military officers. Even in Lagos, where the dominance of the mainly northern military elite is deeply resented, there was cautious optimism over Gen Abacha's takeover. It may reflect, however, a resentment that Mr Shonekan agreed to serve the military administration which last June deprived a fellow southerner of the presidency. Chief Moshood Abiola won the poll which was annulled by the military. Lagos is the home state of both men. 'Shonekan's government was just getting in the way of any resolution of the political deadlock,' said a pro-democracy campaigner. 'If you are going to rule Nigeria you have to have either a mandate from the people or a gun in your hand. Shonekan had neither,' said a leading banker in the commercial capital. The interim government lacked credibility from the start being handpicked by Gen Ibrahim Babangida after his resignation at the end of August. It was handicapped by its inability to legislate by decree or to govern through the National Assembly. Last week's high court ruling in Lagos that the interim government had no legal basis and the popular protest at the rise in the fuel price damaged Mr Shonekan's standing. The police have declared demonstrations illegal and the Campaign for Democracy, which led the opposition to extended military rule through civil protests in July, has called off its two-day demonstration in Lagos. Crowds burning barricades in Lagos' main road were dispersed in the morning but apart from the detention of several civilians there was little tension. There were minor protests in the northern city of Kaduna and serious disturbances at the country's main petrochemicals and refinery complex in Eleme near Port Harcourt, where angry crowds blocked access to the plant and protested against the central government for diverting oil revenue from the region.</p>

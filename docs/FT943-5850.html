			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recovery halted as inflation worries resurface - Market Report An attempt to recover from the profit-taking of the previous session was abandoned yesterday after the latest data on the US economy raised the spectre of inflationary pressures. But, once again, it was the UK blue chips which looked uncertain. The broader market held steady and strength in building shares reflected underlying confidence in the progress of economic recovery. At best, the FT-SE 100-share Index was more than 15 points up. The rises in French bank rates announced after London had closed on Tuesday were dismissed as purely technical moves, with no serious implications for today's meeting at the Bundesbank, where most analysts believe German rates will be left unchanged. A modest fall in the UK Purchasing Managers Index encouraged hopes for non-inflationary growth, although this index is not yet taken too seriously by the stock market. However, gains were quickly whittled away when London caught the hint that the New York markets would react negatively to the July US leading economic indicators, which showed a rise in material prices, known to be a sensitive area at the Federal Reserve; the Chicago Purchasing Managers report seemed to indicate similar trends. Some commentators revived the word 'stagflation' coined 20 years ago to describe the combination of rising prices and slowing economic growth. The FT-SE 100 Index ran back almost to its overnight level as the big trading houses sought to reverse their trading positions in a hurry. However, a late rally left the index at a final reading of 3,251.3 for a gain of 1.7 points on the day. Trading volume increased in the second half of the session as arbitraging was reported between stock index futures and underlying equities. But the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, incorporating a wider range of second line stocks, remained firm, closing 2.8 higher at 3,816.6. Several trading programmes were reported, and these increased the pressures from the stock index futures sector. Seaq-reported trading volume of 647.9m shares was nearly 8 per cent above Tuesday's figure, which in turn reflected Pounds 1.22bn in retail worth and confirmed the return to higher levels of investment activity since the most recent upswing in the stock market. A market highlight in terms of share price movement, although not in trading volume, came in the defence sector, which responded to the Dollars 10bn merger of Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta in the US. Shares in both British Aerospace and GEC rose smartly as the stock market revived past hints that GEC might seek closer links with, or bid for, Aerospace. By the close, GEC shares had given back the gain but Aerospace remained in demand. On balance, however, the stock market did not sound convinced of its own hopes for an early bid. Interest rate-related stocks, including most of the store and retail issues, made a good recovery from the bout of profit-taking endured in the previous session, although Kingfisher, the high street trader, suffered from the implications for Darty, its French retailer, of the rises in bank interest rates in that country. Traders said that the underlying tone of the stock market had remained very firm yesterday. The economic data from the US provided a somewhat discouraging curtain-raiser for the more significant statistics on US unemployment and payrolls due on Friday, which are likely to set the pact for world markets next week. Today will bring both the meeting of the Bundesbank policy council and also the wider ranging US purchasing managers survey. Either could have significant effect on near-term views on the equity market outlook.</p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: ABN-Amro to expand ABN-Amro hopes to double the size of its derivatives operations by 1998, Reuter reports from Amsterdam. 'Derivatives will be the growth engine for the investment bank in the coming years,' said Mr Dolf van den Brink, the bank's head of treasury and fixed income. The bank, the biggest in the Netherlands, aims to double its front office staff to at least 200 people over the next four years as it builds up its foreign derivatives operations. Derivatives are a capital and risk-management intensive business and ABN-Amro intends to keep control firmly in Amsterdam. However, most of the expansion will take place abroad as it builds up derivatives capacity in Chicago, London, Hong Kong and Singapore. Longer term, the aim is to use these centres as hubs to grow fully-fledged derivative operations in a wider range of the countries where it is active, Mr van den Brink said.</p>

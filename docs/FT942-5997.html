			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Motorola to expand plant in Ireland Motorola, the US electronics and wireless communications manufacturer, has announced a IPounds 110m (Pounds 108m) investment in the Republic of Ireland, to expand its operations serving the European market. Its Dublin plant, making pagers and two-way radios, will be extended to include the manufacture of batteries and battery chargers, as well as crystal oscillators which are also used in the company's communications equipment. The project has been backed by Ireland's Industrial Development Authority and is expected to create 2,000 jobs over the next five years, one of the largest projects in job-creating terms that the IDA has been able to attract to Ireland in recent years. As much as a third of the additional workforce being taken on is expected to be made up of university graduates. Mr Dominic Layden, Motorola country manager in Ireland, said that workforce skills were an important factor in choosing Ireland. The IDA does not release details of grant support to individual projects until the publication of its annual report but, in general, grant support tends to average about 25-30 per cent of overall investment in a project and will be directly linked to the achievement of job-creation targets. In announcing details of the project, Mr Ruari Quinn, minister for employment and enterprise, said that the IDA had succeeded in creating nearly 4,000 new jobs in Ireland's electronics sector last year through attracting new investments, and that some 30,000 people are now employed in the sector in more than 300 companies. Output from the sector now accounts for more than a quarter of Ireland's manufactured exports.</p>

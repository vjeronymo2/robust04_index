			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Arts: Rain stops play in Avignon - Anthony Curtis finds Moliere's Don Juan gets more than he bargained for The Don Juan of Moliere has a career that is identical with that of Mozart's Don Giovanni, not surprisingly since they both stem from the same original written by a Spanish monk. In both play and opera the Don has a faithful servitor who accompanies him on his travels, takes much of the rap for his misdeeds, and at one point swaps identities with him. But, as emerges from the new production of Moliere's comedy at Avignon that opened this year's Festival, there is a world of difference between the mood of the two works. Through the interrogation of his master, amusingly combined with deference and flattery, Moliere's Sganarelle forces him to define and redefine his position in relation to the traditional Christian tenets he has repudiated. The result is a mixture of black comedy and socratic dialogue that rips apart the basic assumptions of family life. No wonder the Church saw that the play should remain unstaged for many years and then allowed it to reach the stage only in a sanitised version by Thomas Corneille. This was in spite of the climax, as in Mozart, when the statue of the Commander whom Don Juan has killed in a duel, comes to dinner - the subtitle is Le Festin de Pierre (The Stone Feast) - and consigns him to hell. At the first night in Avignon when the stone Commander nodded his head in acceptance from his plinth there were magnificent claps of thunder and flashes of lightning. Full marks, we thought, to Jacques Lassale, the administrator of the Comedie Francaise who has directed this production. But no, the storm was for real. Then the unthinkable happened, the heavens opened and the rain poured down. There is no shelter either for actors or audience in the Courtyard of the Papal Palace and so at around midnight the play was abandoned with two acts still to go. I cannot remember rain stopping play here ever before and I have been covering this Festival for at least 10 years. Even so three acts out of five were enough to take the measure of Lassale's production. The setting could not be more simple or more effective. A cluster of conifers to the left of the stage and a small stream in front serve as the decor. Towering above them is the great medieval facade of the palace alternatively shrouded in darkness or bathed in soft yellow light. It is a formidable arena for a conflict between good and evil, expressed through the discrepancy between appearance and reality, underlined by Lassale in a series of costume changes. The Don enters in the traditional black doublet and hose of a Spanish nobleman and we observe him being stripped of this habit by the tubby cynical Sganarelle of Roland Bertin, an experienced actor who has played many roles here in previous festivals. The hero is then shaved and re-attired on stage in a colourful costume suitable for a masquerade. This Don Juan has to contend not only with the ghost of the Commander but with several historical ones, the ghosts of those great actors who have played the role in living memory - Jouvet, Vilar, Strehler among them. Avignon's new Don Juan, the Polish actor Andrzej Seweryn has been working in France since 1980. He joined the Comedie Francaise this year and he gives an exciting interpretation of the exacting role. He has grace, agility, gentleness; his striking lantern-jawed face provides a fine impassive mask to match the enormity of his utterances and behaviour. He treats the tirades as if they were nocturnes by Chopin, delivering them with delicate, subtle articulation. The same lightness of touch is evident in his bodily contact with the other characters, notably when he encounters his discarded wife Elvira. This role of the one-time nun is played by Jeanne Balibar, a young actress still a pupil of the Conservatoire: a great opportunity which she seized passionately. Clearly we are going to hear a lot more of her in the future. The later scene with the two peasant girls (Catherine Sauval and Cecile Brune) to both of whom Don Juan has promised marriage was played with a similar balletic mobility. As Don Juan removed their bonnets and let down their hair, it seemed only right and proper that they should have rejected their longstanding rustic boyfriends in order to marry him. Seweryn elegantly deflects their questions, refusing to commit himself to either by name. In the end the two women are left embracing each other, the Don having once more escaped. Lassale is on record as saying that he views the comedy as 'a kind of road movie.' Don Juan uncovers new aspects of himself with each encounter. They are marked by the director's skilful use of the elements - water into which one of his assailants is thrown, earth on which he sits, fire by the light of which he unfolds his pragmatic morality to his servant. It will be interesting to see how Lassale copes with these effects when this essentially open-air production transfers to the Salle Richelieu in Paris later this year. At least it will not be rained off there.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Cluff Zimbabwe raises Dollars 20m Cluff Resources Zimbabwe, 82.4 per cent owned by the UK-quoted mining company, is raising a 52,000 troy ounce gold loan which should raise about Dollars 20m (Pounds 13m). The cash will be used to fund an underground project at the Freda Rebecca mine in Zimbabwe and repay debt. Interest has been fixed at 5.6 per cent, substantially below the 30 per cent paid by CRZ last year. Repayment, in gold, will be in eight equal instalments over four years beginning in January 1995. The company said the Freda Rebecca underground development was projected to boost annual gold output, which was a little more than 72,000 ounces last year, to about 100,000 ounces during 1995 and should extend the mine's life to 2000. It added this was the first gold loan to be approved by the Zimbabwe government and had been granted by the Eastern and Southern African Development Bank. The UK parent also announced that Cluff Oil (Hong Kong), its 34 per cent owned associate, had accepted an offer from the Chinese government to participate through a joint venture company in a new round of oil exploration licences being offered in the East China Sea. Cluff will have a 17 per cent interest but funding for the initial two-year exploration programme will be provided by Primeline Properties of Hong Kong. Cluff has appointed Samuel Montagu as its merchant bank and James Capel as its broker.</p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Cabinet divided over speed of re-entry to system DIFFERENCES within the cabinet over the speed of Britain's return to the European exchange rate mechanism emerged yesterday, raising the prospect of a prolonged strug-gle within the Conservative party. Early in the day, the Tories' so-called Euro-sceptic wing was jubilant at remarks by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, suggesting that there were now considerable obstacles to a rapid return to the exchange rate mechanism. Speaking on BBC Radio's Today programme, Mr Lamont, one of the least enthusiastic Europeans in the cabinet, made clear that in the interim he would pursue a staunchly nationalistic policy. 'We are floating and we will set monetary policy in this country to meet our objectives and it will be a British economic policy and a British monetary policy,' he said. But later, Mr Michael Heseltine, the strongly pro-European trade and industry secretary, stressed that a long-term absence from the currency system could have serious consequences for foreign investment. 'If it was perceived that we were going to be part of a slow stream Europe, do you think all those Japanese companies would continue to invest here on the scale that they are?' he asked an interviewer. The contrast in tone came after both ministers agreed that the government's prime aim continued to centre on squeezing inflation. Mr Lamont added, however, that in the changed circumstances a secondary goal would be to help create a revival in the economy. Moreover, he gave notice that he would need to consider three factors before a return to the ERM would be undertaken. These were developments in the currency markets, changes in German economic policy that enhanced international stability and an examination of co-operation between EC governments. Mr Lamont's remarks provoked a surge in the stockmarket where traders are anticipating a further cut soon in interest rates. They also spurred Euro-sceptic backbenchers to insist that the British government rule out permanently any return to the ERM. Mr Kenneth Baker, a former Tory party chairman, joined ERM critics by insisting that the target of a single European currency by the end of the century could now be ruled out. He argued that interest rates should come down to 6 per cent. Pro-European Tory MPs stepped up their efforts to counter the onslaught, however. Mr Hugh Dykes, a federalist backbencher, argued that ERM membership remained a key to 'the country's future prosperity'.</p>

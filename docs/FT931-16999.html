			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Hopes and fears - What the bosses say .... A unified market of 344m people is now within reach of European business. What are chief executives' main hopes and fears about this milestone in European integration? What has been the impact of recent exchange rate unrest? What government measures do business people favour to help stimulate the European economy? Do companies still see the necessity for a single European currency? Is the Maastricht treaty - the focus of so much controversy in 1992 - still relevant? The FT asked 18 heads of European companies, including offshoots of US and Japanese groups, to give their views. Sir Denys Henderson, ICI (chemicals, UK): 'The single market will create a larger, more dynamic, integrated and faster growing market. We will use the opportunity to increase efficiency and lower costs. The greater scale of operations will give European companies a competitive advantage. 'Rapid Gatt agreement is the most important action to improve the business climate. The EC also needs to agree lower interest rates. 'There is a strong practical link between the Maastricht treaty and prospects for the single market. British companies risk being left behind if there is a two-speed Europe. 'The goal of a single currency remains critical to Europe's competitiveness. Recent exchange rate volatility has complicated trading, but I welcome the current more realistic sterling rate, as the pound was clearly overvalued when it entered the ERM.' Sixto Jimenez, Viscofan (cellulose casings, Spain). 'Anything that opens borders and markets is good. Not having to suffer customs checks and, one day, being able to enjoy a single currency and a single banking system will make us stronger and more efficient. The richness and cultural variety of Europe will keep markets diversified. 'If there is any common sense among Europeans, monetary union will prevail. The political elite in Europe must show leadership. If not, short-term niggardliness will block progress, and Europe will become a club of proud 'old glories', losing ground to the US, Japan and Asia.' Pieter Bouw, KLM (airline, Netherlands): 'Airlines like KLM can now establish a genuine European market with the whole of Europe as its home base. More competition will benefit the customer. 'Although liberalisation offers great opportunities, we should not underestimate the physical, financial and fiscal constraints. We must ensure that national deregulation is not superseded by fresh Community regulations. 'The EC should set limits to state aid. It is not only contrary to the treaty, but damages the whole idea of the free internal market.' Peppino Fumagalli, Candy (white goods, Italy): 'The single market will boost technological innovation and allow more efficient distribution. We have created a special company for after-sales service, operating across Europe. Over half our top managers are non-Italian. In 1992, Candy launched its first European advertising campaign with an investment of L150bn. 'For the household appliances sector, the single market will spur management integration and product standardisation. Appliances like clothes driers, now mainly produced for export, will become more commonplace in Italy. 'We have to recognise that, for Italy to be competitive, it must meet European standards for transport, communications, the civil service, education, taxation, flexible work practices and research.' Gerard van Schaik, Heineken (drinks, Netherlands): 'We aim eventually to pitch our main brands - Heineken, Amstel and Buckler - at the market as a whole, rather than operating differently in different countries. 'We believe the EMS will evolve into Emu, because over the long term this is in the interest of national economies. The EC should fight the tendency for regional or traditional products to be given protection within the Community.' Jack Schmuckli, Sony Europe, (electronics, Japan): 'Tax administrations are not ready for the 1993 initiative since the temporary VAT system, which the Commission will enforce by 1997, will not be able to cope with the changes within four years. This will cause great inconvenience for global companies operating in Europe. 'The Maastricht treaty demonstrates the national authorities' willingness to see Europe as a single entity - in line with Sony's business policy.' Pierre Suard, Alcatel Alsthom (engineering, France): 'Because European markets remain heterogeneous, European companies are subject to an extra R&amp;D and manufacturing charge of at least 10 per cent compared with our main competitors in North America and Japan, which enjoy a harmonised domestic market. Reducing this gap would be a major contribution. 'The most positive aspect of the Maastricht treaty was the prospect of economic and monetary union (Emu). Otherwise, the treaty does not give the Community the political power to carry out a balanced dialogue with those two regions. 'The most important action the EC should take is to shift from idealism to realism, for instance, by setting up an industrial strategy paralleling those of the US and Japan.' Daniel Janssen, Solvay (chemicals, Belgium): 'The single market coincides with recession, when Europe lacks competitiveness vis-a-vis the US as a result of the high value of the D-Mark. So we will see a lot of restructuring and closures. We will emerge from all this with greater productivity and lower prices. 'Everyone talks about deregulation, but in environmental policy we see regulation. It is absurd that France has decided to block the import of waste. One man's waste is another man's raw material. 'For eastern Europe, the common market is their only hope. We must proceed step by step to extend links with these countries. By 2005, the EC could have 25 members. In the meantime, competition from eastern Europe is a serious problem in both steel and chemicals.' Jose Dedeurwaerder, Interbrew (drinks, Belgium): 'Anything which produces fewer barriers to business is welcome. There will be an increasing tendency for business to concentrate and rationalise activities. 'EC member governments must focus on producing currency stability, on improving communication, and on closing the gap between themselves and individual businesses and citizens.' Sir Owen Green, BTR (industrial conglomerate, UK): 'The most important action for EC governments would be to achieve lower interest rates in 1993. The EC should urge the German government and the Bundesbank to agree and publish a common policy for their post-unification economy. 'The Maastricht treaty does not appear very relevant to us - but then, we are only businessmen. We do not think the EMS structure will 'evolve'. Rather, it may 'revolve' - by going round in circles and not getting anywhere.' Heinrich von Pierer, Siemens (engineering, Germany): 'We anticipate a major milestone when new guidelines take effect in the previously exempted sectors of transport, telecommunications and power generation. This will improve our chance of winning orders in other EC countries. 'Competitors from outside the Community will also play a major role. Therefore, European companies should be given reciprocal access to important non-EC markets. 'We welcome, in particular, that the Maastricht treaty does not support direct industrial subsidies and measures that could distort competition. 'By hedging currency dealings, Siemens was able to avoid larger losses from recent devaluations. Hedging costs, however, have reduced our earnings.' Martin Kallen, Monsanto Europe (chemicals, US): 'We have already benefited by improving our cash management across member states, and in logistics. We can now ship chemicals from Wales to Italy in an enormously less complicated way. 'The Maastricht treaty brings no specific cost benefit for businesses, therefore it has been less enthusiastically greeted. The Maastricht timetable is, however, exaggeratedly ambitious compared with the pace of economic convergence. We will get to Emu, but not this century. 'We see an undesirable shift in the European regulatory process towards categorising new products as harmful unless they are proved risk-free, regardless of their benefits. This inhibits progress. Already, for instance, biotechnology research is growing several times faster in the US and Japan than in Europe.' Jacques Raiman, GSI (computer services, France): We stand to benefit from any change in EC legislation which obliges our clients to change their software and service requirements, such as on payroll packages. 'The important thing for unregulated sectors like ours is that entrepreneurs should be free to live and breathe. If there is one thing we fear from the Europe of the future, it is the weight of national and European bureaucracies.' Loraine Krell, Replica Food (food displays, UK): 'The single market will allow us to offer the smaller foreign customer the same service as we offer to the domestic market. It will be as simple for us to send items to Milan as to Edinburgh. We will benefit from a reduced lead time for our own purchases - allowing us to reduce stock levels and improve cash flows. 'The most important step governments could take to improve the business climate would be to conclude and implement a Gatt deal.' Poul Svanholm, Carlsberg (drinks, Denmark): 'We believe the single market will lead to higher living standards, and so benefit producers like ourselves. 'Currency instability is an irritant. The Danish krone's appreciation has reduced our foreign earnings. In spite of Denmark's reservations about Maastricht, I hope the EMS will eventually develop into Emu, and Denmark will be a full member.' Gerry Murphy, Greencore (food, Ireland): 'Since there is already free trade within the Common Agricultural Policy, the single market will not have any immediate direct impact on our business. However, the market is creating greater awareness of markets for products in other member states. 'Financial transfers to the poorer states are essential to correct regional imbalances.' Fabiano Fabiani, Finmeccanica (engineering, Italy): 'We have been preparing for this new phase through rationalisation, acquisitions and technological collaboration with other groups. 'Finmeccanica favours the broad lines of monetary union since this provides a framework for currency stability. This is preferable to competitive devaluations. It also forces the politicians and trades unions to overcome the idea of easy deficit spending.' Sir David Lees, GKN (engineering, UK): 'The single market will spur trade and competition. This will benefit consumers, but place an increasing premium on companies being 'the best'. 'There will be still greater emphasis on investment in plant and equipment, product development and training. Get this right, and the single market offers much more opportunity than threat. 'The two actions which would best improve the business outlook are success in the Gatt round and a cut in German interest rates. 'A return to currency stability, whether or not through the EMS, is highly desirable. What matters is steady progress towards European economic convergence.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all classes of mobile home furnaces show that revised standards would cause a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prototypical manufacturer to have some fluctuations in short-run return on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equity from the 7.3 percent return in the base case, especially at the two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most stringent levels. Standard levels 1 through 6 are projected to produce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> short-run return on equity's of 7.2 percent, 7.3 percent, 6.8 percent, 7.3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent, 3.3 percent and 1.9 percent respectively. However, revised standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have little or minimal effect on the prototypical manufacturer's long-run  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> return on equity. Standard levels 1 through 6 are projected to produce long-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> run return on equity's of 7.3 percent, 7.2 percent, 7.2 percent, 7.2 percent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.1 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively. See Technical Support Document,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tables 5.1 and 5.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer are generally not available because most real firms are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the prototypical firm has largely the same financial characteristics (e.g.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent firms. Financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company annual reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> B. Life-cycle cost and net present value. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A life-cycle cost is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative class, life-cycle costs at all standard levels other than level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6, the max tech level, are less than the baseline unit. Of the six candidate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard levels, a unit meeting level 5 has the lowest consumer life-cycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost. See Technical Support Document, Figure 4.1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average affected consumer of $100.83 for the representative class of mobile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> home furnace; standard level 2 would reduce average life-cycle costs by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $210.08; standard level 3, by $210.16; standard level 4, by $227.91; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard level 5, by $358.96. These life-cycle cost reductions indicate that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no standard level, other than max tech, would cause any economic burden on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average consumer. At standard level 6, the average life-cycle costs are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected to increase by $34.33, compared to the base case. See Technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Support Document, Table 4.3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 10 percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact. The Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates would be beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely face in financing the purchase of mobile home furnaces. Similarly, DOE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> did not consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life-cycle cost analysis. Since any standard is to be a national standard,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE believed that national average energy prices were appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates that for all classes of mobile home furnaces, standard level 1 would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produce a net present value of $12 million to consumers. The corresponding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0net present values for standard levels 2&hyph;6 are all negative at $175 million,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $839 million, $1.39 billion, $2.86 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> See Technical Support Document, Table 3.6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> C. Energy savings. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As indicated above, standards will result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant savings of energy consumption for mobile home furnaces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> D. Lessening of utility or performance of products <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . As indicated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above, DOE established classes of products in order to assure that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards analyzed would not lessen the existing utility or performance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mobile home furnaces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

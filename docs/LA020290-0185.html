Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> PERU LEADER BACKS DOWN, WILL ATTEND DRUG SUMMIT WITH BUSH  </P> <P> President Alan Garcia said today he will attend a drug summit in Colombia on  Feb. 15 now that President Bush has promised to reduce the number of U.S.  troops in Panama to their pre-invasion levels.  </P> <P> Soon after the United States invaded Panama on Dec. 20 and toppled the regime  of Manuel A. Noriega, Garcia and other Latin American leaders protested to  Washington.  </P> <P> Garcia said at the time that he would boycott the summit, probably sending a  government minister in his place.  </P> <P> Garcia, Bush and the presidents of Colombia and Bolivia had planned to  coordinate their fight against drug trafficking at the meeting in Cartagena.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, President Bush said he would reduce the U.S. military  presence in Panama to its pre-invasion level of about 13,000 troops "well  before the end of February." He did not give a specific date.  </P></p>

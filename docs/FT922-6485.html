			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Reaching for the glittering prize: How long will black South Africans be prepared to wait for real improvements in living standards? asks Richard Lambert. And can the economy stand the strain? TEN TIMES, Nelson Mandela put the question: 'Is there anybody in this room who is opposed to this principle?' Ten times, no one budged. In one corner of the large conference hall sat State President F W de Klerk, surrounded by a huddle of earnest looking National Party ministers. Further round were the Democrats, and then the communists: the grandfatherly figure of Joe Slovo, who spent 27 years of his life in exile, next to the radical Chris Hani, who as leader of the African National Congress military wing would, a few years ago, have been shot on sight by the policemen now gathered to protect him. Over on the far side were members of the Inkatha Freedom Party, minus their leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the one notable absentee from last weekend's grand Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa). Scattered around sat a score of other groupings, some with proud histories, some forever scarred by their role in the apartheid process, some with real political power, some with none. Occasionally the atmosphere was electric, as in the silence which followed Mandela's demands that people who disagreed with his definitions of democracy should identify themselves. The mixed response to his speech - some standing and cheering, others sitting firmly in place - gave an impression of the answer to his rhetorical questions. But for the most part, the public part of last weekend's Codesa conference was numbingly dull, cliche piled upon cliche. Everyone wanted the playing fields to be levelled, invariably to their own advantage. It is no wonder that the process was laborious. Here were the nation's leading politicians trying to achieve three difficult tasks simultaneously: to establish a fair and lasting peace, to create a workable constitution, and - not least - to position themselves for the elections which must come sooner or later. You would have to pinch yourself to remember what was at stake: nothing less than the future direction of a country of 38.5m people, one which has enormous problems and even bigger potential, and which stands on the brink of a completely new political and economic environment. How great will the changes be? How long will black Africans be prepared to wait for real improvements in their often appalling standards of living? Can the economy, which has followed a decade of slow growth with three years of stagflation, stand the strain? To judge by the stockbrokers at lunch in Johannesburg's stock exchange tower, the prospects are glittering. In its new Minister of Finance, Derek Keys, South Africa at last has a successful businessman rather than an unreliable politician in the top economic job. A fair political settlement is in view; the ANC has realised that radical economic change would be a disaster; foreign capital is poised to return to South Africa in large amounts; growing wealth in the black community should lead to a decade of rapid economic growth. Few other people talk this language, and certainly not Derek Keys, who says there are no magic buttons to press. 'I don't think there is any alternative to just hard pounding,' he adds. Yet leaders in both the business community and the ANC give the impression that although the future may not be a matter of business as usual, it is not going to bring startling change. Warren Clewlow, chairman of the Barlow Rand conglomerate, believes there is general agreement about economic priorities among the main political groupings. 'In all the discussions I have one to one, I don't hear jarring suggestions,' he says. Another commonly held view is that the country's economic management has been so bad in the past, and its place in the international marketplace so unfavourable, that conditions cannot get any worse. Meyer Kahn, chairman of South African Breweries and a man rich in quotable quotes, claims that 'in a court of law, we could not be accused of handling our economy soundly over the last 40 years.' He does not expect this to change much. 'But a fair political settlement would bring peace and stability in the future. I'll settle for that.' For their part, the closer ANC leaders have been getting to power the more conciliatory they have been sounding about future policy. Nelson Mandela has been backing well away from a broad nationalisation programme; asked about the case for a minimum wage, an ANC economist gives a lecture about how much damage this would cause to employment in a country with such marked regional differences. For foreign investors, the emphasis a year ago was on obligations and investment codes. Today, they are to be welcomed with open arms. 'We've mellowed,' the ANC man explains. But it seems unthinkable that the move to democratic government will not bring great pressures for economic change. It is true that over the past decade there has been a marked increase in the share of government spending directed to blacks. Their share of total social benefits rose from 28 per cent in 1975 to 45 per cent by 1987 and a usefully higher figure today. Yet the inequalities remain startling. Public spending on white school children is still four times per head greater than on black, and large numbers of black children do not go to school at all. On one estimate, over a fifth of black adults have had no schooling, while another third received some primary education only. Gencor, the successful mining finance group, reckons that about half its workforce is illiterate. Columns of such statistics do not prepare you for a visit to the squatter camps scattered around prosperous, first world Cape Town. Mile upon mile of crudely built shacks and rutted roads, with no electricity, inadequate water supplies and sewerage, and almost no social safety nets, they can look like the end of the world. It is true that conditions in neighbouring states like Mozambique, Zimbabwe or Botswana are often at least as bleak when measured by such yardsticks as health, diet and literacy. But that is not the point. As a recent World Bank study observes: 'Black South Africa has done at best only moderately better than its neighbours despite its proximity to Africa's most dynamic economy.' This is the legacy of apartheid. The problem is that poverty and inequality cannot be removed simply by moving away from this repressive system to a non-racial democratic state. Whatever the shape of the next government, the South African economy will impose severe restrictions on its room for manouevre. The explanation lies in the record of slow growth in production and rapid increases in population. Gross domestic product rose by about 1.5 per cent a year in the 1980s, and the present recession has lasted for around three years. The budget in March projected a rise of about 1 per cent this year, but a dreadful drought and the impact of growing political violence means that a further decline now looks likely. Meanwhile, the population has been rising at about 2.5 per cent a year. The result is an enormous pool of unemployed and semi-employed labour. It's reckoned that more than two fifths of the work force have no place in the formal sector of the economy. You can see them scratching a living on the street corners if they are lucky, or just standing around if they are not. There is not much room for raising government spending, with a budget deficit this year likely to run well ahead of a March forecast which represented some 4.5 per cent of gdp. South Africans are already quite highly taxed, and with inflation still running at around 15 per cent, there is no room for an easier credit policy. The country desperately needs rapid economic growth if it is to iron out its present inequalities in the forseeable future. For example, Sam de Beer, Minister of Black Education, says that even if the economy rises by 3 per cent a year and whites are prepared to accept a sharp rise in pupil/ teacher ratios, it would still not be possible to finance equal compulsory education by the year 2000 without a substantial increase in the share of public spending devoted to education. Redistributing the existing cake will not be enough: the cake must be made bigger. The first and most crucial step will be to resolve the present political uncertainties. That will encourage domestic investment, and open the door to badly needed foreign capital. There should, too, be some dividend to come from the abolition of apartheid. It is true that cuts in defence spending are being partly absorbed by the rising cost of policing a violent society, and that the scope for cutting a bloated bureaucracy is not as great as you might think. After all, most people who work for the state are black. But a new government should no longer be tempted to throw money at vastly expensive strategic investments, such as the Mossgas oil refinery. There will be a chance, too, to deal with the corruption spawned by apartheid. An official report published this month on the Department of Development Aid, which once controlled most aspects of the lives of millions of black South Africans, concluded: 'I am satisfied that the management is not up to its task; that controls and control systems are grossly neglected; that personnel are inadequate in numbers and often quality; that planning is inadequate; that dishonesty and abuse are rife.' South Africa, in the words of finance minister Derek Keys, has for years been in a condition of economic civil war. The question is whether political peace will bring the kind of national consensus that will be necessary to persuade citizens to hold back on consumption in order to apply more to investment. Keys says that his first priority is to find areas of economic consensus, and he is clearly inclined to support some kind of business or economic forum in which government, business and labour could try to build a set of common objectives. South Africans are forever quoting models of the kind of society they would like to build: it is as if they are trying to reassure themselves that their problems are not unique. Senior government ministers talk about the Swiss political model (yes, the Swiss]). Democrats talk about Sweden, right wingers about Israel, the ANC about Malaysia, and business about Korea or Taiwan. The trouble with most of these examples is that they depend either on a high degree of social and cultural homogeneity, or on varying degrees of authoritarianism, or on both. South Africa is split by raw conflicts of interest, and the bulk of its workforce is poorly educated. Violence, political and criminal, is a national preoccupation. Suburban bungalows are swathed in metal grilles and security devices. At a liberally inclined dinner party in Johannesburg, a guest asks discreetly where he can leave his gun. So it is not surprising that even from the ANC you will here talk about the limitations of democracy. A possible straw in the wind: liberal lawyers last week expressed outrage that the ANC has agreed in principle to detention without trial during the first phase of political reform. The reality is that there are no precedents for what is happening in South Africa, and few clear signposts to the future. The main political players have an enormous vested interests in developing an agreed constitution: having gone so far they know they will sink or swim together. But their interests do not coincide so clearly when it comes to the pace and nature of the economic reforms which must follow political change. The problems are daunting, maybe even overwhelming. But just as last weekend's political convention would have been unimaginable three years ago, so it would not do to underestimate the country's capacity for change. The last word comes from SA Breweries Meyer Kahn. With a touch of the Sam Goldwyns, he observes: 'I'm not negative about the long-term future. But the quicker it comes, the better.'</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Furniture future for Ghana's forests: A company developing a downstream industry Afromosia, asanfuna, iroko, utile. . . these mysterious African names for the towering giants of Ghana's tropical forests are being tamed by a pioneer furniture exporter in the heart of the jungle. Scanstyle Mim is an unlikely candidate to be blazing a trail in Ghana's attempts to add more value to its Dollars 130m-a-year timber exports. The company's main contact with the outside world is through a crackly radio transmitter. Ghana's national electricity grid only reached the factory in Mim last year. Yet Scanstyle is responsible for more than 90 per cent of Ghana's furniture exports. Its earnings are modest - Dollars 6m last year - but the potential is huge. The company's turnover has grown six-fold since 1982. And in terms of added value, Scanstyle's furniture earns five times as much as the same volume of unprocessed timber. To date, however, few logging companies in Ghana have dared to follow in Scanstyle's path. The reason, says Mr Kwabena Pepera, the company chairman, is that logging earns more money with less risk. 'You can sell lumber to anyone, but if an important consignment of furniture is rejected, you risk bankruptcy.' Mr Pepera believes many Ghanaian manufacturers find it difficult to export because they cannot meet the quality standards demanded by overseas customers. But technology is only one of the hurdles in the export race. Local manufacturers often have little knowledge or experience of marketing their products abroad. And the financial system in Ghana is not yet geared to providing pre-export finance or long-term capital for new plant and machinery. In its own small way, Scanstyle is a textbook case of how these obstacles were overcome. The company was set up by a Norwegian in 1968, who spotted an opportunity to use the offcuts of a large sawmill in Mim to produce flooring and panelling. In the early 1980s, the Norwegian decamped to Singapore, frustrated by the government curbs on his business in Ghana. What he left behind, however, was a knowledge of the European furniture market and the quality standards required to keep customers happy. 'Under the old government controls,' Mr Pepera recalls, 'we could not export a single chair. But we had Lebanese traders coming from the Ivory Coast and paying cash to smuggle our goods through the jungle.' Times have changed. Since Ghana embraced free-market reforms in 1983, life for exporters has become easier. There is less red tape: export and import licences have been abolished; foreign exchange controls scrapped; and the cedi has been devalued, making Ghanaian exports more competitive abroad. Scanstyle began by exporting knocked-down furniture components. It moved on to assemble some of the garden furniture and chair parts at the factory before shipping them in flat-pack form. With the help of a Dollars 400,000 Japanese loan, the company has bought computer controlled lathes from Italy that will allow it to tackle more complex furniture. Mr Pepera's main headache is the fight for logging concessions. These are carefully rationed by the government because of deforestation of the country. His needs are modest compared to the appetite of the Goliaths of the logging industry, but he has only obtained permission to exploit 60 square miles of forest. He says he needs five times that area to meet export demand. Scanstyle's biggest market is the UK, where it sells garden furniture and chairs in tropical hardwoods. The company also exports to Germany, Italy and Ireland. 'The government is very strict about where and what you can cut, and the spacing between fellings,' Mr Pepera says. 'Some of the old lumber guys have been so ruthless that certain species are almost impossible to find. We are importing Afromosia from the Cameroons.' He hopes his business will expand when a government ban on the export of raw timber comes into force in 1994. Somehow, he doubts the ban will be enforced. Ghana is desperately short of foreign exchange, and timber exports earn Dollars 130m a year. Logging is the biggest money spinner after cocoa and gold. But if the government wants to promote export diversification - a key to its economic strategy - it is going to have to push loggers into downstream processing. 'Fairly soon Ghana will have to take a deep breath and decide where it wants its forestry industry to go,' Mr Pepera's son Paul, the company manager, argues. 'Indonesia banned log exports in the 1980s and the local industry responded with a tremendous investment drive into molding and furniture. Indonesia's ban was what enabled the country to cross the rubicon into value added exports.' It is what he hopes will happen in Ghana.</p>

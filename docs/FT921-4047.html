			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (News): Loophole on rents to be closed - Inland Revenue THE Inland Revenue will gain an additional Pounds 230m in the 1992-94 tax years by closing a loophole allowing companies to defer tax payments on rents, Andrew Jack writes. Since the 1970s it has become common for a company to transfer all the properties from its trading businesses to the control of a specially-created property investment company. The company then grants each trading company leases on their properties, with rents payable at the start of the new tax year. Until now the trading companies have been able to claim tax relief on rents in one year, and pay corporation tax against the rental income the following year.</p>

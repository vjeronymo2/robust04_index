			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed ZC/LL: "Safety of Nuclear Plants: Lack of </F> Personnel Within a Federal Division"]    [Text] Bern, 18 May (ATS) -- The main division for the  safety of nuclear plants (DSN) suffers from a lack of personnel.  Eduard Kiener, director of the Federal Office for Energy (OFE),  made this statement on Wednesday evening [18 May] during the  Rundschau program on the German-language television network. He  added that he had already expressed this opinion before a  parliamentary commission, but that he had not received any  answer yet.    An OFE report, which has not been published so far,  indicates  that the DSN requires 15 to 18 additional persons. Questioned  by journalists of the Rundschau program, Mr. Kiener said that if  a critical event should happen, it could be said that the DSN  does not have enough personnel. According to him, parliament is  partly responsible for this situation because of its "personnel  freeze" policy.  <H5>  Beznau II </H5>   The Rundschau program also revealed that the operation of  the  Beznau II Nuclear Plant has been modified, which has led to an  increased level of radioactivity in the pressure containers of  the reactors. [DSN director] Naegelin said this issue would be  closely examined. There will not be any increased risk. If a  negative result should appear, there is still time to take  corrective measures, he added. According to Mr. Naegelin, even  though the plant does not meet the current technical standards  for safety, the measures taken are sufficient.</p>

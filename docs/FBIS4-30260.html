			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- The ruling coalition  parties will reject a demand by the Social Democratic Party  (SDP) [SDPJ -- Social Democratic Party of Japan] that Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata immediately disband his cabinet to  reconcile with the SDP, a former member of the ruling bloc,  coalition sources said Friday [24 June].    The sources said leaders of the coalition partners met and  reached a consensus that there is no reason for the Hata cabinet  to resign en masse.    At the meeting, the minority alliance decided on policy  proposals for a new government to be proposed to other parties  not including the SDP, they said.    During talks on Friday afternoon with the ruling coalition  parties, the SDP once again called for the Hata cabinet's  resignation, the sources said. The coalition parties said they  will discuss the SDP request among themselves, they said.    The minority coalition and the SDP are meeting in an attempt  to woo the second largest opposition force back into the fold in  the face of a no-confidence vote being sought by the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP).    Hata on Thursday hinted that he is ready to resign with his  ministers if it is necessary to bring the SDP back into the  fold. The SDP left the coalition in April, giving risevernment  in four decades.    The LDP, Japan's largest political party which was driven  out  of power last August by a reformist coalition after 38 years of  rule, on Thursday submitted the no-confidence motion against the  Hata government.    The fresh round of talks between coalition partners, led by  Hata's Shinseito, and the SDP was focused on plans to raise the  3 percent consumption tax to cover income tax cuts, welfare  funding and other key financial needs.    The SDP, which opposed the consumption tax when it was  introduced in 1989, is demanding it be replaced with other forms  of indirect taxation.</p>

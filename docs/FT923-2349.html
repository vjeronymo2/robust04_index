			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Russians set for doubling in the price of oil PRICES for oil on the Russian domestic market will double in the next few days following the signing of a decree by Mr Boris Yeltsin, in an attempt to provide increased income to the hard-pressed oil producers. Mr Alexei Ulukayev, the government's economic adviser, said yesterday after a meeting of the Russian cabinet that the move would add about 20 - 25 per cent to annual inflation. Mr Seregei Vassiliev, head of the Centre for Economic Reform, said earlier this week that inflation was presently running at more than 20 per cent a month. The price rise would bring the price of oil - presently trading at between Rbs1,800 and Rbs2,200 a tonne - up to Rbs4,000-Rbs5,000. This would mean fixing the state price at the price presently obtained in the oil exchanges. Coal prices are also expected to rise by 30 per cent - an increase largely caused by the government's agreement to pay increased wages to the industrially powerful miners. Production of oil, Russia's main hard currency export, is forecast to fall again this year from last year's levels of 460m tonnes to 395m tonnes. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, said that the lack of investment in the industry would mean a further 50m tonne fall in 1993. However, the need to provide extra funds to the oil sector means a further squeeze on consumers, already experiencing a sharp drop in living standards. Mr Ulukayev sought to reassure the public by saying that gas and electricity prices would not go up, and that supplies of oil for heating during the coming winter were higher than the previous year. Further evidence of the deepening crisis in the government's finances came yesterday from Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the acting head of the Russian central bank, who told the Itar-Tass news service that the government had received only 40 per cent of its planned income in the first eight months of the year. He said: 'It's possible we will be forced to stop spending as in the budget and limit ourselves to the money we receive.' One recent estimate of the budget deficit stands at Rbs950bn. Mr Vassiliev said that tax revenues were not coming in at the rate planned, while expected revenues from privatisation are running at less than a quarter of the levels planned. However, he placed much of the blame for the gathering financial crisis on Mr Gerashchenko, and on his policy of granting credits to enterprises and other former Soviet republics. Preparations are now being made for the first state visit to Britain by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president. Mr Yeltsin is keen to undertake the visit, which is planned for November 9-11, though a final decision has not yet been taken by the Russian side and British officials yesterday would not confirm that the visit would definitely take place. However, plans are being finalised for the trip which would combine a visit to the Queen, a banquet in the City's Guildhall, with meetings with the prime minister and senior ministers. The visit is timed to coincide with Britain's turn in the chair of the European Community, though the trip will also focus on bilateral issues between the two countries. Mr Michael Heseltine, the industry secretary, will visit Moscow at the end of this month with British business leaders in order to explore the possibilities of increased commercial contacts. Mrs Gillian Shepherd, the employment secretary, has just completed a working visit in which she discussed UK aid to the fledgling and under-funded Russian employment service with Russian ministers. Western creditor nations should be able to reach an agreement on rescheduling Russia's external debt by the end of this month, or at any rate early in October, a senior US official said yesterday, writes George Graham in Washington. Mr David Mulford, US treasury under-secretary in charge of international affairs, said Russian debt would be discussed at tomorrow's meeting of finance ministers of the Group of Seven, with the hope of settling the framework for a rescheduling by the Paris Club of creditor countries. 'We hope to be able to do a Paris Club by the end of this month, or if not then, very shortly thereafter,' he said.</p>

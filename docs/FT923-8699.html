			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P downgrades debt rating of S-E Banken STANDARD &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P), the US credit rating agency, has downgraded the long-term debt of Skandinaviska-Enskilda Banken (S-E Banken), Sweden's leading private commercial bank, to A plus from AA minus. This is the second time in less than four months that S-E Banken's debt has been downgraded. S&amp;P said the decision reflected the continuing deterioration of SEB's asset quality, together with the increased pressure on earnings caused by the rapid build-up of non-performing loans, especially in the sharply declining Swedish real estate sector. The 'large build-up of non-performing loans and renegotiated loans' meant 'a more rapid decline of the bank's underlying core profitability than was anticipated'. S&amp;P also pointed out that the bank's 'historically strong level of core earnings' had come 'under considerable pressure' and this had reduced its ability to absorb higher credit losses. S&amp;P had placed the bank on credit watch on June 23.</p>

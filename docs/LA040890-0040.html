			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADDING SOME NAMES TO THE LITERARY CORRAL  </P> <P> In "The West -- A Literary State of Mind" (View, April 1), writer Frank Waters  is quoted as saying that the "golden myth of the West is an epic of cruel  conquest" (with the cavalry wiping out Indians), and Westward expansion is a  joke and blot on American history.  </P> <P> When Mormon pioneers under the leadership of Brigham Young migrated west from  Nauvoo, Ill., and first settled the Great Salt Lake valley in July, 1847, they  befriended and fed Indian tribes and carved out new settlements throughout the  West.  </P> <P> I suggest researcher-writer Waters visit the Tucson and Huntington libraries  and write another book on the 19th-Century Mormons who helped build up the  American West.  </P> <P> KENNETH LLOYD LARSON, Los Angeles  </P></p>

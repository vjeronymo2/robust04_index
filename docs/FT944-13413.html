			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Super rice' could boost harvests by 25 per cent A new breed of 'super rice' that can produce 25 per cent more grain on the same amount of land and help feed an additional 450m people a year has been developed by scientists at the International Rice Research Institute, the World Bank announces this week. The new strain is capable of yielding 5 tonnes per acre on irrigated land compared with 4 tonnes for existing varieties. If widely planted, the World Bank estimates that the new breed of rice could produce 100m tonnes more each year than is now grown. This extra rice could help feed a population boom expected over the next 30 years when demand for rice is expected to increase by 70 per cent to 350m tonnes. 'It's not possible to step up rice production dramatically by planting on new land,' said Mr Ismail Serageldin, chairman of the World Bank's consultation group on international agricultural research of which the rice institute is part. He points out that good rice land is being lost to expanding urban centres. The rice institute has developed over 300 varieties over the past 30 years. It has managed to increase the yield of its new breed by improving the grain to straw ratio of the plant. More tests need to be conducted on the new breed of rice before it can enter commercial production, but the rice researchers are already trying to cross it with other hybrids to improve yields further to a possible 6 tonnes per acre.</p>

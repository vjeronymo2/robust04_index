			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Joaquin Jose Vallarino, president of the </F> Presidential Commission for Panama Canal Affairs, by reporter  Lucy Molinar from the Palace of the Herons in Panama City; from  the "Telemetro Reports" newscast -- live]    [Text] [Molinar] Mr. Vallarino, we would like to ask you  how this commission will guarantee the country that this work,  which has taken you two years to complete, can be implemented  and that we will be ready when the time comes for us to take  over the Panama Canal?    [Vallarino] I think the best guarantee is what has been done  and what is written. It has been written in very clear and  specific words. Each recommended step is defined and explained.    [Molinar] Let us talk about specifics so that we can better  inform the people. Will a ministry or an autonomous institution  be responsible for implementing the plan?    [Vallarino] The plan is to be implemented in three stages. A  transition commission will handle the first stage. We are  recommending to the president that this commission be appointed  by decree and that it be formed by the most capable Panamanians  he can find, despite the individual's persuasion. We are  recommending the members be professionals from various fields so  that all the areas, engineering, legal, environment, will be  overseen.    [Molinar] Does this plan ensure the stability of Panama  Canal  workers?    [Vallarino] I believe this is one of the most important  things of which we must assure the Panamanian people. Those who  work for the canal will continue to enjoy the same working  conditions and benefits and will abide by the same rules and  regulations they follow today.    [Molinar] Let us talk about rules and regulations. Will they  be allowed to stop canal operations at any time?    [Vallarino] One of the nicest things that happened while we  were discussing that aspect was that union representatives went  to the Legislative Assembly and told us they agree canal  operations should never stop; therefore, we are willing to give  them the right to strike, and we can also tell the world we know  Panama Canal operations will never be stopped due to a strike.    [Molinar] Who will handle canal revenues and where will this  money go?    [Vallarino] That is also properly explained. Even though  canal administration authorities will have all the autonomy they  need, they are also asked to have direct ties with the  government and the legislative branch, via special  representatives. Financially, they will be totally independent.    [Molinar] Where will the profits go?    [Vallarino] These will first be set aside for improvements.  What is left over will go to the treasury. We are looking for a  way for the canal to produce, for the nation, at least the same  economic benefits we receive today.    [Molinar] Will it be possible to implement this plan despite  the political ups and downs? Can we overcome our political  differences and not appoint another commission, and so forth?    [Vallarino] If we all believe in democracy, the way I  believe  in democracy, the people's voice will give the orders. If the  people remain united in defense of democracy and remain united  in the message we received -- that they do not want politics to  meddle in canal administration -- then all the presidents will  have to respect those principles.</p>

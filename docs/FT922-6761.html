			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Teasing out Milan's Swiss connection: Haig Simonian on an off-shore banking probe in Italy's expanding financial scandal THE fast train for Lugano leaves Milan's vaulted central station at 25 minutes past the hour precisely. The 50-mile journey takes almost an hour-and-a-half, lengthened by passport controls and a change of engines at the Swiss border. It is quicker by car, and probably a lot more comfortable in the sort of chauffeur-driven Lancia or Alfa Romeo saloon issued as standard to senior Italian corporate or party functionaries. Either way, it is a journey which may have become familiar to many of the politicians and businessmen who have either been arrested, or are under investigation, by magistrates in Milan in what is fast becoming the country's biggest political corruption scandal since the war. Three months of investigations since the arrest in February of Mr Mario Chiesa, the Socialist administrator who spilled the beans on a still widening web of urban skulduggery, has brought the Swiss link increasingly into the open. The network of bribes paid by local companies in return for lucrative public-sector building and maintenance contracts and funnelled to the city's main political parties by apparatchiks and city councillors originated in Milan. But the trail has already led to Lugano, the capital of the Swiss canton of Ticino, which has for decades played the role of off-shore banking centre for trates believe they have stumbled upon a network of bribes and corruption which has seen at least L150bn (Pounds 68m) changing hands over recent years. While much of the money has gone into party coffers in a largely institutionalised form of percentage takes on big contracts, part has been destined for personal enrichment. magistrates sent their colleagues across the border a list of names of individuals suspected of involvement in the affair. The Swiss were asked to ascertain under new laws whether those included held bank accounts in the canton; the laws have opened up a chink in Switzerland's famed banking secrecy for funds that are believed to have been 'recycled'. Speaking on Italian radio earlier this week, Ms Carla Del Ponte, the Lugano magistrate working with the Italian authorities, confirmed that information had already been provided regarding Mr Chiesa. However, the Italian requests for information have now run aground. At a closed-doors meeting earlier this week, a committee of the Ticino bankers' association advised members to take legal action to block further requests for information. The path to Lugano has become familiar to thousands of rich Milanese over the years, who have traditionally used the town to hide money which they did not want the local tax man to see. Non-lira bank accounts are no longer illegal for Italians, and the country's fiscal authorities have, so far, taken a back seat to the magistrates in the Milan investigation. But the scandal has clearly put the Swiss on the spot and could test the scope of the more open rules on access to bank accounts. Many banks in Lugano, which draw a large number of clients from northern Italy, fear a substantial loss of business should they appear overly co-operative towards the latest requests for information. A lot of money could be at stake. Few believe the Milan affair is an isolated incident. Kickbacks on big public-sector contracts are widely believed to be endemic in Italy's biggest cities, with the money flowing to political parties in the north and to organised crime in the south. But Milan has proved particularly easy to milk in recent years. Italy's second biggest city and financial capital has enjoyed a boom in infrastructural projects, which have made it a model of sorts in Italy. Among the costliest schemes has been the third underground line, completed last year at a price of around L2,500bn. The ambitious project to build a rail-link deep under the city, which is still a long way from being realised, is now expected to cost around L4,000bn. Further projects include the expansion of the second airport at Malpensa, now forecast to cost L450bn. Meanwhile, the breathtaking renovation of the San Siro football stadium in time for the 1990 World Cup cost L180bn. The list excludes the hundreds of smaller contracts awarded for hospital modernisation or more limited new construction projects in recent years. Many were entrusted to local building companies, some of whose bosses have now been implicated in the scandal. And even less conspicuous are the thousands of renewable service contracts for public buildings. These alone probably formed as rich a vein of funds as the big public works projects now under investigation.</p>

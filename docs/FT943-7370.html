			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Probe into Sarno pollution Magistrates looking into one of Italy's worst ecological disasters have put 110 people under investigation and shut down 48 firms, police said yesterday. They said the rubbish-lined river Sarno, which empties into the Gulf of Naples just north of the Amalfi coast resort area, had for decades been the dumping ground for raw sewage and untreated industrial waste. Police said some 1,200 tonnes of sea-bound waste had been filtered out since the investigation began two months ago and all the towns and companies inspected in the area dumped their waste directly into the river. Those under investigation include the mayors of San Valentino Torio and Nocera Superiore. Judicial sources said they expected a further 100 local officials would be placed under investigation.</p>

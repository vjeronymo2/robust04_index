			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Spurs shares dip to 82p on profits downturn Shares in Tottenham Hotspur, the north London football club now 50.1 per cent owned by Mr Alan Sugar, its chairman, fell 10p to 82p yesterday on news that pre-tax profits for the six months to November 30 had fallen from Pounds 3.28m to Pounds 644,000. However, Mr Colin Sandy, finance director, said profits on continuing operations before interest rose from Pounds 242,000 to Pounds 275,000. Meanwhile a case brought by Tottenham for winding-up Edennote, a company controlled by Mr Terry Venables, Spurs' ousted chief executive and team manager, was yesterday adjourned until April, as Mr Venables plans to fight the petition. Mr Sandy said Tottenham had sought the winding-up over Pounds 335,000, which was the adjudication by the taxing master of money owed from a possible Pounds 400,000. This, plus a further Pounds 150,000 of costs over Mr Venables' claim for wrongful dismissal as chief executive last summer were provided for in last year's accounts. The Football Association is still investigating the club over player transfer dealings, but Mr Sandy said Mr Rick Parry, Premier League chief executive, did not expect the club to be relegated. Turnover fell to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 15.1m) as the proceeds from the disposal of players' registrations fell to Pounds 4.54m (Pounds 8.15m). The figure was boosted by Pounds 2.8m from the Pounds 5.5m sale of Paul Gascoigne. Interest payable was Pounds 86,000 (receivable Pounds 352,000, including Pounds 450,000 from the Gascoigne sale). Earnings per share tumbled to 2.7p (19.2p). There is no interim dividend.</p>

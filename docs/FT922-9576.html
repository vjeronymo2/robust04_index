			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: Hopewell raises HKDollars 2bn for Chinese development HOPEWELL Holdings, the Hong Kong-based property development and construction company, has raised HKDollars 2bn (USDollars 259m) from a private placement to fund a toll bridge and property developments connected to its 304km super-highway in China. The company issued 400m new shares at HKDollars 5 each, representing 9 per cent of its enlarged share capital. Response was enthusiastic, reflecting demand from international institutions for China 'plays'. Hopewell's shares have been the best performing among the Hang Seng Index constituents this year. Although it had a net cash position of about Dollars HK4bn, it is undertaking several ambitious projects throughout the region, including the Guangzhou-Shenzhen toll road project in China, its HKDollars 25bn Bangkok mass transit system and power stations in China, the Philippines and Malaysia. The latest China property developments are all linked to the company's super-highway. Hopewell plans to develop a 3.12m sq ft site adjacent to the toll road's border crossing with Hong Kong at a cost of HKDollars 300m. A further 7.75m sq ft of retail and commercial space will be developed on 12 intersections of the super-highway, taking up HKDollars 1.15bn of the new capital.</p>

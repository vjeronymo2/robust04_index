			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Iraq relents on arms suppliers IRAQ yesterday gave Mr Rolf Ekeus, the chief United Nations weapons inspector, a long sought-after list of foreign suppliers for its ballistic missile, chemical and nuclear weapons programs, AP reports from Bahrain. Mr Ekeus, a Swedish disarmament expert overseeing Iraq's destruction of non-conventional weapons, confirmed the handover on arrival in Bahrain after an eight-day mission in Baghdad. His talks with Iraqi leaders were considered crucial to Iraqi requests to lift the UN oil embargo. Mr Ekeus said there had been 'considerable progress' on Iraqi compliance with other long-standing demands contained in Gulf war ceasefire resolutions, but Iraq continued to balk at open acknowledgement of Security Council Resolution 715, which is one of the conditions set by the council for lifting the embargo. The resolution calls for long-term monitoring to ensure Iraq does not try to revive the nuclear, chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range missiles prohibited after the war. Mr Ekeus, chairman of the inspectors' UN Special Commission, said there had been 'hardly any progress' on this score because Iraq considered the resolution an infringement of its sovereignty.</p>

Part of the needed mandatory immunization vaccines arrived  yesterday, provided by the European Union. According to the  Ministry of Health, the amounts received will be sufficient to  meet requirements for the balance of the year for diphtheria and  tetanus vaccines, administered to children over eight, who were  not vaccinated so far for a variety of reasons. Furthermore, it  is expected that part of this aid will meet the need for  tuberculin tests for the last quarter of the year, used for  children in the first and eighth grades, who received the BCG  vaccine. The test will establish whether they will have to be  revaccinated.    The vaccines are to be distributed in the next few days  among  the medical centers, based on their requests. As to the other  vaccines in short supply, for mumps, smallpox, and whooping  cough, the Ministry of Health expects their arrival by the end  of the month.</p>

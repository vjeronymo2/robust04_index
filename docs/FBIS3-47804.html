But it is not different at all from the successive  military dictatorial regimes.    NODONG SINMUN says this in an article today.    The author of the article goes on:    The Kim Yong-sam group has committed crimes, selling off the  national dignity and interests further to outside forces, far  from defending the dignity of the nation and exercising its  sovereignty.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam allowed the United States to freely  use the South Korean port facilities "in case of emergency"  under the "war time host nation support agreement" and he let  the U.S. Seventh Airforce use most of the U.S. Airforce setups  which had been to be returned to South Korea.    It is the Kim Yong-sam group that begged for a permanent  presence of the U.S. Forces in South Korea, at the "summit  talks" and "annual Security Consultative Meeting" with the U.S.  master [as received] flatteringly promising to the U.S. master  to increase the annual burden share of South Korea for the  maintenance of the U.S. Forces to more than three billion  dollars, and got the U.S. troop cutback shelved. And it is  again the Kim Yong-sam traitor clique which totally opened the  South Korean rice market to the United States at the expense of  the farmers. The Kim Yong-sam clique renounced the claim for  the liquidation of the colonial past by the Japanese  imperialists and their compensation to the "comfort women for  the Army" and unilaterally declared economic opening to Japan,  thus flinging open the door to the Japanese reactionaries who  are pushing forward a military power building and nuclear  armament and seeking overseas expansion.    The Kim Yong-sam group has trampled upon the desire of the  people for democracy with the bayonet, maintaining the  anti-democratic fascist dictatorial system. Leaving intact the  "National Security Law", an anti-democratic fascist law, the  abolition of which is demanded so strongly by the people and  keeping such repressive tools as the "Security Planning Board"  and the "secret affairs command", it is totally blocking the  movement of popular masses of all walks of life with the "new  security-oriented rule" which puts the "security-oriented rule"  of the "Sixth Republic" military dictatorship into the shade.    The Kim Yong-sam group claims that the "Democratic Liberal  Party", as the ruling party, is leading "changes and reforms" in  the van. But it is a small group of privileged men propping up  the colonial fascist dictatorship in South Korea.    "Civilian" fascist dictatorship little different from the  successive military dictatorship has been established in South  Korea today.    In the "unification policy" the Kim Yong-sam group, just as  the successive military dictators did, is trampling underfoot  the desire of the people for reunification and pursuing  North-South confrontation, not national unity.    Turning down the magnanimous proposals of the North, it  completely stopped the dialogues and cooperation between  authorities of the North and the South, which had been kept  going even under the dictatorship of the "Fifth Republic" and  "Sixth Republic," under the pretext of "suspicion of nuclear  development by the North". Moreover it committed crimes against  reunification by blocking at the point of the bayonet  North-South student talks and the fourth pan-national rally in  Seoul, which were being promoted at the civilian level. It has  frequently staged large military exercises against the North in  league with foreign forces and is leading the North-South  relations to the dangerous brink of war under the pretext of the  "nuclear issue" of the North, crying for "a military  countermove" and "an international cooperation system".    As a result, after Kim Yong-sam the traitor took office, the  national independence has been further violated, with the  humiliating policy of depending on outside forces stepped up,  and the democratic civil rights of the people have been stamped  out, with "civilian" fascistization stepped up, and the desire  of the people for reunification has been trampled upon with the  intensification of North- South confrontation.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam must act with discretion, clearly  knowing that it is not a means of prolonging his days to resort  to fascist repression and treacheries under the false "civilian"  slogan.</p>

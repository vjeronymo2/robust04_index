			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Learmonth &amp; Burchett plans to concentrate on US Learmonth &amp; Burchett Man-agement Systems, the USM-quoted computer services company, is switching its focus to the US. It is selling its UK general consulting division and increasing its US shareholdings, writes Nigel Clark. The moves were announced at the same time as reporting losses of Pounds 746,000 for the year to April 30, against profits of Pounds 1.61m. Turnover was Pounds 26.4m (Pounds 23.6m) including Pounds 3.81m (Pounds 4.26m) from discontinued activities. The shares lost 40p to close at 85p. The consulting division is being sold to Parity, which yesterday confirmed its change of name from Comac, for Pounds 1.35m cash plus Pounds 400,000 under a software licence agreement. The division reported trading profits of Pounds 438,000 on turnover of Pounds 3.8m in the year to end-April. Net assets at July 6 were valued at Pounds 27,000. Learmonth is raising a net Pounds 2.3m through a 1-for-5 rights issue of 3.63m shares at 70p. Mr Rainer Burchett, chairman, and Mr Roger Learmonth, chief executive officer, with others, are not taking up their rights in favour of Bessemer Venture Partners III, which is acting on behalf of a US consortium. Bessemer is also underwriting the issue. Following the rights the consortium will hold between 7.9 and 16.7 per cent of the enlarged capital. It may subsequently increase its holding to 29.9 per cent. Over the last three years the focus of Learmonth has been switching to software sales particularly in the US. The new operational centre will be in Houston, although because of the UK quote Mr Burchett will be based in the UK. Mr Learmonth will travel between the UK and US and Mr John Bantleman, chief executive of the US company, becomes group chief operating officer. In due course the company may consider moving to a US stock market quote. Problems in the UK and continental Europe were blamed for the fall into losses in 1993-94. Corrective action was taken towards the end of the year which will have an effect in the present year. Losses per share were 3.3p (earnings 7p) and the dividend is passed (0.75p).</p>

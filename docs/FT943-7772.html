			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Arts: A day in the life of a festival groupie - Voluptuous paintings, sensuous music and sex on the Fringe as the Edinburgh Festival enters its second week / Alastair Macaulay avoids the vampires but finds just about everything else At 7.am: rise; and shine; and write about yesterday. 10.10 am: a 20-minute walk along the links and the meadows towards the Queens Hall and breakfast. The longer I work each morning, the later I set off, and the less time for coffee and croissants. On some occasions my mouth has still been full as the morning's artist ascends the platform. 11 am Queen's Hall. (Official Festival.) Or, on this occasion, four artists: the Borodin Quartet. This year, at Edinburgh, is Beethoven year, and the Borodin players are giving morning and evening all-Beethoven recitals. This has its fascinations, especially in comparing early Beethoven with late. One music-critic chum, however, says 'I can't bear the moral certainty of Beethoven and the Germans'. I don't agree, since Beethoven's music to my ear has plenty of questioning, not least in the quartets; and, anyway, I am enough of an idealist or zealot to be a sucker for what moral certainties that he does offer - as in Fidelio or the Fifth Symphony. But debates about such matters are part of why I love coming to the festival. It might be better if the debate was helped along by programming Beethoven in context - in particular of Haydn and Mozart, and of Schubert and Schumann. Still, an all-Beethoven concert contents me much (and the all-Fidelio day thrilled me to the marrow). 12.30 am The music critic who cannot abide Beethoven also cannot abide Indian food: in which case it is no-go to the excellent Indian vegetarian restaurant near the Queen's Hall. Today, we plump for echt Scottish food in the Grassmarket: for me, haggis with tatties and neeps. 2 pm Assembly Rooms. Off Out. (Festival Fringe.) All about prostitutes and their men. Are most fringe plays about sex? If not, I have an uncanny knack in avoiding the chaste ones. This year has a bumper crop of smutty titles - Ilsa, Queen of the Nazi Love Camp, Dudes with Dicks, etc . . . Several of those with harmless titles turn out to cover one or more variety of sexual perversion. (When clocking in at the Fringe press office this year, I said 'I can't wait to see Vampire Girlie Poofs of Sodom.' A press officer said 'Oh, are you going to all four vampire shows this year?') For Off Out, the author is Gill Adams, the company is Hull Truck. Those of us who do not frequent the company of prostitutes may find an occasional dose of this kind of thing salutary; my dosage, however, has been quite regular, and though this play is sound enough it takes me nowhere other plays have not taken me before. 3.30. pm. Walking from the New Town to the Old, I bump into several colleagues in succession. 'Have you seen anything wonderful?' comes the question. 'Not so far,' I reply. 4.30 pm. Pleasance. A Midsummer Night's Dream (Fringe.) I have also been told on no account to miss the Ukrainian company Theatre-on-Podol. In the queue to see its 100-minute version of Shakespeare's comedy, I meet two Canadians whom I told of the good word about Podol last night. They tell me that they're glad I'm here because if it's no good they'll lynch me. Oh dear. Well, it is A Midsummer Night's Dream, but the further it departs from Shakespeare the more enthralling it becomes. (An odd touch comes when the rustics switch from Ukrainian into Shakespearian English for Pyramus and Thisbe: eg: 'I zank zou, Moon, for zy glattering beams,' etc . . .) Theseus is sick; he and his court dream the story of erotic magic and fairies in the wood. Later, when Bottom &amp; Co. play Pyramus and Thisbe at court, Theseus suddenly takes cruel revenge on Bottom for having made it (even if in ass's form) with Hippolyta-Titania; he stops the play and hands Bottom-Pyramus a real sword to kill himself with. So Bottom-Pyramus dies the noble Athenian way, and Flute-Thisbe follows suit; Hippolyta is aghast but powerless. Suddenly, however, Bottom and Flute spring back to life; they were good enough actors to fake death; and the joke, or dream, was on the nobles. All which turns the play into a Marivaux-type play about heart and heartlessness. The lights go up. Oh dear. The Canadians are tetchy. They are in Edinburgh because of Robert Lepage and his new Seven Streams of the River Ota. They think Lepage's Dream was definitive and poetic and Shakespearian, and they are cross because the Podel version is not. Nervously, I encourage them to talk Lepage, but this does not help matters. Like most people, they did not like The Seven Streams. I scarper before they decide to lynch me after all. 7.30. pm. Playhouse Theatre. Miami City Ballet dancing Balanchine. (Official.) To say that this year's festival includes the only three dance companies in the world I now care about is to exaggerate, but not much. (Mark Morris and Merce Cunningham are the other two.) Tonight reminds me what I had almost forgotten: that Balanchine ballets are, or should be, constantly dramatic and poetic illuminations of space itself. Also of music. 11 pm Traverse Theatre. Killer Joe. (Fringe.) More sex. Also, in this case, a hired killer, nudity, adultery, and double-crossing. There is even that rarest Fringe commodity, virginity - though not for long. The play ends with the ex-virgin going berserk with a gun. After she has shot most of her nearest and dearest she aims the gun at the hired killer who she meant to marry and announces 'I'm pregnant.' It is acted, well, by Hired Gun Theatre from Chicago, and set in a trailer park in Texas. My date, a New Yorker, tells me: 'All Chicago theatre is like that.' She explains why, but l am too tired to take it in. We stagger home. There are a million messages on the answering machine, all from fringe companies doing vampire shows at half-past-midnight this week. But at 1 am, my head hits the pillow like lead.</p>

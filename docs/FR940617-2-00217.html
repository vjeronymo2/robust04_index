			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA Regional Administrators will select grant recipients for projects with federal environmental education grant funding of $25,000 or less, taking into account the recommendations of the regional environmental education coordinators who will base their recommendations on the factors discussed above. The Associate Administrator for Communications, Education, and Public Affairs at EPA headquarters will select the grant recipients for projects with federal environmental education grant funding of more than $25,000 and up to $250,000, taking into account the recommendations of the Environmental Education Division Director who will base the recommendations on the factors discussed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> W. How and when will I be notified about the status of my proposal? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Headquarters and each regional office set up their own processes for notifying applicants about the status of their proposals. Our goal is to keep applicants informed as much as possible about the status of their proposals and to assist those applicants who do not receive funding to successfully compete in future years. To this end, all applicants will be notified (in mid-December 1994) after their pre-applications have been received and entered into a computerized data base, and again (in late April to early May 1995) after awards have been announced. To the extent possible, EPA will also provide applicants with feedback on those proposals which were screened out of the process early and on how proposals were evaluated. The degree to which EPA can provide such feedback will vary among EPA offices depending upon the availability of resources to conduct these activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> X. Where may I obtain more information on possible sources of funding other than this program? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The large number of pre-applications EPA received in Fiscal Years 1992, 1993, and 1994 demonstrates the strong demand for funding environmental education projects. EPA expects an equally large demand for funding for Fiscal Year 1995. Unfortunately, EPA alone cannot meet this demand. Thus, in cooperation with EPA, the North American Association for Environmental Education (NAAEE) has developed a publication called ``Grant Funding For Your Environmental Education Program'' which provides strategies for identifying potential sources of funding. This publication can be purchased for a $5.00 fee by writing to NAAEE, Publications and Member Services, P.O. Box 400, Troy, Ohio, 45373. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section VII. Grant Recipient Activities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Y. When can I begin incurring costs? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Grant recipients may begin incurring costs on the start date that is identified in your grant agreement with EPA. Since EPA plans to announce awards in the Spring of 1995, EPA recommends that you do not plan to begin incurring costs until June of 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Z. When must proposed activities be completed? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA strongly encourages grant recipients to complete their projects within the time period specified in the pre-application. Extensions may be granted only in extenuating circumstances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> AA. May an applicant request Fiscal Year 1995 funds for a project that extends beyond a one-year budget period? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pre-applications submitted to EPA regional offices for up to $5,000 may request funds for only a one-year budget period. Pre-applications submitted to EPA regional offices or headquarters requesting funds of more than $5,000 may request funds for up to a two-year budget period, although EPA strongly encourages applicants to request funds for only a one-year budget period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> BB. Who will perform projects and activities? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act requires that projects be performed by the applicant or by a person satisfactory to the applicant and EPA. All pre-applications must identify any person other than the applicant that will assist in carrying out the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> CC. What reports and work products must grant recipients submit to EPA and when are they due? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All grant recipients must submit three copies of their final report and three copies of all work products to the EPA project officer within 30 days after the expiration of the budget period. This report will be accepted as the final report unless the EPA project officer notifies you, within 30 days of your submittal date, that changes must be made. Grant recipients with projects that have a two-year budget period must also submit a progress report at the end of the first year. Grant recipients with a federal environmental education grant share greater than $5,000 may also be required to submit a quarterly or semi-annual progress report. Specific report requirements will be identified in your award agreement with EPA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DD. What does EPA plan to do with the grant recipients' final reports and final work products? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Copies of all final reports and final work products will be assembled in a central library at EPA headquarters. EPA will evaluate these final reports and final work products and may disseminate these items to others to serve as model programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

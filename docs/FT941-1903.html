			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Fags held back by lower copper prices Sharply lower international copper prices held down the 1993 profits of Antofagasta Holdings, which has mining, banking, rail and water distribution interests in Chile. The group's pre-tax profits slipped from Pounds 23.5m to Pounds 23.1m. Earnings per share increased by 22.5 per cent to 73.5p, however, after a strong performance by associate companies, reflecting growth in the Chilean economy. Antofagasta is lifting the total dividend by 1p to 21p with a final payment of 15p (14p). Pre-tax profits of the group's mining operations fell from Pounds 6.65m to Pounds 1.51m. The directors pointed out that during last year the average global copper price fell by 16 per cent from Dollars 1.03 per lb to 87 cents. In December the group's Michilla mining operations were merged with those of Lince, and ore from both mines is now processed through a solvent-extraction-electro-winning plant at Lince. This process was not previously available to Michilla. A Pounds 7.28m provision has been made for the write-down of mining assets associated with the previous process. Pre-tax profits from the railway operations increased from Pounds 3.37m to Pounds 4.1m and income from associated undertakings was up from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 15m. There was an Pounds 8.25m profit on disposal of part of Banco O'Higgins, merged last year with the Chilean subsidiary of Banco Central Hispanoamericano of Spain (CentroHispano Bank). Group turnover was up from Pounds 72.1m to Pounds 86.7m. Administration expenses jumped from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 18.6m, mainly because of the inclusion of an extra Pounds 4m costs at the Lince mine which became operational from only the second half of 1992. Another Pounds 1m in extra costs was incurred from the closure of Michilla.</p>

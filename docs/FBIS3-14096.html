The armies of the former North and South Yemens have not  merged since the two countries unified in May 1990 and there  have been frequent clashes between the sides in recent months.    The plane was not hit as warning shots were fired as it  overflew units from the northern al-'Amaliqah [Giants] brigade  based [in] Abyan, in southern Yemen, the sources said.    The country's rival leaders have been involved in a long  running feud, and tension has risen with the deployment of the  rival armies in each other's territory.    The shooting happened a few hours before a mutual news  blackout on such incidents was imposed by the two sides.    President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his ruling General  People's Congress from the north have been at loggerheads with  Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid's Yemeni Socialist Party from  the poorer south for seven months.</p>

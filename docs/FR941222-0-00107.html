			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nine comments were received opposing the standard that mailings of heavy letter pieces be 100 percent delivery point barcoded. Eight commenters stated that 100 percent delivery point barcoding would discourage or inhibit them from participating in the test and requested that barcoding levels be set at the 85 percent level now generally applicable to Barcoded rate letter mailings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seven commenters stated that 100 percent delivery point barcoding would require splitting their mailings into two streams_one delivery point barcoded stream and one not. Several commenters stated that splitting the mail into two such streams would negate the benefits of the automation rate. One commenter stated that his company already splits the mail into two streams and meets the 100 percent requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four commenters stated that no major mailer today has been able to ZIP+4 code 100 percent of its mailing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Postal Service believes that the requirement for 100 percent delivery point barcoding of all heavy letter mail is necessary. As part of an effort to get a barcode on all mail, the Postal Service routinely processes on an optical character reader (OCR) all mailpieces rejected from barcode sorters in an effort to read the delivery address and print a barcode in the lower right corner of the mailpiece. However, heavy letter mail will not run through OCRs; attempts to process and barcode such mail on an OCR revealed that significant damage occurred to the heavy letter pieces and that any barcodes printed in the barcode clear zone by the OCR were often unreadable. (The increased thickness caused the bottom edges of the heavy letter mail envelopes to be rounded and to buckle when bent. Because of the curvature and irregular surface created by the rounding and buckling of the heavy mailpiece, barcodes printed in the lower right corner of such mailpieces by the OCR were outside the working specifications of postal barcode readers and, as a result, useless for automated processing.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The additional OCR processing of non-delivery point barcoded heavy letter mail, the labor to repair damaged pieces, and the ensuing manual or mechanized handling of that mail amount to unreasonable additional costs for the Postal Service, well beyond that appropriate for Barcoded rate mail. As a result, the proposed rule's provisions for a 100 percent delivery point barcoded mailstream for heavy letter mail will be retained in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Follow Current Postal Requirements for Heavy Letter Mail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Six commenters stated that the heavy letter mail trial period should be run using the current standards for automation rate mail and that no additional constraints should be imposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Postal Service believes that modification of the current standards for automation-compatible mail are necessary based on the results of controlled tests already performed on heavy letter mail as previously described. If appropriate additional standards are not imposed on heavy letter mail, consistent with the results of earlier tests, the Postal Service believes that live mail testing will have no chance for success and that greater customer dissatisfaction would result than may occur with the heavy letter mail standards adopted by this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Barcode Window Placement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter objected to extending the barcode window to the bottom of the envelope.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The section referred to by the commenter applies only to lower right corner barcode windows. The Postal Service does not intend to add new standards to DMM C840.6.0, only to limit the use of lower right corner barcode windows to mailpieces weighing 3.0 ounces or less.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Requirements for Identification of Test Mail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before the Postal Service can determine whether a permanent increase in the maximum weight for barcoded letter mail is appropriate, it must determine whether the impact of heavy letter mail is acceptable. Accurate evaluation of the test data will depend in part on the Postal Service's ability to identify, measure, and monitor heavy letter mail as it enters and moves through the mailstream. Accordingly, test participants will be required to take specific measures to identify heavy letter mail to enable the Postal Service to gather the necessary data for this test. Although not specifically discussed in the proposed rule, the importance of mail identification became evident as the comments were being reviewed, and provisions requiring identification are being introduced in the final rule as reasonable and logical elements of the test process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, the Postal Service will require that each container of heavy mail be clearly identified when submitted by the mailer. Pallets, general purpose mail containers, and other similar equipment used to transport trays of heavy letter mail will require labels (placards) bearing the words ``HEAVY LETTER MAIL'' in letters not less than 1/2 inch high. These labels must be white or light-colored stock, not smaller than 8 by 11 inches, and placed on two adjacent sides of the pallet or other equipment. Each tray of heavy letter mail must also be identified by a flag (similar to a separator card) clearly marked ``HEAVY LETTER MAIL'' and placed in front of the contents of the tray. No marking will be required on the pieces of heavy letter mail themselves other than as required by the class or rate claimed, or by the postage payment method used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants in the heavy letter mail test will also be asked to provide documentation for any heavy letter mailing exceeding 100,000 pieces. Requested information includes the mailer's name and contact person for test information, the mailing's contents (size, weight, volume, level of presort, and proportion of heavy letter mail), and the mailing's distribution (place(s) of mailing and destination ZIP Code ranges). This information, which should be provided to the address below at least 3 weeks before mailing, will allow the Postal Service adequate time to conduct on-site evaluation and data collection for test mail. Documentation of heavy letter mailings should be addressed to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manager Customer Mail Preparation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USPS Headquarters Rm 6912,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Washington DC 20260&hyph;6805.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If heavy letter mail is damaged in processing during this test period, the mailer will be asked to recall the damaged pieces before delivery (by completing Form 1509) to allow their examination for evaluation of both the cause of the damage and possible remedies for that cause.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 111  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Postal Service.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons discussed above, the Postal Service hereby adopts the following amendments to the Domestic Mail Manual, which is incorporated by reference in the Code of Federal Regulations (see 39 CFR part 111).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 111_[AMENDED]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

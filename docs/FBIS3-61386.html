			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Kisherin by Viktor Starik; place </F> and date not given: "`The Main Policy Is the Economy'"]    [Text] Our paper has already informed readers that a  new social and political organization--the Economic Revival of  Moldova Party--has been formed in the city of Belts. A sponsor  of the formation of the new party is the well-known entrepreneur  A. Kisherin, head of the Kisherin &amp; Co. concern. Our own  correspondent in Belts met with Mr. Kisherin and asked him to  answer a number of questions.    [Starik] Aleksandr Alekseyevich, as far as I know, you were  never a member of any party or involved in politics previously.  Why did you, a prosperous, respected person, doing what you like  best, want to get into....    [Kisherin] Do not go on, I know what you are going to  say--politics is a dirty business. And I agree, but only when  ambitious people who are backed by nothing other than a set of  populist phrases and slogans take up politics. They, truly, make  all kinds of promises and quite unconcernedly go about their  business, enjoying the blandishments of power. I ask forgiveness  for the excessively strong language, some people will not like  it, naturally, but speaking openly, plainly is in my nature.  This is my problem and my good fortune. I have had unpleasant  situations and have made enemies, but even more have I found  friends, who like my candor. They trust me and believe me. This  was a factor that brought me to the party.    I never was, truly, a member of any party. I was involved in  the economy and I understand some things here and I can see that  it is currently on the brink of ruin. Struggling alone makes no  sense. We have assembled a team of fellow thinkers who evaluate  events identically and who know how to find a way out of the  impasse situation.    [Starik] You see light at the end of the tunnel, then?    [Kisherin] Yes, together we have formulated a program for  the  extrication of the republic's economy from the impasse. We are  publishing this program and will not, therefore, touch on it  now. Specially since we will not be revealing any special  truths: We will simply struggle to ensure that the manufacturer  and entrepreneur may work efficiently and productively,  manufacture output, pay people, and well, for their work, and  sell the commodities where there is demand for them.    [Starik] This is in the sphere of the economy. What does  your  party offer in the social and political plane?    [Kisherin] It seems to me that our society simply cannot rid  itself of the complexes of the socialist system, when everyone,  be he of Solomonic wisdom or an outright slacker, must be  supported. At the expense of the state. It is time to understand  that the main policy in all spheres should be the economy. It  should put man at the forefront. If we resolve economic  problems, political problems, the social problems will disappear  of their own accord.    You took a stab at me here, saying I am a prosperous  individual. Yes, I can allow myself to take my family to Miami,  Switzerland, wherever I like. No problems. But why should others  have them--young families, students, old people who have spent  all their lives working for this system, and large families that  cannot now make ends meet, and the state has forgotten about  them. It was for the sake of social justice that we created the  Economic Revival Party, and it will struggle for a better life  for all strata of society and influence government policy in  this respect. And seek a preponderance in favor of the working  man.    Look what is happening, after all: Production is grinding to  a halt, and people capable of working well are finding  themselves on the street, not to mention old people, the infirm,  and children. And why? Because some people wanted to play at  politics for politics' sake. Having totally forgotten about  economics. But it does not allow itself to be dependent on  political ambitions. It is supported on its own laws, which no  demonstration or edict can abolish. We believe, therefore, that  the time has come for people who have proven by action that they  know how to manage to come to power. If only in the example of  their own enterprise, plant, or factory. Those who are called  the bread and salt of the economy.    Our information: The Kisherin &amp; Co. concern is an  enterprise of a broad agro-industrial profile. It is known as  one of the republic's highly profitable enterprises with a  well-funded social infrastructure. Average wages in the concern  constitute R150,000 (this material prepared before the money  exchange). More than 500 new jobs have been created in the past  two years. Aside from its main profile--the cultivation of  agricultural products--the concern has a network of commercial  stores selling consumer goods. The production of packing crates,  which have helped the farms of the republic considerably in  saving and selling what they have grown, has been organized here  as of spring of this year.    [Starik] So in creating the party you set your sights on  acquiring power?    [Kisherin] I emphasize once again that there should be at  the  helm of the state competent and decisive people who know  precisely what needs to be done. And the interests of whose  party they represent are secondary. Just as long as the people  believe and support them.    [Starik] It is being said that the Economic Revival of  Moldova Party is a millionaires' party.    [Kisherin] Ah, this habit of pinning on labels! People are  still afraid of becoming bourgeois and appearing, according to  stereotypes, like bad little boys. What is wrong, pray, in a  person getting on thanks to his intellect, ability, know-how,  and enterprise. Not by thievery, but by his personal attributes.  Why is being a millionaire in our Sovman consciousness  considered a vice, and in America people are proud of this and  aspire to wealth? What, don't they understand anything, those  people across the ocean? But we have digressed.    There are in our party many industrialists, entrepreneurs,  bankers, leaders of state-owned enterprises and private firms,  specialists, and many ordinary workers and peasants. And they  came to us voluntarily in order to establish together a normal  life and in order that each of us, be he a member of the  Economic Revival Party or not, may hope to become a millionaire.    [Starik] Are you yourself, Mr. Kisherin, a millionaire?    [Kisherin] It is somewhat difficult becoming a millionaire  with our permanent economic disorders and almost regular  monetary reforms. But I am able to provide my family with a  decent living and have a foreign car in the garage and money to  enable me to feel in charge of the situation in any country.  Everything earned by the concern is constantly being put to work  and is making profits. For me and my subordinates. Such is the  law of the market economy.    Decent wages should be received not just by the workers of  the Kisherin concern, but also by the other inhabitants of our  republic. And this is possible on one condition: the  unrestricted development of enterprise. People are reluctant to  understand this as yet, unfortunately. There is much work to be  done by our party, using facts and figures, for this simple  truth to triumph. Democratically, without any social upheavals.    [Starik] Aleksandr Alekseyevich, your concern is known also  for its extensive charitable activity. The church in  Drokiyevskiy Rayon's village of Kotovo was restored with its  money, and you support Belts television, the Yunost movie  theater, artistic groups of the city and the republic,  athletes.... Will not your assistance grow scarce in connection  with the formation of the party? After all, it could be that  some of the resources will be needed for the party coffers.    [Kisherin] A party, if it is based on certain economic  principles, should support itself. Plus the dues and personal  contributions of its members and organizations, but only for the  accomplishment of program tasks. We have no intention of  maintaining a bureaucratic machinery like the former rayon and  city party committees. Everyone, not apparatchiks, should work  with the masses.    As far as the charity is concerned, we will continue this  program. Within the framework of the Kisherin &amp; Co. concern  and  also within the framework of party activity.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Dunkel puts off top-level Gatt talks MR Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, has postponed until next Tuesday a meeting of senior trade negotiators in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalising talks. The top level Trade Negotiations Committee had been planned for Friday. The aim is to give US and European Community negotiators more time to edge forward on a tariff deal, which could then pave the way for early completion of the six-year-old Round. Trade officials want to present the Clinton administration, which takes office on Wednesday, with as much of the Round sewn up as possible. However, it is now inevitable that a large amount of unfinished business will be bequeathed to the inexperienced Clinton trade team, and negotiators are not optimistic that the Round can be concluded in time to catch the March 2 expiry of the US administration's current negotiating authority. US and EC officials said yesterday they would continue to work for a tariff agreement over the next few days, but both sides have said the other is not being sufficiently forthcoming. Mrs Carla Hills, President Bush's trade representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, spoke on the telephone on Tuesday after negotiations in Geneva reached an impasse, but officials yesterday were downbeat about the prospects for a deal. The main stumbling-block remains textiles where the EC is demanding a 50 per cent cut in the highest US tariffs but is refusing US demands for a similar percentage cut in the Community's own lower tariffs. Washington, which wants industrialised countries to scrap tariffs in a wide range of sectors, says Brussels is not offering enough on wood, aluminium, medical, scientific and agricultural equipment and electronic items such as semiconductors and photocopiers. The Uruguay Round target is for overall tariff cuts of a third, but the US wants to do this through a series of sectoral deals while the EC prefers lowering tariffs across the board with bigger cuts for high tariffs. The two sides expect to meet again today when Mr Dunkel will also resume talks with a core group of about 20 countries to take stock of other outstanding issues in the Round. Most of these concern the US, but India is challenging the terms of the draft textiles accord and Japan and South Korea object to opening their closed rice markets.</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / World Trade News: UK and Netherlands sign gas agreement The UK and the Netherlands yesterday signed a treaty which will lead to the first export of UK gas to continental Europe later this year, a move seen as a possible first step in the development of a European energy market, writes Neil Buckley in London. The treaty gave the go-ahead to development of the Markham Field, operated by a Dutch subsidiary of Lasmo, the UK oil exploration and production company. The field, with reserves of 700 bn cubic feet, straddles the UK/Netherlands median line, requiring inter-governmental agreement on the development plan, allocation of reserves, and issues such as safety and inspection, before the field could be developed. Gas will be exported from the North Sea field via a pipeline to Den Helder, in the Netherlands. The majority will be sold to Gasunie in the Netherlands, with the rest going to Wintershall in Germany.</p>

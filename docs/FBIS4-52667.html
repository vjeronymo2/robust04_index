			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- Korean film studios have  recently released many feature films of high ideological and  artistic value.    The 17th and 18th parts of the multi-part feature film "The  Nation and Destiny" recently released by the Korean film studio  are showing at cinema houses throughout the country.    These parts of the film deal with the life of Ho Chong-suk  who was a well-known woman political activist of Korea.    Born into a patriotic lawyer's family in Seoul, Kyonggi  Province, she (the heroine of the film) joins in the communist  movement as a girl. But she has to experience twists and turns  for the absence of an illustrious leader.    The film gives a keen anatomy of the tragic situation of the  early communist movement in the 1920s which was divided due to  factional strife for leadership, and eloquently tells the truth  that only under the guidance of a wise leader can a country lost  to outside forces be retaken and the nation be saved as well.    Among the films released by the studio are "The General Clad  in Red", the second part of "Japanese Invasion in 1592", a  feature film about Kwak Chae-u of the aristocratic class origin,  commander of the volunteers who organized volunteers with  patriotic-minded average people, transcending the difference in  caste, and valiantly fought the Japanese aggressors, and "Looks  of a Party Member", a feature film showing a party cell  secretary at a fertilizer factory.    The Korean February 8 film studio released a feature film  "Political Commissar of the 8th Regiment" (two parts).    The film represents on an artistic canvas a historical  occurrence in the mid-1970s out of the brilliant career of  Comrade Kim Il, a staunch communist revolutionary fighter and  prominent activist of the party and the state who remained  unfailingly loyal to the party and the leader, to the country  and people till the last moments of his life since he  participated in the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle under  the guidance of the great leader President Kim Il- song.    It truthfully shows that loyal subjects are brought up in  the  bosom of a great leader and their lives are exalted in holding  the leader in high esteem.    A feature film "The Daughter of Veterans" based on a story  about a girl teacher who volunteers to be the daughter of a  disabled veteran couple without anyone to rely on and looks  after them with the utmost care, leaves deep impressions upon  young men and women.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- The Europeans are playing  hardball with Korean automakers by threatening to strip them of  their Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) status for car  imports.    The European Union (EU) is reacting sensitively to Korea's  fast advancement into its market, a Foreign Ministry official  said Monday.    The ACEA (Association of European Automobile Manufacturers)  recently submitted a recommendation to the European commission  urging it to lift GSP privileges for Korean car imports.    The ACEA, joined by such major European automakers as Fiat  of  Italy, Renault of France and Rover of Britain, also asked for an  anti-dumping investigation of Korean car exporters in the  recommendation.    Korea exported 90,000 cars to Europe last year while  importing 500 units. The European Union has repeatedly called  on Seoul to rectify the trade imbalance.</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Letter: Tax relief plea for head offices Sir, It is quite proper for multinational companies to review their HQ operations to determine: whether the cost is really necessary and adds value; whether the function should be delegated to an operating entity. However, if at the conclusion of the review the function and expenditure are retained at the centre, in what jurisdiction does the multinational company obtain a tax deduction for the expense? In his interesting article, ('The myth of the bloated head office', March 5) Christopher Lorenz does not mention that most multinational companies have difficulty in obtaining a tax deduction for centrally incurred costs which benefit not only the parent company but also many of the operating subsidiaries. Failure to obtain a tax deduction for the expense considerably increases the net costs of an HQ function. A gross-up factor of only 33 per cent, using the UK corporate tax rate which is lower than most, is not an inconsiderable added cost] It is high time that Revenue authorities recognised that a cost incurred on revenue account ought to be deductible somewhere.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statement of Consideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provisions proposed to be revised are the supply plant shipping percentages for the months of September 1994 through February 1995. The proposed action would reduce the amount of milk that supply plants must ship to pool distributing plants by 10 percentage points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, the order provides that for a supply plant to be considered a pool plant, a minimum percentage of the total quantity of milk received at the supply plant must be transferred or diverted to and physically received at pool distributing plants regulated under the order. The minimum percentages are: 40 percent for September, October, and November; 30 percent for December; and 35 percent for January and February.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania order provides that the Director of the Dairy Division may increase or decrease the percentage delivery requirement by up to 10 percentage points if the Director finds that such revision is necessary to obtain needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revision was requested by Brewster Dairy, Inc. (Brewster), a proprietary handler who operates a pool supply plant regulated under the order. Brewster contends that in Fall 1993 the plant was unable to accept surplus distributing plant milk associated with Order 36 and still meet supply plant qualifications. Consequently, milk from a distributing plant located 10 miles from Brewster had to be diverted to a manufacturing facility 92 miles away. At the same time, Brewster had to procure surplus milk from greater distances to fulfill manufacturing obligations. Brewster contends that this situation represents inequitable and inefficient movements of milk for both supply and distributing plants, undertaken to meet order shipping requirements. Brewster asserts that the same inequitable and inefficient movements of milk are expected again for Fall 1994. Thus, Brewster contends, a reduction of supply plant shipping percentages is necessary to prevent uneconomic and inefficient shipments of milk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In view of the current supply and demand relationship, it may be necessary to reduce the supply plant shipping percentage requirements as proposed to provide for the efficient and economic marketing of milk during the months of September 1, 1994, through February 28, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1036  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Milk marketing orders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 1036_[AMENDED] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The authority citation for 7 CFR Part 1036 continues to read as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Secs. 1&hyph;19, 48 Stat. 31, as amended; 7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: August 22, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Silvio Capponi, Jr.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Deputy Director, Dairy Division. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21080 Filed 8&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;02&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

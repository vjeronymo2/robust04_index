			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading EARLY strength in stock index futures, which saw the near month contract climb to a new peak, gave way to a mood of uncertainty as traders mused about the future direction of the market, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened at 3,114, early buying soon drove the September contract on the FT-SE 100 to a new high of 3,130, all in the first half-hour of trading. But that early progress was short-lived and a mood of caution appeared to descend upon the market, leaving the September contract to surrender the earlier gain as it drifted lower for the next few hours. Traders stressed uncertainty in underlying stocks. It hit the day's low of 3,103 in the last hour of trading but steadied to end at 3,108, in line with Friday's close and just 2 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of around 7 points. Volume was a reasonable 8,419 lots in the September contract, while increasing action in the December contract saw its turnover reach nearly 2,000 lots. Turnover in the traded options improved from Friday's session as 29,313 lots were recorded against a previous 24,801. Some 12,298 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option. The actives list among the stock options was topped by Hanson, which saw 2,819 contracts dealt, and was followed by HSBC with 1,293. Lasmo, British Gas and Tomkins were also busy.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Importers slow to pay British exporters More British exporters have lost money as a result of payments delays by European importers, according to NCM, the leading export credit insurer, Richard Lapper writes from London. In its latest report on the exports outlook NCM said that one in four UK companies has been hit by bad payers last year, compared with one in five in the 12 months to September 1993. The figures show that the number of British companies exporting to Germany, France, Spain and Italy and reporting a loss as a result of non-payment increased. One exporter in 17 to Germany reported a loss (compared to one in 20 for the year to September 1993). One in 10 exporters to France, (one in 11), one in 12 to Spain (one in 13) and one in 10 to Italy (one in 12) were hit by non-payment.</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: TV companies Yesterday's results from Scottish Television did nothing to alter the market's view that one incumbent bidder at least will be back in the saddle this autumn. Scottish has a strong balance sheet - net cash currently stands at Pounds 20m - and the company is better placed than any would-be competitor to meet the local programming requirements of the Independent Television Commission. Scottish shares, which advanced another 10p to 645p on news of maintained profits last year, have surged 20 per cent since March when the only declared rival pulled out of the race. Yet investors in all quoted TV companies will need strong nerves. Fact will replace rumour in a couple of weeks when the ITC publishes a list of formal franchise contenders for the 15 independent regions, though most of the uncertainties will remain. Those companies unopposed, or perceived to face weak opposition, will presumably benefit from a rapid re-rating. But under the sealed bidding system, successful applicants may end up paying over the odds. It is impossible at this stage to tell whether the sector's average multiple - at a 20 per cent discount to the market - is accurately reflecting the risks. Franchise winners may struggle to print serious money. Advertising should be one of the first sectors to see real recovery, which augurs well for profits over the next two years. Longer term, however, there is a big question mark over what proportion of TV advertising revenue will go to the renamed Channel 3 and how much will leak away to satellite, cable and Channels 4 and 5. The ending of the takeover moratorium in 1994 - perhaps bringing in a string of bidders from continental Europe - may not come a minute too soon.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Rebels stall Mail sell-off Mr Michael Heseltine's plan to sell 51 per cent of Royal Mail was put on hold by senior ministers yesterday amid growing anxieties about a rebellion by backbench Tories. Mr Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, sought to persuade the cabinet's industrial affairs committee to include a privatisation bill in the Queen's Speech at the opening of the next session of parliament on November 16. But the committee failed to agree after warnings from the government's business managers that enough Conservative MPs may be prepared to vote with the opposition to defeat the bill. Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, is believed to have warned that eight Tories who last week signed a Commons motion supporting public ownership were likely to be joined by at least two previously uncommitted backbench MPs. That would be enough to defeat the government by a majority of six if all MPs voted, leaving the government dependent on assistance from the Ulster Unionist party to force the bill through. Downing Street said that 'more ministerial consideration' was needed before the cabinet took a final decision on the bill, probably next week. Officials said, however, that a cabinet vote could be put off until shortly before the Queen's Speech. The delay is a blow to Mr Heseltine, who believes that the government must press ahead with legislation or risk being seen as a lame-duck administration. He is supported by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who believes that enough Tory rebels could be persuaded to abstain for the government to push the bill through. Mr Clarke is refusing to countenance compromise proposals floated by the rebels which would allow the Post Office to remain in the public sector with significantly greater commercial freedom. Mr Heseltine has the support of several rightwing committee members, including Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary. The cabinet is believed to be fairly evenly split, although some influential senior ministers who were initially sceptical now believe the bill should go ahead, including Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary. MPs said the final decision might depend on a judgment by Mr Richard Ryder, the government chief whip, on whether Ulster Unionists MPs, who are formally opposed to the sell-off, can be expected to abstain.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Carlos Menem emphasized today that  Argentina will not participate in a probable military  intervention in Haiti outside UN resolutions.    The Argentine president guaranteed that the government will  ask Congress for authorization if the United Nations makes a  decision for our country to send military forces to that  Caribbean island where a coup overthrew a democratic president  in 1991.    President Carlos Menem also urged the United States to  increase political and economic measures against Haiti's de  facto government in order to restore the democratic system in  that country.</p>

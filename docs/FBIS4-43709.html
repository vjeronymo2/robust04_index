			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Now we go the World Cup -- Oh, but  before that, we can go live to the office of the prime minister  for a statement by Mr. Balladur:    [Balladur] Well, after the European elections, I wanted to  draw conclusions in consultation with the representatives of all  the electoral lists present in the European Parliament [EP]. It  seemed to me that these elections had, on the one hand, revealed  a feeling of dissatisfaction among our compatriots on the way in  which Europe was working, though they did not in the main call  into question their basic attachment to Europe; on the other  hand, these elections have resulted in a fragmentation of  France's representation in the EP, which could be damaging to  the interests of our country.    I have drawn the following two conclusions, about which I  wanted to inform the representatives of the EP:    The first is that the coordination of the activity of French  officials in Brussels must be better organized. For this  reason, I will preside over a monthly meeting prepared by Mr.  Alain Lamassoure, the minister for European affairs, where we  will examine developments in Brussels -- directives, regulations  -- which we sometimes feel are adopted without sufficient  national consultation.    Second, in order to fight against the unfortunate effects of  the fragmentation of the French delegation in the EP, I have  proposed that, every month, French members of the EP from all  parties should meet with the European affairs minister, so that  they can be informed of what the government is doing, of what  its policies are, what it is currently debating, and so that the  debate in the EP is coordinated with the government. In other  words, to put things very simply....    [Announcer interrupts] Well, that was what the prime  minister had to say live after meeting with the leaders of the  European election lists this morning.</p>

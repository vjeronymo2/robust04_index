			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Virani 'a victim of fraud at BCCI' Mr Nazmudin Virani, the former property entrepreneur, was a victim of, not a participant in, the fraud perpetrated by the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, his barrister, Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, told the Old Bailey yesterday, John Mason writes. In an opening statement to the jury, Mr Scrivener said there was no dispute that BCCI had been run by a 'gang of crooks'. However, Mr Virani had been 'duped' by a senior BCCI figure into signing documents which the prosecution claims show he was part of a conspiracy to inflate the bank's profits by Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.2m). Mr Virani denies one charge of conspiring to defraud BCCI investors, one of theft, one of false accounting and 11 of furnishing false information to Price Waterhouse, BCCI's auditors. Mr Scrivener said that when BCCI got into its deep financial difficulties, Mr Mohammed Haque, the head of BCCI's London property division, was told to create fictitious accounts intended to fool the auditors. These included letters which falsely confirmed that the Virani group of property companies had loans from BCCI totalling Dollars 30m. Mr Virani had trusted Mr Haque and had not studied these letters closely, before signing them, Mr Scrivener said. Although Mr Virani had been fooled by BCCI, he was in good company, Mr Scrivener went on. The Bank of England, accountancy firm Price Waterhouse, the ruler of Abu Dhabi and other wealthy Middle Eastern figures had also been duped, he said. The trial continues on Wednesday.</p>

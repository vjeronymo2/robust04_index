			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Nato Summit: Nato's unequal Partnership for Peace - The US idea for a bigger alliance fails fully to satisfy the former east bloc states Even before it was launched at the Nato summit yesterday, the alliance's Partnership for Peace plan had lost some shine. The plan, a US inspiration, was conceived three months ago as a means of placating both the central European countries seeking Nato membership and the Russians, worried about being left out in the cold. Publicising the idea at such an early stage may have been a tactical error, some officials at Nato now believe. It became clear that the plan would fully satisfy none of the main countries at which it was directed - neither central European nations such as Poland, because it gives them no explicit security guarantees, nor the Russians, since it is billed as a prelude to the expansion of Nato closer to their own borders. Invitations to negotiate individual Partnership for Peace agreements are being sent to all the former Warsaw pact countries, including Russia and other Soviet successor states in Europe and central Asia. Other European countries - neutral and non-aligned - may also seek to participate. Altogether the plan could involve Nato in military co-operation with 30 or more countries. First discussed at an informal meeting of allied defence ministers in the German Baltic town of Travemunde in October, the idea provided an elegant way of resolving, or at least postponing, a Nato dilemma. Alternatives under discussion at the time included the creation of some kind of Nato affiliate status. Partnership for Peace offered the advantages both of avoiding any new legal arrangement - Nato's treaty makes no provision for associate membership - and of appearing to be even-handed with respect to Moscow and its former military satellites. Nato officials have in the meantime worked hard to inject practical content into the proposed agreements. The alliance is eager to stage the first joint field exercises in peacekeeping this year. A 'planning cell' will be set up at Mons in Belgium, site of Nato's European military headquarters. Although participants are warned that co-operation will not be a military aid programme, Nato expects to have to stump up initial funds. These will not be huge in relation to allied defence spending - Nato sources suggested yesterday that 'we can do significant things for less than Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.7m) in the initial phase'. But the plan will nonetheless require extra contributions to Nato funds. The plan is being launched separately from co-operation programmes under the 22-nation North Atlantic Co-operation Council, which was set up two years ago as a forum for Nato to deal with its former foes. The NACC, often criticised for being little more than a talking shop, will continue to be for the purpose of wider consultations. Under the partnership agreements, or PFPs, countries will be able to consult individually with Nato if their security is endangered. However, allies have resisted formally extending to PFP partners the provisions of Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty providing for automatic consultation when 'the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened'. This, it was feared, would have encouraged countries to seek protection under the treaty's following article, which pledges mutual assistance on the basis that an attack on one is considered an attack on all. However, Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary general, said in his opening statement yesterday that the alliance's message to central and eastern European countries was: 'We shall not leave you alone.' The PFP plan is presented as being non-discriminatory. But in practice it will result in several different levels of co-operation. Nato's aim is that it should act as a filter for genuine candidates eventually to join the alliance. The communique to be issued today will state that allies 'expect and would welcome Nato expansion that would reach to democratic states to our east as part of an evolutionary process'. A less explicit version, simply reaffirming that the alliance remained 'open to the membership of other European countries', as stated in the North Atlantic Treaty 45 years ago, was rejected. US President Bill Clinton said the plan would 'advance a process of evolution for Nato's formal enlargement'. In a distinct difference of nuance, Mr John Major, UK prime minister, said yesterday it 'could' lead to the admission of new members. Mr Major emphasised that countries wanting to join had 'much work to do'. Departing from previous policy of not naming names, he hinted strongly that Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary would have priority. UK officials said that Slovakia, the fourth member of the so-called Visegrad group, would have 'a different timetable'.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NATO: MEMBERS AND APPLICANTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Present members                       Countries applying  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US                                    Poland Canada                                Czech Republic UK                                    Slovakia France                                Hungary Germany                               Romania Belgium                               Bulgaria Luxembourg                            Albania Netherlands                           Lithuania Denmark Norway Iceland Spain Portugal Italy Greece Turkey  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Elections   <F P=102>   PA1305190594 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1524 GMT 13 May 94 </F> <F P=103> PA1305190594 </F> <F P=104>  Madrid EFE </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 13 May (EFE) -- Opposition leader  Jose Francisco Pena Gomez said today that high-ranking military  officers have discussed a plan, which was disavowed by President  Joaquin Balaguer, to prevent the transfer of power to the  opposition if it wins the Dominican elections,    According to Pena Gomez, two "friendly" generals informed  him  of a meeting held last Monday at the Defense Secretariat  Operations Center attended by Lt. Gen. Constantino Matos  Villanueva, Armed Forces secretary, and other generals who were  not identified.    Pena Gomez said a plan was discussed at the meeting to allow  the Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC) of President  Balaguer to retain power in case it loses the 16 May elections,  but a group of officers at the meeting opposed the measure.    The opposition leader did not specify which position was  taken by the secretary of the Armed Forces.    Pena Gomez said the subject of the meeting was made known to  President Joaquin Balaguer, who disavowed the same and asked the  Armed Forces to keep its distance from the electoral and  democratic process.    The leader of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD)  praised  the president's position and the professionalism of the Armed  Forces and asked Balaguer to discipline the military officers  who proposed the plan discussed at the meeting, which was  "recorded" by the two officers who reported the same.    Pena Gomez' accusations come 24 hours after the Armed Forces  issued a communique, signed by Lt. Gen. Matos Villanueva and  other generals, expressing their willingness to guarantee  constitutional order and peace during the election. The Armed  Forces warned that any attempt to alter the results would be  strongly dealt with.    In a televised appearance, Pena Gomez also asked that the  Haitian border be closed for three days, next Sunday, Monday,  and Tuesday -- Monday is election day -- to prevent "adventurers  on both sides" from interfering in the elections.    Pena Gomez' request stems from a minority party report that  sectors close to the government and the PRSC plan to cause  incidents at the border during the election to alarm the  population and influence the elections results.</p>

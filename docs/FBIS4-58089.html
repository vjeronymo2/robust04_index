			<p>BFN     [Text] On the line from Cairo now is Sha'ul Menashe to  update us on the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Good  evening, Sha'ul.    [Menashe] Good evening to you. A short while ago, Dr. Nabil  Sha'th arrived here at the site of the negotiations from Tunis  where he held meetings and consultations. He told journalists:    [Begin Sha'th recording] I outlined to Fatah's Central  Committee and the PLO's Executive Committee, as did my brother  Abu- al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'] how things stand vis-a-vis the  Gaza-Jericho accord and the economic agreement. A deep and  exhaustive study of every aspect of these agreements was  undertaken. We obtained Fatah's Central Committee's  ratification of what has been agreed upon, and we received  instructions for the next few days leading up to the signing on  Wednesday [4 May]. [end recording]    [Menashe] Nabil Sha'th expects the Legal and Security  Committees will now proceed to draft the agreement without any  hitches.</p>

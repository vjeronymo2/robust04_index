			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend concern hurts BP DISAPPOINTMENT with the fourth-quarter dividend, and results below the most pessimistic forecasts, triggered a fresh slide in BP shares, which fell to their lowest closing level since April 1989. The stock ended its busiest trading session since mid-1990 a net 10 lower at 274p, after touching 268p. Turnover topped 40m shares. Oil sector specialists said the market had taken the dividend news very badly. The payment was held at 4.2p and most analysts had expected it to be increased to 4.3p. Observers were busy preparing earnings downgrades after the figures. Mr John Toalster, at Strauss Turnbull, adopted an extremely bearish stance: 'It is no longer a question of whether BP will cut the dividend, simply a question of when and by how much; we think they will hold the payment for the first two quarters and then cut the payment to 2.8p in the third. The shares are going down to 220p.' Dismay over BP's numbers triggered a predictable flurry of switching into Shell, which rose 4 to 478p on heavy turnover of 6.8m. Hanson active First-quarter results from Hanson yesterday prompted volatile and heavy two-way trading. The shares closed 2 off at 197 3/4 p after being more than 5 up at one stage. The recorded turnover was 24m shares. Hanson was also the most active stock option in the Traded Options Market. The profits were in the middle of the range of forecasts and many investors liked the yield and the earnings per share. There was also support from a 45-page strategy review published by securities house Hoare Govett. However, a decision to change the dividend policy led to wide confusion and there was concern over the lower than expected tax charge. Airtours placing A successful placing of new and existing shares in Airtours left the holiday group down 15 at 245p. US buyers were again in evidence as Hoare Govett, the broker, placed the 5.1m package with institutions from both sides of the Atlantic. The shares consisted of 1.3m ordinary, and 3.8m in warrants on behalf of the directors which are due for exercising on February 28. The stock was bought at 250p and placed, or conditionally placed in the case of the warrants, at 252p. Owners Abroad lost 2 1/2 to 109p in sympathy with Airtours. Securicor busy The two classes of shares in Securicor and those of its 51 per cent owned subsidiary Security Services gave another outstanding performance yesterday, responding to increasing hopes that the two companies may be on the verge of selling their minority interests in Cellnet to BT. Cellnet is one of the UK's two cellular radio networks. Securicor has a direct 13.3 per cent stake in Cellnet, and Security Services a further 27 per cent. Analysts said the Securicor/Security Services holdings in Cellnet are among the cheapest cellular stocks in the world. BT holds the rest of Cellnet. Telecoms specialists said BT would be a willing buyer of the Securicor/Security Services holdings and that Oftel, the telecoms regulator, would allow such a move. It was also pointed out that a sale would be most likely to take place before the general election. US institutions were said to be chasing Securicor stock yesterday after good results from McCaw, the US cellular group. Smith Barney, the US brokerage, has been a keen supporter of cellular issues recently. Securicor ordinary shares added 15 at 765p and the 'A' rose 25 more to 605p. Security Services jumped 21 to 486p. BT came in for strong support, still responding to a series of broker buy notes, with the 'old' closing 4 1/2 higher at 335p and the 'new' 2 3/4 better at 123 3/4 p. Harland Simon plunged 332p to 253p after the group warned on big write-offs and the effect of the failure of the late Mr Robert Maxwell's businesses. Worries that London Electricity had lodged a complaint with Offer, the electricity regulator, regarding supplies from National Power left the latter 5 1/2 down at 214p. PowerGen declined 7 to 220p. A Daiwa buy recommendation boosted Severn Trent Water 5 to 249p. Babcock International put on 2 1/2 to 58p as the market assessed the news that it is buying CNH &amp; Bulk, of Sweden, for Pounds 21.4m. Babcock also announced two share placings involving 66.3m shares at 50p each to cover the purchase and raise Pounds 9.5m for bonding requirements. The placings, arranged by Babcock's broker Panmure Gordon, were heavily oversubscribed. Dark clouds continued around British Aerospace, sending the shares to a new low of 263p. This time, the worries centre on the balance sheet and on problems over aircraft leasing. However, bargain hunters lifted the shares and they closed only 2 down at 268p on turnover of 3m. Currency risk for Tate &amp; Lyle, combined with trading difficulties in the US, led to widespread forecast downgrades which prompted the shares to fall 14 to 413p. Smith New Court cut its profits forecast for the sugar producer to Pounds 242m from Pounds 249m, while James Capel reduced its estimate by Pounds 5m to Pounds 240m. Financial constraints are likely to lead to a dividend cut and a sharp fall in the share price of stores group Burton, according to Credit Lyonnais Laing. It was suggested that the market is looking for a dividend in the range of 1.5p to 2.7p for the current financial year and 2p to 2.7p for the year to August 1993. Laing's profits forecast is Pounds 5m for 1992 and Pounds 15m for 1993 and it believes the dividend for both years may be cut to 1p from 2.7p for reasons of financial prudence. The broker thinks this could lead to a share price of 22p. The stock lost  1/2 to 35 1/2 p yesterday. Bid speculation pushed Fisons ahead 15 to 388p. Some analysts said the shares were firmer on rumours that both ICI (off 2 at 1287p) and Hanson were possible bidders. The talk was that each was holding a 3 per cent stake in Fisons. Other names mentioned recently include Medeva, Merck and Astra. Reuters Holdings gained 11 to 1115p as Hoare Govett, the company's broker, strengthened its stance on the stock from 'undervalued' to 'buy'. Hoare was said to be poised to raise its 1992 profits forecast by at least Pounds 15m from its current Pounds 365m. Also, US investment house Goldman Sachs raised its profits estimate ahead of a presentation by Reuters to US analysts yesterday afternoon. Tightly-traded Wellcome opened weaker in reaction to a US medical press article that said early treatment with its drug AZT, or Retrovir, does not help Aids virus sufferers to live longer. However, the shares rallied later, with marketmakers pointing to 'bear closing', and finished a net 14 up at 1117p. SmithKline Beecham eased 2 to 955p. Nomura lowered its 1992 profits estimate by Pounds 40m to Pounds 1.17bn and recommended short-term profit-taking. Chemicals group BOC retreated 15 to 631p, reflecting profit-taking following its results meeting. Electronics and entertainment group Thorn EMI was further undermined by speculation that it could be dragged into a bidding war for Virgin Records, the music division of Virgin Group. The shares weakened 15 to 810p on busy turnover of 2.4m. Rank Organisation climbed 11 to 693p as dealers again reported switching into the leisure group. Granada Group gained on optimism over BSkyB, in which it is a shareholder, following positive results from News Corp, BSkyB's main stakeholder. A series of recent meetings, held by Granada chief executive Mr Gerry Robinson for analysts, have also helped sentiment. The shares added 7 at 232p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (102).

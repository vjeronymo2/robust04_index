			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Strong earnings advance at Varity Varity, the Buffalo-based maker of Kelsey-Hayes automotive parts and Perkins brand diesel engines, lifted second-quarter earnings from continuing operations to Dollars 22.8m, or 50 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 517m. This was up from Dollars 13.1m, or 25 cents, on sales of Dollars 422m in last year's second quarter. Varity sold the remaining portions of Massey Ferguson's farm equipment division to Agco during the quarter, realising a gain of Dollars 23.2m, or 52 cents a share. Including that gain, it earned Dollars 46m, or Dollars 1.02 a share, in the second quarter. Shareholders' equity rose by Dollars 93m after the sale. Varity said yesterday it would use the proceeds of the sale to buy back up to 4.5m of its own shares, or about 10 per cent of those outstanding. The repurchase programme would be valued at close to Dollars 157m at current share prices. Wall Street responded favourably to the announcement, pushing Varity shares up Dollars  1/2 to close at 35 1/4 . For the first half of the year, the company reported income from continuing operations of Dollars 47.8m, or Dollars 1.05 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.02bn. This is up sharply from last year's first-half profits of Dollars 27.1m before extraordinary charges, on sales of Dollars 878m. Clark Refining &amp; Marketing, a unit of Canada's Horsham Corporation, is buying the Port Arthur, Texas oil refinery and terminal facilities of Chevron of the US for CDollars 74m plus inventory of about CDollars 140m (USDollars 102.2m), Reuter reports from Toronto. The deal has a potential for additional payments of up to CDollars 125m over five years if refining industry margins exceed certain levels, Clark said. The Part Arthur refinery has an operating capacity of about 200,000 barrels per day.</p>

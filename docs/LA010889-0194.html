			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY, FRIENDS MOURN GIRL STRUCK IN CROSSWALK  </P> <P> As mourners entered Community Reformed Church in Buena Park on Saturday to  remember 6-year-old Mary Dargan, who died after a car hit her in a crosswalk, a  neighbor and family friend said the death could have been avoided.  </P> <P> "We need a traffic light there," said Chet Polston, 67, about the Buena Park  intersection marked by a yellow crosswalk and stop signs. "We've got to get  that thing taken care of."  </P> <P> Mary, a first-grader at San Marino Elementary School, was walking home from  school holding hands with her grandmother and younger sister Tuesday when a car  hit all three in the crosswalk on Crescent Avenue at San Marino Drive. Mary  died of her injuries Wednesday.  </P> <P> Rose Dargan, 72, remains in satisfactory condition with a broken pelvis and  cuts at Los Alamitos Medical Center. Morgan Dargan, 5, who is in kindergarten,  is in stable condition at Charter Community Hospital in Hawaiian Gardens with a  fractured thigh bone.  </P> <P> "The sad part about it is (Morgan) keeps asking for her sister," Polston said.  "It's a shame, a total shame."  </P> <P> The driver, 25-year-old Deborah Casey of La Palma, has been charged with  misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter. If convicted, she could receive up to a  year in County Jail or a fine, a spokesman for the district attorney's office  said. Casey's mother, Jeanette, has said her daughter was hysterical after the  accident and on sedatives.  </P> <P> But Polston said he doesn't blame Casey for the accident. "People have been  trying to get a stoplight there for 20 years," he said. "If I was going to be a  crosswalk guard, I'd be scared to work there."  </P> <P> Neighbors complained Tuesday that the intersection across the street from San  Marino school has been the scene of several accidents. Studies in several  Orange County cities have shown that pedestrians are more likely to be hit at a  marked crosswalk than at an unmarked crossing because they feel a false sense  of security.  </P> <P> Polston said Rose Dargan walked her granddaughter home from school almost every  day. They lived about half a block from the accident site.  </P> <P> More than 150 friends and family members attended the funeral. A portrait of  Mary sat amid white carnations and pink roses on top of her small, white  casket.  </P> <P> The Rev. Duane Tellinghuisen asked the audience to look at the picture and keep  Mary in their memories.  </P> <P> "Isn't that what life consists of, memories?" he said. "Aren't those the things  we really cherish?  </P> <P> "We can ask, 'Why, God?' But there's no answer. Friends, don't wait around for  the answer."  </P> <P> After the burial at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Cypress, Mary's friends and  classmates placed flowers at the scene of the accident as a memorial.  </P></p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / How To Spend It: Rich and fake THERE ARE certain people who feel they must wear only 'real' jewellery. For some it is an expression of wealth and status, not a source of fun and fashion. The delight of costume jewellery is that precisely because it is conjured from the humblest materials designers feel freed from bourgeois constraints. As Vivienne Becker put it in her beautiful book Fabulous Fakes (Pounds 19.95, Grafton Books): 'Since they are not intended to last beyond the latest craze, jewels of little or no intrinsic value can be more evocative of their age and wearer than expensive gem-set heirlooms.' In other words, they do not have to last forever. Those who work with them can indulge in wilder flights of fantasy, be more exotic, more fantastical, take bigger risks than those who deal with gems worth a king's ransom. In an exhibition opening on Wednesday at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, South Kensington, London SW1, some of the finest costume jewellery ever made will be on show - works from Chanel, Schiaparelli, Dior, Trifari, Eisenberg, Ken Lane and Robert Lee Morris will be there, charting the rise and rise in popularity of this now essential fashion accessory. The V &amp; A shop will be selling a vast collection of costume jewellery including inexpensive modern pieces - starting at Pounds 6.99 and aimed at the student market - to collectors' items from the Fior, Cobra &amp; Bellamy and Melanie Coe collections. Melanie Coe, for example, is selling reproductions in glitzy Schiaparelli mode, at prices ranging from Pounds 80 to Pounds 100 while Fior's pieces will start at about Pounds 16 and up for collectors' pieces. Cobra &amp; Bellamy has a line of pieces based on the Armada jewel and Queen Victoria's jewels - prices start at Pounds 35 and go on up to about Pounds 80. Swarovski, the Austrian supplier of cut crystal to the fashion industry, is sponsoring the exhibition and will be selling a glitzy brooch of its own for Pounds 40. The exhibition and runs until July 5.</p>

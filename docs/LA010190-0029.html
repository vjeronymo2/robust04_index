			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH TAPES 1990 GREETING FOR SOVIETS  </P> <P> President Bush on Sunday sent a television greeting to the Soviet people,  offering "warmest greetings" for the New Year and for "a new world of our own  making."  </P> <P> In a video message to be broadcast on Soviet television, Bush praised Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as "a good partner in peace."  </P> <P> A companion message taped by Gorbachev is expected to be aired on U.S.  television, continuing an exchange begun by Gorbachev and former President  Ronald Reagan in the mid-1980s. It was not immediately clear when either  message would be broadcast.  </P> <P> "Given the war-torn history of this century, we should redouble our efforts to  forge a new century of peace and freedom," said Bush, who is vacationing in  Texas but who taped the message in Washington before he left.  </P> <P> Bush noted that "our nations have produced" leaders such as Abraham Lincoln,  Soviet novelist Leo Tolstoy, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and  Soviet dissident Andrei D. Sakharov.  </P> <P> "We have persevered as allies in a terrible war," he said. "The challenges we  face today are no less daunting. But with good will and determination on both  sides, I am confident our two peoples will be equal to the task."  </P> <P> Bush reiterated that the United States "seeks no advantage from the  extraordinary changes under way" in Eastern Europe.  </P></p>

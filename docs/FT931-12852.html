			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Letter: Justifiable despair over Britain's economy Sir, It is not often that I find myself so diametrically in disagreement with an article appearing in the Financial Times, but Sir Geoffrey Owen's 'The Myth of Britain's Decline' takes the biscuit. Anyone who has worked in industry and commerce as I have done for 40 years, and largely at the sharp end overseas, is in no doubt that regular doses of despair over Britain's economic performance are absolutely justified. We should drink deep draughts of the stuff] He blames the media for trotting out the usual culprits, but both the press and politicians seem very loath to confront, respectively, their readers and the electorate with the unpalatable truth that the British people themselves, in failing to measure up to competition in world markets, are largely to blame for Britain's undoubted decline. We British must accept that we must begin to match in our attitude to work the diligence and dedication, not only of the Japanese and Germans but also an increasing number of nationals such as the Koreans and the Taiwanese. Until we do Britain will continue its inexorable descent down the slippery slope, taking with it our valued institutions and our standard of living. As George Walden MP rightly said recently, 'tell the people the truth'. And the truth is that the deep-seated flaw that Sir Geoffrey doubts exists is conspicuously clear in an all too common sloppy disregard of customer interests both domestic and overseas. There are brilliant exceptions such as British Airways, which, despite its present problems, has in recent years given an impressive performance on a world stage, but we need more. I hope Sir Geoffrey will accept what I say as the constructive self-criticism which he says is welcome. Gavin Clezy, chief executive, British Chamber of Commerce for Italy, Milan</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 8 (KCNA) -- The great leader  President Kim Il-song received a message of greetings from the  participants in a Malian joint seminar on the chuche idea and  education held in Bamako. The message said:    President Kim Il-song founded the chuche idea, the idea of  shaping the destiny of mankind, reflecting the independent  demand and interest of the popular masses in the first period  when he set out on the road of revolution and applied it to  practical activities to build the socialist system centred on  the popular masses in Korea.    The Korean-style socialism where the leader, the party and  the masses are singleheartedly united gives a hope and courage  to the world progressive people and clearly indicates the road  ahead of the third world countries.    We extend firm solidarity with the heroic Korean people  confidently advancing along the road of socialism chosen by  themselves and express full support to the Korean people in  their struggle to realize reunification of the country on the  basis of the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole  nation.    The message wished President Kim Il-song good health and a  long life.</p>

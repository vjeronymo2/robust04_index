			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / International Company News: Winterthur and UAP in link-up Winterthur Insurance, Switzerland's third largest insurer, and UAP, the biggest French insurer, are setting up a joint venture company for credit insurance in France. The venture, called Assurcredit, will take over the credit insurance business of Winterthur in that country which has annual premium income of about FFr80m (Dollars 13.60m). UAP, which does not have a significant presence in the credit insurance sector, will bring capital to the venture and make its distribution channels available. Mr Michel Clerckx, a Winterthur general manager, said the groups hoped to have the venture operating in April or May of next year. Winterthur acquired a 3 per cent stake in UAP in December 1992 in exchange for its 37.4 per cent holding in Nordstern Allgemeine of Germany. Mr Peter Spalti, Winterthur chairman, said last June the group might raise this stake when UAP was privatised. Mr Clerckx said yesterday that would be discussed when the privatisation plan was brought forward, probably in January or February. He added that the two groups were discussing further co-operation, notably by extending their joint activities in breakdown assistance for motorists.</p>

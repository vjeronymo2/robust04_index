			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau], 28 Apr -- Meeting near  Tiraspol, the leaders of Moldavia [Moldova] and the leaders of  the Dniester region today confirmed their adherence to  negotiated forms of resolving the conflict in the Dniester  left-bank districts. The outcome of their talks was a  communique signed by Moldavian President Mircea Snegur and the  leader of the Dniester region Igor Smirnov.    The document emphasizes that a new socio-political situation  has been created in Moldavia. This situation is a "serious  prerequisite for a successful resolution of the Dniester region  crisis by negotiations and in accordance with the interests of  the entire people."    The sides pledged to take into consideration at the talks  the  recommendations on a settlement to the conflict that were  prepared by the CSCE mission and the proposals of the Russian  Federation. Yesterday, the Russian president's representative  Vladlen Vasev, who took part in the talks, told an ITAR-TASS  correspondent that the proposals of Russia, which is acting as  mediator in the talks between Kishinev and Tiraspol, are very  close to the CSCE's recommendations. They propose to grant the  Dniester region a special legal status, broad  self-administration and economic independence within the  framework of a unified Moldavia, as well as rights to  self-determination in the event of Moldavia's loss of statehood.    Today the sides agreed without delay and without any  preconditions to begin talks, remove barriers in the way of the  normal implementation of economic and socio-cultural ties and to  ensure their restoration and development. They agreed on the  need to determine the Dniester region's status under state law,  the stage-by-stage establishment and implementation of state-law  relations, the delegation and demarcation of the powers of the  sides and the creation of a system of mutual guarantees.    Taking part in the meeting were Petr Luchinskiy, the  Moldavian parliamentary chairman; Prime Minister Andrei  Sangheli; Grigoriy Marakutsa, chairman of the Dniester region  Supreme Soviet, and Richard Samuel, the head of the CSCE mission  in Kishinev.</p>

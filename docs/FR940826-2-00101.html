			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To determine whether that entry is now appropriate, the Court should consider whether sufficient safeguards exist or have been proposed to prevent the danger that the access provider, in providing access to itself as well as its competitors, could discriminate against those competitors in the provision of exchange access. <FOOTCITE>42</FOOTCITE>  As in 1982, simply enjoining discrimination is insufficient protection; specific proscriptions are appropriate in light of the dangers presented, and those proscriptions should be adopted in a manner that will make detection and prosecution of any violations reasonably likely. <FOOTCITE>43</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 42 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, wireless access markets cannot today be considered to be especially competitive. Those markets are nonetheless not nearly as tightly controlled as landline exchange access markets, where local telephone companies appear to have well over 90 percent of the market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 43 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> To further the enforcement of these conditions, the Department believes that the grant of authority to provide interexchange services should be subject to the following sanctions. First, that the Court should have the authority to withdraw the waiver if a BOC violates the equal access requirements of the waiver and of the Decree; and, second, that the Court reserve the authority to impose civil fines for violations. Proposed Order, &sect;VIII(L)(5). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department has considered these questions in the limited context of cellular services, and believes that appropriate safeguards can be devised_although the Department also believes that the safeguards offered by the BOCs are insufficient, and recommends additional safeguards to prevent the discrimination that could reduce competition in cellular interexchange markets. <FOOTCITE>44</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 44 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Department does not believe that the BOCs should be prohibited from providing any interexchange services until they can demonstrate that competition would not be reduced were they allowed entry into interexchange services generally. The Department is aware of, and shares, the Court's concern about ``piecemeal waivers.'' Triennial Review, 673 F. Supp. at 545; see also United States v. Western Elec. Co., 777 F.2d 23, 29 (D.C. Cir. 1985), but believes that wireless markets (as defined in the Department's proposed order) are sufficiently discrete to allay these concerns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The BOCs have said that ``for the most part, [the Department's] conditions and clarifications appear to be acceptable, though some clarifications may be necessary.'' (BOC Mem. 16) We discuss these issues in Section 1, pp. 31&hyph;36 below. The BOCs have, however, objected to the Department's resale and marketing restrictions. (BOC Mem. 16&hyph;19) We therefore explain our reasoning for those restrictions separately, in Sections 2 and 3, pp. 36&hyph;40 below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The Department's Proposed Order Will Substantially Prevent Discrimination in the Provision of Access. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following specific terms and safeguards appear to be necessary and appropriate to prevent discrimination by a cellular exchange against competing interexchange carriers: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basic Injunction.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department's proposed order states explicitly the basic injunction necessary to protect against discrimination: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Each BOC local telephone exchange company and Wireless Exchange System shall offer to all interexchange carriers interconnection, exchange access, and exchange services for such access, on an unbundled basis that is equal in type, quality and price to that provided to any interexchange service provided by that BOC or any affiliate thereof. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Order, &sect;VIII(L)(3)(a)(1). <FOOTCITE>45</FOOTCITE>  This language, which paraphrases Section II(A) of the Decree, makes clear that the equal access obligation applies to cellular carriers and that the benchmark for discrimination is the access the BOC provides to itself, rather than what it provides to AT&amp;T, the original language of Section II(A). Section VIII(L)(3)(a)(3) of the proposed order also makes explicit the implicit requirement of equal access, that the prices for cellular exchange not vary with the interexchange carrier chosen: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 45 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Department's proposed order adds a new Section VIII(L) to the Decree. Section VIII(L)(1) contains definitions. Section VIII(L)(2) provides the authorization for specific interexchange services to be provided in connection with wireless exchange services. Section VIII(L)(3) contains specific equal access requirements related to that authority. Section VIII(L)(4) provides for the filing of compliance plans with the Department, and Section VIII(L)(5) specifies sanctions for violations of the modification or of equal access. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A BOC or any affiliate thereof shall not sell or contract to sell Wireless Exchange Service at a price, term or discount that depends upon whether the customer obtains interexchange service from the BOC or any affiliate thereof. <FOOTCITE>46</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 46 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section VIII(L)(3)(a)(4) imposes an equivalent restriction on the sale of interexchange services; i.e., to the extent a BOC provides interexchange services to the customers of its cellular affiliates and to the customers of competing cellular affiliates, it may not vary the price depending on which cellular exchange service the customer buys. This requirement, which has been questioned by the BOCs (BOC Mem. 22), is necessary to give meaning to the unbundling requirement. Absent this constraint, the BOC could adjust the price of its interexchange service to create combinations of services that its long distance competitors could not match. Moreover, it would be decidedly procompetitive if the BOCs were to compete for long distance from each other's cellular exchanges and from McCaw cellular exchanges. A similar requirement is imposed upon AT&amp;T and McCaw under the consent decree agreed to between them and the United States. AT&amp;T McCaw Decree, &sect;IV.F.l.c. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the Department's proposed order explicitly makes Section II(B)'s requirements of nondiscrimination in the provision of technical information, interconnection and provision for planning of facilities binding on BOC commercial mobile service providers. The Department objected to the BOCs' earlier request to be allowed to give themselves preferential routing and collocation. The BOCs' proposed equal access plan as presented to the Court affirms that they will not give themselves those preferences. (BOC Model Equal Access Plan, p. 2). The Department believes that 60 days' notice of changes to the network is reasonably necessary to allow competing interexchange carriers sufficient time to modify their networks, and the BOCs have accepted that requirement. Id. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Services from which Interexchange Service May Be Provided.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The scope of the proposed relief_i.e., the exchange services from which originating interexchange services may be offered_needs to be defined beyond the use of the recently added statutory term ``commercial mobile services.'' <FOOTCITE>47</FOOTCITE>  The Department proposes to use the term the following definition: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 47 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This term, added by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, 107 Stat. 312 (1993), defines ``commercial mobile services'' as ``any mobile service *&blank;*&blank;* that is provided for profit and makes interconnected service (a) to the public or (b) to such classes of eligible users as to be effectively available to a substantial portion of the public *&blank;*&blank;*.'' 47 U.S.C. 332(d)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Wireless Exchange Services mean commercial mobile services, as defined in 47 U.S.C. 332(d)(1); provided, however, that BOC Wireless Exchange Services are limited to services provided by corporations that have been established as separate subsidiaries from the BOC's local telephone exchange companies (``LECs''), and provided, further, that the principal facilities used to provide Wireless Exchange Services, including the MTSO and radio base stations, are physically and operationally separate from LEC facilities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Order, Section VIII(L)(1)(c). The purpose of this restriction to ``physically and operationally separate'' networks is to distinguish wireless networks that are physically separate from the landline exchange, such as today's cellular networks, from networks that might be tightly integrated with the local exchange. It is unclear whether such a PCS service could be offered by anyone other than the local exchange itself, and therefore it might not be appropriate to allow BOCs to provide interexchange services from the network, just as it is not appropriate today for the BOCs to provide interexchange services from their landline exchanges, on these conditions. The BOCs based their proposal, and the Department evaluated this proposal, in light of current cellular architectures, and the Department therefore recommends limiting the waiver to commercial mobile services offered from networks that are fully distinct and separated_both physically and structurally_from the local exchange. <FOOTCITE>48</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 48 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As with the BOCs' proposed form of order, the waiver would not extend to interexchange telecommunications originated on cordless telephones or on ``wireless PBXs,'' i.e., private mobile radio services provided within an office complex or similar environment. (BOC Mem. 12) The BOCs do not intend their relief to extend to the sorts of LEC-provided PCS services excluded by the Department's proposed order (BOC Mem. 12); the Department's proposal makes that limitation explicit on the face of the order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

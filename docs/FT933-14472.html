			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy Since the government's own statisticians were at pains to stress that May's industrial production figures were distorted by public holidays, not even the enthusiasts for recovery can take them at face value. Still, the trend in manufacturing output confirms the strength of recovery. Even the slowing in pace recently is overshadowed by the overall improvement, and economic growth may approach 2 per cent in 1993. It seems the inflationary impact of devaluation has been effectively muted because the UK economy is running so far behind its potential and deflationary forces are still strong worldwide. What stops the champagne corks popping is anxiety over the current account deficit. If the increase in investment is helping increase exports, the UK may be in for some genuine non-inflationary growth. If it stokes domestic demand, the recovery will not have too far to run. Either way, there is a case for some tax increases in the autumn budget to control the rate of expansion. A simultaneous interest rate cut might also blunt sterling's appreciation on the foreign exchanges. One other nagging worry is the way in which economic statistics seem to be running ahead of companies' expectations. But perhaps the September reporting season will provide more cheer.</p>

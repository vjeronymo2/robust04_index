			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment stated that foreign flag vessels should be exempt from the requirement to have equipment that meets the material standards referenced in the proposed regulations (46 CFR 56.25). The comment claimed that some of the material standards referenced would not be appropriate for foreign flag vessels because their standards are established by other classification societies or by other foreign standards. The comment did state, however, that foreign flag vessels should be held to the dimensional requirements in the proposed &sect;157.420 of the NPRM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard finds that no change in response to this comment is appropriate. Foreign flag vessels operating in U.S. waters must be prepared to conduct emergency lightering operations in coordination with vessels operating under Coast Guard standards. The Coast Guard will accept equipment that complies with other standards that it determines to be equivalent, or it may accept specific pieces of equipment as being equivalent. All lightering equipment, regardless of which standards are used, must facilitate safe lightering operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment indicated that the Coast Guard should consider requiring onboard emergency rapid transfer systems (ERTS) in conjunction with the requirement for emergency lightering equipment. Without full-scale development and testing of the ERTS, the Coast Guard does not wish to mandate the use of this system because its effectiveness is unproven; however, the Coast Guard may consider the use of such a system in the future if it determines that such an arrangement provides as substantial protection to the environment as is economically and technologically feasible and meets the general safety considerations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adapters have been added to the equipment required by &sect;157.410 to ensure equipment size compatibility. Adapters are required to adapt components with dimensions in English units to metric units. The vessel owner or operator must provide any other adapters that are necessary to ensure connection to the specified hose sizes for lightering purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Initially, the NPRM for this rulemaking proposed a 3-year phase-in period for structural and operational measures. This period would give the vessel owner or operator sufficient time to conveniently drydock a tank vessel. The lightering equipment required by this final rule does not require drydocking for installation and is most likely available from manufacturers' stock inventory. Therefore, a phase-in period of 1 year is granted to allow for convenient installation aboard a tank vessel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Advance Notice of Arrival <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM proposed to require the owners or operators of certain foreign flag tank vessels to provide the vessels' IMO international numbers to the Captains of the Port before arriving at a port or place in the United States. There were no comments on the advance notice of arrival requirements in the NPRM, and the requirements remain unchanged in the final rule. However, the effective date has been changed from 3 years to 90 days after publication of this final rule. Because no structural or operational changes are required to implement this provision, the change in the effective date should not adversely affect the owners or operators of foreign flag tank vessels operating in U.S. waters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Location Within Regulations <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The telegram expresses support and solidarity for the  policies expounded by President Kim Il-song in his New Year  address, especially the DPRK's policies to be enforced in 1994,  a year of a great revolutionary upswing and advance.    As President Kim Il-song stressed in his New Year address,  the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must be settled  through DPRK-U.S. talks and the United States must act with  discretion, looking straight at the reality, the telegram says.    The Jordanian Communist Party supports the WPK in the  efforts  and struggle to defend the interests of the friendly Korean  people and world peace and security, it stresses.</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / S African strikes pose challenge to ANC Although the newly elected South African government has been hoping to focus its attention on development issues, its first real test seems likely to be in the thorny labour relations arena. Strikes have broken out among provincial government employees and yesterday ambulance workers in Pretoria walked out to protest against planned privatisation of the city's emergency services. More serious are labour relations in the country's huge mining industry. A strike at Kloof gold mine was resolved only yesterday after the loss of six days of normal underground production. While the problem appears to have been solved for the moment, many analysts feel this is a sign of things to come as unions hope to take advantage of a sympathetic government to wring concessions from the mines. 'The workers think it's pay-back time,' observes one mining analyst. All this will pose a serious problem for the ruling African National Congress, which remains in formal alliance with the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the country's largest union federation. Many unions, because of their position at the forefront of the liberation struggle, feel that the new government owes them a debt which is now falling due. The 280,000-strong National Union of Mineworkers, which has been asserting itself in a wide range of limited actions over the past few months, has signalled its intention to push harder on traditionally intransigent companies now that a black government is running the country. Right at the top of the NUM's hit list is Kloof's parent company, Gold Fields of South Africa, one of the country's biggest mining conglomerates. Gold Fields, which has large interests in gold, platinum, copper and zinc, has a history of poor labour relations, and the union is determined to step up pressure on the company. According to Mr Jerry Majatladi, the NUM spokesman, the primary issue is GFSA's general approach to unions, particularly the right to organise, although Gold Fields claims the problem stems from misconceptions rather real grievances. The NUM plans a big march on GFSA's head office in Johannesburg over the weekend and will consider further strike action to pursue its goals. If the campaign succeeds, the union intends to target other recalcitrant mining houses, notably Johannesburg Consolidated Industries, the parent of the Western Areas mine where several workers have been killed in political clashes over the past week. According to Mr Gavin Brown, an industrial relations consultant, further strikes in the rest of the private sector are now increasingly likely, given that many companies delayed wage negotiations until after the election. He also predicts more unrest among civil servants, particularly in the health and education areas. Despite their longstanding links, tensions between Cosatu and the ANC began to surface shortly before the election, when the federation resisted ANC calls for a moratorium on strikes. They are likely to widen further when Cosatu launches its public sector union later this month, expected to draw in some 150,000 civil servants. Meanwhile, the demands of office are already forcing many former union leaders to try to rein in workers' demands. The former Cosatu general secretary, Mr Jay Naidoo, who, as minister without portfolio in the new cabinet, is almost certain to be given responsibility for implementing the ANC's planned reconstruction and development programme, has already publicly committed the ANC to squeezing productivity gains out of the civil service to help fund development. Other ANC leaders have also urged restraint in wage demands to help keep down inflation, but, so far at least, Cosatu seems unlikely to heed the call.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Whyte &amp; Mackay expected to renew Invergordon bid The city now firmly expects Whyte &amp; Mackay, the UK drinks subsidiary of American Brands, to renew its bid later this year for Invergordon Distillers, the independent Scotch whisky company, writes Philip Rawstorne. Invergordon's shares, which have risen sharply in recent weeks, closed yesterday at 330p - 55p above W&amp;M's final, unsuccessful offer last October. W&amp;M, which holds a 41.3 per cent stake, made its presence felt at the distiller's annual meeting last week.</p>

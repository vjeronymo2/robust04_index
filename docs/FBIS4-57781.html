			<p>BFN     [Text] An increase in production and a more efficient use  of fuels allocated to Matanzas Province have resulted, from the  point of view of efficient energy use, in relative savings,  which totaled 16,000 tons of conventional fuel by the end of  April. This information has been confirmed by a survey conducted  by the Matanzas office of statistics. The survey adds that  consumption of energy resources has decreased by nearly 13,000  tons in comparison with the same period in 1993, while  mercantile production has increased by 5.3 million pesos.    Statistics officials point out that only petroleum  consumption was higher than projected, while there has been a  decrease in electricity consumption of 7,000 megawatt-hours.    There are 35 enterprises in the province that have surpassed  the electric consumption quotas. Among the enterprises that  consume large amounts of energy, 25 have exceeded quotas --  among them the rope and thread factory; the Martires leather  factory in Caguasu; the meat complex; the metal-tooling factory;  and the Cuba Libre, Juan Avila, Reinol Garcia, Mexico, and  Jovellanos Farming Complexes.</p>

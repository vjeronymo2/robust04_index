Averaging Period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> USDA submitted comments to the Agency encouraging a season-specific averaging program, rather than an annual averaging program. USDA argued that requiring the renewables requirement to be met separately for VOC-controlled and non-VOC-controlled gasoline would increase the energy and environmental benefits. Specifically, USDA suggested that a season-specific program would provide additional incentives to convert ethanol that would otherwise have been blended directly into summer RFG into the form of ETBE. USDA argued that the resulting reduction in summer ethanol use would further reduce commingling effects and lead to additional VOC emission reductions due to the distillation characteristics of ETBE. USDA suggested that a season-specific program would provide the potential for ethanol market share to expand beyond 30 percent in future years. The reader is referred to the RIA for a detailed discussion of the seasonal averaging program suggested by USDA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has considered the issues raised by USDA, and has decided to retain the annual averaging period proposed in the December NPRM, based on an analysis of the logistical, energy, environmental, and cost impacts of splitting the summer and winter seasons. First, seasonal averaging would require ETBE use in VOC-controlled reformulated gasoline, which presents serious capacity problems in the short-term. Although only minor modifications are necessary in order to produce ethers from ethanol rather than methanol, it will take some time to make those ether production facility conversions and to acquire the necessary construction and operating permits. EPA's analysis indicates that insufficient ETBE capacity would be available to fully meet the summer requirements of a season-specific renewable program in 1995 and likely also 1996. As a result, a seasonal averaging program would have to be delayed and/or phased in. Since, as discussed below, EPA anticipates the Phase II RFG requirements to stimulate the use of ETBE, a phased-in requirement might have little actual impact on ETBE use. In addition, a split season program would introduce additional complexity and expense to the renewable oxygenate and reformulated gasoline programs. ETBE is more expensive on an oxygen content basis than either MTBE or ethanol, and ETBE provides smaller toxics emission reductions than other oxygenates included in EPA's RFG emission models, which refiners would have to offset through other fuel controls. Thus, forcing ETBE use in summer gasoline in order to meet a season-specific renewable oxygenate requirement could have increased the cost of compliance with the annual toxics requirement of the reformulated gasoline rule, especially under Phase I of the RFG program, and complicated implementation of the RFG program given the short leadtime available. This problem would have been particularly severe during the initial years of the program, since the refinery modifications necessary to offset the increase in toxics emissions can require several years to complete, and since the value of ETBE's RVP benefits will increase only when the Phase II RFG standards are implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, EPA concluded that the purposes of the program could be achieved without a season-specific program. The renewable oxygenate program is being promulgated to provide two primary benefits: reducing the fossil energy impact of RFG, and stimulating the development of renewable fuels which can lead to greenhouse gas emission benefits, this would supplement the VOC and toxics emissions reduction benefits from RFG. ETBE use per se is not required to obtain these benefits. Based on the DOE analysis, ETBE use during the summer does not provide any additional fossil energy benefit than ethanol use in the winter, and in fact, results in a slightly smaller fossil energy savings. The program may also achieve some marginal crude oil savings and some additional VOC emission benefits with the use of ETBE during the summer months (due to the favorable front-end distillation characteristics of ETBE relative to ethanol and MTBE). However, EPA does not believe a split season is necessary to stimulate the use of ETBE in the summer months, particularly when the Phase II RFG standards take effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

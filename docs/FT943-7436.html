			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: Walt Disney in German satellite TV venture Walt Disney yesterday announced its first significant new media investment in Europe - a joint venture with CLT Multi Media, the Luxembourg-based international broadcaster. The two groups plan to launch a German satellite television channel specialising in family entertainment in January. The deal could herald the launch of a number of similar Disney-backed channels in other European countries including the UK. Disney last year acquired a 25 per cent shareholding in GMTV, the commercial breakfast television service in the UK. For years Disney has been looking at the development of the European cable and satellite market. A potential deal with Mr Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television before the merger with British Satellite Broadcasting failed to materialise. Mr Michael Eisner, Walt Disney chairman and chief executive, said yesterday the venture with CLT 'provides us with a perfect opportunity to develop a family programming service in Germany and to evaluate the potential for similar services elsewhere in Europe'. At the moment Disney has a programme supply agreement with ARD, the terrestrial German broadcaster, which runs until the end of next year. Disney made it clear yesterday the agreement is unlikely to be extended and there will now be talks to see when it can be concluded. The deal with CLT, whose television interests include television channels in Germany, France, Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg, will be on a 50-50 basis. The new channel, which will be available to an estimated 30 to 35 per cent of German television households, will be called Super RTL to distinguish it from CLT's existing German language channels RTL and RTL 2. The new channel, which will be carried on German cable networks, will include Disney animation, feature films and live action. Disney has also agreed in principle to become a long-term programme supplier to CLT Multi Media.</p>

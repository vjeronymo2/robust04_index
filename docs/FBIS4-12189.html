			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, Yemeni southerners accused northerners of  mobilizing forces on the former border between the two parts of  Yemen, considering this a serious military escalation. This  came in a statement by Ahmad 'Abdallah Salih, deputy secretary  of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP].    A responsible source at the General People's Congress [GPC]  -- a northern official -- responded to these accusations by  saying that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih rejected, during the  Salalah meeting, a southern proposal implying divisionist  trends, calling for returning all northern and southern military  units to their pre-unity positions.    The same source noted that the Yemeni Presidential Council  will not be able to hold its scheduled meeting tomorrow because  the second man in the YSP refuses to come to Sanaa to  participate in the meeting.    It is noteworthy that the Yemeni Presidential Council is a  collective presidential body including five members -- three  from the North and two from the South. The two members from the  South are 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his deputy Salim Salih Muhammad.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- Japan's economy is  gradually moving in a better direction, International Trade and  Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai said Tuesday [5 April]. In  view of remaining structural problems, it will be difficult for  the economy to recover rapidly in the immediate future but there  is no danger any longer of its plunging into a double-dip  recession, Kumagai told a regular press conference.    Corporate capital spending is still slack but personal  spending has begun "clearly" picking up, he said.    Kumagai said he expects auto sales to lead an expected  economic recovery. March auto sales fell 3.7 percent from a  year before -- but this was an improvement from an 8.4 percent  drop in February.    Kumagai said a coming ministerial gathering in Marrakech,  Morocco, for the signing of the global trade pact may provide  "the best opportunity" to open the way for a breakthrough in the  stalled trade talks with the United States. Ministers from  Japan, the U.S. and other member countries of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) will meet in Marrakech  later this month to ratify the Uruguay Round pact concluded in  December.    Kumagai said he has yet to decide whether or not he will go  to Marrakech, citing a tight parliamentary schedule.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Abbey trims mortgage rates Abbey National, the UK's second-largest mortgage lender, yesterday cut its mortgage rates by 0.25 percentage points to a range between 7.54 and 7.74 per cent. It said that the reduction - less than that announced by Halifax Building Society on Monday - reflected the fact that falling interest rates were bad news for savers. Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth-largest society, followed Halifax, the largest, by announcing a cut of 0.35 percentage points to 7.64 per cent in its variable rate. Other main lenders joining Abbey in the smaller cut of 0.25 points were Leeds Permanent, the fifth-largest society, and Midland Bank. The series of cuts has been triggered by a pre-Budget 0.5 percentage point reduction in base rates. The new rates will be available immediately to new borrowers, and to existing borrowers from January. Mr Chris Chadwick, Leeds executive director, echoed the warning from other societies that if the government subsidised its savings products to attract investors, then societies might not be able to pass on to borrowers further cuts in interest rates. He said: 'Over-aggressive pricing on national savings will impact on lenders' ability to maintain current rates or reduce them any further.' Many mortgage lenders have not announced new rates for savers, but are likely to do so before the end of the month.</p>

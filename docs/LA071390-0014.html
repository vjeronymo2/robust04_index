			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN RAFAEL;  </P> <P> NUNS EVACUATED FROM CONVENT FIRE  </P> <P> Fire erupted on the top floor of a four-story 1889 convent near Dominican  College, forcing the evacuation of 30 nuns from the Marin County landmark.  </P> <P> The blaze quickly went to greater-alarm status and snarled traffic along U.S.  101 near the college, a San Rafael Fire Department spokesman said, adding that  about 100 firefighters from the city and 10 surrounding communities brought the  blaze under control. Members of the Dominican Sisters of San Rafael fled safely  from the convent, original home to the founding Sisters of the college, said  Michelle Liapes, staff writer for the institution, who was watching the flames  from a window. "It's a very beautiful building and a landmark in the Marin  area."  </P></p>

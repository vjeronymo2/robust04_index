			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : AN INEFFECTIVE SET FROM ROBERT CRAY BAND AT UNIVERSAL  </P> <P> Between being announced at the Universal Amphitheatre Saturday as America's  premier R&amp;B band and utilizing the Memphis Horns, the Robert Cray Band left  plenty of clues that its music owes as much to Southern soul as to straight  blues. But the problems during the quintet's uneven two-hour performance went  beyond definitions of musical style or the six (!) broken guitar strings that  Cray suffered during the set.  </P> <P> Cray's effectiveness depends on waging a subtle kind of guerrilla war on  blues/soul conventions, in everything from song structure and lyric themes to  his spiky, rhythmically unpredictable solos and expressive singing.  </P> <P> The problem is that in a large hall like the Amphitheatre, Cray needs strong  material in which all those elements click, because there's no musical flash or  visual dazzle to fall back on. His up-tempo songs hardly qualify as  barn-burners, and the moody medium tempo and lack of punch Saturday became  enervating. Every song seemed to take the set back to square one.  </P> <P> The terse punctuations of the Memphis Horns added snap and color to the  quintet's Spartan sound. But, during the second hour, only brief, unexpected  interludes -- Cray's throat-lacerating gospel growls on one number, a Delta  blues duel with guitarist Tim Kaihatsu on another -- and his breakthrough hit  "Smoking Gun" sustained interest.

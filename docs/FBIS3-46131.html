			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By So Lai-Fun and Linda Choy] </F>   [Text] Legislators last night said China's latest  declaration on the airport breached the 1991 Sino-British accord  on the project.    The United Democrats' spokesman on airport and  infrastructure, Albert Chan Wai-yip, rejected the statements by  the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, calling it an  "irrational" move. Mr Chan said the Chinese Government breached  the agreement -- the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) -- under  which both sides said they would co- operate on the construction  of Chek Lap Kok.    He further criticised China's warning that it would declare  airport-related legislation passed by the pre-1997 legislature  invalid as disrespectful of the Basic Law. Mr Chan called on  the two governments to reveal their interpretation of the  memorandum and any exchanges that had taken place before the  signing. Despite the threats from China, the United Democrats  would continue to support the Government's funding request for  the airport projects to give them a chance of being completed  before the changeover, Mr Chan said.    Meeting Point's Fred Li Wah-ming said the statement was a  heavy blow to the confidence of Hong Kong people. He said  China's four point declaration carried an explicit warning that  legislators should not approve any of the funding proposals put  forward by the Government recently. Mr Li said his party would  not bow to such pressure, added that continuing objections from  China without concrete counter-proposals were of no help to the  airport row.    While other political parties regarded China -- the future  sovereign of Hong Kong -- as in a legitimate position to bring  its threats into action, they said due consideration should be  given to the impact on the community.    Describing the Chinese position as "unfortunate", Steven  Poon  Kwok-lim of the Liberal Party said it would inevitably harm the  airport's construction. It would be more difficult for the  project to move ahead if China displayed such an attitude, he  said.    But Mr Poon said the declaration would not change his  party's  stance on the airport funding issue or the Airport Corporation  Bill, the legislation governing the management body for the new  airport. "The four-point declaration does not contradict our  principles, we have stated very clearly that we would not agree  to any funding requests that would leave any (financial)  implications for the SAR [Special Administrative Region]  government", he said. As for the airport bill, Mr Poon said the  party's stance was that it would not give its consent without  China's approval.    Frederick Fung Kin-kee, chairman of the Association for  Democracy and People's Livelihood warned that the mainland  statement could lead to further delay in the airport projects.  It would create further hurdles in the search for financial  support, he said.    Tam Yiu-chung of the pro-China Democratic Alliance for the  Betterment of Hong Kong said Britain should stop all funding  requests until it received China's approval for the financing  arrangements. "One central theme of the statement is that China  as well as the future SAR will not shoulder any of the  responsibility left over by the unilateral move of the Hong Kong  British Government," Mr Tam said.</p>

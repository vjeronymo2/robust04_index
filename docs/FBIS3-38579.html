Ly.: "Willy Claes in Favor of the </F> Belgian Soldiers Remaining"]    [Text] At a time when some people in Europe are demanding  the withdrawal of the blue helmets from Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Belgium intends to keep its soldiers in former Yugoslavia,  Foreign Minister Willy Claes said on Wednesday [2 February]  during a press conference in Brussels.    "On the basis of principles," he said, "I cannot imagine a  humanist country like ours reaching the conclusion that we must  withdraw" from Bosnia. "Every effort must be made to avoid a  new confrontation."    Defense Minister Leo Delcroix, who was also taking part in  the press conference, shares the viewpoint of the Belgian head  of diplomacy, although the soldiers "must be able to work in  conditions of relative safety."  <H5>  Lack of Men </H5>   The limits of the Belgian mission in former Yugoslavia, the  two ministers noted, are primarily budgetary and the lack of  men. For instance, Mr. Delcroix pointed out that the Engineers  do not have enough men to ensure a full relief of those who are  in the area of Kakanj, in central Bosnia.    At the end of December 1993, a few more than 700 Belgian  soldiers were based in Baranja, in Serbian-occupied Croatia, and  more than 300 had been sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina. This  operation is the one which requires "by far" the most effort  from Belgium in the framework of UN missions.    Some countries, like Britain, periodically maintain doubt  about a withdrawal of their troops in the spring. But in  practice, those speaking out belong to the political world, like  the RPR [Rally for the Republic] in France or the People's Party  (right-wing opposition) in Spain, which are openly hostile to  the blue helmets remaining.  <H5>  Butrus-Ghali: We Will Continue </H5>   Aside from that, the international community seems to be  resigned to pursuing its negotiation mandate. This was the  message delivered on Tuesday evening by UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali, for whom an "overall reevaluation" of the  international effort is planned in the coming weeks.    Nothing very specific is filtering through from the  chancelleries for the time being. Reports from Bonn refer to a  joint initiative by Germany, the United States, France, and  Britain which would be presented to the warring sides when they  meet in Geneva on 10 February for new negotiations.  <H5>  In Brussels on Monday </H5>   The idea of the three European countries is to involve the  United States and Russia more. But the state of relations  between Paris and Washington on this issue, Germany's obligation  to keep a low profile, the Americans' refusal to play a more  active part in the UN force, and the Russians' natural alliance  with Serbia are all obstacles to a new initiative.    Bosnia will be on the agenda of the meeting of European  foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday, the first Council  meeting under the Greek presidency.</p>

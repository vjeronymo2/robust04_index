			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 14 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Finance  has decided to limit the amount of fruit travelers can bring  into Taiwan to two kilograms, down from the current six kgs,  customs officials said Thursday [14 April].    The decision was made after years of abuse of the 6 kgs rule  and after calls from customs officials to forbid the tourist  import of fruit.    In 1993, the Council of Agriculture asked customs to boost  its enforcement of the regulations, as illegal fruit retailers  were abusing the rules by asking tourists to help them import  large quantities of duty-free fruit.    The abuse caused grave concern among fruit growers in Taiwan  and led the Directorate General of Customs to suggest  prohibiting tourists from bringing in fruit altogether. The  proposal, however, was rejected because it violated consumer  rights.    The Ministry of Finance finally resolved the dispute by  cutting the legal fruit import limit to 2 kilograms. The new  limit will take effect after approval by Finance Minister Lin  Chen-kuo.</p>

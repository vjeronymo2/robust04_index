			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / City power plan wins approval PLANS for a Pounds 100m gas-turbine combined heat and power station on the edge of Newcastle upon Tyne's city centre were yesterday given outline approval by Tyne and Wear Development Corporation, Chris Tighe writes. The station, intended to provide heating for big energy users in the city, has been promoted as a showcase energy-efficient project suitable for a heavily populated urban location. The CHP concept has been championed by Newcastle City Council for more than a decade. Forth Energy, which devised the plans approved yesterday, is a consortium of the council, architects Couves and consulting engineers Merz and McLellan, both Tyneside companies. Although the project has outline planning consent, its high capital cost means it will only get off the drawing board if other large energy-sector companies become involved.</p>

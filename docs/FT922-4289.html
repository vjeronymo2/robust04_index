			<p>920606 FT  06 JUN 92 / Offer for Hawes creamery refused DAIRY CREST, the Milk Marketing Board subsiduary, yesterday rejected a Pounds 160,000 offer from the Hawes Dairy Rescue Committee for its cheese-making creamery in the North Yorkshire town, Chris Tighe writes. Dairy Crest ceased production of Wensleydale and other cheeses at the factory last week to transfer production to Lancashire. It told local campaigners that their offer, increased from Pounds 120,000, was still substantially below its own valuation. Mr John Blackie, rescue committee spokesman, said it would submit a final offer next week. He said premises had been lined up to start a new Hawes Wensleydale cheese factory if the offer was rejected.</p>

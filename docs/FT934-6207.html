			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Swiss to vote on introduction of VAT Swiss voters pride themselves on using their direct democracy responsibly; if taxes need to be raised, this action will be approved in a referendum. That sense of responsibility will be tested on Sunday when the Swiss will be asked, for the fourth time, to vote on the introduction of a value added tax. At a time when every other European government has long since introduced VAT, it may be asked why the Swiss have rejected the idea. The Swiss answer would be that no negative consequences have resulted from previous rejections in 1977, 1979 and 1991. This time, however, there is a sense of urgency. Federal government finances are in disarray as soaring social security spending in the recession led to record deficits. Another concern is the competitiveness of Swiss industry. Last December, Swiss voters rejected joining the European Economic Area (EEA), an expanded free trade area between the European Union and the countries of the European Free Trade Association. Swiss manufacturing companies have become increasingly nervous that exports to Europe will face increased costs when the EEA comes into force next year. Thus, their campaign to replace the existing 6.2 per cent turnover tax, which applies only to goods and capital spending, with VAT has been more passionate than on previous outings. It is estimated that Swiss industry would save SFr2.6bn a year if a 6.2 per cent VAT, applicable to services as well as goods and refunded from exports, were introduced. As is often the case in Swiss referendums, the balloting process will require considerable concentration from voters. They can vote for 6.2 per cent VAT or 6.5 per cent, which the government would prefer because it would raise more revenue. There is also an opportunity to vote in favour of adding another 1 percentage point to help underwrite soaring public pension costs. The VAT proposal has the full support of all the main political parties and business groups, with the exception of the restaurant and hairdressing trades which dread being brought into the tax net. Polls indicate that it will probably be approved by a narrow majority, but that the people will only approve a 6.2 per cent rate. Swiss voters would prefer to keep the pressure on the politicians to cut spending rather than let them have more money. In addition to VAT voters will also decide whether or not to abolish tobacco and liquor advertising, an issue brought to a referendum by concerned citizens.</p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / MPs favour longer stamp duty holiday A SURVEY of MPs suggests most favour extending the suspension of stamp duty. An Access Opinion survey of 100 MPs shows 65 per cent of Tories and 67 per cent of Labour MPs want abolition of the tax. Just 12 per cent of MPs want the tax re-imposed and 15 per cent would like to see its re-introduction delayed until the housing market picks up. Mr Clive Soley, MP for Hammersmith and a former Labour housing spokesman, said yesterday that the government must reconsider its stance on housing policy and financing. 'In the present circumstances it is probably a good idea to get rid of stamp duty, but the underlying message is that housing finance is in an appalling mess and they need to start from the beginning again,' he said. But Mr Quentin Davies, Tory MP for Stamford and Spalding and a member of the Commons Treasury select committee, said the experiment had been 'absolutely useless'. Mr Keith Vaz, Labour environment spokesman, called for the suspension to be extended until there was an upturn in the housing market.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Buoyant sales to NHS help Philip Harris to top Pounds 2m PHILIP HARRIS Holdings, the pharmaceutical and scientific equipment supplier, reported pre-tax profits up almost 15 per cent, from Pounds 1.76m to Pounds 2.02m, in the year ended March 31, helped by buoyant sales to the National Health Service. Following three acquisitions, gearing at the year-end stood at 65 per cent (28 per cent) and interest charges rose to Pounds 570,000 (Pounds 484,000). The figures, however, excluded the Pounds 5m proceeds of March's rights issue which were received after the year-end, reducing bank borrowings to about Pounds 1m and gearing to about 10 per cent. Turnover rose to Pounds 85.3m (Pounds 79.1m) with the medical division contributing Pounds 62.8m (Pounds 51.3m) to sales and Pounds 1.41m (Pounds 1m) to operating profit. Results included contributions from the nine retail pharmacies acquired in June 1992. Sales to the NHS continued at a 'buoyant level' with the wholesale business benefiting from the Folidays acquisition in February 1992. While political pressure over the NHS drugs bill had affected margins and stability, directors said that 'the natural growth in healthcare and in particular the increasing age profile of the population indicates that in the medium term this market should grow'. The education and science division felt the effects of recession and changes in the UK education system. Sales fell to Pounds 22.5m (Pounds 27.8m) and operating profits to Pounds 1.18m (Pounds 1.24m) following a centralisation programme. A final dividend of 4.65p gives a total of 6.85p (6.25p). Earnings were 16.47p (14.58p).</p>

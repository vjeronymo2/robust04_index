			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "eli": "70,000 Tonnes of Ammunition from the </F> National People's Army in Other Hands"]    [Text] Bonn -- According to the latest calculations, the  Federal Government has given away to other nations more than  70,000 tonnes of ammunition, approximately 900 armored vehicles  and artillery guns, 408,000 firearms, as well as other equipment  and materiel from the stocks of the former GDR National People's  Army [NVA] worth approximately 14 million German marks.  According to the Defense and Finance Ministries, the stocks of  wheeled vehicles considerably exceeds previous estimates.  Nonetheless, they say that the arms were scrapped, given away,  or disposed of faster than planned. According to the report,  the Bundeswehr has been largely relieved of the task of  stockpiling the military materiel. This work is carried out by  two companies running approximately 60 depots. Roughly 850  armored combat vehicles and artillery guns have been given away  to NATO partners, other countries, or the United Nations. The  report does not list the countries concerned; however, it is  known that Turkey is one of the largest buyers of former NVA  weapons.    More than 69,000 wheeled vehicles of the former NVA, above  all cars and trucks, have been made use of, but the report does  not say whether the vehicles were scrapped or supplied to other  countries. However, a major number of vehicles are no longer  technically usable and must therefore be scrapped. The people  running the depots have counted more than 110,000 vehicles.    Of the huge ammunition mountain, 100,000 tonnes have been  destroyed, and approximately 60,000 tonnes were given to other  countries. Approximately 111,000 tonnes are still in the  depots. Approximately 3,000 tonnes can be destroyed every month.  In addition, so far, a total of 956 combat tanks, 2,074 armored  combat vehicles, 814 artillery guns, and 140 fighter aircraft  have been destroyed. Under the arms control law, an equal  number of tanks and combat vehicles as well as 290 artillery  guns will yet have to be removed.</p>

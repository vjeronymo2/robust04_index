			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Gonzalez gets unions on side: Two main labour organisations agree to start pay pact talks SPAIN'S prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, yesterday won agreement from the country's two leading unions - the Socialist UGT and the Communist Comisiones Obreras - to start talks on a long-term wages pact. Both unions have in the past been extremely critical of the government's liberal economic policies. He spent nearly two hours with the unions' leaders, Mr Nicolas Redondo and Mr Antonio Gutierrez and, in what may presage a new rapprochement, he promised not to toughen a controversial strike law whose passage through parliament was blocked by his decision to call last month's general election. Mr Gonzalez's Socialist party won the election but lost its majority in parliament. In order to signal to foreign investors that the new government is serious about lowering inflation and reducing public sector deficits, he has had to move quickly to get the unions and employers around a negotiating table. As imports fall, wage increases of more than 7 per cent this year are now assumed to be the most important cause of inflation. By offering to allow the strike legislation to pass into law untouched, the prime minister is giving the unions what they want. Employers earlier this year denounced the draft law as a 'striker's charter' for the powers it gives pickets. The carrot being dangled in front of the employers is far-reaching reform of the labour market, with the unspoken promise that negotiations will result in laws that make it easier and cheaper to sack workers. Mr Gonzalez also met employers yesterday. Figures showing the Spanish economy in a much sharper recession than had been feared - gross domestic product shrank by 1.1 per cent in the first quarter - have added to the sense of urgency Mr Gonzalez is keen to give to the 'social pact' talks and to the work that has already begun on producing a restrictive budget for 1994. The budget has to be presented in September and many analysts believe the short-term fate of the peseta depends on the depth of public spending cuts. Mr Gonzalez is also scrambling to put a government together before the August summer holiday, but both the leading Catalan and Basque regional parties are reluctant (in varying degrees) to join a coalition. He is toying with naming a provisional minority government until the Catalans feel the right fiscal and federal policies are in place for them to join. But analysts warn that Mr Gonzalez can ill afford to begin this administration with anything smacking of the provisional. His failure to name a new cabinet for 16 months after winning the 1989 election crippled policy-making for almost all of his third term.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, January 5 (BTA) -- The Confederation of  Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB) must be a priority  concern for the National Council of Tripartite Cooperation, the  confederation's Vice President Ivan Neykov told a news  conference here today. KNSB, which is one of the two most  influential labour amalgamations in the country, will probably  come up with an official proposal on incomes policy countering  the proposal of government experts, Mr. Neykov said.    After three months of work in the Tripartite Council's  subcommittees, three fundamental differences still remain  between the proposals of the government and the KNSB, the  confederation's Executive Secretary Mr. Georgi Georgiev told the  news conference. The KNSB rejects the cabinet-proposed method of  adopting projected inflation as a key element in the overall  incomes policy. The amalgamation's experts claim that the 45  percent average annual inflation, projected for 1994, will be  exceeded already at the start of the year.    The KNSB also sees as unacceptable the government-suggested  options for cost-of-living adjustment of pensions. The  mechanism which is proposed now could make it impossible to  abolish adjustment supplements in future, Mr. Georgiev said.  Another option suggests merely a revision of the base of  pension calculation and a one-time rise without adjustment  payments throughout the year. The KNSB believes this will lead  to an economically and socially unjustified increase of the  difference between the lowest and the highest pensions. The  confederation will suggest an option which will retain the  inflation-related indexation of pensions. This will create  conditions for a complete abolition of cost-of-living adjustment  supplements to pensions in 1995, Mr. Georgiev said.    The KNSB does not accept a method suggested by the Finance  Ministry for wage formation and wage growth regulation in the  state-financed sector. The amalgamation insists on guarantees  of the availability of money for the payment of agreed wages in  the state-financed sector irrespective of budget revenue, Mr.  Georgiev said.</p>

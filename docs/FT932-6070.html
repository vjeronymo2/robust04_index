			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Markets: Clarke must seek some elbow room - London 'If you come to a fork in the road, take it' - Yogi Berra, legendary American baseball manager. ALL THE signs are that investors in the London market are in a dither. According to some stockbrokers - and it might be wishful thinking - the FT-SE 100 is about to break out of the increasingly narrow range in which it has traded. Consensus in the City about the direction of this move is, however, elusive. Those seeking guidance should therefore heed another Berra aphorism - 'You can observe a lot just by watching'. The case for shares rising above their recent ceiling of about 2880 rests heavily on the new chancellor finding a considerable degree of elbow room. Although sterling wobbled following Lamont's removal, bulls say the currency is strong enough to allow the incoming Kenneth Clarke scope to cut base rates from 6 per cent by a further percentage point. To prevent an interest rate reduction from weakening sterling unduly, however, Clarke would have to show he is prepared to cut public spending and set a policy framework to keep it down. No-one in the equity markets underestimates how difficult it would be to deliver this. But the bull case has also received strong support from an unlikely quarter  -the property sector. After being one of the hardest hit sectors during the recession, the last month has seen shares racing ahead as investors start to rebuild portfolios in expectation of more demand for quality properties. Further bull support can be gleaned from the turbulent derivatives market. Short sellers have been visible for some time in anticipation of a fall in the Footsie. But some market makers and holders of put options appear to be getting nervous the longer the index does not fall. Closing short positions could give a fillip to the market. So what could push the FT-SE 100 below the recent 2790 floor of its trading range? The bear case can be summed up simply - the market has fully responded to the economic recovery coming through. As one equity strategist said this week, 'Professional fund managers have bought the market and don't want a lot more of it.' Institutions appear to have decided how much to put in the market but are in two minds which stocks to pick. This shows up in some sharp moves in individual stocks, a pattern that emerged in New York last year when the American economy was in a similar shape to the UK's now. London is also keeping one eye on the European economies, heading into rather than out of recession, and another on New York that has almost daily hit new heights. It was noticeable that Wall Street's 24 point fall by London's close yesterday helped push the FT-SE index down 15 points to a close at 2840.7, up 28.5 on the week. Then there are questions marks about the pace of domestic economic recovery. Whatever the government is saying, there is a growing sense that it is slowing. Joe Dwyer, Wimpey chief executive, this week, appeared to underline this point in calling for a more expansionary economic policy. If recovery is not as strong as previously thought, some sectors of the market are looking frothy - share price multiples would appear to be running ahead of reported earnings growth. Since the start of the year, for example, the multiple on the FT Small Cap index, has risen from 21 times historic earnings to over 30 times. Smaller companies were heavily exposed to the UK recession and greatly underperformed in the last two years. But even so these are are demanding ratings which discount a considerable degree of recovery. What is more, after steadily outperforming the FT-SE 100, the FT-SE Mid 250 this week faltered and slipped, sending another warning that unrealistic expectations of recovery may be built into prices. The state of institutional liquidity offers little more comfort. True, the government's gilt auctions continue to find willing buyers; and large rights issues like this week's Pounds 199m call from Hammerson and last week's Pounds 442m from British Airways were safely underwritten. No doubt institutions also have kept something up their sleeves for BT3 in June and the Zeneca rights issue. But bankers said this week there were signs institutions are approaching the point of exhausting their appetite to fund both the public sector and private deficits. It has to be said that neither the bull nor the bear argument is that convincing. Nomura, the raging bull among stockbrokers, is therefore confidently expecting the FT-SE 100 to end the year at 3500 while Warburgs, among the more pessimistic brokers, think it will end closer to 2900. Despite their differences, Nomura and Warburgs broadly agree the strategy investors should adopt Investors, they say, should avoid cyclical recovery stocks which in general have risen too high, and pick longer term growth stocks in the pharmaceuticals, brewing and food retailing sectors. One event that would inject some life into the London market would be an injection of fresh cash. It could yet come from foreign investors. But the source of fresh funds that has never failed to get the market excited - the big cash takeover bid - seems increasingly less likely to appear. This week, Brian McGowan, one of the architects of acquisitive growth at Williams Holdings, the FT-SE conglomerate, resigned as chief executive. His parting remark that takeovers are increasingly difficult and expensive seemed to confirm that the age of the big bid is over. These things may go in cycles; the day of the mega-bid will no doubt return. But it is a fork in the road investors would have preferred to avoid.</p>

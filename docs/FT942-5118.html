			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): Kansallis-Osake-Pankki - Other companies Finland's leading commercial bank is expected to have remained heavily in the red, when it reports figures for the first four months today. Continuing high credit losses and the impact of rising long-term interest rates have led analysts to predict a loss of FM400m-FM500m (Dollars 93m) for the period, compared with a FM626m deficit a year ago. KOP, which has reported three consecutive years of losses, has already predicted another deficit for 1994 before an expected return to profit next year.</p>

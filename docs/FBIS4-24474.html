			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Bai Maqiao] </F>   [Text] The Second Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous  Regional People's Congress held its second plenary meeting  yesterday afternoon at the Tibet People's Hall.    Deputies attending the meeting heard a report by Wu  Shunxiang, deputy chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Regional  Planning and Economic Commission, on the execution of Tibet's  1993 economic and social development plan and on the autonomous  region's draft economic and social development plan for 1994.  They also heard a report by Pingcuo, director of the Tibet  Autonomous Regional Finance Department, on Tibet's final  financial account of 1993 and on its draft financial budget for  1994.    Puqung, executive chairman of the meeting and the presidium,  presided over the meeting.    Other executive chairmen of the meeting were Chen Kuiyuan,  Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, Luosang Toinzhub, Jiang Chengguang, Ma  Guanghua, Gao Shizhen, Zheng Guangju, Zhan Dui, Ni Zhicheng,  Baima Ciren, Chilai, Wang Xiaoruo, Luosang Xinba, Cidian Lamu,  Yixi Danzeng, Lu Sheng, Liao Jikang, Sangzhub, and Xiangba  Pingcuo.    Wu Shunxiang, who was entrusted by the Tibet Autonomous  Regional Government to make the report, said in his report:  Tibet continued to adhere to the reform and opening up policy  in 1993 and the region's economic and social development  maintained at a considerable speed last year. Over the past  year, under the leadership of the regional CPC Committee and  government, following the guidelines of the 14th CPC National  Congress and the spirit of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important  remarks made during his south China tour, centering on economic  construction, and proceeding from reform, people of all  nationalities in Tibet emancipated their minds and changed the  conventional way of thinking, enabling Tibet to take a new step  forward in carrying out reform and opening up -- its production  and construction developed rapidly and in a steady and sustained  manner; and work in the science and technology, education, and  other social sectors developed in a coordinated manner. The  region's 1993 gross product, calculated using current prices,  reached 3.65 billion yuan -- in terms of comparable prices, this  represents an 8.1-percent increase over the previous year, which  was higher than the planned growth of 8 percent. With the  public ownership system as the pillar, a diversified economic  setup in which simultaneous development was made in all economic  sectors began to take shape. The market was brisk, the economy  prospered, and the people's livelihood continued to improve.    To completely fulfill the 1994 plan, the report stressed  that  work in few important areas must be properly carried out. They  are: First, we should do everything we can to increase incomes  of the masses of peasants and herdsmen; second, we should ensure  that reform of state-owned enterprises is properly carried out;  third, we should endeavor to develop the market; fourth, we  should strictly control price increases; fifth, we should make  positive efforts to reform the workers pension system and the  unemployment insurance system; sixth, we should deepen reform of  the fixed asset investment system and further improve the  management of capital construction projects.    Based on an overall analysis of last year's economic  performance, Wu Shunxiang pointed out in his report: In 1994,  Tibet's economy can still maintain a good growth trend. As long  as we do our work well in all areas, we will be able to develop  the economy in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner, as  required by Chairman Gyaincain Norbu in his government work  report.    Pingcuo, who was entrusted by the autonomous regional  government to make the report, said in his report: Following  the more than 100 million yuan in financial revenue in 1992,  Tibet's financial revenue further increased in 1993 -- reaching  156 million yuan, a 43.5-percent increase over the previous  year, which was higher than the region's gross product growth.  Financial expenditures in 1993 was 2.16012 million yuan, a net  increase of 494,820 yuan -- or 30 percent -- over the 1992 final  account value. Both the absolute amount of increase in  expenditure and the increase percentage were the highest in  recent years. The guiding thoughts for the preparation of the  1994 budget are: to ensure the supply of daily necessities for  the people; to ensure that reform can be carried out smoothly;  to support construction; while ensuring funds for wages and  basic public expenditures, to smoothly promote financial,  taxation, and other major economic reforms; to strive to open up  new financial sources and to increase revenues; to adjust the  expenditure structure -- supporting selected agricultural,  animal husbandry, science and technology, and educational  projects and to the construction of infrastructural facilities;  and sharply reducing general consumption expenditures to ensure  that the economy develops in a sustained, rapid, and healthy  manner and to maintain social stability.    Tibet's party, government, and military leaders attended  yesterday's meeting. All members attending the Second Session  of the Sixth Tibet Regional Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference attended the meeting as  observers.    Yesterday's meeting should have been attended by 448  deputies; 358 deputies, meeting the quorum, attended the meeting.</p>

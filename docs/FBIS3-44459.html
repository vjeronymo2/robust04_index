			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by staff commentator Chang Shaoyang (1603 1421 </F> 2254): "It Is Necessary To Say `Two Things' to Foreign  Businessmen"]    [Text] When the great fire at the Shenzhen Zhili Technical  Toy Factory -- which had a death toll of 80 -- had just died  down, with nothing said about how its Hong Kong boss -- who is  nowhere to be found -- would be dealt with, two Taiwan-funded  enterprises in Fuzhou have become the new focuses of concern in  public opinion. In the first incident, a female worker at the  Yongqi Company was shut in a dog kennel, and the Taiwanese  manager -- who is held to be chiefly responsible -- has  absconded, following in the footsteps of the aforementioned Hong  Kong boss. Then, on 13 December, a fire broke out at Gaofu  Textile Company, Ltd., causing the deaths of some 60 workers.    True, there is an inevitable, accidental factor in any fire,  but for some time past, there really has been a small number of  foreign businessmen who pay no attention to Chinese laws and  decrees, being bent on making profits by playing wicked tricks  against their conscience: Some had no concern for the life and  safety of Chinese staffers and workers, and would not provide  labor conditions meeting safety and hygiene requirements.  Others did not show any respect for the human dignity of  Chinese staffers and workers, and would arbitrarily beat them,  call them names, conduct body searches, and restrict their  personal freedom. Some regarded Chinese staffers and workers  merely as cheap machines that create wealth, while allowing them  very low pay, and depriving them of legitimate public holidays,  as well as their right to leave with pay. Still others deprived  Chinese staffers and workers of their rights and interests in  organizing workers' trade unions, regardless of customary  international practice and the stipulations of Chinese law. In  certain foreign-funded enterprises, their awful demeanor has  gone beyond the tolerance of the law of any sovereign state.    It must be pointed out that the lawbreaking behavior of some  foreign businessmen had its cause in their ignorance of Chinese  law, not in deliberate actions. However, there really are some  individual foreign businessmen who definitely believe that  mainland China is "a paradise for adventurists," where they run  no risk, and they can keep the enterprise's running costs to a  minimum impossible to achieve abroad or outside the border, and  can reduce China's legal system to nothingness, as described in  a poetic line: "It looks like grass from afar, but is actually  nothing when one comes draws close."    How is it possible that those foreign businessmen have such  an understanding of mainland China? Who has led them into this  "erroneous zone?" Perhaps it would be no exaggeration to say  that "the cause lies in our own selves!"    One wave of the "craze for importing foreign funds" has  surged higher than another in various places over the past few  years. The volume of foreign funds imported, and the number of  foreign-funded enterprises sanctioned seemed to be the highest  criterion for assessing the governing accomplishments of "local  officials" at all levels. There is always a limit to foreign  funds, but not in the demand for them. Thus, all places were  vying to present their preferential policies. As for foreign  businessmen, their tax burdens have been cut time and again, and  land prices were cut increasingly deeper as local officials  bowed increasingly lower before foreign businessmen. Naturally,  foreign businessmen heard only a crescendo chorus of "welcome"  wherever they went; how could there be any "different opinion?"  Could there be places or people that would run the risk of  dampening the enthusiasm of investment- bent foreign businessmen  by enlightening them on the ABC's of the Chinese law?    "The habitual force of people going after profits is like  water in a river always running downstream." Foreign  businessmen come to China to invest in running enterprises so as  to make money; this is beyond reproach. To provide them with a  sound investment climate and play the role of host is something  that must be done. However, there is a "limit" to everything;  we must remember that "excess is just as bad as deficiency,"  which has been a law that governing things since ancient times.  Quite a few foreign businessmen have been scared away by the  "wild" super-preferential policies of some localities.  Regarding those places where vicious incidents frequently took  place, those earnest, law-abiding foreign businessmen who make  money by relying on their own abilities would ponder: Can one  be at ease in a legal environment that cannot even protect the  personal rights, interests, properties, and lives of its own  citizens, its own brothers and sisters?    Locking one's doors against the world is not socialism;  neither is being afraid of foreign countries or fawning on  foreign powers; nor is impoverishment or neglecting and even  sacrificing the legitimate rights and interests of one's own  compatriots in order to escape poverty and become well-off. In  socialist China, no patriotic Chinese who has intuitive  knowledge will ever tolerate a repetition of the tragic  "indentured laborers"; by no means will he tolerate the evil of  putting an equal sign between "Chinese and dogs" on PRC  territory!    To those foreign businessmen who plan to invest in China in  sincere cooperation, our door is wide open and will always be,  but we must tell them two things: First, we warmly welcome them  and will provide them with conveniences. Second, they must  observe Chinese laws, decrees and regulations, and must operate  in accordance with the law. Chinese laws are suitable to all,  without discrimination, regardless of surname, no matter whether  capitalist or socialist, Chinese or foreign. Those who abide by  the law will be protected, while lawbreakers will be penalized.  Soverignty and the law brook no nonsense.    The "welcoming ceremonies" are complete only when these "two  things" have been made clear. Of course, we must be true to our  word. The Hong Kong boss of the Zhili factory, and the Taiwan  manager of the Yongqi Company have left without saying goodbye,  believing that "the show is over" when they are "gone with the  wind," though on this point they are wrong.    In conclusion, we would like to say a few words to those  brothers and sisters "working" at foreign-funded enterprises:  True, we are poor today, but in seeking jobs, we should choose  a sound employer, while avoiding those places where we will have  to suffer and be humiliated, or even sacrifice our lives in  order to earn a living. In addition, we must be always serious  on one point: Should our legitimate rights and interests be  violated, we should learn to "protect ourselves" with the law.  Never should we forget that no matter the kind of enterprise at  which we work, we are the masters on this piece of land.</p>

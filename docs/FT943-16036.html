			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Court Cavendish shows advance to Pounds 3.09m Court Cavendish, the nursing home operator which came to the market last July, saw pre-tax profits jump from Pounds 194,000 to Pounds 3.09m during in the year to April 30 before exceptional costs of Pounds 600,000. Operating profits from existing homes were down 16 per cent at Pounds 2.33m due largely to a fall in occupancy following the introduction of the Community Care Act. But Dr Chai Patel, executive chairman, said this was only a temporary effect. 'Occupancy was down a bit to 91 per cent in the first half but picked up to 93.6 per cent in the second and for the first two months of this year is well over 94 per cent.' He believes it is sustainable at this level, which is above the company's historic average. Some other nursing home operators believe that Community Care will mean permanently lower occupancy for them. But Dr Patel said Court Cavendish has been less affected because almost 60 per cent of its customers are self-pay and its local authority work is biased towards specialist care which commands premium prices. Its average fee rates from continuing operations increased by 4.5 per cent with private care fees up 6.3 per cent. Existing homes showed a 2.4 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 13.9m with homes acquired during the year contributing Pounds 2.85m. The contribution to operating profit from acquisitions was Pounds 876,000, increasing the group total to Pounds 3.21m (Pounds 2.78m). The group spent Pounds 13.5m buying further homes in the year increasing the number of owned beds from 658 to 1,200. Dr Patel said the group was on course to add a similar number this year. The flotation proceeds of Pounds 38.6m cut the interest bill from Pounds 2.63m to Pounds 144,000. Earnings, excluding exceptional items, rose from 4.2p to 15p; a final dividend of 2.65p brings the total to 4p. The shares added 1p to 215p, compared with the flotation price of 225p.</p>

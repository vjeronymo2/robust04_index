Competitive Bidding Design <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. General Competitive Bidding Rules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 24. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  established the criteria to be used in selecting which auction design method to use for each particular auctionable service. Generally, we concluded that awarding licenses to those parties who value them most highly will foster Congress' policy objectives. In this regard, we noted that since a bidder's ability to introduce valuable new services and to deploy them quickly, intensively, and efficiently increases the value of a license to that bidder, an auction design that awards licenses to those bidders with the highest willingness to pay tends to promote the development and rapid deployment of new services and the efficient and intensive use of the spectrum. In articulating our auction design principles we further stated that: (1) Licenses with strong value interdependencies should be auctioned simultaneously; (2) multiple round auctions, by providing bidders with information regarding other bidders' valuations of licenses, generally will yield more efficient allocations of licenses and higher revenues, especially where there is substantial uncertainty as to value; and (3) because they are relatively expensive to implement and time-consuming, simultaneous and/or multiple round auctions become less cost-effective as the value of licenses decreases.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at &para;69. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 25. Based on the foregoing, we concluded that where the licenses to be auctioned are interdependent and their value is expected to be high, simultaneous multiple round auctions would best achieve the Commission's goals for competitive bidding.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at &para;&para; 109&hyph;111. We indicated that compared with other bidding mechanisms, simultaneous multiple round bidding will generate the most information about license values during the course of the auction and provide bidders with the most flexibility to pursue back-up strategies. Thus, we concluded that simultaneous multiple round bidding is most likely to award interdependent licenses to the bidders who value them the most. We also indicated that this method will facilitate efficient aggregation of licenses across spectrum bands, thereby resulting in vigorous competition among several strong service providers who will be able rapidly to introduce a wide variety of services highly valued by end users.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at &para; 106. In addition, we concluded that because of the superior information and flexibility it provides, this method is likely to yield greater revenues than other auction designs. Thus, we found that the use of simultaneous multiple round auctions would generally be preferred.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 26. However, because simultaneous multiple round bidding is likely to be more administratively complex and costly both for bidders and for the FCC than sequential or single round bidding, we indicated that we would use this auction design only where license values are interdependent and the expected value of the licenses to be auctioned is high relative to the costs of conducting a simultaneous multiple round auction.

Competitive Bidding Design for Broadband PCS Licenses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 27. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  we considered several auction methods including simultaneous multiple round bidding, sequential bidding, and combinatorial bidding. We discuss each of these below. We have chosen to adopt simultaneous multiple round auctions as our auction methodology for broadband PCS licenses. We believe that for broadband licenses this method will best meet Congress' goals in authorizing competitive bidding in section 309(j) of the Communications Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Simultaneous Multiple Round Auctions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 28. There is considerable support in the record for the use of simultaneous multiple round auctions, in which two or more licenses are put up for bid at the same time, and there are multiple bidding rounds in which bidders have the opportunity to top the high bids from the previous round. Several comments and studies in the record by academic auction experts advocate simultaneous multiple round bidding for broadband PCS.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  comments of PacTel Corporation, Attachment of R. Preston McAfee; comments of Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell, Attachment of Paul R. Milgrom and Robert B. Wilson; comments of NYNEX, Attachment by Robert G. Harris and Michael L. Katz. NTIA also recommends simultaneous multiple round bidding. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  Comments of NTIA at 14&hyph;16. Other experts recommend using some combination of sequential and simultaneous bidding.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  comments of Bell Atlantic Personal Communications, Inc., Attachment by Barry Nalebuff and Jeremy Bulow; and comments of Telephone and Data Systems, Attachment by Robert J. Weber. Some commenters who originally expressed no opinion on the issue or supported other methods in their comments supported proposals for simultaneous bidding in their reply comments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reply comments of AT&amp;T, GTE Service Corp. and Community Service Telephone Co. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> NTIA also supports all-or-nothing bids on groups of licenses,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  combinatorial bidding, in conjunction with simultaneous multiple round bidding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 29. The analysis in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  also supports simultaneous multiple round bidding for broadband PCS auctions. We concluded that multiple round bidding is generally superior to single round bidding, and that when licenses are interdependent, simultaneous bidding is generally superior to sequential bidding. As we noted in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , multiple-round auctions have the advantage over single-round auctions insofar as they provide more information to bidders about the value that other bidders place on licenses, increasing the likelihood that the licenses are acquired by those who value them most highly and increasing the revenue likely to be gained from the auction. Multiple-round auctions are also more likely to be perceived as open and fair. The disadvantage of multiple round auctions is that they have higher administrative costs than single round auctions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at &para;&para;82&hyph;85. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

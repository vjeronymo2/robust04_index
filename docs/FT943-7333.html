			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Gatwick near-miss blamed on computer A jumbo jet with more than 200 passengers and crew on board narrowly missed buildings at Gatwick airport because a navigation computer was faulty and the aircraft's crew made mistakes, a safety report said yesterday. The crew of the Continental Airways Boeing 747 was working on incorrect information when two attempts were made to land on February 7 last year. Both were aborted a short way from the runway. The aircraft was landed at the third attempt under manual control, a report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch said. The report said the problems arose because the aircraft's automatic flight control system failed to lock on correctly to Gatwick's landing guidance instruments. The captain, not knowing this had happened, accepted incorrect guidance instructions from a radar controller at Gatwick - without realising that instruments in his cockpit were accurately telling him he was off course. The report also blamed the captain for not realising how far off course he was when making his second approach - which saw the jumbo pass within 500 feet of the airport's south terminal building. It recommended that the US Federal Aviation Administration should investigate the computer failure.</p>

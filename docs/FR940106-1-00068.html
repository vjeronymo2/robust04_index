			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Given this potential flexibility, EPA believes that establishing smolt survival indices as Fish Migration and Cold Fresh-Water Habitat criteria would give the State Board maximum latitude in choosing a set of implementation methods that will attain protection of the designated migration and coldwater fisheries uses. As such, these proposed criteria are consistent with the mandates of section 101(g) of the CWA, as discussed above, and accommodate the State's interest in allocating its water supplies in a way that maximizes the many values important to the State. Furthermore, the proposal of these criteria is consistent with the authority in CWA section 303(c)(4), which authorizes EPA to propose revised or new standards to meet the requirements of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> e. Protection of Other Salmon Runs and Life Stages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the smolt survival indices were developed using tagged fall-run fish during the time of their outmigration, EPA is proposing the use of these indices only for fall-run outmigrants. For winter-, late fall-, and spring-run salmon, as well as steelhead, there is no direct information about the factors that affect survival, although it is likely that many of the same factors, with the exception of temperatures during the colder months, are also affecting the juveniles of these populations as they migrate through the Delta.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Measures implemented by the USBR and SWP as a result of the Biological Opinion for winter-run salmon issued by NMFS under the ESA afford some protection for other runs, in addition to protection for the winter-run salmon population itself. NMFS, Biological Opinion on Central Valley Project, 1992 Operations (February 14, 1992). In addition, EPA has been consulting with NMFS to assure that the implementation of EPA's proposed standards will not jeopardize the winter-run Chinook salmon population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Juvenile spring-run salmon and steelhead move through the Delta during the same period as winter-run and fall-run salmon, and should be protected in the Delta by measures taken for these other runs. Late fall-run salmon, however, outmigrate in fall and early winter, and are currently not fully protected during their passage through the Delta. Protective criteria for this run should be developed by the State Board in the near future to ensure that this run is protected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Younger salmon, or fry, also enter the Delta, particularly when rainstorms stimulate the movement of fry out of the tributaries and into the lower Rivers and Delta. Some protection for these fry is afforded by the current State Board standards requiring closure of the Delta Cross Channel gates when flows are higher than 12,000 cfs. However, closure of the Cross Channel gates alone may not be protective enough, since fry can be swept into the central Delta through Georgiana Slough and upstream to the export pumps when there is reverse flow in the lower San Joaquin River, especially during times of high export. For that reason, Delta habitat conditions for fry may need to be addressed by the State Board in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> f. Protection of Other Migrating Species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Species other than salmonids seasonally migrate into and out of the Delta for spawning and as juveniles. These species include striped bass, Delta smelt, longfin smelt, white and green sturgeon, American shad and Sacramento splittail. With the exception of temperature, the factors that lead to successful migration of salmonid smolts are also important for successful migration of the juveniles of these species into the lower embayments. Therefore, EPA's proposed salmon smolt survival criteria, although specifically addressing fall-run Chinook salmon, will also help protect migration of these other migrating species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

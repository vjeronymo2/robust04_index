			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE PARTY ANIMALS;  </P> <P> CAMPAIGNS: DESPITE A LIKELY LOW TURNOUT OF YOUNG VOTERS, A COMMITTED GROUP OF  COLLEGE-AGE MEN AND WOMEN IS HARD AT WORK IN POLITICS.  </P> <P> Election day was less than three weeks away, and things seemed to be going well  enough in the Dianne Feinstein for Governor campaign. The Democratic  gubernatorial candidate and her entourage of staff, security, family and the  press would arrive at this Encino home for another in a long series of campaign  fund-raisers, and Mia Bernstein's part in all this was simple, really.  </P> <P> The 23-year-old San Fernando Valley woman -- a campaign intern and member of  the Feinstein advance team -- was mainly needed to bring the small public  address system from her own house, just blocks away, before greeting the  candidate at curbside. Bernstein, like other young, novice campaign workers  spread throughout the state's various political races, had found in her six  weeks on the Feinstein staff that more experienced election strategists were  counting on her.  </P> <P> This weekend luncheon would run flawlessly, even if Feinstein arrived a bit  ahead of schedule, and ahead of some of the press. Bernstein could smile easily  in a way she couldn't have imagined early last month, when it was her  high-pressure responsibility to gather a crowd of about 700 supporters for a  post-debate rally in Burbank.  </P> <P> In spite of polls that reflect a consistently low turnout for voters between  the ages of 18 and 24, Bernstein is part of a tight, committed group of  college-age men and women working in politics for the first time. Their  involvement ranges from the grass-roots busywork of hanging campaign placards  and telephone solicitation to meaningful roles in the offices of candidates and  political parties.  </P> <P> In the Valley, only Cal State Northridge and Glendale Community College can  claim active campus Democratic and Republican clubs working in the local and  statewide campaigns leading up to Tuesday's election. But it's actually the  efforts of individual students from these and other local campuses such as Los  Angeles Valley College and Pierce College that may be having the most direct  and lasting impact on contemporary politics, say student organizers in both  gubernatorial camps.  </P> <P> "When I came into the campaign, I was given a lot of responsibility, and that  was amazing to me in the beginning," Bernstein said, pausing briefly after the  Encino event before driving down to the campaign's Wilshire Boulevard offices.  "I was in shock. I was so nervous the first time I met her."  </P> <P> The presence of youthful campaign workers can offer a candidacy what the older  pols describe as a more excited atmosphere in what otherwise might become a dry  season of campaign rhetoric, charges and countercharges. "I think they bring an  enthusiasm," said George Gorton, campaign director for Republican gubernatorial  hopeful Sen. Pete Wilson. "And they charge the candidate up like crazy. He  walks in and they cheer and shout. The candidate really gets pumped up."  </P> <P> Gorton's experience with the youngest section of the electorate runs deeper  than most of his fellow political consultants. In 1972, he worked in President  Richard Nixon's reelection campaign as national college director. And it has  been with his encouragement that the state Republican Party has embarked this  year on a massive drive to recruit college and high school students into the  election effort, hoping to capitalize on polls conducted by the Wilson campaign  that revealed strong support for the Republican among young voters.  </P> <P> According to Stephanie Schroder, the party's state youth director, more than  5,000 students have been organized for the Republican cause. It's the first  large-scale student outreach Gorton has seen since the 1974 race for governor  between Democrat Jerry Brown and Republican Houston Flournoy. He said that  before this year's effort, campaigns all but ignored the youth vote.  </P> <P> Gorton, 43, said he always believed that the young electorate was an untapped  source of votes, even during the 1972 election, when organizing for a  Republican candidate on radicalized college campuses was a daunting task.  </P> <P> "Back in those days, people really cultivated them," he explained. "That was  the first year that 18-year-olds had the right to vote."  </P> <P> It was the prospect of helping to elect the state's first female governor that  attracted Laramy Blohm, 20, to volunteer at the Feinstein campaign headquarters  last July. A psychology student at CSUN, Blohm began by coming in every day to  help work the telephones, calling congressional offices across the state  looking for more campaign volunteers. Three weeks later, she was offered a  paid, part-time position as the office receptionist.  </P> <P> "For a 20-year-old, it's not like an average job," Blohm said. "It's not like  working at a tanning salon or something."  </P> <P> Before now, Blohm's interest in politics hadn't reached any further than voting  on Election Day. Her plan with the Feinstein campaign was originally to just  get a taste of politics.  </P> <P> "My interest in government has been increasing every day," said Blohm, who  hopes to go to law school. "Like Mia, the more responsibilities I take on, and  the more people that I meet, the more my interest expands. So now it would be a  goal for me to work in the government."  </P> <P> Danette Dugas was juggling phone calls again one afternoon, surrounded by the  stately photographic portraits of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, and  pausing only to direct visitors through the plush Burbank offices of the  California Republican Party. The 20-year-old Valley College business major had  only been working there about four weeks, and already she was a paid member of  the special events staff.  </P> <P> "Probably at first it seemed overwhelming," she said, "but it's a very  comfortable atmosphere. It just takes a little getting used to."  </P> <P> Work within the party offers students an inside look at the election process,  while adding some job security that no campaign offers after Election Day. The  office work can also carry more substance than the sign-hanging of typical  campaigns, explained Dan Schnur, Republican Party communications director.  </P> <P> It was the job itself that first attracted Anna Blishak as a 17-year-old to the  party three years ago -- that and the close proximity of its headquarters to  her high school. Her parents were longtime Republican voters, but an interest  in politics developed only after she started to work for the party. And the  intention of the Valley College business major to remain active with the party,  regardless of where her career takes her, reflects what Gorton said is a  tendency of young voters to follow indefinitely their earliest political  experiences.  </P> <P> "I'd like to stay involved somehow, whether it's volunteering or whatever,"  Blishak said. "It's been around me these past three years, and it's part of my  life now. I can't imagine not being involved at all."  </P> <P> During an election year, much of the political excitement and attention  inevitably focuses on the individual candidates, leaving the party to work more  behind the scenes. But David Knatcal, a 22-year-old CSUN political science  major who has worked in the Republicans' communications department the last 15  months, said he feels connected with all levels of the election.  </P> <P> "I much prefer it," Knatcal said. "It gives you such a broad view of  everything. You're involved in, conceivably, every race. Being the California  Republican Party, we're in touch with the whole state. There are certain  advantages to being focused on one campaign, but I think I'm learning a lot  more here."  </P> <P> On Valley campuses, only a handful of student clubs representing Democrats or  Republicans are active this election year. Knatcal, a member of the CSUN  Republican group a few years ago, said his commitment had grown beyond the club  by the time he volunteered at the Burbank party office.  </P> <P> For this election at least, it appears that the clubs are designed more to  educate their members than to do any meaningful campaigning for the various  party candidates.  </P> <P> "I'd say people join the club just to get a general idea of the Republican  Party," explained Dave Louden, 20, president of the Republican club at Glendale  College. The state's 28 ballot propositions, he said, "are so long and involved  a lot of people aren't quite sure how the party stands on them, what they  mean."  </P> <P> The Republican club at CSUN began having regular meetings again only last  month, after at least a year of inactivity. And the school's young Democratic  organization was able only to get its members out to campaign for the party  last weekend. Both club rosters list about two dozen members, although it is  usually a core of about 10 that regularly participates in group activities.  </P> <P> "We've kind of missed the boat, unfortunately, at least at this point with the  gubernatorial and state assembly," admitted Doug Winger, 21, vice president of  the CSUN Republican group. "But in the next year or two, we've got quite a few  campaigns coming up. And personally, I would like to get more involved."  </P> <P> The CSUN Democrats were successful in bringing former Gov. Jerry Brown, now  state party leader, to speak on the campus in early October. Club president  David Weiss said the group was also working to get students living away from  home to vote by mail.  </P> <P> Weiss, a 20-year-old political science major, has worked beyond the confines of  his club as the only college-age volunteer for Irene Allert, Democratic  candidate for the 38th Assembly District. At a recent Wednesday afternoon  meeting of the club, he said he was even happy to see his rivals in the CSUN  Republicans organizing again.  </P> <P> "I'm actually glad that they are, because I think it's important that students  have that option," Weiss said. "It makes me angry when students aren't involved  and they don't care about the political process. And I'd rather see them, as  much as I hate to say this, active in the Republican Party than nothing at  all."  </P> <P> To observers, a career in politics may have seemed an obvious path for Mia  Bernstein, but she said she was slow to realize it herself. Her mother is Sandy  Miller, longtime chief of staff for state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana). As a  toddler, young Mia often accompanied her mother to political functions. Still,  Bernstein did not immediately choose political science as her major at UC Santa  Barbara, and the initial idea to join the Feinstein campaign as an intern  started as a suggestion from her mother.  </P> <P> "Even though I was always surrounded by politics, I voted, but never got into  it until now," Bernstein said, sitting in a Wilshire Boulevard office  surrounded by signs and posters of her candidate. "I always understood it, but  it was something that was out there, not part of me.  </P> <P> "The stuff that we studied was international relations and history, like what  happened during the Depression. And except for a couple of classes in public  policy, I haven't had any actual 'This is what's happening today.' I think I'm  learning more here than I ever would in school. Absolutely."  </P></p>

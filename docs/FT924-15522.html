			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Survival of the fittest: Ways to weather the recession Ray Neale has a nice little business making steel structures for the building industry in Portslade on the Sussex coast. Westwing Engineering employs seven people and has annual sales of just over Pounds 200,000. The bad news is that two years ago Mr Neale was running an even bigger business, R Neale &amp; Co, with twice as many employees and four times the turnover. But some of his customers could not pay and others would not pay, so the company collapsed. R Neale made its own small contribution to the statistics which chart the swelling flood of bankruptcies. More than 46,000 businesses, mostly small, failed in the first nine months of this year, according to Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group. One of the principal causes has been customers failing to pay their bills. 'It was mainly bad debts,' says Mr Neale. 'The banks tell you to do a credit check on your customers but that doesn't mean a thing. Sometimes even your big customers go down while others tell you that they are not satisfied with the work you have done and hold back payment.' For a time it looked as though Mr Neale, 48, and with more than 30 years in the steel business, would have to sell his home to pay off debts of more than Pounds 70,000. But he managed to remortgage the house and start up in business again. He is determined that things will be different this time. 'I am very uptight about everything I do now,' he says. 'I chase people right down to the last penny.' Ray Neale has survived to fight another day. He has even taken over a smaller welding company which itself went under with debts of just over Pounds 6,000. But the increased rate of failure of well-established small businesses is causing concern. 'We are not dealing with businesses which have been reckless,' says Mr David Swaden, a partner in insolvency specialists Leonard Curtis &amp; Co. 'What is worrying is that we are down to bedrock, family businesses which have used up their reserves and their energy fighting the recession.' It is often the smaller businesses, many of them set up during Mrs Thatcher's enterprise revival of the 1980s, which are the most vulnerable. Small companies may be more flexible than large corporations but they often lack the management expertise, the financial resources and the broad customer base which can help larger competitors ride out the recession. Numerous studies have pointed to a shortage of capital and related financial problems such as excessive dependence on borrowings, poor financial management and the high level of interest rates as the main reasons for businesses failing. Even well-managed businesses can be undone by events beyond their control. But a recent survey by the Manchester Business School revealed, to the researchers' surprise, that business owners did not blame outside events for the failure of their venture but accepted their own limitations as managers. If the problems are within the control of the managers themselves what should companies do to survive the recession and stay out of the clutches of the insolvency profession? Experience suggests the following should be given priority: Realistic business planning. 'Too many businesses set their plans on the assumption that nothing will go wrong,' says Mr Swaden. Even in the best of times you must build room into your business plan to allow for setbacks. In a recession this becomes even more necessary. Accurate and timely financial information. 'Companies frequently do not have efficient accounting systems so they do not know where losses are being made,' says Mr Mike Wheeler, a turnround specialist at accountants KPMG Peat Marwick. 'We go into some companies, even listed companies, and find there is financial chaos.' Tight control of cash flow. Companies often do not understand the difference between cash flow, which is money in the hand to pay the wages, and profits, which are a book-keeping entry arrived after applying the relevant accounting conventions. Mr Lance Blackstone of accountants Blackstone Franks advises managers to review every stage in the production and sales cycle to see if can be shortened or reorganised to free more cash. Credit control. Put your credit policy down in writing and make someone responsible for enforcing it. Take credit references on all new customers and update them regularly. When dealing with new or risky customers you should protect your position by asking for personal guarantees, taking out credit insurance or by making partial shipment against part-payment. Do not allow long credit periods and chase up slow payers promptly but firmly. Keep on good terms with the bank manager. He should be given all the relevant data he needs. If anything goes wrong he should not be kept in the dark but you must have ready a plan to put things right. Check the terms and renewal dates of bank facilities and plan ahead for renewal meeting. Keep good stock controls. Boxes of unsold product gathering dust have to be financed and take up costly space. Computerised stock control systems are available but you can achieve a lot by walking round the warehouse to identify slow-moving items. Do not be afraid to discount, sharply if necessary, to move obsolete stock. Try to broaden your customer base. A range of customers means that it need not be the end if one large customer goes down. If financial problems are looming, act fast. It is easier to renegotiate a loan agreement with the bank manager or sell an unprofitable part of the business if your negotiating partner believes he is dealing with a sound business. If your difficulties are only too obvious your negotiating hand will be weakened. Many of the businesses which fail, particularly those with attractive products or a lucrative market niche, live on in some form - often under new ownership and with a reduced workforce. But this is little consolation to the original owners who may have lost their homes and livelihood.</p>

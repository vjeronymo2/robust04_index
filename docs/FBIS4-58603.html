			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, May 5 (AFP)--Southern warplanes attacked the  government headquarters and the radio and television centre here  Thursday, an AFP correspondent reported.    Anti-aircraft guns blazed into action and it was not  immediately known if the planes hit their targets, the  correspondent added.    Witnesses also reported that a southern aircraft may have  been shot down over Sanaa just before dawn.    Airports in the towns of Ta'izz in the south and in  al-Hudaydah in the west also came under attack Thursday from  southern planes but were not hit, the defence ministry said in a  statement.    President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih declared a 30-day state of  emergency following the worsening fighting between his  supporters from the north and their southern rivals.    Troops were deployed in the deserted streets as army  vehicles  criss-crossed the city.</p>

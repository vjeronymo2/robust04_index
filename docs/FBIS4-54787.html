			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 4 -- Leader of the Social Democracy  of the Republic of Poland (SDRP) and Chairman of the  Parliamentary Caucus of the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD)  Aleksander Kwasniewski now on a visit to the United States, met  with Polish and American journalists at the National Press Club  in Washington on Wednesday.    Some twenty journalists, including correspondents of the  leading U.S. newspapers questioned Kwasniewski about the  situation in Poland, his attitude to President Lech Walesa,  Poland's strivings to join NATO and his views on Russia.    Kwasniewski declared that Poland is a politically stable  country of a mature democracy, in which ruling teams change but  the main elements of implemented reforms remain unchanged. He  pointed to the development of market economy in Poland and its  openness to the world. He also stressed that there is a  consensus among Poland's main parties as to the basic principles  which should be included in the future constitution.    The SLD leader criticized the Solidarity trade union for the  present strike action. He said that Solidarity is using  frustration and disappointment for political purposes which can  be dangerous for Poland. "Solidarity is trying in this way to  return to the political scene after (...) its defeat in the  parliamentary elections," he said.    Kwasniewski declared that Poland wants to become full member  of NATO and added that he shares the opinion of Deputy Secretary  of State Strobe Talbott that the "Partnership for Peace" should  be the road leading Central European countries to NATO.    He stressed that Poland's efforts to join NATO are being  wrongly interpreted by Russia as an attempt to form a bloc  directed against that country. "We want to cooperate with  Russia and we want to have the best possible relations with it,"  he stated.    Asked for his opinion about President Lech Walesa, the SLD  chairman stressed that although there are many differences  between his party and the president "we share the great  responsibility for Poland and we have to jointly find some  compromise." Kwasniewski criticised the president for wasting  the chance of "strategic changes" instead of concentrating on  many detailed issues. In his opinion the president in Poland  should have a position strong enough to be able to act in time  of crisis. He thought that the American model of presidency is  not possible in Poland.    Kwasniewski is staying in the United States with a  delegation  of Polish parliamentarians. On Tuesday, the delegation met with  Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, held talks in the  Congress and met with the Supreme Court Judge Antonin Scalia.  On Wednesday, the Polish parliamentarians met with influential  Democratic Senator Paul Simon of Illinois and on Thursday they  are to meet with Ambassador Richard Shifter, director for East  European affairs in the Presidential National Security Council.</p>

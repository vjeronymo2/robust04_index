			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Six found guilty over East Timor massacre INDONESIA'S army said yesterday it had found six soldiers guilty for last November's massacre of civilians in East Timor and would court martial eight others, Reuter reports from Jakarta. General Edi Sudradjat, army chief of staff, announcing the findings of a special military council investigating the November shooting, told reporters that a further five soldiers were being investigated. An earlier government- installed national commission said the troops killed about 50 people, while witnesses say at least 100 people died when soldiers fired into a crowd of East Timorese independence demonstrators attending a funeral. The report of the national commission put much of the blame on the security forces and yesterday's announcement should help to appease Indonesia's major aid donors, who have demanded that soldiers be punished for their role in the shooting. Those found guilty include two generals - the former East Timor military commander and regional military commander - who were relieved of their posts in late December. Of the six, General Sudradjat said three had been dismissed from the military, two had been removed from active duty but had been allowed to keep their uniforms, and one was temporarily off active duty. The eight soldiers being court-martialled include four junior officers, three non-commissioned officers and one private.</p>

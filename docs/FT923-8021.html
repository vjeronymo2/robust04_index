			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Fed watches the dollar slide THE DOLLAR again threatened to drop to its all-time low against the D-Mark yesterday, but central banks did not intervene to support the US currency, writes James Blitz. After opening at around DM1.4680 in European trading, the dollar fell through the DM1.4610 level at which the Federal Reserve and European banks had extensively intervened on Monday. It closed in Europe at DM1.4590, and lost further ground in New York to DM1.4553. The dollar was partly weighed down by poor US indicators. The retail sales figure for July was up 0.5 per cent, and the June figure was revised down to a fall of 0.3 per cent from a rise of 0.5 per cent. But analysts pointed to more fundamental reasons for dollar weakness: the fear of higher German rates and the belief that central bank intervention to support the dollar is proving increasingly tricky. Dealers believe that another rise in the German Lombard rate is possible, widening the differential with short-term US rates. The Bundesbank's withdrawal of funds from the German money market in its intervention on Wednesday pushed call money up to the Lombard rate level, which has clearly worried the market. One London analyst said that a big test now is how the Bundesbank reacts to the forthcoming figure for 2nd Quarter GDP, which could show a drop of between  1/2 per cent and 1 per cent. 'If the Bundesbank keeps call money tight, it will show that the risk of recession is still not forcing them to cut rates,' he said. There is a feeling, too, that central bank intervention cannot easily turn the market. Some dealers doubt the Bundesbank's commitment to buy dollars and sell D-Marks, because this will exacerbate its money supply problems. Others believe that intervention can only work when the economic fundamentals favour the currency that is being supported. As they say in the US markets: 'You cannot stop the dollar on a dime.' Fears of a German rate rise took their toll in Europe. The pound was not saved by better-than-expected economic indicators, and closed at a new 27-month low against the German currency of DM2.8170. The possibility of heavy intervention to support the currency is increasing: one analyst warned yesterday that the Bank of England will soon come out 'with guns blazing.' The Italian lira fell sharply against the D-Mark to L759.3 after a previous close of L758.0. The lira's difficulties were compounded by Moody's rating agency, which announced a two-notch downgrade in Italy's foreign currency credit rating. The French franc fell to a 5-month low against the D-Mark, closing at FFr3.392 from FFr3.390.</p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / US warns Japan on economic squabbling The US, seeking to extract trade concessions from Japan, has issued a fresh warning to Tokyo underscoring the risks of continued economic squabbling, Reuter reports from Washington. Washington has been negotiating an agreement to open up Japan's glass sector and has sought an accord on vehicles and parts - the single biggest component of the US trade deficit with Japan. But the talks have proved tough going. Should no trade deal emerge in the glass sector by today, according to top officials in the Clinton administration, the allies would find themselves in 'a difficult situation'. As for cars: 'It is essential that we reach agreement'. The warning was directed to Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japanese trade minister, in a letter dated October 25 from Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, and Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary. A copy of the letter, whose existence was first reported in a Japanese newspaper on Friday, was obtained by Reuters. 'It was a direct letter. . . that will hopefully provide some results,' Mr Brown told US public television. 'We're very anxious to re-engage the Japanese as soon as possible.' Mr Kantor and Mr Brown wrote to Mr Hashimoto in reply to two letters he had sent them earlier this month, thanking the Tokyo trade minister for his 'candid comments'. Officials said Mr Hashimoto had complained about a recent speech by Mr Jeffrey Garten, commerce undersecretary and the chief US negotiator on cars, in which he had outlined the advantages of private-sector co-operation. 'The Japanese took umbrage with that speech. This letter was in response,' said one official. No reply to the latest US letter had been received by the weekend, another said. But the US side made clear that a long-sought deal on automotive trade - which accounts for two-thirds of the Dollars 60bn bilateral imbalance  - was vital to improved relations. 'It is essential that we reach agreement,' they wrote. As for glass, under negotiation this week, Mr Kantor and Mr Brown both voiced 'concern at the pace of discussions in Tokyo. There are many issues left to resolve before the end of the month.' The two sides struck an agreement in principle on October 1 to open Japan's Dollars 4.5bn flat glass market and pledged to finalise the accord in 30 days. 'We cannot conclude an agreement that does not result in substantial opening of the glass distribution system. Failure to reach an agreement by the end of the month would create a difficult situation,' Mr Kantor and Mr Brown said. They did not spell out what action the US team might take should no accord emerge and reiterated that the Clinton administration was not seeking 'numerical targets' over glass.</p>

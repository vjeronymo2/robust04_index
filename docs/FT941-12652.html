			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (10): Cash in hand will ensure flexibility - Where will investment opportunities arise this year?  Analysts do not expect a re-run of 1993. Some see Japan as a good buy, but are less clear about Europe and the UK So what does the investor do for an encore? Last year was a real rollercoaster on world stock markets, and those many fund managers who sat on their hands - and their profits - at the end of the third quarter of 1993 missed out on the massive bull run in most markets during the run-up to Christmas and the new year. Just to get the facts out of the way: the world, as measured by the FT Actuaries World Index, advanced in sterling terms by more than 25 per cent, and a little less for dollar-based investors. This global return concealed a relatively weak performance on Wall Street, where the return in dollars (9.6 per cent) was the smallest for any of the 24 markets surveyed. It also averaged out some spectacular results in such markets as Malaysia (136 per cent) and Hong Kong (134 per cent). No single market ended in negative ground. Japan outperformed Wall Street by a couple of percentage points, measured in local currency, but the strength of the yen gave sterling-based investors a total return, including re-invested income, of almost 28 per cent. The Pacific region, excluding Japan, produced a remarkable near-doubling of returns over the full year; Europe, excluding the UK, yielded 36 per cent; the UK itself showed an advance of 26.7 per cent. The question now is: where will the markets go from here? Most analysts viewing the new old year were agreed that it was too much to ask for a re-run in 1994; and the first trading days in January did see some significant setbacks among last year's star performers, with Malaysia and Hong Kong each down by some 6 per cent in a matter of days. On the other hand, Wall St continued to hit new highs, despite the growing conviction that the US Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates will be upwards. Interest rates, coupled with low levels of inflation and only modest, or no, growth in the main western economies, are the uncertain (and unusual in recent investment cycles) backdrop to the current year. Yet history, even including the 1987 markets crash, still shows that, over time, equities outperform most other investments; and mainstream analysts are sticking with that view. Even though their conviction at the start of 1994 appeared to have waned just a fraction, it is still generally bullish. Could there be a sea-change around the corner? Some analysts think this could happen in the front-running emerging markets, especially in the Pacific rim. But on Japan itself there continue to be hopes of even lower interest rates, tax cuts and a further massive injection of infrastructure spending, albeit by a politically uncertain government. A declining yen, fervently hoped for by Japanese exporters, would help the share price of high-technology companies; and Nomura Securities thinks Japan is a good bet for 1994. The firm has increased its investment exposure there, mainly at the expense of Australia, Canada and Hong Kong. But if many global investment funds see Tokyo as 'cheap' at the moment (it is still more than 50 per cent below its all-time high, achieved at the end of 1989), managers are less clear - and more divided - over Europe, including the UK, and also about the high multiples on Wall Street. Europe surged ahead by almost one-third last year (Germany by 41 per cent, Switzerland by almost 48 per cent, both in sterling terms) and some investment weightings there are being reduced by British fund managers; but not so far by most of the highly-liquid large American houses, with the notable and well-publicised exception of Morgan Stanley Staying slightly overweight in cash may not give much immediate return, but it does provide flexibility to exploit particular opportunities; and the bond markets at the longer end are beginning to look attractive, against a low-inflation environment. Taking a little profit from the 1993 bonanza could be no bad thing.</p>

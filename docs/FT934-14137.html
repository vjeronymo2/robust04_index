			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Native rights will apply to farm leases, says Keating MR Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, yesterday delivered a blow to the nation's farmers when he hinted that proposed native land rights legislation would allow claims against land held under pastoral leases. The government had previously indicated that only mining leases would fail to extinguish native title, which, in turn, could 'co-exist' with the mining lease and revive once the latter expired. During parliamentary question time yesterday, Mr Keating said he expected only about 11 pastoral leases issued between the implementation of the 1975 Racial Discrimination Act and 1993 to be affected by the government's legislation. But he said native title claimants could make claims under common law on all of the thousands of pastoral leases issued before 1975. The government has been battling to draw up a system for deciding Aborigine land claims, in the wake of a High Court decision last year. This ruling, known as the 'Mabo' decision, threw out the notion that Australia was essentially unoccupied before European settlement, and suggested the Aborigine claims could be valid where there had been close and continuing association with the land in question. The National Farmers' Federation campaigned strongly for a ban on native title rights on all pastoral leases. Aboriginal groups, by contrast, argued that pastoral leases should be among the leases which did not extinguish native title rights. Mr Keating said yesterday the legislation would allow states to validate all pastoral leases without the lessees having to disprove the existence of residual native title. Holders of pastoral leases on land covered by native title would have primacy, with no question of co-ownership. 'The only question then at issue is whether in validating these leases, we should go so far as to extinguish native title completely and forever, or whether we should leave the relationship between lease rights and native title to the common law,' he said. Under the envisaged legislation, native title claimants would still be able to claim residual rights through claims in the courts. Mr Keating added he believed such cases had little chance. The Australian cabinet was meeting to discuss the draft 'Mabo' legislation yesterday, and there have been suggestions it could be presented to parliament in a matter of weeks.</p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / UK Company News: A plea that could put an end to an 'unfair tax' - Nagging worry for companies with an international flavour SOMEWHERE in the Chancellor's in-tray is a heartfelt plea from some of Britain's biggest companies that tomorrow's Budget will end what they see as an unfair tax penalty for internationally minded firms. Advance Corporation Tax is a central part of UK corporate taxation. For the most part, it works smoothly - and there are few complaints. But for those companies with big overseas operations, it is a nagging worry. Aggrieved finance directors say it is starting to affect the way companies run their businesses, driving them into moving research and development centres abroad, or making UK acquisitions they would otherwise not have considered. The problem starts with a highly desirable feature of the UK tax system  - shareholders are taxed only once on income from investments. Before distributing dividends, companies deduct ACT from them and pay it to the Inland Revenue. For basic rate taxpayers, dividends are then tax-free. When the time comes for the company to settle its corporation tax bill, it deducts the ACT it has already paid. For most companies, the system works perfectly: ACT is paid on dividends, then deducted from mainstream corporation tax so that the income that flows through to taxpayers is taxed only once. One side effect of the system is that for any company that pays no mainstream corporation tax but still pays dividends, ACT acts as a sort of minimum tax. No bad thing, thought parliament at the time. Since then, this occasional development has become much more common. For three reasons: UK dividends have risen faster than profits in recent years. Industrial companies paid out over half their earnings as dividends in 1991. A higher dividend payment raises the relative importance of ACT vis-a-vis mainstream corporation tax, setting the 'minimum tax', if payable, at a higher level. Big British companies have become increasingly international, deriving ever-larger proportions of profits from abroad. The recession, which has hurt UK operations disproportionately badly, has further increased this effect. Corporation tax rates have been cut sharply, to levels below those of most other countries. This is a good thing - but it means overseas taxes reclaimable against UK tax bills may well wipe out all of a company's liability for mainstream corporation tax, leaving them with nothing to claim back ACT against. So ACT acts as a minimum tax on dividends, on top of those overseas taxes they cannot reclaim. Tax charges for big UK companies have been rising sharply as a result. GKN, which recently reported, paid 43 per cent of its profits in tax - up from 35 per cent the year before; the effective tax rates for other big motor component-makers could be as high as 70 per cent, analysts say. A recent study commissioned by the 100 Group of big-company finance directors estimated that each year UK companies pay Pounds 400m a year in 'surplus' ACT - tax which cannot be reclaimed against mainstream corporation tax. That may even be an underestimate, according to government sources. One obvious solution is for companies to reduce their dividends - but they say that this is simply unrealistic. 'For us to reduce dividend payments there would have to be a significant change of heart by institutional investors,' says Mr Roger Wood, group finance director of Wimpey. Instead, they find other palliatives. One such - made possible by the transatlantic merger that formed SmithKline Beecham - is to have two types of equity so that overseas shareholders, at least, escape the ACT burden. Another is to move costs abroad. Finance directors point to Pilkington's recent move abroad of research and administrative offices for its glass operations as a decision in which ACT considerations played a role. A third solution might be to invest in the UK rather than abroad. That might damage the business in the long term, however. 'We are world leaders in constant-velocity joints,' says Brian Walsh, GKN's finance director. 'Our customers are world companies. They want to have their suppliers at their elbow. Given that, there is no way we can just be a UK manufacturer.' So finance directors lobby the Treasury. They would like small adjustments to the impact of ACT in the short term. In the longer term, they want bigger reforms. Suggestions include a new ACT-free 'international holding company' status for those businesses that work mostly overseas. Another idea is a liberalised market in surplus ACT so that companies with lots of it could sell it on, at a discount, to companies with remaining mainstream corporation tax against which to offset it. A third thought is to make ACT offsetable against all taxes - including those overseas. The taxman is not sympathetic. One result of lower UK taxes is to make investing in the UK more attractive: the ACT effect is just one way in which that process takes place. Is a system that subtly biases UK companies towards domestic investment necessarily a bad thing? Would companies really prefer to solve the ACT problem by moving back to a system where dividend income was taxed twice, as in the US? And why should UK taxpayers compensate shareholders of a small group of UK companies for the tax rates set by foreign governments? Still, with the plight of UK companies much in evidence this year, finance directors have not lost hope. They would like a short-term easing of the system; they would settle for a promise of a longer term review of the issue. Because the problem is so complex, however, and affects such a relatively small number of companies, they may get neither.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: SAS plunges to SKr1.75bn deficit SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS) has plunged into a SKr1.75bn (Dollars 216m) loss after financial items for the first nine months, sharply reversing the SKr592m profit it made in the same 1992 period. The deterioration underlines the urgency of the group's efforts to merge with three other European airlines - KLM Royal Dutch, Swissair and Austrian Airlines - in the Alcazar project. It has led the airline to promise 'an intensive result improvement programme' to help it get back into profit. The measures being considered include job losses, route closures, and the sale and leaseback of aircraft. SAS blamed its deficit on the weakening of the Swedish krona, which produced unrealised exchange losses of SKr1.15bn. A 2 per cent drop in passenger yields and losses on hotel and leisure operations aggravated its position. Operating revenues climbed 15 per cent to SKr29.2bn, but this was outstripped by a 21 per cent rise in expenses to SKr27.4bn. The airline admits it has fallen behind schedule on a targeted 8 per cent cut in costs this year, and is promising to beef up the efficiency drive in 1994. Pre-tax losses were held to SKr1.13bn after a SKr500m gain from the sale of part of SAS Service Partner, the airline's catering unit. The airline benefited from a 2 per cent increase in passengers to 14.1m, while traffic in revenue passenger kilometres was up 7 per cent from last year. The most difficult market has been Sweden, where deregulation has brought a 14 per cent decline in traffic. Compensating for this was favourable growth on European, Intercontinental and domestic Norwegian routes. SAS expects its full-year figures to show a slight improvement over the nine-month results, helped by a stronger Swedish krona. Mr Jan Carlzon, who stepped down as chief executive of SAS in September to add impetus to the Alcazar talks, yesterday warned that the merger project would collapse if the European carriers could not agree on the choice of a US partner before the end of this month. His remarks were quoted in the Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet, which said SAS was planning to cut 3,000 out of 39,000 jobs.</p>

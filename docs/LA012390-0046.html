			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SANTEE  </P> <P> A Santee woman and her 2-year-old daughter were killed Sunday night, apparently  by the woman's estranged husband, who then turned the gun on himself, the San  Diego County Sheriff's Department said.  </P> <P> The bodies of Sherry Lucern Battaglia, 41; Kelly Renee Battaglia, 2, and Joseph  Frances Battaglia, 32, were found at 6:55 p.m. by Sherry Battaglia's family,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Sherry's father, mother and sisters went to the apartment in the 9400 block of  Lake Canyon Road to take her and Kelly to dinner for Sherry's birthday. When no  one answered the door, Irving Knight, Sherry Battaglia's father, climbed  through a window in the back of the house and found the bodies in the bedroom,  sheriff's deputies said.  </P> <P> The mother and daughter were found in bed. Joseph Battaglia was on the bedroom  floor with an apparently self-inflicted gunshot to the head. A .38-caliber  pistol was found nearby, Sheriff's Sgt. Manuel Castillo said.  </P> <P> Joseph and Sherry Battaglia had been separated for several months, Castillo  said, but authorities are unsure what led to the shooting.  </P> <P> "The whys and why nots, we may never know," Castillo said.  </P></p>

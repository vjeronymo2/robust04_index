			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Wide support for chemical weapons ban A PROPOSED international treaty outlawing chemical weapons will eventually command near-universal support, despite objections to aspects of the final draft by some developing countries, the chairman of the negotiating committee predicted yesterday. Mr Adolf von Wagner, chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on Chemical Weapons of the UN Disarmament Conference, told reporters he was confident that the treaty 'will have universal adherence - minus very few'. The final draft was completed last Friday after 24 years of negotiations. The treaty bans use, production and stockpiling of toxic arms, provides for the destruction of existing weapons stocks over ten years, and institutes a strict verification regime. The US and Britain are among more than 50 countries which have said they will sign the treaty, which needs 65 ratifications to come into force.</p>

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Leading Article: China and WTO China's admission that agreement could not be reached this year on its bid for membership of the Gatt and the new World Trade Organisation cost its government considerable loss of face. It is encouraging, therefore, that its response has not been to quit the bargaining table, but to indicate readiness to continue talks next year. If resumed negotiations are to succeed, however, all involved need to absorb some important lessons. That is true, above all, for Beijing, which has frequently resorted to menacing bluster rather than negotiating purposefully. China still seems to covet WTO membership as a political prize, rather than for its economic benefits. Western interest in China's market also appears to have caused its government to think it holds all the high cards. Its public utterances often imply that unless other countries accept its terms, they - not China - will be the biggest losers. Such assumptions are mistaken. Despite the recent growth of China's economy and exports, it accounts for only 2.5 per cent of world trade. Its commercial isolation would thus only affect marginally the world economy. But it would put at risk China's future growth potential. China needs WTO membership for three main reasons: to stimulate further reforms and modernisation of its economy; to safeguard markets for its export industries, which in many cases are the main consumers of its imports; and to provide a stable framework for the foreign investment on which its development crucially depends. Such reassurance is particularly critical given growing international concern about China's arbitrary official regulations and late payments by its state enterprises. Progress in negotiations is likely to remain slow until Beijing fully accepts that WTO membership is fundamental to its economic self-interest. Only then will it have the incentive to improve its offers on market access and drop demands for easier terms than are enjoyed by other developing countries, none of which is nearly as important a trading power. This change will not be easy to accomplish while a looming leadership struggle continues to immobilise China's government. Gatt's bigger members must do everything possible to bolster the position of Beijing's economic reformers, while standing firm on issues of basic principle. That calls for enlightened leadership by the US, which should be ready to respond positively to any constructive initiatives from Beijing. As well as refraining from bilateral trade sanctions, which would play into the hands of China's hardliners, Washington needs to show more flexibility. In particular, it should soften its insistence that China join the WTO as a developed country. Provided Beijing is ready to make worthwhile commitments, it should be allowed to adjust to multilateral trade rules according to an agreed timetable, subject to regular monitoring. The EU could usefully play a role by offering the US stronger support if it adopted a more flexible position. Regrettably, Sir Leon Brittan, the trade commissioner, has seemed more interested in ingratiating himself with Beijing. Whatever his motives, that has won no favours, but merely encouraged China's negotiators to concentrate on driving a wedge between the EU and the US. China's membership of the WTO remains a highly desirable objective. But achieving the necessary political conditions will take time. Recent events have shown the futility of setting artificial deadlines. Admitting China to the organisation by a fixed date is much less important than ensuring it enters on the right terms.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the Chesapeake Bay Region, Delaware Bay and the James River below Richmond continue to be a source of organochlorine and heavy metal contaminants that may impact eagle reproduction (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1990). However, DDE concentrations in addled bald eagle eggs in Chesapeake Bay have declined significantly from 1969&hyph;84 (Wiemeyer et al. 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In parts of the Northern States Region, contamination is depressing bald eagle productivity. This occurs notably in the coastal areas of the Great Lakes, those rivers accessible by anadromous fishes of the Great Lakes, and in parts of Maine. Research on bald eagle productivity in the vicinity of Great Lakes shorelines indicates significantly lower productivity than for inland breeding birds. The reduced productivity is correlated with concentrations of PCB's, DDE, dieldrin, and other organochlorine compounds in addled eggs (Best et al. in press).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bald eagles of the Pacific Recovery Region nesting near the Columbia River estuary and Hood Canal, which is adjacent to Puget Sound, repeatedly have low reproductive success. DDE and PCB's have had a deleterious effect on the reproduction of bald eagles in the Columbia River estuary (Anthony et al. 1993). Wiemeyer et al. (1993) found addled bald eagle eggs collected from Oregon ranked second (behind Maine) in DDE concentrations among the fifteen States sampled. However, concentrations of other contaminants in the Oregon eggs were low. In spite of localized reproductive impairment, the Pacific Recovery Region population has increased by about 68 percent in the past 10 years. Contaminants are not known to be a significant problem for eagles in the Southwestern Recovery Region or Mexico.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lead poisoning has also contributed to bald eagle mortality. The National Wildlife Health Research Center has diagnosed lead poisoning in more than 225 bald eagles during the last 15 years. Lead can poison bald eagles when they ingest prey items that contain lead shot or lead fragments or where the prey has assimilated lead into its own tissues. In winter, eagles frequently feed on waterfowl that are dead or dying from lead poisoning or upon waterfowl crippled in the hunting season. Lead poisoning of eagles was a primary reason the Service required the nationwide use of non-toxic shot for waterfowl hunting. The requirement for use of non-toxic shot was phased in over a period of 5 years, and its use became mandatory for all waterfowl hunting in 1991. Use of lead shot is still permitted in many parts of Canada.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of particular concern for bald eagles in the Southeastern Region and in Maine are the toxic effects of mercury (Wiemeyer et al. 1993, C. Facmire, pers. comm.). High levels of mercury affect eagles with a variety of neurological problems, where flight and other motor skills can be significantly altered, and with reduced hatching rates of eggs. Mercury has entered the waterways as air emissions from solid waste incineration sites and other point and non-point sources. Impacts from mercury to bald eagles are currently under investigation in the Southeastern Region.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Illegal shooting still poses threats to individual birds. Improved law enforcement and public awareness has reduced shooting impacts from a cause of large scale mortality in the first half of this century to the deaths of occasional individuals at present. From 1985 to 1990, the National Wildlife Health Research Center has diagnosed over 150 bald eagle deaths due to gunshot. Hunter education courses routinely include bald eagle identification material to educate hunters about bald eagles and the protections that the species is afforded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Electrocutions occur on power poles and lines that are not yet configured for the protection of raptors. Much research has been done in this area, and generally new poles and lines are configured to reduce raptor electrocutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Human disturbance also remains a long-term threat. Significant declines in eagle use of the Skagit River, Washington, were noted in response to recreational activity (Stalmaster 1989). Human disturbance can be harmful during egg incubation and young brooding periods because disturbance can flush adults from nests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Land management practices can reduce or eliminate these disturbance problems. Management of bald eagle nesting sites has progressed in some areas to include zones of protection extending up to 2.5 miles (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1986). In the Bear Valley National Wildlife Refuge, Oregon, for example, public access is restricted from November 1 through March 30 to prevent human disturbance to wintering bald eagles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Despite these various threats to the bald eagle in the area proposed for reclassification, none are of sufficient magnitude, individually or collectively, to place the species at risk of extinction. Over most of the 48 States, the population is doubling every 6 or 7 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by this species in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to reclassify the bald eagle from endangered to threatened in the lower 48 States except the southwestern population in Arizona, New Mexico, the southeast corner of California within 10 miles of the Colorado River or the river's mainstem reservoirs, and those portions of Texas and the panhandle of Oklahoma that are west of the 100th meridian. The latter population appears to be isolated, to suffer from lower survival rates, and to require intensive management to ensure nesting success. The bald eagle would remain threatened in the five States where it is currently listed as threatened and be listed as endangered in Mexico under this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By a correspondent in New York] </F>   [Text] A Chinese labour activist has described his  dramatic escape from a detention centre.    Wang Jiaqi, who fled to Hong Kong on April 17, arrived in  New  York City on Sunday after spending time in another Western  country.    In his first interview since leaving China, Mr Wang, a  graduate law student at Beijing University, alleged that his  arrest and subsequent incarceration was illegal.    The dissident's detention on March 2 is believed to be  linked  to the role he played in the formation of a League for the  Protection of the Rights for Workers.    "I was arrested in Beijing by seven security agents who wore  no uniforms," said Mr Wang, himself a Public security Bureau  (PSB) officer in Tangshan before his enrolment at Beijing  University.    "They refused to identify themselves, put a hood over my  face, and practically abducted me."    The PSB held him prisoner in a hostel belonging to an  electricity company in Changping district, Beijing, but rarely  spoke to him.    After six days Mr Wang was handed over to PSB officials in  his home town, Tangshan, 200 kilometres east of the capital, but  even there he was held not in an official prison but in a  semi-legal lock-up belonging to the local steel works.    After he staged a three-day hunger strike he was shifted to  the barracks of the People's Armed Police in Tangshan, where he  was kept in a room under 24 hour watch by three police.    PSB officials there made no attempt to question him,  because,  they told him, they had not been told why he had been arrested.    On the evening of March 27, helped by quick thinking, Mr  Wang  managed to dupe his guards and to escape while he was being  escorted across a courtyard to a toilet.    "Three guards are supposed to be watching me all the time,"  Mr Wang said. "One of them got drunk and the other was cramming  for an examination in an adjacent room."    As a result, only one guard was with him as he made a quick  dash out of the open gates of the barracks.    Mr Wang said his escape was only successful because a truck  passed the entrance of the barracks just as he ran out past the  sentry.    He threw himself on to the vehicle and was able to get away  into the centre of Tangshan before the guards could react.    "The barracks is not designed to hold prisoners," Mr Wang  said. "And the sentries are on the look out for intruders from  outside instead of preventing people from getting out."    The dissident also indicated he tried to make friends with  the three guards, and the night of the escape, he succeeded in  persuading the senior PSB officer to start drinking.    Within an hour of his escape every exit from Tangshan was  sealed by police, and searches were carried out throughout the  city.    But after a few days police, convinced that Mr Wang had fled  in the hour before the checkpoints were in place, lifted the  restrictions, and he was able to escape undetected to Beijing.    Planning or carrying out a prison escape is a capital  offence  in China, but Mr Wang said he was not frightened. In Beijing,  Mr Wang contacted the "underground railway", a network of  dissidents which arranged for him to get to Hong Kong. He  waited eight weeks before U.S. immigration authorities were able  to complete entry procedures.    Mr Wang, who was doing post-graduate study in criminal  procedure law at Beijing University, has gone to the U.S. as a  visiting academic and has no intention of applying for asylum,  he said. He is on a one-year research programme at Columbia  University, New York, where he will continue research into  Chinese law.    Two other legal experts Yuan Hongbing and Zhou Guoqiang,  disappeared within a day of Mr Wang's arrest and have not been  seen since. The three men had drawn up a five-point petition on  labour rights which they had intended to present to China's  National People's Congress. They had also planned to formally  register the League, for which Mr Wang had written the  constitution.    Mr Wang and legal experts he has talked to in the West said  his virtual kidnap by unidentified security agents represented a  disturbing new trend in Beijing's campaign against dissident  intellectuals.    The use of unofficial or semi-legal lock-ups to hold  political dissidents is also a new development, they said, and  raised the possibility that dissidents could be held in any of  the thousands of small prisons within state factories and police  barracks to which no one outside China, and probably few locals,  had access.    Mr Wang said that although he had worked in Tangshan as a  police official for several years, he had never heard of the  steel corporation prison in which he was held in March.    He said that official showed him a faxed copy of a detention  order which appeared to justify his arrest, but it gave no  legally recognisable description of the charge for which he was  held.    "On the detention order they showed me the offence for which  I was held was described as tuanhuo, a non-legal term with no  precise definition and roughly corresponding to `forming a  conspiratorial group'," said Mr Wang, who had refused to  countersign the order.    In a message to China's leaders, Mr Wang said that since the  Chinese Communist Party "represents the country on the  international stage it should make great efforts to observe the  rule of international law".    "The Party should have enough confidence to reform itself,"  said Mr Wang who remains strongly committed to non-violent  reform in China and consider his work to be non-political.</p>

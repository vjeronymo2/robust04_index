			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMISSIONER LEAVENWORTH -- HE'S HONEST  </P> <P> In your article regarding Orange County Planning Commissioner Doug Leavenworth  and his votes affecting the Mission Viejo Co., you might have interviewed some  people who routinely work with Doug.  </P> <P> I think they would all tell you that you couldn't buy Doug off with a golf  course, much less a golf game.  </P> <P> Moreover, the hours and hours spent on commission duties is hardly offset by  the pay or the perks. It is largely a grueling, thankless job.  </P> <P> Obviously Doug wasn't aware of the problem since he very openly reported  everything and could have easily abstained from voting. He has too much  integrity and is too honest for it to be anything other than a simple  oversight.  </P> <P> RANDALL G. SMITH  </P> <P> Yorba Linda  </P></p>

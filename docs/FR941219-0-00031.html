			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Critical habitat is defined in section 3(5)(A) of the Act as ``(i) the specific areas within the geographical area occupied by the species at the time it is listed *&blank;*&blank;* on which are found those physical or biological features (I) essential to the conservation of the species and (II) which may require special management considerations or protection; and (ii) specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by the species at the time it is listed *&blank;*&blank;* upon a determination *&blank;*&blank;* that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species.'' The term ``conservation'', as defined in section 3(3) of the Act, means ``*&blank;*&blank;* to use and the use of all methods and procedures which are necessary to bring an endangered species or threatened species to the point at which the measures provided pursuant to this Act are no longer necessary.'' With recovery, no protection from the Act is necessary. Therefore, areas designated as critical habitat must contain those physical or biological features essential to recover a species to the point that it no longer requires protection under the Act and can be removed from the list of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endangered and threatened species. Section 3(c) further states that in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most cases the entire range of a species should not be encompassed within critical habitat. Areas outside the present geographic range may be included as critical habitat if a species' present range would be inadequate to ensure conservation of the species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Role in Species Conservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Use of the term ``conservation'' in the definition of critical habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates that its designation should identify areas that may be needed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a species' recovery and delisting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The designation of critical habitat will not, in itself, lead to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery, but is one of several measures available to contribute to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species' recovery. Critical habitat helps focus conservation activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by identifying areas that contain essential habitat features (primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituent elements) regardless of whether or not they are currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupied by the listed species, thus alerting the public to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importance of an area in the conservation of a listed species. Critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat also identifies areas that may require special management or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection. Critical habitat receives protection under section 7 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act with regard to actions carried out, funded, or authorized by Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies. Section 7 requires that Federal agencies consult on actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that may affect critical habitat to ensure that their actions are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. This additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection to a species' habitat may actually shorten the time needed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve recovery. Aside from this added protection provided by section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7, the Act does not provide other direct forms of protection to lands  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated as critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Designating critical habitat does not create a management plan,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish numerical population goals, prescribe specific management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions (inside or out of critical habitat), nor does it have a direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect on areas not designated as critical habitat. Specific management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendations for critical habitat are more appropriately addressed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery plans, management plans, and section 7 consultations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Critical habitat identifies specific areas essential to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservation of a species. Areas with one or more essential features  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but not currently containing all of the features and areas having the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability to provide essential features in the future, may be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the long-term recovery of the species. This may be so particularly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in certain portions of its range. However, not all areas containing all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> features of a listed species' habitat are necessarily essential to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species' recovery. Areas not included in critical habitat that contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one or more of the essential elements are still important to a species'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservation and may be addressed under other facets of the Act and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other conservation laws and regulations. All designated areas also may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be of considerable value in maintaining ecosystem integrity and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supporting other species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Designation of critical habitat may be reevaluated and revised, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any time, when new information indicates that changes are warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service may revise critical habitat if management plans, recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans, or other conservation strategies are developed and fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented, reducing the need for the additional protection provided by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat designation. For example, after the draft Delta Native  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fishes Recovery Plan (Recovery Plan) is finalized or the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgates more protective water quality standards for the Estuary than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are currently in place, land and water management agencies may provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased protection for the delta smelt. If these protection measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are implemented, the Service may revise its critical habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Telstra tests data software Telstra, Australia's government-owned telecommunications group, is one of six international telephone and cable companies to test Microsoft software for a high-speed information highway. The Microsoft 'broadband network operating system' (BNOS) software aims to transmit large amounts of interactive data and services from third-party sources and could be applicable in industries ranging from financial services to retailing. Telstra said that the trials would help to give Australia a head start in the development of multimedia industries. The project will begin next year. Other carriers evaluating BNOS are Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, NTT, Rogers Cablesystems, US West and Southwestern Bell.</p>

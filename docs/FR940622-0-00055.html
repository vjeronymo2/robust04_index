			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter objected to the OIG, rather than the Secretary, having the discretion to waive an exclusion under &sect;1003.105. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary has delegated the discretion to waive an exclusion under &sect;1003.105 to the OIG, and the regulations were amended in 1986 (51 FR 34777) to reflect this. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter objected to suspending a provider from the Medicare program for a single instance of an inappropriate transfer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4008(b)(3) of OBRA 90 deleted the suspension authority from section 1867(d) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter believes that the statute and the regulation will unduly penalize hospitals that are making good faith efforts to comply with the provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We disagree. As long as a hospital complies with the provisions it will not be subject to penalty. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters believe that active enforcement of these provisions will force many hospitals to close their emergency departments to avoid potential liabilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We disagree. The impact of discontinuing an emergency services department, which is among the top income producers in a hospital, will outweigh the risk of potential losses due to violations of this regulation, especially since improved management of emergency departments can avoid the risk of violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that these regulations would give the government carte blanche authority to investigate any and all records for suspected violations. He felt that this ability would enable one hospital to slow down another with unnecessary, costly, and time-consuming investigations if it makes frivolous complaints about it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Congress has mandated that the Secretary enforce section 1867 of the Act. All credible alleged violations require a thorough investigation. Rather than overzealousness, the OIG has to date found and reported a marked reluctance on the part of hospitals to report suspected inappropriate transfers. (Office of Inspector General, ``Patient Dumping After COBRA: Assessing the Incidences and the Perspectives of Health Care Professionals'' (Aug. 1988).) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter believes that the HCFA Administrator should retain the termination authority, rather than delegate it to the regional offices, as these termination decisions are best administered on a national level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All terminations are authorized by the respective HCFA regional office as part of its general responsibility for operating the survey and certification function for HCFA. This authority is delegated to the regional office because of its knowledge of State and local matters and its proximity to the providers it is overseeing and to the beneficiaries within its region. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nineteen commenters objected that 2 days was too short a period to correct a problem or deficiency before a termination. One commenter agreed that the termination should occur within 2 days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Violations of section 1867 of the Act have the potential to be immediate and serious threats to patient health and safety. Therefore, we believe that it is essential that a violation that poses an immediate and serious threat be corrected as rapidly as possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In cases where it has been determined that the violation poses an immediate and serious threat to patient health and safety, a hospital will be placed on a 23-day termination track. On day 1, the hospital will receive a preliminary notice of termination from the regional office stating that a violation has been identified and that the projected date of termination will be on day 23. The preliminary notice of termination will also inform the hospital that the HCFA regional office will issue a final notice of termination and inform the public of the date of termination at least 2 days, but not more than 4 days, before the projected date of termination. Thus, the final notice to the hospital and the public concerning the termination of the hospital's provider agreement for a violation that poses an immediate and serious threat to patient health and safety will be issued between day 19 and day 21 of the 23-day termination track. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The preliminary notice of termination will also inform the hospital that it may avoid the termination action by either providing credible evidence of correction of the deficiencies or by successfully showing that the deficiencies did not exist. The hospital will have an opportunity to make such a showing to the regional office between day 1 and day 19 of the termination process. If the hospital is successful, the regional office will stop the termination process, and there will not be a public notice of termination. If verification of correction does not occur before the 19th day of the termination track, the hospital receives a final notice of termination, and the public is concurrently notified by publication of the effective date of the termination in the newspaper. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In cases that do not involve an immediate and serious threat to patient health and safety, a hospital will be placed on a 90-day termination track. The hospital will receive a preliminary notice of termination on day 1, and will be notified that the projected termination date will be on day 90. We will continue our current practice, set forth in &sect;489.53(c)(1), of issuing a final notice of termination to the hospital and the public 15 days prior to the effective date of termination. Thus, in situations where the violation does not constitute an immediate and serious threat to patient health and safety, public notice of the effective date of the termination will be given on approximately day 75 of the 90-day termination process unless the hospital successfully shows that correction has occurred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

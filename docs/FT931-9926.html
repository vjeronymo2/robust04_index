			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Indonesian paper mill for India SINAR Mas, an Indonesian industrial group, plans to build a Rs3bn (Pounds 62m) paper mill in India. The company, Indonesia's second largest combine, is submitting a proposal to the Indian government for a 200,000 tonnes a year paper mill. The mill would import pulp for conversion into paper for sale in India and other south Asian countries. The project is one of several investment schemes in India proposed by foreign companies since the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, embarked on economic liberalisation in mid-1991. The authorities last year approved investments totalling about Dollars 1.3bn. But the actual flow of funds has been much smaller - around Dollars 300m. It is not clear how quickly Sinar Mas will go ahead with its scheme. Mr M K Raina, a leading executive in the Indian paper industry who is to head the Indonesian group's Indian operation, said Sinar Mas would invest a total of Dollars 1bn in India over five years in various projects including the paper mill.</p>

In his continued efforts to prevent a  break in the peace talks, mediator Alioune Blondin Beye decided  to move to the last point on the working agenda -- the  conclusion of the electoral process, which is viewed as a less  polemical topic. All the same, the Black Cockerel's delegation  does not seem ready to give its views on the issue. Our  correspondent Pedro Manuel reports.    Good evening. The conclusion of the electoral process is  being examined here in Lusaka. At a plenary session held here  this morning, the mediator presented to the negotiating teams  his views regarding the conclusion of the electoral process.  This afternoon, the government team was examining the  mediator's document and it will probably give a reply tomorrow.    There are people who say, however, that UNITA is already  contesting the mediator's views. It does not want to discuss  this issue now, because it says it is not ready to do so. The  conclusion of the electoral process is the last point on the  working agenda of this round of peace talks.    This does not mean, however, that agreements have been  reached on all previous points. Alioune Blondin Beye decided to  move forward and discuss the issue connected with the electoral  process, while a formula is being sought to resolve the issue  connected with the country's administration [words indistinct]  to discuss all steps to be taken for the holding of the second  round of presidential elections.    During the debates on the conclusion of the electoral  process, the negotiators could reach an agreement on the date of  the second round of presidential elections.</p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Pope picks up remnants of peace mission with visit to Zagreb Sarajevo's beleaguered status and fragile security was cruelly underlined by the Pope's decision to abandon his planned visit this week. But the Pontiff is assured of an enthusiastic welcome when he arrives in Zagreb today for his long awaited visit to the capital of staunchly catholic Croatia. The first papal visit formally celebrates the 900th anniversary of the establishment of the Zagreb diocese. But it was originally planned as part of a more ambitious scheme to visit the three feuding capitals of former Yugoslavia to plead for a return to religious and cultural co-existence between those of catholic, orthodox and Islamic belief. Gunmen, and fear of another assassination in the city where a Serbian nationalist fired the shot which ignited the first world war scuppered the first speech. A hostile reaction from the orthodox church prevented the Pope's healing words being heard in Belgrade. The risk now is that the Pope's visit to Zagreb alone will be twisted by propagandists as evidence of Vatican support for the Croatian president, Mr Franjo Tudjman, and behind the scenes support by the world-wide catholic church for one side in the Yugoslavian conflict. In fact the Vatican has never hidden its reservations over the personality and policies of Mr Tudjman, a former communist general turned Croat nationalist. His insensitivity to the fears of Croatian Serbs at the time of independence played into the hands of Mr Slobodan Milosevic, his Serb counterpart, and contributed to the post-independence uprising by ethnic Serbs in Slavonia and the Krajina regions. The independent Croatia which the pope is visiting this weekend is not the prosperous, independent state dreamed of by Croats for centuries. It is a rump state with one-third of its territory controlled by Serbs who possess the most fertile land in Slavonia and block access to the Dalmatia coast which once provided more than Dollars 1bn a year in tourist earnings. It is also a country still at war in neighbouring Bosnia where Zagreb's clandestine deal with Belgrade for a two-way territorial carve-up and initial support for Croat nationalists degenerated into a three-way conflict. Again it was largely discreet papal diplomacy which persuaded Mr Tudjman to lean on the Bosnian Croats and persuade them to accept the uneasy Croat-Moslem alliance which currently prevails. For a brief weekend the papal visit will raise the spirits of the Croat nation. He will call for reconciliation, address the rights of minorities and call for the return of refugees. They will be words of special relevance for the estimated 250,000 Croats and ethnic Hungarians driven from their homes in 1991 and hoping that the Pope will be able perform the miracle which continues to elude armies, politicians and international negotiators. The unanswerable question is whether the Serbs, with similar hopes and fears, will be listening.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, June 21 (BTA) -- Today President Zhelyu  Zhelev started consultations on the Judiciary Organization Act.  He has the right to refer it back to parliament for review.  His first meeting was with supreme magistrates: Supreme Court  Chairman Ivan Grigorov and his deputies, the chairwoman of the  Regional Court of Sofia, etc. This is a modern and democratic  act, but there are certain passages that contradict the  constitution, apart from being undemocratic and immoral, Mr.  Grigorov said. These passages, however, account for no more  than 3 percent of the act.    Mr. Grigorov maintains that the act cannot become operative  immediately on the authority of Clause 4 of the Transitional and  Concluding Provisions of the Constitution, which reads: "The  organization of the judicial branch of government... shall come  into force following the passage of the new structural and  procedural laws." On the motion of an MP of the BSP [Bulgarian  Socialist Party] parliament voted that the act should come into  force upon its publishing in the OFFICIAL GAZETTE. The most  controversial paragraphs are those concerning the years of  service required for the holding of key posts in the judiciary  system. Supreme Court Chairman Ivan Grigorov and Prosecutor  General Ivan Tatarchev do not meet that requirement.    The Constitutional Court should rule on the Judiciary  Organization Act, Justice Minister Petur Kornazhev told a news  conference today. He will point that out at his consultations  with President Zhelev tomorrow [22 June]. Members of the  Supreme Judicial Council, the Prosecutor's Office and the  Supreme Council of the Bar will also meet with the president  tomorrow.</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / UK companies face pressure from EC over works councils MANY large British companies operating on the continent may be forced to set up elected works councils under European Community proposals which Denmark is seeking to push through into law. The EC directive would require the councils to be set up by any company  - including those based outside the EC - that has more than 1,000 employees in more than one of the EC's 12 member states (with more than 100 employees in at least two of the states). They would have to be consulted on issues such as job changes, new technology and investment and relocation plans. Denmark, current holder of the EC presidency, is determined to go ahead with the directive, one of the Community's most controversial pieces of legislation. After talks among employment and social affairs ministers yesterday in Luxembourg, it became clear that Britain - the only member state opposing the measure - will have to fight to dilute its content, or see it passed by its 11 partners, assuming that the Maastricht treaty and its social protocol come into force later this year. If the works council directive were passed by the 11, British companies would still be among those most affected. According to British calculations, more than 100 UK companies have operations in continental Europe which are large enough to fall under the requirements of the directive for their operations outside Britain. If the UK were party to the scheme, more than 300 companies would be affected, a fifth more than in Germany and three times more than France. Denmark wants agreement among the 11 by the EC's June summit, to crown its presidency. If the UK wishes to stay detached from the measure, as it did from the Maastricht social chapter, the works council requirements would go through without the British if and when the treaty is ratified. During the recent controversies over alleged 'job poaching' in the relocation to the UK of production by Hoover from Burgundy and Digital from the west of Ireland, Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, pledged a new effort to get the works councils directive into EC law. The Commission believes such cases would be less inflammatory with obligatory consultation of the workforce, denying companies the chance to play one set of employees off against another. Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK employment secretary, yesterday expressed 'fundamental reservations', objecting because the measure was prescriptive, mandatory, and based on a single model which did not include, for instance, employee share options.

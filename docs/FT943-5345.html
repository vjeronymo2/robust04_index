			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / IoD warns on interest rate increase A warning that higher interest rates will damage economic growth was sounded by the Institute of Directors yesterday in advance of Wednesday's monthly economic meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. Mr Tim Melville-Ross, the director-general of the institute, said that its bi-monthly business opinion survey revealed continued uncertainty among members although the economy was growing quite strongly. He said: 'With inflation at such low levels, there is no case at present for a damaging increase in interest rates.' Summer speculation about an early interest rate rise abated after the announcement of a fall in the underlying rate of inflation from 2.4 per cent in June to 2.2 per cent in July. Although the Bank of England has warned that the government's targets for reducing underlying inflation would be at risk without a base rate increase in the next few months, analysts do not expect this week's meeting to lead to an immediate change. Mr Melville-Ross said there were few signs of higher inflation in the pipeline and if exports, rather than consumer spending, continued to provide the impetus for economic growth 'it could be next year before the situation warrants a base rate rise'. The survey found 76 per cent of directors saying that their companies were doing well or very well. This was down slightly from 79 per cent in June. There were falls in the proportion reporting improved volume and profit. These were from 70 per cent in June to 63 per cent in August for volume, and from 62 per cent to 54 per cent for profit. The share of respondents feeling more optimistic about the economy nudged up from 44 per cent to 46 per cent. Signs of economic growth were given as the main cause of optimism, while political uncertainty was the biggest inhibiting factor. The Finance &amp; Leasing Association says heavy discounting in the summer sales produced a slackening of consumer credit in July. The association says in its monthly consumer credit and business finance report that although consumers used credit in the sales, it was to buy heavily discounted items. As a result, consumer credit of Pounds 1.276bn in July was 7 per cent down from June. Although the association's July figure represents a 28 per cent year-on-year increase it was the lowest annual rise since October.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today  referred to the priorities of the Greek presidency [of the  European Union, EU]. At the same time, he reiterated that  Greece does not accept any dialogue over the name of Skopje and  added that it expects [Macedonian President] Kiro Gligorov to  give practical proof of relaxing his intransigent positions.  Among other things, the government spokesman said:    [Begin Venizelos recording] We will exercise this presidency  while bearing in mind the Community's practices and the true  correlations of forces being formulated within the framework of  the EU's institutional bodies and while adhering to the goal of  European integration.    Greece has already declared that it expects the Skopje  government to follow some self-evident and fundamental dictates  of international law. It expects the removal of national  emblems that are Greek, an end to hostile and irredentist  propaganda, and amendment of the preamble as well as Articles 3  and 49 in the Skopje constitution. I repeat, these are not  demands by Greece but obligations stemming from international  law with which every state -- and moreover every UN member --  has to comply. [end recording]</p>

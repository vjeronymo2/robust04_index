			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Cookery Courses: The Black Forest - without gateau / All over Europe, FT writers have been slaving over hot stoves to pick some of AFTER the uncertain, albeit dignified, approach of English cooks to a course in Normandy, it came as quite a surprise to witness the passionate commitment to gastronomy which exists in more prosperous parts of Germany. From my recent experience I should say that the interest which Germans take in food can be compared only to the pre-occupation of Austrians with their own wines: both amount to obsessions. One of the newest coinages in the German language is the word 'hobbycook.' This describes a man or a woman who uses up a substantial part of his or her free time to perfect recipes, preferably under the eye of a talented professional. Something of this recent German craze is evident from the competition launched by Wolfram Siebeck, Die Zeit's gastronomic correspondent, last month. Siebeck's last contest was held 11 years ago. At that time, few German men took any interest in what went into the Sunday pot. Now, the talk is of char cooked in cling-film served with potato puree made with olive oil; of tuna or shark steaks; or some recipe beloved of Frederick the Great, such as carp cooked in beer. Siebeck expects a good number of the responses to come from men. Men were in the majority on the first course I attended: run by Herr Jehli in the Romantik Hotel Stollen at Gutach in the Black Forest. The group was not, however, exclusively masculine and a woman doctor had come on her own from Garmisch, as had a Parisian long domiciled in Munich. In Gutach, I had a brief insight into the sort of courses which are organised by German gastronomic associations such as Feinschmecker or Marmite eV (the name will make some English people giggle, but it is no more than the French word for a cooking pot). As a businessman from Frankfurt told me, the aim was to perfect certain dishes 'up to two Michelin star standard.' I had a chance to see how this worked out in Jehli's kitchen. To my surprise, we stood around armed with spoons while the genial Jehli and his crew prepared our meal. Only one man, a pharmacist, managed to change the course of a sauce, and then after repeated pleas to be given some responsibility in the affair. At its worst, I thought, hobbycookery was little more than a superior way of exciting a jaded appetite in an advanced consumer society. My second cookery course was in the Romantik Hotel Adler Post at Neustadt, above the popular Black Forest resort of Titisee. Here, courses were prefaced by a magisterial expose on raw materials delivered by Rudolf Lipp from the catering school in nearby Villingen. Some of Lipp's wisdom was stirring stuff: how to choose the right (white) asparagus; the decline of freshwater crayfish; the need to avoid Danish farmed salmon. In the hotel kitchen I was set to work with a pleasant, if laconic, landscape gardener from Hessen who bred sheep as a hobby (more hobbies]). Over the two days of cooking together, we prepared some highly-spiced Barnsley chops with a yoghurt sauce; some entrecotes with chervil sauce and maize drop-cakes; and a combination of asparagus and just-cooked salmon under an orange butter sauce. Except on the evening of our arrival, we ate our own creations. I had done little more than visit Jehli's course in Gutach. Perhaps because I was there for the duration, I found the atmosphere more relaxed in Neustadt. After dinner on Saturday night, Herr and Frau Ketterer invited us over to their Stammtisch (the regulars' table) where a lively discussion took place on the difference between a 'fillet' and a 'Lendchen.' Both courses were in German but, given sufficient numbers, it would be easy to arrange for someone to translate. All three Ketterers, including the 93-year-old mother, speak impeccable English and there is the added bonus of a charming Sri Lankan sous-chef. Both hotels are in ravishing locations. Information about Romantik Hotel courses may be had from Representation Plus, 375 Upper Richmond Road, London SW14 (tel: 081-392-1589; fax: 081-392-1318). The next Adler Post course is scheduled for the last weekend in November. Prices start at DM455 (Pounds 154.70) per person: but you will need to make your own way to the Black Forest.</p>

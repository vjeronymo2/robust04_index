			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: YOUTH PLEADS NO CONTEST IN HOSTAGE INCIDENT  </P> <P> A former San Gabriel High School student accused of holding his classmates  hostage with a semiautomatic rifle pleaded no contest in Pasadena Superior  Court on Monday to charges of kidnaping and assault with a deadly weapon.  </P> <P> Jeffrey Lyne Cox, 19, who could have faced life sentences for those felonies,  entered the plea after Judge Terry Smerling told Lyne that he would not be  sentenced to more than 10 years and 8 months in prison.  </P> <P> A sentencing hearing was set for April 6 pending a psychiatric review of Cox by  the state Department of Corrections.  </P> <P> Cox already has been found guilty of false imprisonment and burglary for  storming his humanities class and holding about 60 students captive on April  26, 1988. No one was injured in the 40-minute siege. But jurors were unable to  reach agreement on the kidnaping and assault charges, forcing a mistrial Dec.  19 on those counts.  </P></p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / N Korea cleared in new arms row North Korea has apparently not attempted to divert spent nuclear fuel now being unloaded from its Yongbyon reactor to nuclear arms production, US officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. 'There is no diversion, according to (IAEA) inspectors. We are hopeful,' said one of the officials. The US has repeatedly warned Pyongyang that it is prepared to press the United Nations for international sanctions if it moves ahead with a programme to develop nuclear weapons. On Wednesday Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said the US would increase the already high 'readiness level' of its troops in South Korea if it proved necessary to seek sanctions against North Korea. The North, which denies it has such a programme, recently announced that it had begun unloading spent nuclear fuel rods from a controversial reactor at Yongbyon - fuel which the US says can be converted into enriched plutonium for nuclear weapons. A team of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN nuclear watchdog, arrived in Pyongyang this week and reported that some of the ageing fuel rods had been removed from the reactor's power core. But US officials said yesterday the IAEA had also reported those rods had been put in cooling tanks of water and had not been spirited away from the reactor in an attempt to enrich the material. The UN nuclear agency said the unloading of the fuel rods alone was a serious violation of its safeguards agreement with Pyongyang and it would report the communist state to the UN Security Council. 'But I don't believe the IAEA statement says there will be any immediate declaration that continuity of (nuclear) safeguards has been broken,' said one US official.</p>

			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Constructing defences against terrorist attacks: A company in County Londonderry that refuses to give in to IRA intimidation RESILIENT is a word often used to describe the people of Northern Ireland. In spite of all the killings and bombings of the past 20 years the province's population shows determination to carry on with normal life. Mr John Henry is an example. He runs one of Northern Ireland's biggest construction companies, in Magherafelt, County Londonderry. It is much like any other large builder's yard, bustling with trucks, but the security checks, the vehicles in the company car park with bullet-proof windows and the surveillance cameras tell a different story. Mr Henry's privately run Henry Bros is the main company in Northern Ireland carrying out construction work for the security forces - the army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary. It is a very risky business. The IRA describes those who carry out such work as 'legitimate targets'. Mr Henry says: 'The IRA always comes for us. Unlike other companies, we see no reason to hide what we do.' The price for such openness has been high. In the past four years alone several people who were associated with the company, including Mr Henry's brother, have been murdered by the IRA. Company drivers have been shot at and the Henry Bros premises have been attacked with car bombs and mortars. In 1986 a manager at the Magherafelt plant was shot by the IRA as he sat in his car. The IRA had mistaken him for Mr Henry. Eighteen months ago a supplier to the company - a cousin of Mr Henry's wife  -was blown up in his car. Earlier this year the IRA abducted a company employee and forced him to drive a 'proxy bomb' to a nearby army base. The employee was lucky enough to escape before the massive bomb exploded. Mr Henry and many of his employees endure a besieged existence. Mr Henry is under constant police guard and he drives an armour-plated car. His company yard and his house are kept under constant surveillance. A quietly spoken, genial man, Mr Henry feels the pressure. 'It's when I go to Scotland or away somewhere that I realise just what it's like to relax. Here you can't let down your guard for one second.' Mr Henry, a Protestant, started his company in the mid 1970s. He was once in partnership with two Roman Catholics, but they sold out after IRA intimidation. Most of Mr Henry's 600 employees are Protestant. He says IRA intimidation prevents Catholics from joining the company. There have been times when Mr Henry has felt like giving up. One of his murdered brother's sons became involved with Protestant paramilitaries and is now serving a 12-year jail sentence. Last year one of Mr Henry's own sons was killed in an industrial accident. 'My family urge me to carry on. We have lost family members and employees, but we are also in the business of saving lives,' he says. Henry Bros builds and installs heavily reinforced steel and concrete structures to protect police stations and army posts, as well as bullet-proof windows and blast-proof doors for government offices and residences of senior officials. The company does much of its own research and collaborates with a company in Germany which specialises in counter terrorism and security. Army observation posts, called 'sangers', are built at the Magherafelt plant. The walls of the sangers consist of two layers of inch-thick steel sandwiching slabs of concrete. 'You always have to think about what the IRA will come up with next,' says Mr Henry. 'Now they are using horizontally launched mortars which can even pierce one of these sangers.' Henry Bros' business involves high risk, but it is also profitable. Five years ago company turnover was Pounds 5m. Last year it was Pounds 22m. The company has been forced into being as self-sufficient as possible. Three years ago the IRA sent cards to 30 of Henry Bros' leading suppliers, saying that if they continued selling goods to the company, funerals would follow. 'It had great effect. All our big suppliers refused to do business with us. We felt betrayed. We even had to start buying cement from Poland instead of locally,' Mr Henry says. 'If all the energy and skills we put into this business could instead be concentrated on exports, Northern Ireland could achieve a great deal,' he points out. Henry Bros is hoping for export orders - for its bullet-proof windows.</p>

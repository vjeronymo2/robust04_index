			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report "specially for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA" by ITAR-TASS </F> correspondents Galina Kuchina and Yuriy Sizov incoporating  remarks by and interview with Latvian Prime Minister Valdis  Birkavs, date and place not given, under the "Former Union  Republics" rubric: "We Do Not See the Future in a Gloomy Light"]    [Text] Russia remains Latvia's main trading partner.  Goods from Russia constitute over 28 percent of total imports,  while the proportion of goods being dispatched from the Baltic  state is close to 30 percent. Latvia imports mainly energy and  fuel resources from its neighbor -- they form approximately  one-half of the import volume.    Economists analyzing not only the absolute figures but also  their dynamic processes noted long ago that Latvia is moving  away from the eastern market and turning sharply toward the  West. What is the reason for this strategy? It was with that  question that we began our conversation with Valdis Birkavs,  head of the Latvian Government.    In the premier's opinion, the "attempt to preserve old  relations, however tempting that may seem, is doomed to total  failure in the future." The Russian market, in his words, is  already full of high-quality goods from many countries. Latvian  goods, which are inferior to Japanese machinery and German radio  equipment, may be in demand in Russia for a couple of years more  only because of its market's capacity to absorb them. That  would keep local enterprises "afloat" for a while. But then the  inevitable collapse would follow. So is there any sense in  continuing to create products today with a limited level of  competitiveness? Is it not better to embark right away on the  socially painful path of reforming the structure of production  and seeking to meet the demands of the European and U.S. markets?    Valdis Birkavs is convinced that the republic's traditional  sectors -- radioelectronics, textiles, and timber processing --  will recover and survive. What about the "RAF" minibus plant in  Jelgava?    As the head of the government said, the plant has designed a  new test model, the "RAF-style," and Russian enterprises will  take part in its production. But this program is not going to  be implemented until the beginning of the next century. For the  moment the plant is living off its accumulated assets and the  improvement of existing models.    Is politics not proving a hindrance to economic relations  between Latvia and Russia? Yes, that is true, Valdis Birkavs  agreed, and he recalled the story of the "capture" of two  Russian generals. When that incident was over -- as far as the  Latvian side and the Russian side were concerned -- there  followed what the premier called the demarche of Leonid Mayorov,  commander of the Northwestern Group of Forces. The colonel  general issued an order on the use of weapons in the event of an  attempt to seize Russian military installations.    Then when it seemed that passions had subsided and the  differences of opinion had been sorted out, the "situation was  immediately reversed," Birkavs said. The outline of the  forthcoming troop withdrawal treaty immediately became less  clear and instability crept into the negotiating process.    "The disturbance of the foreign economic balance could lead  to internal political imbalance and an opposition onslaught  after which the resignation of the government cannot be ruled  out," the premier said. He added: "The limit of our  concessions to Russia has been reached. But the talks must go  on even in the present situation, impossible though that may be.  There is no other way, the countries will not achieve  rapprochement by military methods."    During the conversation the question of the situation of  people who do not have Latvian citizenship was raised. This  affects about one-third of the population. As is well known,  officials in Riga have repeatedly asserted that the distinction  between citizens and those without citizenship will amount  solely to the right to vote or be elected. At the same time the  number of laws limiting noncitizens' opportunities in the  economic and social spheres is increasing. A second reading has  been given to the law on state service, which envisages that  only a Latvian citizen may be a state official. Article 35 of  the law "On Aviation" says that only citizens may form part of  an aircrew. Noncitizens cannot be judges, lawyers, or private  detectives, they receive fewer passes, and they get a social  pension amounting to 90 percent of the social pensions of  citizens.    [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] What is the head of government's view  of the opinion of Max van der Stoel, CSCE high commissioner for  the affairs of national minorities, that the problem of  citizenship in Latvia has not so much a political aspect as an  economic one?    [Birkavs] I think someone is trying to artificially  aggravate this problem. After all, people go where things are  best for them. The fact that there is no mass exodus from  Latvia demonstrates that various categories of residents are not  suffering a marked economic disadvantage. On the contrary,  people want to live and work normally here. It takes time and  some patience for the solution of the citizenship problem and  the adoption of a law. Previously we did not even pay attention  to citizenship. Now, however, when this question is constantly  being raised, when there is talk about mass deportations, even  though no one has any intention of doing such a thing, now  people want an anchor in the form of citizenship.    Admittedly, there is a certain number of people who want to  leave. There are around 150,000 of them according to the  statistics of the "Roots" association, which is engaged on the  resettlement of people to Russia. Around 30,000 Belarusians and  Ukrainians also want to return to their ethnic homeland. They  need assistance. If the financial problem is resolved, the  voluntary departure of 150,000 people would immediately ease the  situation. Of course, the West too could help in that.    We have always said that we have three ways of normalizing  relations. The first is a very cautious naturalization. The  second is absolutely voluntary repatriation to the ethnic  homeland with financial support for that process. There is one  more way -- emigration to third countries, but that of course  will not be large scale. Incidentally, Riga has always been a  transit zone from where, by virtue of its liberal conditions,  people have after their arrival then gone on to third countries.    In meetings with representatives of many states I have  always  said: Those who want to leave must be helped. I have discussed  this with U.S. Secretary of State Christopher and at other  levels. But there has been no real movement. The process will  probably become more active when the army has withdrawn.    [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] What is the attitude in Latvia to Bill  Clinton's initiative on the new reconstruction of NATO?    [Birkavs] We take a positive view of the "Partnership for  Peace" program, it has long-term prospects. It requires  resources, admittedly, but nevertheless we will take part in it.  Had we already been participants in this program at the start  of the incident involving the Russian generals, we could have  turned to NATO for consultation because that is envisaged by  Article 14 of the "Partnership for Peace" declaration.    The proposed mechanism for the peaceful settlement of  conflicts is also valuable for us because the problem of  security for Latvia will be a very topical one in the next two  to three years. Indeed, the time has come to look at the  military systems of other countries. We were part of the old,  Soviet, system for quite a long time. We did not emerge from it  with the fondest memories.    Of course, we will look closely at what is happening in the  Russian Armed Forces because there are plenty of interesting  reforms there. But this is not the right time for military  cooperation and joint maneuvers with Russia. First of all we  must settle mutual grievances.    [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] So that is why you see even Israel and  the Czech Republic as suppliers of weapons?    [Birkavs] I don't particularly like spending money on  weapons. Nevertheless, we need to equip our military forces in  a sufficiently organized way and for the fairly long term. We  are not preparing to attack anyone. We simply need to have  mobile, well-trained defense forces. Compared with European  countries our budget has the lowest spending on the needs of the  armed forces -- just 1.8 percent. That is clearly inadequate  and we, the government, are often criticized for that.    Even so, I am confident that Latvia will enter the 21st  century not as a country with big military muscles but with the  highest level of education in Europe. After all, before World  War II we had the highest number of people with higher education  (per thousand inhabitants) in Europe. While looking back at the  past, we see the future and we see it by no means in a gloomy  light.</p>

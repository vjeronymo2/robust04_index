			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW BILL MAY PAVE PATH FOR IRISH ALIENS;  </P> <P> IMMIGRATION: MANY OF THE LATEST ARRIVALS FIND OPPORTUNITIES SEVERELY LIMITED.  GIVEN THEIR EDUCATION AND SKILLS, FRUSTRATION RUNS HIGH.  </P> <P> Twenty-six-year-old Brendan had high hopes of success when he came here from  his native Ireland as that country's economy turned sour in 1988. America is "a  country where you can come and go-get-it," he says. "I want to work for myself.  I want to move."  </P> <P> But for the past 2 1/2 years, Brendan has been stymied. Although he has two  years of college, he can't qualify for much more than a bartender's job. He  worries about filling out medical forms. And he has had to live in fear of  arrest -- by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  </P> <P> Brendan (he won't give his last name) is part of a new wave of Irish  immigrants, some 100,000 or more who have landed on U.S. soil in recent years,  many of them here in Boston, where a similar influx -- in the early 1900s --  settled, worked and eventually made good.  </P> <P> Unlike the earlier Irish immigrants, Brendan and most of his well-educated or  highly skilled compatriots haven't been absorbed very readily. The job market  is tight, and not having the proper immigration documents severely limits what  they can do.  </P> <P> Even more stultifying, increasingly restrictive U.S. immigration laws have  virtually barred Irish subjects from becoming U.S. citizens unless they are  relatives of Americans.  </P> <P> "I find myself stalled by my illegality," Brendan laments. "You only live  three-score-and-10, you know. I feel my time, my best years are running out."  </P> <P> Soon, however, there may be some relief. The new immigration bill that Congress  recently passed provides preferential treatment for Irish immigrants that could  offer Brendan and thousands of others already here new opportunities to become  "legal."  </P> <P> Nestled in legislation to increase legal immigration to 700,000 persons a year,  from the current 500,000, are provisions for some 48,000 entry visas just for  Irish immigrants -- more than double the number allotted to any other  nationality. President Bush is expected to sign the bill into law.  </P> <P> Proponents say once the legislation becomes law it effectively will pave a new  express lane from Ireland to the United States.  </P> <P> "The reforms will have a beneficial impact on Irish people wanting to find a  better life in America," says Declan Kelleher, an Irish government spokesman.  "Many Irish are living in an out-of-status capacity. . . . This (law) should be  able to get them proper credentials."  </P> <P> But the transition won't be easy. Currently, few of the illegal Irish aliens  fully understand the new bill, and many are distrustful of any government  promises. And the U.S. economy is in a slump, dampening job prospects for all  in America, even for those legal workers who hold "green cards."  </P> <P> And while the new procedures give a slight advantage to the estimated 100,000  Irish who are here illegally as opposed to applicants still living in Ireland,  the process isn't automatic. Because visas will be issued on a first-come,  first-served basis, many could go to applicants abroad.  </P> <P> The task of spreading information about the new bill to worried Irish illegal  aliens here -- and coaxing them to apply for their visas -- is expected to fall  heavily upon an extensive network of relief agencies, Roman Catholic church  officials and Irish rights organizations.  </P> <P> But here, too, there are obstacles to be surmounted. As more illegal immigrants  have come to the United States, relations among some of these groups have  become strained, with the newer organizations adopting tactics that older ones  find offensive. In some cases, the new Irish immigrants are encountering  friction with their predecessors of decades ago, many of whom resent the  newcomers' radically different values.  </P> <P> "Most of the old immigrants came here in the past from poor and rural  communities in Ireland, which colors the way they remember the place," explains  Ken, a 41-year-old illegal immigrant who is living in the Boston area.  </P> <P> "The young people coming here now are better educated, they come from the  cities and many have traveled before settling here. They're not as religious as  their parents or the older immigrants. They have a totally different view of  Ireland, themselves and the world."  </P> <P> The split has shown up most visibly in the efforts of the Irish Immigration  Reform Movement, a New York-based organization that was instrumental in pushing  the new, expanded immigration quotas for Irish aliens through Congress.  </P> <P> Formed out of splinter groups of illegal immigrants themselves, the group --  which has chapters in several large cities with sizable numbers of Irish aliens  -- hired Washington lobbyists and enlisted the aid of lawmakers who are  influential in setting immigration policy, such as Sen. Edward M. Kennedy  (D-Mass.), Reps. Bruce A. Morrison (D-Conn.) and Joe Moakley (D-Mass.).  </P> <P> Although the IIRM achieved its aims, it did so in a way that tended to make  members of the old-line Irish-American community uncomfortable.  </P> <P> "They have a sensational approach," gripes Bill McGowan, a Boston accountant  and insurance broker who has been active in the Irish Working Committee, a  coalition of relief and social service agencies that has been set up to help  the city's immigrant communities.  </P> <P> "The leaders in the Boston chapter (of IIRM) are a somewhat more radical group  -- they like to attack the Establishment," McGowan says.  </P> <P> But Donald O'Sullivan, president and chairman of IIRM's Boston chapter, brushes  aside such criticisms as "90% envy and 10% objectivity" on the part of  older-generation Irish-Americans.  </P> <P> The IIRM's tactics may have been aggressive, but there was nothing wrong with  them, O'Sullivan says. "We were audacious, optimistic and confident," he  concedes, but "We were very clear in what we wanted. We got down and dirty and  did the work to change the law."  </P> <P> Moira Maguire, a Boston native whose grandparents emigrated here in 1910, said  she became active in IIRM lobbying because she remembered the stories that her  grandmother told her of the difficult cultural transition that the earlier  immigrants had encountered.  </P> <P> "A whole generation of (Irish) people have become complacent," says Maguire,  25, a college graduate who works as an administrative assistant in a Boston  bank. "They have forgotten how difficult it was here before they became  established in America."  </P> <P> Ken, the 41-year-old illegal alien, believes the newcomers' higher education  level and more aggressive posture is a plus, because they are coming here with  a level of energy that the more impoverished Irish immigrants of the early  1900s did not have.  </P> <P> "The leaders of the IIRM have an opportunity, having set a precedent with the  passage of the (immigration) legislation, to go into politics and to challenge  the community's older and comfortable leaders in our community," Ken says.  </P> <P> "I think that it is important for us to bring in fresh ideas and perspectives  to our community," he adds.  </P> <P> There's no doubt the new bill will make life here a lot easier -- and  potentially rewarding -- for thousands of illegal immigrants.  </P> <P> For Joe, a 26-year-old bartender and construction worker who has been in Boston  for about 18 months, qualifying for the new entry visa would end the  frustrating hardships of having to live underground and provide the promise of  an open life in America.  </P> <P> After finishing three years of college, Joe left Ireland for a vacation here  and never returned to his native country. About a month ago, he married an  Irish woman who also has been living illegally in Boston.  </P> <P> From time to time, Joe says, the thought of being discovered crosses his mind  -- "mostly when you hear that some Irish guy was caught. Then, you feel a  little bit cautious."  </P> <P> But the prospect of a day when both he and his wife can "be just like any other  American -- with an apartment, a bank account, credit cards and the works" --  overrides his fear of detection.  </P> <P> "I don't know too much about the details right now, but I intend to apply for  it," he said of the new visa opportunity.  </P></p>

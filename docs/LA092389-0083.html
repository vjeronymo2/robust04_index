			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> P&amp;G TO ACQUIRE NOXELL CORP. IN $1.3-BILLION DEAL;  </P> <P> TAX-FREE TRANSACTION WILL INVOLVE STOCK SWAP WITH COSMETICS MAKER  </P> <P> Consumer products powerhouse Procter &amp; Gamble Co. will acquire Noxell  Corp., maker of skin-care goods and cosmetics, in a stock-swap deal valued at  $1.3 billion, both companies announced Friday.  </P> <P> Under terms of a definitive agreement approved by the boards of both companies,  P&amp;G will add Noxell's Cover Girl and Clarion makeup lines and Noxzema skin  cream to its already bulging portfolio of leading consumer products and foods.  </P> <P> The announcement sent Noxell soaring $10 to $31.25 a share in over-the-counter  trading. On the New York Stock Exchange, P&amp;G lost $2 a share to $119.86.  </P> <P> Under terms of the agreement, P&amp;G will exchange 0.272 shares of its common  stock for each of Noxell's 40.5 million common and class B shares in a tax-free  transaction. Based on the closing price for P&amp;G, the transaction would have  a value of $32.60 per Noxell share.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Very Competitive Market  </P> <P> Noxell, based in Hunt Valley, Md., will be operated as a P&amp;G unit. The  75-year-old company has 2,200 employees and annual revenue of roughly $522  million from sales in the United States, Canada and Europe.  </P> <P> Analysts applauded the surprise announcement as strategically sound and said  the acquisition launches P&amp;G into the rough-and-tumble world of women's  makeup. Although P&amp;G has a number of successful skin care products,  including Oil of Olay, Bain de Soleil and Clearasil, it has no cosmetics lines.  </P> <P> "P&amp;G has done a lot of work in skin care technology . . . and this will add  another leg to their delivery systems," said Jay Freedman of Kidder, Peabody  &amp; Co.  </P> <P> He said Cover Girl is the No. 1 mass-market cosmetics line in the United  States, and for that P&amp;G paid a premium. Freedman said the price offered  for Noxell is about 15 times operating cash flow.  </P> <P> For its part, Noxell, which also makes Lestoil household cleaner, was attracted  by P&amp;G's resources for research and development. Last year P&amp;G spent  more than $650 million on research and product development.  </P></p>

First, for each SEEDS, the NASD will distribute a circular to the membership providing guidance concerning member firm compliance responsibilities (including suitability recommendations and account approval) when handling transactions in SEEDS. Second, the NASD reiterates that, pursuant to the NASD's customer suitability rule found at Section 2, Article III of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice, members will have a duty of due diligence to learn the essential facts relating to every customer trading SEEDS prior to their first SEEDS transaction. In addition, consistent with Section 2, Article III, of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice, the NASD will require that a member specifically approve a customers's account for trading SEEDS prior to, or promptly after, the completion of its first SEEDS transaction. In this connection the NASD has also proposed to amend the Policy of the NASD Board of Governors issued under Article III, section 2 of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice to highlight members' obligations to deal fairly with their customers when making recommendations or accepting orders concerning SEEDS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the NASD believes the proposed rule change is consistent with section 15A(b)(6) of the Act. Section 15A(b)(6) requires that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and in general to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, the NASD believes the proposal strikes an appropriate balance between the NASD's need to adapt and respond to innovations in the securities markets and the NASD's concomitant need to ensure the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets. The NASD believes the proposed numerical, quantitative listing standards should ensure that only substantial companies capable of meeting their contingent obligations created by SEEDS are able to list such products on Nasdaq. Similarly, by providing for the distribution of circulars to the membership concerning member firm compliance responsibilities and requirements, the NASD believes the proposal addresses any potential sales practice concerns that may arise in connection with SEEDS. The NASD also believes that the trading of SEEDS will provide investors with important investment and hedging benefits that will serve to satisfy better their investment and portfolio management needs. Moreover, the NASD believes that SEEDS represent innovative financing techniques that provide issuers with increased flexibility to raise capital at potentially lower costs, in return for assuming some market volatility risk. Finally, the NASD believes that listing SEEDS on Nasdaq will also facilitate members and investors desiring to trade SEEDS in a dealer environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Bankers seek a path through tricky woodlands issue: The opposition and obstacles to privatisation of Forestry Commission property A TEAM from London merchant bankers Samuel Montagu has until the end of this week to finish a crash course on one of the trickiest privatisation questions in Britain and present its recommendations to the government. The bankers have to advise a government review group about the commercial feasibility of ways in which the woodlands owned by the Forestry Commission might be privatised. It was given only six weeks to present its first report. The Montagu team is looking at Forest Enterprise, the commercial arm of the commission. It owns about 2m acres of forest, ranging from big commercial plantations of Sitka spruce in Scotland to historic woodlands such as the New Forest. Forest Enterprise harvests mature timber which it sells to the large paper and board mills in which foreign companies have invested about Pounds 1bn in the last decade. It also looks after woods where growing numbers of people walk or ride mountain bikes. Its timber sales are about Pounds 75m a year. Last spring the government asked a committee of civil servants from several ministries to consider the future of Forest Enterprise as part of a review of forestry policy. Samuel Montagu has been called in to look at the commercial viability of three options: Selling Forest Enterprise and all its properties to the private sector. Finding other ways of bringing private-sector methods and private ownership into the organisation. Leaving it as it is and continuing piecemeal sales of woodland. The privatisation of Forest Enterprise has long been desired by Tory rightwingers, anxious to reduce the state's role. But it would bring in little money for the Treasury (perhaps less than Pounds 1bn) and has few supporters. Important opponents are the wood processors, who range from the big sawmillers to the Finnish-owned Caledonian Paper of Irvine, Ayrshire, which daily turns 800-900 tonnes of fresh timber into paper. Caledonian Paper has a 10-year contract until 1999 with Forest Enterprise to supply 50 per cent of its timber. It says private-sector suppliers are small and unreliable, and wants to be sure of a guaranteed supply when it decides whether to double its capacity. Perhaps more surprisingly, the private-sector timber growers who might be expected to welcome the possibility of buying Forest Enterprise's woodlands are also opposed. Their organisation, Timber Growers UK, says that to sell Forest Enterprise now while the timber and land markets are depressed would mean selling it too cheaply, and divert investment from planting. Environmental organisations and walkers' groups such as the Ramblers Association are critics of privatisation, fearing that it would reverse the trend whereby forestry has become more sympathetic to environmental concerns and threaten the public's 'right to roam'. The Forestry Commission, a government department under the Scottish, Welsh and agriculture ministries, does not wish to be privatised. Having only last year split itself between Forest Enterprise and the regulatory Forest Authority, it would like more time to make the new structure work. Among the few strong advocates of privatisation are forestry investment managers, such as Tilhill Economic Forestry, which manage other people's woodland. They believe it is time the state withdrew from forestry and stopped competing with their clients. The Forestry Industry Committee of Great Britain represents the whole industry, from wood processors to timber growers and professional bodies. It opposes privatisation. 'Forest Enterprise is not in a fit state to privatise,' says Mr Ronnie Williams, its chief executive. He believes that with a government majority in the Commons of only 17, outright privatisation is politically unfeasible. But he adds: 'We have to accept that something's going to be done.' FICGB's priority is to see Forest Enterprise run as if it were a private-sector company. It says the organisation's woodlands should be rationalised, with historic forests and nature reserves that would never be suitable for private ownership going to a separate national organisation. Whatever the Samuel Montagu team recommends, the real debate will take place in government when it considers the review group's conclusions in the new year. Ministers are divided. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, is thought to oppose outright privatisation; Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, has long advocated it; Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, is sympathetic to the idea. As one person close to the review says: 'If the Forest Enterprise were easy to privatise it would have been done long ago.'</p>

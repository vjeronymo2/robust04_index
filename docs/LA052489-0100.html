			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARE ENTERPRISES CREDITORS SAY TOP OFFICIALS MISMANAGED FIRM  </P> <P> Creditors of bankrupt Care Enterprises of Tustin have accused the company's top  management of engaging in insider trading, manipulating earnings reports and  generally profiting from corporate transactions at the expense of Care  bondholders, shareholders and employees.  </P> <P> Court documents filed by the creditors also allege that executives of the  troubled nursing home chain entered into questionable business deals, took  corporate jets on fishing trips in violation of company policy and stayed in  $1,000 hotel suites at company expense.  </P> <P> The court papers, filed Monday by a committee of Care creditors, ask the U.S.  Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles to oust Care's management and replace it with  an independent trustee.  </P> <P> The company is expected to file a formal response to the allegations before a  scheduled June 16 hearing on the trustee request. Although the response is not  yet ready, Care attorney Arnold Kupetz denied Tuesday that the company's  management has acted improperly.  </P> <P> Twin brothers Lee Roy and Dee Roy Bangerter, the company's principal owners and  top officers, could not be reached Tuesday for comment.  </P> <P> Care filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S.  Bankruptcy Code in March, 1987. Care has total debt of about $180 million.  </P> <P> The creditors committee, which represents unsecured bondholders, has been  seeking removal of Care's current managers since last year. But the court  documents filed Monday represent the first detailed look at allegations of  mismanagement raised by creditors of the company.  </P> <P> Many of those allegations involve actions by the Bangerters.  </P> <P> The creditors' court filing states that Lee Roy Bangerter, Care's chairman and  chief executive, sold 200,000 shares of Care stock to the company's employee  stock ownership plan on April 2, 1986, for that day's market price of $6.75 per  share.  </P> <P> One month later, according to court documents, Care reported that its  first-quarter earnings had fallen by more than 50% from the previous year's  $264,000.  </P> <P> The creditors charge that Bangerter knew about the earnings decline when he  sold the stock but failed to inform the head of the ESOP committee. They also  allege that he did not tell the committee that his shares were classified as  "restricted" under securities laws and could not be resold for a significant  length of time.  </P> <P> Care's stock closed at $6.50 per share on Friday, May 9, the day the earnings  decline was announced publicly, and $7 on the following Monday. The price of  Care stock began falling later in the year and was trading for about 50 cents a  share when the company filed for bankruptcy.  </P> <P> Care attorney Arnold Kupetz acknowledged Tuesday that Bangerter sold the shares  to the ESOP, but he said the sale was approved by company attorneys. He said  the executives administering the ESOP probably had as much information about  the company's operations as Bangerter did.  </P> <P> A second allegation contained in the creditors' court papers is that the  company manipulated its reported earnings in an effort to improve the  appearance of its financial performance in advance of a $51.8-million bond  offering.  </P> <P> The creditors said the company prematurely reported the sale of a convalescent  care center during the first quarter of 1985. Care recorded a $150,000 profit  from the planned sale, which was later scuttled. The recorded gain accounted  for about 20% of first-quarter 1985 earnings.  </P> <P> But the company had received only $60,000 of the $500,000 purchase price, the  creditors allege, and the sale had not been completed at the end of the  quarter. Under accounting rules, the profit should not have been recorded in  the first quarter, court documents state.  </P></p>

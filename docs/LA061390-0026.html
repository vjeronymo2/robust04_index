			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> U.S. APPROVES BORDER SEWAGE PLANT  </P> <P> U.S. authorities have given their approval to initial plans to construct an  almost $200-million binational sewage-treatment complex near the U.S.-Mexico  boundary line in San Diego, opening the way for a formal agreement between both  nations, officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The consent of U.S. officials to the proposed project is considered an  important development in resolving the decades-old dilemma of what to do with  the huge volume of Tijuana sewage that has long befouled farmland, horse  ranches, beaches and other land in San Diego County.  </P> <P> The consent of U.S. authorities -- including officials from the State  Department, Environmental Protection Agency and Office of Management and Budget  -- had been eagerly awaited by proponents of the project. Mexican authorities  had already given their imprimatur to the informal agreement.  </P> <P> The joint project -- to be financed with U.S. and Mexican funds -- is viewed by  many as the only viable solution for the cross-border pollution problem, which  has at times strained relations between the United States and Mexico.  </P> <P> Part of the informal pact would allow financially strapped Mexico to pay its  share of the mega-project -- an amount totaling perhaps $41 million -- during a  10-year period, thus stretching out the fiscal impact.  </P> <P> However, the planned international sewage treatment complex -- an almost  $200-million project, including an elaborate system of pipelines on both sides  of the border and an outfall extending 3 miles into the Pacific -- is still far  from reality. Many questions about its design and ultimate funding remain to be  worked out. The Bush Administration is seeking $15.7 million to finance design  work and initial construction costs.  </P> <P> The treatment facility, which would treat up to 25 million gallons a day of  Tijuana-generated wastes, is not slated to be in operation until the end of  1994.  </P> <P> The U.S. approval sets the stage for signing the formal agreement between the  governments of the United States and Mexico, said Jose Valdez, a spokesman for  Narendra N. Gunaji, U.S. representative on the International Boundary and Water  Commission, the binational U.S.-Mexico body that is proposing to construct the  huge project.  </P> <P> San Diego-area congressional representatives, in a joint statement, said  Tuesday that the long-awaited U.S. approval should open the way for formal  binational adoption of a sewage-plant pact as soon as next month.  </P> <P> "This agreement is a giant step for the environment," U.S. Rep. Bill Lowery  (R-Coronado), said in the joint statement. "It is a pleasure to announce that a  solution is not only at hand but is now inevitable."  </P> <P> Added U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, (R-Calif.), "It's a victory for border residents,  the environment, and all Californians."  </P></p>

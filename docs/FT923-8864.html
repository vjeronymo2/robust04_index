			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Drink: Champagne hits back - A look at the price of a favourite fizz WHY IS much champagne so expensive and what are the Champenois doing about it? An answer to the first part of this question is that the cost of the grapes for fine champagne accounts for half the ex-Marne cellars price of the wines of the Grande Marque firms that dominate the market. Following the collapse of the interprofessional contract in 1990 and the implementation of individual ones, they could not press their grower associates too hard on price. Based on prices of the last two vintages, the cost of the 1.2 kilos of grapes needed per bottle of high grade champagne is about Pounds 3.50. The production cost is around Pounds 2.50. Add the cost of keeping a non-vintage blend well into its third year, and the ex-cellars price of a Grande Marque champagne rises to between Pounds 8 and Pounds 9. At the other end of the market, the cost of grapes from the villages selling at 80 per cent of the top price on the Montagne de Reims and the Cotes de Blancs can be less than Pounds 2. Then there is champagne, made partly at least from the third pressing (deuxieme taille), yields a poor quality vintage with very short ageing potential, and has an ex-cellars price of about Pounds 5. The problem of the Grandes Marques and a few other high-quality firms is to establish, particularly in a time of sharp decline, a fair relationship between the price and the quality of their (inevitably) dearer champagnes - after all, why buy champagne if it is not clearly superior to the growing number of sparkling wines throughout the world? So great efforts are being made to improve quality, thereby obliging the low-cost producers to raise their standards and prices. During the past two or three years, almost all the 3,000 press-houses have been inspected and 400 have been replaced. The result is better, clearer must. Now, the deuxieme taille is to be eliminated at the coming vintage so that the merchants will secure 100 litres of must from 160, rather than 150, kilos of grapes. And the leading firms which do not use this third pressing will be unable to re-sell it, for it will be distilled. Fifteen million bottles of champagne will thus be lost in an average year. No other sparkling wine in the world has cut out this pressing. Further, the maximum yield per hectare of grapes will be cut. This will have a positive effect on quality and, eventually, will result in some increase in the final cost per bottle. A large vintage this year will be highly unwelcome to the champagne makers for, while the desirable level of stocks is the equivalent of three years' sales, stocks at the end of June were estimated at 4.3 years. This has led to prices being cut to levels at which there is little or no profit. It has been possible in French supermarkets to buy champagne for as little as FFr 52 a bottle. A normal good crop runs to 10,000 to 11,000 kilos per hectare, but this year anything exceeding 9,000 to 9,500 will be blocked. The excess cannot be made into champagne and will be kept in reserve by the growers and co-ops, who will not be paid for it until it is released, probably in two years' time. The champagne makers are also planning to extend the minimum age for selling a champagne from 12 to 15 months and, eventually, to 18. Although too little even then for adequate maturity, it will prevent the marketing of immature champagne. But what will be the likely price of grapes this coming vintage? It must depend first on the size and quality of the crop; but if these are favourable, it will certainly come down from the Comite's recommended price last year of FFr 30 a kilo. Forecasts range from FFr 27-FFr 25. Last year, for the first time for at least 16 years, prices did not rise and this trend is likely to continue for another couple of years. After the effects of inflation, this means a 'real money' cut. The predicament of the champagne makers is not, however, as bad as it might appear from the UK, which cut its consumption of champagne by a third last year compared with 1990. Worldwide, sales fell by only 10 per cent. This year, a further 7 per cent drop is expected. In less than six months, however, UK supermarkets may face strong competition. Their normal retail margins on champagne are much higher than in French supermarkets: 20 per cent to 25 per cent compared with 5 per cent to 10 per cent. From January, it will be possible to import without duty (now Pounds 1.56 a bottle) 6 1/2 cases for personal consumption. While such amounts may exceed the wildest wishes of the average Briton, his cash resources and the spare space in his car, it is likely to encourage champagne purchases in France that otherwise might have been made in the UK. It will be interesting to see how British supermarkets respond.</p>

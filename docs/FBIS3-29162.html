			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- The government launched a  fiscal 1994 national budget Tuesday [15 February] featuring  austere overall spending for the second straight year but tax  cuts and relatively ample outlays to prop up the flagging  economy. The budget plan, endorsed at a cabinet meeting for  submission to the Diet in early March, earmarked 73,081.7  billion yen for the year beginning April 1, up a scant 1 percent  from the current year's initial budget.    This is higher than a 0.2 percent growth in the initial 1993  budget, stemming largely from special accounting techniques such  as advanced repayment of loans extended to local governments to  boost the budget by some 4,520 billion yen. Without these  measures, the overall program could have posted a contraction of  some 5 percent, Finance Ministry officials said.    More clearly showing the constraints imposed by sluggish tax  revenues amid the prolonged economic slump, general operating  expenditures, the core of the budget, are limited to 40,854.8  billion yen, up 2.3 percent or the lowest rise since fiscal  1988. But in a bid to shore up the economy, the government  maintains a growth rate in public works spending of 4 percent  for the third straight year, with a figure of 8,984.6 billion  yen, up 4.0 percent, and includes cuts in income tax and other  taxes worth 4,377.0 billion yen.    As a result, the government is to issue deficit-covering  bonds for the first time in five years to raise 3,133.8 billion  yen.    Among other core outlays, the plan earmarks 4,683.5 billion  yen for defense spending, an increase of 0.9 percent which is  the lowest in 34 years, and 1,063.4 billion yen for Official  Development Assistance (ODA), up 4.8 percent to mark a record  low.    Outside the general operating expenditures, debt-service  costs will shrink 7.0 percent to 14,360.2 billion yen, and tax  grants to local governments will contract 18.3 percent to  12,757.8 billion yen.    The plan also calls for repayment of 1,544.8 billion yen in  funds borrowed from the national debt consolidation fund to  cover revenue shortfalls in fiscal 1992.    On the revenue side, the government estimates tax revenues  will amount to 53,665.0 billion yen, down 12.5 percent, and  nontax revenues 5,601.1 billion yen, up 104.8 percent, and that  it will get 172.5 billion yen, down 7.5 percent, in proceeds  from the sale of shares in the privatized Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone Corp.    New bond issuances are to rise 67.8 percent to a record  13,643.0 billion yen, including 10,509.2 billion yen in  construction bonds, used primarily for public works, and  deficit-financing bonds.    As a result, the debt dependency rate will rise to 18.7  percent from this year's 11.2 percent, and the outstanding  balance of bonds will top 200 trillion yen for the first time to  reach some 201 trillion yen, up from 182 trillion yen.</p>

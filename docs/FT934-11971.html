			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of Locating in North America (3): The shift to the south - Regional factors that come into play AN IMPORTANT consideration when locating in North America is the relative strengths of the various regional economies and their competitive advantages. For the US constitutes not a single economy but an agglomeration of regional ones, each with differing attitudes towards business issues, industrial mixes, cycles of growth and recession. That said, two overall national trends have been particularly noticeable in recent decades. First, the population of the country has increased since 1960 from about 180m to 250m. However, most of this growth has occurred in the south and west of the country, rather than in the traditional northern 'rustbelt,' where population growth has slowed to a crawl. There has been a similar shift in national output, especially in manufacturing industry. Between 1963 and 1989 the middle Atlantic and east-north central regions' combined share of manufacturing output declined by nearly 30 per cent, while the south and west enjoyed a combined increase of nearly 33 per cent, according to Mr Robert Crandall, a Fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. In his book Manufacturing on the Move, Mr Crandall argues that labour market conditions, and in particular high wages and high levels of unionisation, have been a primary factor behind the decline of the north and rise of the south, with its lower labour costs and tradition of hostility to unions. 'As of 1993', he adds, 'there is no evidence that the shift in manufacturing is slowing. Northern states may event- ually discover that it is in their interest to reduce impediments in their own labour markets. These policies may, in turn, slow the migration, but they seem unlikely to stop it.' Few would dispute that labour issues have been a major factor in this trend, but others would also cite such factors as the development of more entrepreneurial attitudes in some parts of the south and the invention of the air-conditioner. A second trend, which has become discernible in the past year or so, is rapid economic growth in the scenically beautiful and less developed states of the Rocky Mountains and Pacific north-west. 'Employment in the moun- tain and plain states is growing at a 3.2 per cent annual rate, or four times the national average,' says Mr David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services. 'In the 1980s it was growing at half the national rate. 'In fact, the top ranking states for employment growth this year are Utah (up 4.1 per cent), Nevada (3.1 per cent), Idaho (3 per cent) and Colorado (2.7 per cent.)' The Rockies seem to be part- icularly attractive to white- collar professionals who are able to live wherever they choose, thanks to the wonders of computer networks and the fax machine, and plump for this area because of its superb, outdoor lifestyle. Time magazine said recently that 'on the strength of cur- rent migration trends, some experts believe the region may even be on the way to becoming a magnetic pole of a new West, replacing California as the ultimate, myth-making destination, tantalising the daydreams of restless souls itching to pick up and move.' Certainly, a large number of migrants to the Rockies seem to be coming from California, which is in the throes of a deep recession, due partly to the shrinking defence industry, which remains an important part of its industrial base, high wages and a collapse in its property market. California is also suffering from more serious, and basic, structural problems, including racial tensions (brought home by the Los Angeles riots), heavy government regulation of industry and congested roads. All this has meant a deterioration in the quality of life. That said, the state seems to be starting to grapple with some of these problems. Hughes Aircraft, the large aerospace manufacturer, announced recently that it would stay in California because of the state's adoption of tax breaks for businesses and a new 'atmosphere of co-operation'. It had put its headquarters on the real estate market a year ago. The north-eastern US is undergoing similar structural economic problems to those in California, since it has been heavily reliant on the defence industry and suffered a property market bubble in the 1980s from which the region is only slowly recovering. As Kemper's Mr Hale notes: 'While the US economy has long experienced regional divergences in economic performance they have increased greatly during this cycle.' Other regions which are currently seeing reasonable, if somewhat sluggish, growth include: Texas, the Pacific north-west and the south-east. Texas suffered a severe slump in the mid-1980s when the price of oil tumbled but it has since diversified away from the sector into such areas as high technology and environmental services, and the economy should benefit greatly from its proximity to Mexico if the North American free trade agreement is signed into law. The Pacific north-western states of Washington and Oregon, like the Rocky Mountain states, have attracted considerable immigration from California and have moved far beyond their traditional reliance on agro-businesses, with thriving high technology sectors. That said, the downturn in the world aviation market is hitting Boeing, based just outside Seattle, Washington, and that is having a detrimental knock-on effect on the local economy. In the south-east, a 1.8 per cent growth in employment this year has been helped by a string of company relocations and start-ups, including construction of a new BMW car plant in South Carolina. The region also comes out well in a recent study by Cognetics Inc, an economic consultancy in Cambridge, Massachusetts, called 'Entrepreneurial Hot Spots: The Best Places in America to Start and Grow a Company'. Among the 50 largest metropolitan areas, four of the top five are in the south-east: Charlotte, North Carolina; Atlanta, Georgia; Nashville, Tennessee; and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina. Indianapolis, Indiana, is the only one of the five to be outside the region. Of the small metropolitan areas, the lead is held by Huntsville, Alabama; followed by Honolulu, in the Hawaiian islands; Las Vegas, Nevada; Madison, Wisconsin; and Tallahassee, Florida. The study argues that America's entrepreneurial hubs are determined more by world-class universities and good infrastructure than by cheap labour or low tax rates.</p>

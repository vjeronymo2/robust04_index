			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Free trade for the Americas NEGOTIATING a free trade agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada was never going to be easy. Concluding one at a time of economic recession in two of the countries involved and impending presidential elections in one of them is likely to be very difficult indeed. Mr Brian Mulroney, the Canadian prime minister, brought his worries into the open a few days ago. In an interview with the FT, he said he doubted whether the US Congress would ratify the pact before this November's elections. His concerns are far from theoretical. Protectionist sentiment in general and special interest lobbying in particular are raising questions over Washington's commitment to the negotiations. More to the point, the existing free trade agreement between Canada and the US, negotiated four years ago, is itself coming under a shadow - thanks to moves by the US administration against Canadian exports. Two weeks ago, the US Customs Service ruled that Honda cars assembled in Ontario fail to meet the 50 per cent North American-content threshold required for duty-free access to the US under the FTA. Then last Friday, the commerce department slapped a 14.5 per cent countervailing duty on allegedly subsidised Canadian lumber. Since these are Canada's two biggest exports to the US in a trade that amounts to CDollars 200bn, it is scarcely surprising that Ottawa suspects Washington's motives, or that some Canadians favour pulling out of the agreement completely. Warning signal Canada will probably do no such thing. But since the Canada-US agreement is supposed to provide the framework for the more ambitious Nafta, the current dispute amounts to a warning for all the governments involved. The US action against Canadian-made Honda Civics certainly seems arbitrary. It has taken the US customs service three years to issue guidelines on what counts as local content, whereas Canada published guidelines in 1988. Defining local content is a fraught business, but it is hard to escape the conclusion that the US administration is pandering to protectionist pressure from domestic carmakers. It is a similar story in the case of lumber. All this is regrettable, but it is not a reason for the Canadians to despair. On the contrary, they should be using the current Nafta negotiations to eliminate the shortcomings in their existing agreement. Mexico's President Salinas, for his part, would do well to take note of Ottawa's difficulties as he forces the pace towards an early Nafta agreement. He will need all the skill he can muster to resist US negotiating pressure; at worst he could find himself negotiating a bilateral deal with the US on unfavourable terms. Political risks Free trade does entail political risks for all three governments. In Canada in particular the public blames a two-year recession on the existing FTA and Mr Mulroney, who faces elections next year, is currently perhaps the most unpopular leader in the democratic world. Yet Nafta would have a beneficial overall effect on all three economies. For the US, it would give exports a much-needed fillip. One recent study predicted net gains in US-Mexico trade of Dollars 24bn a year by 1995, with more than 600,000 jobs created in Mexico and 130,000 in the US. Significant obstacles remain to a deal. After two months of intensive negotiation disagreements persist over the pace of tariff reduction, rules of origin, banking services, trade in farm products, and oil. To these must be added pressure on President Bush to make special provision wherever there are job losses, and on the migration of 'dirty industry' to Mexico. None of these problems should be insuperable, however. For Mr Bush, far from causing political trouble, an early Nafta agreement might provide a much-needed pre-election coup. But that means dealing fairly with his northern neighbour as well as his southern one. Budget leaders, page 10</p>

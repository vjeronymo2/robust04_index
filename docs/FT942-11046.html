			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Miners given pay-off ultimatum British Coal yesterday presented its 10,000 miners with an ultimatum to accept a new deal on working conditions and redundancy arrangements within the next two weeks or risk losing a Pounds 6,000 sweetener. The lump sum is for agreeing to flexible con-ditions including weekend work and extending the maximum rostered shift from 7 1/2 to 12 hours. Miners must accept the deal by May 20 or lose the offer, leaving them with maximum redundancy payouts of Pounds 6,150, British Coal said yesterday. Mr Kevan Hunt, British Coal's employee relations director said: 'Everyone must understand this is not only the best offer in town, it's the only offer.' The Union of Democratic Mineworkers opposes the offer but the British Association of Colliery Management has accepted it. Nacods, the pit deputies union, is considering its response. British Coal said talks are planned at local level at non-UDM pits.</p>

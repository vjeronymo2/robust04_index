			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Midland backs down over cheque clearing Midland Bank, one of the big four UK clearing banks, yesterday announced that it would cut the time for processing customers' cheques and standing orders. Its statement came a day after Labour stepped up its attack on the high street banks for delays in crediting customers' accounts. Labour said that banks were making Pounds 300m a year from delays in clearing customers' cheques and almost Pounds 40m a year from time spent processing standing orders. Midland's move increases pressure on Lloyds and National Westminster banks to follow suit. This could add to a longer-term shift towards more explicit charges to customers for particular services, as the scope for 'implicit charges' is reduced. Both banks said that the clearing cycle should be seen as part of the competitive package of services being offered to customers. At present, Barclays bank is the only UK clearer to pay interest on retail deposits three days after they are made. Midland also said that from mid-1995 it would give its personal customers 14 days' advance notice of money to be deducted from their accounts as charges and interest. The requirement to introduce pre-notification of charges was part of the revised code of banking practice that was published last week. Subscribers have until the end of 1996 to introduce pre-notification. Midland added that from March 28 any standing order between customers at different branches would be given value on the same day as the bank received it. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, said Midland's announcement vindicated his campaign 'to get banks to treat customers more fairly'. At the same time he urged it to give back to customers what he described as its 'ill-gotten gains'. He said: 'I want to know what has changed from the situation a fortnight ago, when the bank claimed that they had no need to amend their rules.' Mr Griffiths called for an inquiry by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and for the two other UK clearers to act in a similar way to Barclays and Midland. Bankers do not expect the speeding up of the clearing process to produce significant gains for individuals.</p>

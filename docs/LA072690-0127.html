			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZAMBIA'S LEADER AGREES TO FREE POLITICAL CAPTIVES  </P> <P> Zambian President Kenneth D. Kaunda, in a surprise offer of reconciliation to  his political foes, announced Wednesday the release of all political prisoners  and agreed to postpone a referendum on multi-party rule.  </P> <P> "I am sending a strong message of love to those who are insulting me and my  colleagues to stop doing that," he said.  </P> <P> The referendum previously set for Oct. 17 this year would be put off until Aug.  13, 1991, he told a news conference.  </P> <P> "We must start afresh and hence the need for forgiveness, the need to come  together again," Kaunda said as he announced the release of men jailed and  detained for plotting to overthrow him at different periods during his 26-year  rule.  </P> <P> Until now, Kaunda has shown no sign of making concessions to opponents calling  for a multi-party political system, labeling them misfits, malcontents and drug  traffickers.  </P> <P> Multi-party advocates had demanded a postponement of the referendum, saying  millions of Zambians would be disenfranchised unless the electoral register was  updated.  </P> <P> Among the political prisoners released is Lt. Mwamba Luchembe, the man who  briefly took over Zambia Radio to broadcast news of a non-existent military  takeover last month.  </P></p>

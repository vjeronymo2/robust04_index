			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Bombay share prices fall 17.5% SHARE values on the Bombay stock exchange, India's largest, have plunged by 17.75 per cent in the last two days as fears spread that stocks had been bought up in recent months using funds improperly diverted from the gilt-edged market. State Bank of India, the country's largest bank, has said that an audit following its March year-end revealed that Rs6bn (Pounds 118m) in bankers' notes had not been surrendered on time by a gilts broker. It described this as an invalid transaction which had now been 'regularised'. In New Delhi Mr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, came under pressure in parliament to explain the Bombay equities slide. The country's Central Bureau of Investigation is also inquiring into the case, which has raised questions about gilts trading procedures. Stock market analysts see the decline as reflecting fears of forced selling in a number of issues where the broker was said to have built big positions. The BSE index fell 222.49 points yesterday to 3,674.41 following a plunge of 570.42 on Tuesday, the first trading session after a five-day suspension caused by a brokers' strike. At issue in the stoppage was the registration of brokers with the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the market watchdog. As prices fell, restrictions on share dealings using borrowed funds were relaxed by the authorities at the BSE, which accounts for two thirds of national share trading.</p>

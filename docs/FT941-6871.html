			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Managers see pay increase sharply Managerial pay awards rose markedly in the three months to the end of January, the first upturn in the level of managerial salary increases since the summer of 1990, Richard Donkin writes. The March issue of Incomes Data Services' Management Pay Review, which analysed salary awards in 183 groups of managerial and professional staff, says median awards rose from 2.5 per cent in the three months to October 1993 to 3 per cent in the latest period. IDS interprets the rise as an indication of 'broad stability' rather than recovery. It also says that pay increases are becoming more complex since a growing number of companies are adopting Inland Revenue approved tax-free profit-related pay schemes. Pay figures released by the Engineering Employers' Federation today show that settlements remain around 2 per cent. The average level of settlement in member companies from November to January was 2.16 per cent.</p>

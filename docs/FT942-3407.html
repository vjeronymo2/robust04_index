			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Censure for Allied Dunbar advert Allied Dunbar, the life company, has been told by the Advertising Standards Authority to withdraw an advertisement featuring a funeral because of the 'severe distress' it caused some readers. The advertisement, headlined 'Every two minutes someone dies of heart disease', pictured a burial service viewed from the bottom of a grave looking upwards, with mourners and a priest looking down. The ASA said 15 complaints were received from people who found the advertisement 'emotive, in extreme bad taste, an appeal to fear, and distressing'. Separately, the ASA upheld a complaint against Allied Dunbar over its direct mailing. The complainant objected to the continual receipt of unrequested mailings, even though he had been assured by the company that his details were on a 'no contact' list.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks ended in  failure at the 11 February Japan-U.S. summit talks. However, a  source close to the Japanese negotiators disclosed on 19  February that Japanese and American negotiators each attended  consultations the day before the summit in the belief that the  other side had made concessions, and this misunderstanding  further intensified the conflict.    According to the same source, the United States made a new  proposal which suggested not adopting any numerical targets at  the talks between Deputy Foreign Minister Koichiro Matsuura and  Bowman Cutter, deputy presidential assistant for economic  policy, on the evening of 9 February. The surprised deputy  foreign minister immediately met with negotiators from the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] and the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs and informed them "the U.S. side has  backed off [oritta]."    Nevertheless, when the U.S. side called for "aiming at a  goal" at the talks between U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata the following morning,  Hata consented in his response. As a result, the situation  further changed.    While the Japanese side took "a goal" simply to mean  "accord," Representative Kantor took it as "numerical targets"  and believed that "the Japanese side had backed off." Thus, the  two cabinet members "confirmed" that the other side had made  concessions. Therefore, meetings on three sectors -- government  procurement, insurance, and automobiles and auto parts -- were  resumed at the vice-ministerial level.    However, neither Japan nor the United States indicated any  sign of making concessions. Maintaining that the Cutter  proposal of the previous evening was merely a private plan, the  U.S. side refused to talk about it. To make matters worse, the  U.S. side threatened that "since the Japanese economic stimulus  package seems rather insufficient, an expression of  `disappointment' would be included in the part connected with  macroeconomic issues in any joint statement issued." After the  consultations, Japanese officials in charge of talks on these  three sectors looked at each other in dumb amazement, saying it  was quite a different story.    The actual situation now indicates that while the U.S. side  has intensified its offensive against Japan following the summit  talks, Japan is quite at a loss as to how the framework talks  can be resumed.    Sources connected with the Japanese negotiators have  complained: "We are not sure at which point things went wrong,  but we certainly did miss a very good opportunity."</p>

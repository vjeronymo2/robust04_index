Subsequent to the advance of funds, H&amp;V was advised that the transaction might constitute a prohibited transaction under section 406 of the Act and section 4975 of the Code. H&amp;V therefore took immediate action in an attempt to put the Plan in the position in which it would have been had the transaction not occurred. The Committee determined that under the Vanguard GICs, funds could be transferred at that time without penalties to participants. Allocations to the GIC Fund made by participants in September and October, 1992 were applied, together with a partial liquidation principally of the Vanguard Fixed Rate Trust II&hyph;91, to repay to H&amp;V the amount that had been advanced to the Plan. Specifically, $163,548 was repaid to H&amp;V on November 10, 1992, and $24,452 was retained by the Plan and used as an offset for contributions which would have otherwise been made by H&amp;V.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Under the terms of the Plan, the amounts repaid to H&amp;V would have been invested in the open GICs held in the GIC Fund, had the Loan not been made. The money that was in the GIC Fund prior to the Loan remained in the GIC Fund because it could not be transferred out without penalty. Thus, the subsequent allocations could be used to repay the Loan to H&amp;V, and the GIC Fund remained in the same position it would have been in had the Loan by H&amp;V not been made. The entire effect of the Loan and repayment to H&amp;V was thus to provide liquidity to the GIC Fund in order to make transfers to other investment funds as directed by participants. The transaction was corrected within 90 days. No interest or other expense was paid by the Plan. Participants who did not transfer amounts from the GIC Fund as of the July 1, 1992 change date continued to receive the same return on their investment in the Fund. Participants who later invested in the GIC Fund received the same return they would have received if the subject transaction had not occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. In summary, the applicant represents that the subject transaction satisfied the criteria contained in section 408(a) of the Act for the following reasons: (a) The Loan enabled the Plan to effect the transfer of amounts held in participant Accounts without penalty to new investments made available under the Plan; (b) Accounts transferred from the GIC Fund were credited with amounts representing the allocable principal deposit in the fund plus accrued interest at the Fund rate; (c) Accounts which remained invested in the GIC Fund continued to receive interest at the same rate; (d) no interest or other expense was incurred by the Plan with respect to the Loan; (e) the applicant undid the Loan as soon as it realized that the Loan constituted a prohibited transaction, with repayment of the loan taking place within 90 days of the making of the Loan; and (f) repayment of the loan was restricted to amounts held in or allocated to the GIC Fund, and no other Plan assets were used for that purpose.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Gary H.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Istanbul, June 9 (XINHUA) -- The ministerial meeting  of the North Atlantic Council (NAC) adopted here today a policy  framework on preventing proliferation of weapons of mass  destruction (WMD).    The adoption was made at the end of the one-day NATO foreign  ministers meeting which were attended by 16 NATO member states.    The NAC said that major political changes on the European  continent following the break-up of the former Soviet Union also  have potential proliferation implications that required close  attention.    It added that a number of states on the periphery of the  alliance continue in their attempts to develop or acquire the  capability to produce WMD and their delivery means or to acquire  illegally such systems.    "Similarly, the growth of indigenously developed WMD-related  technology has also made proliferation more difficult to  control," the NAC said.    "In addition, there is the risk that a proliferator might  seek to profit or gain political benefit by selling WMD and  their delivery means, relevant technology and expertise," stated  the meeting.    The NAC agreed that current international efforts focused on  the prevention of WMD and missile proliferation through a range  of international treaties and regimes.    The most important normsetting treaties are the nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), the Chemical Weapons Convention  (CWC) and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC).    It pointed out that the BTWC can be strengthened through  efforts in the field of transparency and verification.    It also added that the allies furthermore supported other  relevant efforts in the field of non-proliferation and arms  control.    "The alliance policy on proliferation is aimed at  supporting,  reinforcing and complementing, not at duplicating or  substituting the aforementioned treaties and regimes," the NAC  said.</p>

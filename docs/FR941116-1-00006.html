			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would require checking the part and serial number on the data plate of each GCU to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify discrepant units, and conducting closed loop tests on affected GCU's to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the setting of the underfrequency trip level. The proposed AD would also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require either adjusting the underfrequency trip level or replacing the discrepant GCU  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a serviceable unit, and conducting post assembly testing. The actions would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 43 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed AD, that it would take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be $2,580, or $60 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in the Rules Docket.

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Jaguar to shed a further 650 workers JAGUAR, Ford's luxury cars subsidiary, is seeking to shed a further 650 jobs this year, reducing its total UK workforce to about 7,400. The move comes against the background of heavy financial losses at Jaguar and a continuing slump in luxury car markets. It is on top of 4,000 job losses at the company last year. A Jaguar spokesman said last night the company hoped to achieve most if not all of this year's reduction through an early retirement scheme, with the age threshold for eligibility reduced from 60 to 55. Negotiations on this scheme are being held with unions, which are not expected to launch any large campaign against further cuts. The latest cuts prompted Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEU engineering union, to warn that the motor industry 'can't take much more of this depression and this government's mismanagement of the economy'. Estimates from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show a total of 70,000 motor-industry jobs lost, or likely to be lost, by the middle of this year since the start of the recession. Jaguar is believed to want to achieve the reductions as quickly as possible and may impose redundancies if not enough volunteers come forward. Last year fewer than 300 of the job cuts were imposed. About 800 Jaguar workers would qualify for early retirement under the lower age limit. The company's management is understood to be hoping that up to 500 workers will apply quickly. Jaguar made a pre-tax loss last year of Pounds 226m compared with a Pounds 66.2m loss in 1990. Two leading washing-machine manufacturers yesterday announced plans to lay off 2,600 workers in Wales. Hotpoint is to lay off 1,600 workers at plants at Llandudno Junction, Gwynedd, and Bodelwyddan, Clwyd, for two weeks next month. Hoover will lay off 1,000 workers at its Merthyr Tydfil plant, south Wales, for two weeks from March 2.</p>

"We believe that the dispute has lost actuality at all. Now  the 'Partnership for Peace' plan has been adopted and we believe  that its implementation will give us a lot of work at least for  the foreseeable future", he told a press conference on Saturday  after meeting Foreign Minister of the Czech Republic Josef  Zieleniec.    Both Russia and the Czech Republic have to implement the  plan  first and then think what to do next, according to Kozyrev.    "We believe that NATO is an organisation with which it is  necessary to cooperate. But NATO is only one of such  organisations. There are also the European Union, the CIS, the  Visegrad group. That is why we are discussing how to use all  these organisations, how to meet the challenges which none of  them, including NATO and the CSCE, are ready to meet so far",  Kozyrev said.    The Russian minister admitted that certain differences in  the  positions of the two sides do exist, but they are caused "not by  a head-on collision of interests, but rather by the complexity  of problems which are to be jointly solved."    "It was in this spirit that the issues of ensuring European  security, including the crises in Bosnia and other hot spots,  were discussed", Kozyrev said.    Zieleniec stressed that Russia had met with understanding  the  position of the Czech Republic about its integration into  European structures.    He added that remaining bilateral problems, including  financial issues, would be soon solved and that it is necessary  to accelerate the preparations of a visit of the prime minister  of the Czech Republic to Moscow.</p>

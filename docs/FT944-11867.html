			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Cabinet forced to cancel Post Office sell-off: Heseltine 'dismayed' after defeat by rebel Tory backbenchers The government's legislative programme was in disarray yesterday after the cabinet cancelled Post Office privatisation in the face of implacable opposition from a handful of Conservative backbenchers. After weeks of uncertainty, ministers accepted warnings from Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip, that at least eight Tory backbenchers would vote against a privatisation bill, ensuring its defeat in the Commons. The decision was greeted with dismay by the Post Office, which has campaigned hard for greater commercial freedom. Mr Michael Heron, chairman, said the corporation faced 'crippling uncertainty' about its future. The cabinet retreat was a severe blow for Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who was forced to admit that last-minute attempts to find a compromise were doomed to failure. He admitted: 'I have no idea how we are going to move forward from where we are now. That is the problem we now have to address.' Mr Heseltine also lost a cabinet battle with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who blocked a fall-back position that would have given the Post Office substantial commercial freedom within the public sector. Mr Clarke, a strong supporter of privatisation, refused to accept changes to the Treasury's borrowing rules for state-owned companies which would be needed to remove financial controls from the Post Office. Mr Heseltine said it was a 'sad day' for Royal Mail, the Post Office's letter delivery subsidiary, which faces growing competition from private companies and overseas post offices. 'I find it extremely distressing to see Royal Mail having its markets eaten into by American and Australian multinational transportation companies. I'm depressed by the fact that the Dutch and the Germans are moving into private capital in their postal services,' he said. The climbdown leaves an embarrassing gap at the centre of the government's legislative programme for the next session of parliament, which will be announced in the Queen's Speech on November 16. Ministers pointed to Mr Heseltine's proposed bill to deregulate the domestic gas market as a substitute centrepiece, but rightwingers claimed the retreat as evidence that the government has lost its way. The only other surprise in the government's legislative programme of about a dozen bills is expected to be a disabled rights bill. Other key measures will include bills to equalise pensions, tighten unemployment benefit rules, and increase contributions to the European Union. Downing Street said that efforts to increase the Post Office's efficiency and competitiveness would continue. The most likely changes include investment in automation, and more contracts with private sector companies to increase services such as bill paying. Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the decision was 'a massive rebuff for the government and a personal humiliation for Michael Heseltine'. Mr Alan Johnson, general secretary of the UCW communications union, said privatisation 'has finally bitten the dust, never to rear its ugly head again'.

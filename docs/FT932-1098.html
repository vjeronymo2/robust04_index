			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Deficit bill inches through Senate THE US Senate yesterday moved slowly but inexorably towards passing the Democratic majority's version of President Bill Clinton's Dollars 500bn (Pounds 333.3bn) five-year deficit reduction plan. In the morning, interrupting a debate conspicuous for its partisan theatrical rhetoric, the Democrats beat back, on a 50-48 vote, a last-ditch Republican attempt to kill the proposed increase of 4.3 cents a gallon in fuel taxes. On Wednesday night, a hastily cobbled together Republican alternative deficit package was defeated 55-43. There was one defection from the party line on each side: Senators Richard Shelby, the Democrat from Alabama, who invariably votes against his own party, and James Jeffords, the independent-minded moderate Republican from Vermont. The Republican proposal claimed to be able to achieve the same budgetary goal without any tax increases. It would have capped spending on federal entitlement programmes and frozen most other disbursements at current levels. Mr Leon Panetta, budget director, denounced it as a step backward to 'trickle-down economics' that rides 'to the rescue of wealthy Americans in the country and sacrifices the middle class in the process'. Democratic causes did not emerge unscathed. Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, had to accept defeat of his amendment to restore some Dollars 3.6bn in tax breaks for small businesses. Four Democratic Senators joined the Republican minority to deny it the three-fifths majority required, but Mr Mitchell said he would introduce another variation. Liberal Democrats were also intent on forcing a vote on an amendment reducing the scale of the proposed cuts in Medicare payments, and claimed some support from Mr Clinton. Even if they do not succeed in the Senate round, a compromise between the Senate and House bills may ultimately achieve their goal. The White House remained cautiously optimistic the bill would pass. Vice President Al Gore, who is also Senate chairman, was on hand to cast any necessary deciding vote. Mr Clinton himself was reported to be diligently working the phones from the Oval Office.</p>

These procedures are drawn up in accordance with  the "Provisions of the State Council on the Work Hours of  Workers and Staff Members."    Article 2. These procedures shall apply to workers and staff  members in all organs, mass organizations, enterprises, and  institutions (including enterprises under various single-mode or  forms of mixed economic ownership such as state-owned,  collectively owned, privately run, individually run,  foreign-funded, and Chinese-foreign joint-funded enterprises, as  well as mines, factories; construction, communications and  transportation, logging, farming, and commercial organizations;  service entities; scientific research and design, and cultural  and sports organizations; and medical and public health  services, institutes of higher learning, middle and elementary  schools, and kindergartens) on the PRC's territory.    Article 3. While ensuring the completion of their production  tasks and work without increasing personnel and spending, a  system of work hours consisting of eight hours each day for a  weekly average of 44 work hours shall be implemented among  workers and staff members.    Article 4. All units shall implement the provisions step by  step with plans and strengthen their management. They shall not  let the implementation of the 44-hour work week affect their  economic performance, nor shall they reduce the salaries of  their workers and staff members.    Article 5. The work hours of workers and staff members  working under extraordinary conditions or those whose  circumstances are special may be further shortened appropriately  in accordance with relevant provisions of the State Council or  its principal labor and personnel departments. To shorten the  work hours of workers and staff members of enterprises and  institutions directly under the central authorities, principal  departments shall verify the need to do so and shall submit  reports to the State Council's labor and personnel ministries  for approval. For workers and staff members of local  enterprises and institutions, local principal departments shall  verify the need and shall submit reports to local labor and  personnel departments for approval to shorten the work hours.    Article 6. When it is found unsuitable to adopt a fixed  work-hour system for workers and staff members because of  restrictions in the nature of work and duties, an irregular  work-hour system may be implemented with the approval of the  relevant State Council labor and personnel departments.    Article 7. No units shall extend the work hours of workers  and staff members under normal situations aside from the  following:    (1) Work in production, transportation, or operations that  must be continued during statutory festivals and public holidays;    (2) Instances of equipment repair and maintenance that must  be carried out during statutory festivals and public holidays  when production is stopped;    (3) Emergency repairs that must be carried out because of  sudden breakdowns in production equipment, communications and  transportation facilities, and public utilities;    (4) Emergency relief work that must be carried out because  of severe natural or other disasters that seriously threaten the  people's safety and health as well as state property;    (5) Emergency production tasks for the national defense or  other emergency production tasks allocated by superiors that  must be completed along with state programs, as well as  emergency tasks of commercial and marketing enterprises in  purchasing, transportation, and agricultural and sideline  products processing to be undertaken during peak seasons.    Article 8. The powers for verifying and approving the  extended work hours of workers and staff members under the  aforementioned situations shall be studied and determined by  provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal people's  governments as well as by various State Council principal  departments.    Article 9. Enterprise units shall implement the 44-hour  average work-week system. They may exchange the two half-day  rest days of two fortnights for a rest day according to the  specific situation.    Article 10. State organs, enterprise units, and mass  organizations shall from the effective date of the provisions on  1 March 1994 uniformly designate the Saturday and Sunday of the  first week and the Sunday of the second week as rest days  nationwide. The cycle shall continue and shall not be  restricted by months and years. Personnel may be placed on duty  on rest days according to the needs of their work.    Article 11. Individual professions and enterprises that  truly have difficulty in implementing the 44-hour work-week  system from 1 March 1994 may appropriately defer doing so, but  not later than 1 May 1994.    Article 12. Labor and personnel departments at all levels  shall supervise the implementation of the provisions. They  shall accordingly penalize units and individuals who violate the  provisions by forcing workers and staff members to work extended  hours.    Article 13. Based on these procedures, provincial,  autonomous regional, and municipal people's governments may draw  up rules of implementation.    Article 14. The Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of  Personnel shall be responsible for interpreting these provisions  within the scope of their respective duties.    Article 15. These procedures shall take effect on 1 March  1994.</p>

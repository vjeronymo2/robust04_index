			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Gatt chief answers critics Mr Peter Sutherland, the director general of Gatt, has said that the idea that the recently concluded Gatt agreement would erode national sovereignty was 'absolute nonsense' and that such sentiments must not be allowed to undermine the accord, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur. Some members of the US Congress have said that a new World Trade Organisation (WTO), to be set up next year, will be like an 'economic United Nations' in which the US could be outvoted by smaller countries. Mr Sutherland, in Kuala Lumpur to attend a meeting of business leaders from around the Pacific, said it would be an act of the greatest folly if the recently concluded agreement was to be questioned in this way. 'By any stretch of the imagination, sovereignty is not at issue. The WTO will not be an instrument of world government. It will in no way inhibit sovereignty.' Mr Sutherland said there was an urgent need for countries including the US to ratify the Gatt agreement.</p>

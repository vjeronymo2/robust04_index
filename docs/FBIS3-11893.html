This information was  announced yesterday by Telebras [Brazilian Telecommunications  Inc.] President Adyr da Silva during a briefing before the  National Defense Committee of the Chamber of Deputies.    This Brazilian project seeks to resist an onslaught by  foreign companies, especially that by Motorola, which is casting  its net wide in search of partners for its $4-billion  megaproject called Iridium, which seeks to surround the earth  with a network of telephone communications satellites. Brazil  was not impressed with Iridium because of its high cost and the  impossibility of having a say in its development. Therefore, it  sought its own alternative.    This project, which has been called Eco-8, will only cost  $265 million and will consist of an uplink to eight satellites  orbiting the equator at a height of 2,000 km. It will enable  telephone communications from any point of the country.  Explaining that this technology will permit communications even  in non-cost-effective regions, Da Silva noted: "This is no  dream; it is our objective."    Beside telephone communications, the satellite network will  make possible communications by fax, location by radio,  telemetry, border control, and rural telephony, among other  things. The technology to develop this project is almost  entirely available on the Brazilian market and the domestic  industry has the know-how to manufacture the equipment. Even  the launching of the satellites can be achieved with a domestic  rocket from the Alcantara Base in Maranhao State.    The only problem is the range of the Brazilian rocket, since  it is still unable to reach a height of 2,000 km. Da Silva said  that if this is not possible by then, the satellites can be put  into a lower orbit, although this will leave 25 percent of the  territory without coverage. The domestic satellites  manufactured by the National Institute of Space Research (INPE)  will be used to test some of the systems of the Eco-8 project.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The results of two separate surveys examining voter  preferences for next year's election show that the African  National Congress (ANC) is going to win by a wide margin--with  the National Party (NP) coming in second. A poll conducted by  Integrated Market Research (IMR) for THE SUNDAY TIMES found that  the ANC can garner up to 60 percent support in contrast to a  meager 13 percent for the NP--with the Freedom Alliance coming  in right behind at 11.5 percent.    Mr. Donald Simpson, an independent election analyst,  projected for RAPPORT that the ANC could get 57.10 percent of  the votes, the NP 15.51 percent, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP)  9.22 percent, the CP [Conservative Party] 4.10 percent, the DP  [Democratic Party] 4.00 percent, the Afrikaner People's Union  (AVU) 0.30 percent, the Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] 5.23  percent, and regional parties 3.30 percent.    According to the IMR, support among black people for the NP  has decreased drastically. Less than 2 percent of them will vote  for the party, while support for it has declined to 40 percent  among whites. A large segment of the colored and Indian  community, where the NP is campaigning heavily, is still  uncertain as to how it will vote, however. According to one of  the polls, the ANC will not achieve the two-thirds majority  necessary to change the constitution. The predictions are  causing concern to the NP and Inkatha even though there are six  months to go to the election. According to constitutional  provisions, they will only be junior partners in the government.  The rest of the parties are doing hopelessly poorly.    In accordance with constitutional provisions, the ANC, with  its predicted support, will get 19 posts in the 30-member  cabinet. It will also be able to designate a president and vice  president and will thus have a two-thirds majority in the  cabinet. Accordingly, President F.W. de Klerk will be the second  vice president with an additional four posts for the NP. The  Freedom Alliance will also be able to occupy four posts.    The survey was conducted among 2,200 people nationwide and  the margin of error is 4 percent. According to Mr. Simpson, the  parties could end up with the following seats in the National  Assembly: ANC 229, NP 66, IFP 37, CP 17, DP 16, AVU 1, regional  parties 13, and the PAC 21. He also predicts that the Northern  and Western Cape are the only two regions where the NP could win  easily.</p>

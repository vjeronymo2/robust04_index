Land supervision credentials are uniformly made by the State  Land Administration Bureau and issued by the people's  governments at the county level or above.    Chapter III -- The Jurisdiction, Filing, and Handling of  Cases Involving Violations of the Land Law    Article 13. Cases involving violations of the land law refer  to those that violate the land administration laws, rules, and  regulations, the legal responsibility for which should be  investigated and determined according to the law.    Article 14. The provincial land administration department is  responsible for the province's land supervision work, and it  administers the following cases in this administrative area:    1. Cases involving violations of the land law which go  beyond city or county administrative area;    2.

Cases involving violations of the land law which are  commissioned by the provincial people's government or the State  Land Administration Bureau.    Article 15.

Article 16. Township (town) people's governments are  responsible for handling illegal occupations of land by  residents in their administrative areas.    Article 17. A higher-level land administration department  has the right to handle cases involving violations of the land  law which come under the jurisdiction of a lower-level land  administration department. It also can turn over to a  lower-level land administrative department any cases involving  violations of the land law which come under its jurisdiction so  that these cases can be handled.    If a lower-level land administration department holds that a  case under its jurisdiction involves violations of the land law  which are so serious that the case should be administered by a  higher-level land administration department, it may submit the  case to a higher- level land administration department for  handling.    Article 18. In accepting and hearing a case, it is necessary  to fill in an "Application To Put on Record a Case Involving  Violations of the Land Law." On approval, the case will be put  on file for investigation and prosecution.    Conditions for accepting and hearing a case:    1. Have a definite actor;    2. Have facts on violations of the land administration laws,  rules, and regulations;    3. A case that should be investigated and the responsibility  determined according to the land administration laws, rules, and  regulations;    4. A case over which the department has jurisdiction.    With regard to a major, complex case, it is necessary to  send  a duplicate copy to a higher-level land administration  department for the record after the case has been put on file.    If, on examination, a case does not have the necessary  conditions for being placed on file or does not come under the  jurisdiction of this unit, it is necessary to inform the  complainant in writing.    Article 19. After a case involving violations of the land  law is placed on file, it is necessary to determine promptly no  fewer than two handlers. For major, complex cases, a  case-handling team may be set up.    If a case handler or relevant leader has conflicts of  interest with the case or has other relationships with the  interested parties and is likely to affect the fair handling of  the case, he should avoid handling the case.    Whether a case handler or a relevant leader responsible for  a  case should avoid handling the case, it is for the relevant  leader responsible for the case to determine the former, and for  the higher-level land administration department or people's  government at the same level to determine the latter.    Article 20. The land administration department should notify  the actor within three days after the case is put on file, and  the latter may express his view in writing within five days  after receiving the notification. It will not affect the  investigation and handling of the case if an actor does not  express his view within the prescribed time.    Article 21. In handling a case involving violations of the  land law, a handler should complete his work within 30 days  after the case is put on file. If, owing to special  circumstances, the case cannot be wound up as scheduled, with  the approval of the relevant competent leader the deadline may  be extended appropriately, but it should not be more than one  month.    Article 22. If, through investigation, a case cannot be  established as in violation of the law, it should be revoked.  When a case is revoked, it is necessary to submit a report to  the relevant leader for approval and to notify the actor and the  complainant in writing.    Article 23. If a complainant considers it wrong not to put a  case on file or to revoke a case, he may apply within five days  pf receiving the notification to a higher-level land  administration department for a re-examination. Within 30 days  of receiving the application for re-examination, the  higher-level land administration department should made a  re-examination decision and pass the decision to the complainant  and to the land administration department which had not put the  case on file or had decided to revoke the case.    Article 24. If, through investigation, the land  administration department establishes the existence of  violations of the law, it should promptly issue a "Notice  Calling For Discontinuation of Violations of the Land Law" to  the interested party or parties.    Article 25. After ending its investigation and hearing,  the case handler should submit a "Report on Investigating and  Hearing Case Involving Violations of the Land Law" to the land  administration department, which handles the case according to  different circumstances:    1. If, after investigation, the violations of the land law  are proven true and should be subject to disciplinary sanctions  according to the law, the land administration department is to  issue a "Written Ruling on Disciplinary Sanctions Against  Violations of the Land Law";    2. If a case is established as infringing on land  proprietorship or use rights, the land administration department  is to issue a "Written Ruling on the Handling of Land  Infringement Conduct." The written ruling should be delivered  to the interested party or parties.    Article 26. After completing the handling of a case, the  case handler should fill in a "Report on Closing Case Involving  Violations of the Land Law" which, on approval by the competent  leader, should be catalogued with the documents, charts, and  pictures collected in the course of handling the case, bound  together, and placed on file.    After a major, complex case -- or one commissioned by the  higher authorities -- is completed, it is necessary to submit  the following documents to the higher-level land administration  department for the record:    1. A "Written Ruling on Disciplinary Sanctions Against Cases  Involving Violations of the Land Law";    2. A "Written Ruling on the Handling of Land Infringement  Conduct";    3. A "Report on Closing Case Involving Violations of the  Land Law."    With regard to a case reconsidered by an organ or heard by a  people's court, it is necessary to attach the duplicate copy of  the written ruling on reconsideration or the duplicate copy of  the written ruling of the people's court.    Article 27. With regard to personnel who should be given  disciplinary sanctions according to the law, the land  administrative department is to make a recommendation on  disciplinary sanctions to the unit in which he works or to the  higher-level organ and the administrative and supervision organ.    A duplicate copy of the ruling on disciplinary sanctions  made  by the unit or the higher-level organ and the administrative  supervision organ should be sent to the land administration  department making the recommendation.    Article 28. In the course of handling a case involving  violations of the land law, if the land administration  department establishes that the violations constitute a crime,  it should promptly turn over the case to a judicial organ for  investigation and determination of criminal responsibility.    Article 29. If an interested party refuses to accept the  disciplinary sanctions, he may apply for reconsideration to a  higher-level land administration department within 15 days of  receiving the "Written Ruling on Disciplinary Sanctions Against  Cases Involving Violations of the Land Law." If the interested  party refuses to accept the reconsidered ruling, he may file a  suit with the people's court within 15 days of receiving the  written ruling. He also may file a suit directly to the  people's court within 15 days of receiving the "Written Ruling  on Disciplinary Sanctions Against Cases Involving Violations of  the Land Law." If, within the prescribed time, he neither  applies for reconsideration, nor files a suit with the people's  court, nor observes the sanctions, the land administration  department, which takes the disciplinary sanctions, is to make  an "Application for Forcible Implementation of Disciplinary  Sanctions Against Cases Involving Violations of the Land Law"  which, along with the copy of the case file, should be turned  over to the people's court for forcible implementation.    Article 30. If the interested party refuses to accept the  ruling on land infringement conduct, he may apply for  reconsideration to an organ at a higher level than the one  making the ruling within 15 days of receiving the "Written  Ruling on the Handling of Land Infringement Conduct." If the  interested party refuses to accept the reconsidered ruling, he  may file a suit with a people's court within 15 days of  receiving the written ruling.  Chapter IV -- Rewards and Punishments    Article 31 Units or individuals conforming to one of the  following conditions are to be commended or rewarded by the  people's government or the land administration department:    1. Those scoring marked achievements in implementing land  administration laws, rules, and regulations;    2. Those scoring marked achievements in developing,  utilizing, and protecting land;    3. Those scoring outstanding achievements in land  supervision work;    4. Those scoring marked achievements in informing against,  exposing, and curbing violations of the land law.    Article 32. Land supervision personnel who, in the course of  investigating and handling violations of the land law, practice  favoritism or fraud in violation of the law, neglect duties, or  abuse power, will be given disciplinary sanctions by the  competent department. If this constitutes a crime, criminal  responsibility will be investigated and determined according to  the law.    Article 33. A person who refuses or obstructs land  supervision personnel from executing their duties according to  the law will be dealt with by the public security organ  according to the provisions of the "PRC Security Administration  Punishment Act."

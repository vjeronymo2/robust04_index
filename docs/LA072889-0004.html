			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Argentina's Peronist government will pardon more than 300 army officers who  were involved in three recent military rebellions, a Defense Ministry source  said. The source said hundreds of junior officers had faced discharges. The  uprisings took place in April, 1987, January, 1988 and December, 1988.  Nationalist officers staged the rebellions to press the government to stop  trials against military personnel accused of human rights abuses committed in  the 1970s "dirty war" against guerrillas. Defense Minister Italo Luder appeared  to confirm the government's leniency toward the lower-ranked dissidents, saying  they "were given minor disciplinary penalties and were ordered back to their  postings."  </P></p>

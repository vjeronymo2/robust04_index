Despite the fact that  it is the top brand in the commercial computer industry, Fujitsu  has to be content with a humble position behind such outshining  contenders as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi  Electric when it comes to the defense-related business. Fujitsu  has been longing for many years for the position of a "prime  contractor" because being a prime contractor empowers them to  dictate the technology.    The dwindling growth rate of the government defense budget  has been a hard blow to Fujitsu as well. The total amount of its  contract with the Defense Agency for FY93 is expected to be  about &yen;33 billion. It is a substantial drop from the peak  figure of about &yen;38 billion (FY91). However, as Norio  Nakamura, General Manager of Special Equipment System Div.,  says, "it's not bad for us that the focus of the defense budget  is shifting from the front-line equipment to the rear support  elements." With abundant experience in the computer technology,  the company can compete more favorably in the field of the rear  support elements than the front-line equipment such as fighters  and missiles. A typical case is an information communication  system called CI (Command Control Communication Intelligence).    In FY91, the company successfully attained the prime  contractor position when it got the contract to build a  nationwide information communication system called "GSDF Command  System." The project is to build the nationwide system with the  annual budget of several billion yen, starting from the Northern  Army located in Hokkaido, where Fujitsu is the leader of a group  of subcontractors including Mitsubishi Electric, NEC, Hitachi,  Toshiba, and Oki. "The ratio between front-line equipment vs.  rear support elements in the contract amounts used to be about 2  to 1 five years ago, but it is now 1 to 2," says Mr. Nakamura.    The company is at the valley of the orders for the moment.  Although it received an order for the electronic equipment to be  borne by P3C antisubmarine patrol airplane, which amounts to  &yen;500 million per set, it will not continue very long as the  implementation of the airplane will be over soon. The project  for the equipment of the ground support center for P3C (ASWOC)  to be installed at various bases starting with Atsugi and  Hachinohe, which amounted to slightly less than &yen;3 billion,  was finally completed last year when it finished the  installation at Iwakuni. The short distance surface-to-air  missile (Short SAM) project, in which Fujitsu participated as a  vendor for Toshiba, will soon be entering a remodeling period.    On the other hand, some optimistic opinions have recently  surfaced as exemplified by Mr. Nakamura's comment, "it will be  bottoming out soon." The company has accumulated a substantial  amount of technology. It recently delivered an electronic  warfare performance evaluation system for the F15  interceptor-fighter. This system installed at the Gifu Base of  ASDF at the cost of over &yen;10 billion is capable of  conducting simulated electronic warfare using an F15 hung from  the ceiling of a huge hangar. It tests the counteracting  capability against the enemy's electronic jamming. The company  is planning to propose a modification to enable it to handle the  FSX next generation support fighter.    The infrared technology is another strong point of this  company. Fujitsu is leading the world neck and neck with  Mitsubishi Electric in the development of Infrared Charged  Couple Device (IRCCD) which is used for detecting the quantity  of infrared rays emitted by any object, in other words, the  temperature difference. The infrared night vision device using  the JRCCD technology it developed is expected to be used on the  OHX next generation small size helicopter for GSDF. It is  assumed that approximately 180 OHX helicopters will be purchased  eventually, so that this infrared night vision device costing  about &yen;50 million will be a stable source of business for  the company.    According to a source at the Defense Agency, "the only area  where Japanese defense industry can compete against the leading  defense industries of the world may be the information software  and the cutting edge semiconductor technology." Now that the  time where tanks and airplanes are the leading roles is over,  the "dark horse" Fujitsu is ready to advance to the front row.</p>

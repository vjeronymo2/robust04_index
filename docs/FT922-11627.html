			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: Nippon Mining to assist US subsidiary NIPPON Mining, the Japanese non-ferrous metals and petroleum refining group, is to provide nearly Dollars 150m to help Gould, its debt-ridden US subsidiary, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The assistance, to be given to the US copper foil maker by the end of 1992, will be used to repay part of Gould's debts and improve its production and research facilities. The Japanese group aims to ease the burden of the unprofitable subsidiary ahead of the merger of Nippon Mining with Kyodo Oil in December. After the merger, Gould will become a subsidiary of the combined company, Nikko Kyoseki. Nippon Mining acquired Gould in 1988. Nippon Mining expects Gould to post group net losses of Dollars 180m for 1991. Gould's long-term and short-term debts came to Dollars 900m as of the end of 1991. Nippon Mining forecasts group pre-tax losses of Y500m (Dollars 3.73m) for the year ended March, mainly due to Gould's poor performance. It had group pre-tax profits of Y14.88bn in the previous year.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Positive factors and bargain hunting lift Nikkei Tokyo INSTITUTIONAL and foreign bargain hunting and positive fundamentals enabled the Nikkei average to post a small gain yesterday in arbitrage-dominated trading after five consecutive losses, writes Neil Weinberg in Tokyo. The Nikkei closed 78.27 up at 21,775.13 after a day's high of 22,019.94 and a low of 21,662.99. The market fell 3.1 per cent the previous day. Volume came to 180m shares after Monday's 176m. The overall tendency was easier, however, declines leading rises by 530 to 384 with 185 issues unchanged, and 170 shares hitting lows for the year. The Topix index of all first section stocks improved 4.56 to 1,624.40 after finishing at the lowest level since the beginning of 1991 on Monday. In London trading the ISE/Nikkei 50 index picked up 5.79 to 1,232.72. Japanese markets are closed today for a public holiday. The market managed to fend off early declines in spite of a narrowing of the spread between cash and futures prices as the plunge in recent sessions enticed buyers. Prices also received support from lower interest rates, strength in the over-the-counter and bond markets and the yen's afternoon rally. Traders nevertheless warned that the investment trust selling which has prompted recent sell-offs has not diminished, and that the market could face further losses prior to March-end book closings. Petroleum shares firmed on overnight strength abroad, with Nippon Oil putting on Y15 to Y870. Financials also staged a rebound after recent sharp losses, Fuji Bank rising Y100 to Y2,290 and Yamaichi Securities Y32 to Y708. Auto makers and electricals recovered lost ground as well. Toyota was up Y40 to Y1,430 and Pioneer Y90 to Y3,330. In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 52.31 to 23,198.67 on volume of 66.2m shares. Roundup THE Pacific Rim put in a mixed performance yesterday, as Hong Kong reached another all-time high. HONG KONG climbed to a new record in active trading as fund managers, reshuffling their portfolios, stocked up on laggards. There were also rumours that Sino-US talks on the protection of US intellectual property rights had reached a compromise. The Hang Seng index rose 41.70 to 4,367.61 as turnover swelled to HKDollars 1.68bn from HKDollars 1.33bn. AUSTRALIA ended lower, affected by a further decline in BHP, which lost 20 cents to ADollars 13.58. After the close, BHP announced structural changes to its steel division. The All Ordinaries index finished near the day's worst at 1,651.7, down 8.9, in turnover of ADollars 199m, against ADollars 218m. Banking shares fell on speculation that further declines in domestic interest rates were unlikely. Commonwealth Bank of Australia slipped 11 cents to ADollars 7.64 and Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking lost 10 cents to ADollars 4.74. Pacific Magazines &amp; Printing, spun off recently from News Corp, dropped 21 cents to ADollars 3.15 on a report that the underwriter had been left with a large number of the shares.

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Irish cabinet awaits fate: Government in balance as judiciary joins row THE FATE of Ireland's coalition government hung in the balance last night, as confusion surrounded an effort by a parliamentary inquiry to establish the facts at the centre of a political row between the two coalition partners.

He said that he will not be holding a special investigation into the allegations of dishonesty, but would seek to clarify the facts during the normal course of the inquiry's hearings today. Mr O'Malley said later that he 'regretted' the misunderstanding, but gave the clearest signal yet that his party would withdraw from the coalition tomorrow.

Verbal clashes in the local media between the coalition partners have continued to resound. When Mr Seamus Brennan, the education minister, defended Mr Reynolds's position on radio yesterday, Mr Michael McDowell, the chairman of the PDs, accused him of using 'weak-minded weasel words', to which Mr Brennan replied: 'I will not sit here and be insulted.'</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Arts: 'Time of my Life' - Theatre Always be wary of plays that dot about with chronology, moving backwards and forwards as the tale unfolds. There must be a suspicion that the device is used because the plot would not stand up if it were told in a straightforward way. Alan Ayckbourn's Time Of My Life, slightly tightened up since it was first performed at Scarborough last year, just about pulls it off, but immediately there is another caution. This is not the Ayckbourn who was wont to set the house upon a roar with laughter. Time Of My Life stems more from the Alan Bennett school of Talking Heads. It is a play about sad, not very well educated people who do not always understand themselves, let alone each other. The overwhelming impression is that life is hard, not comic. True, there are flashes when the old (or rather the younger) Ayckbourn is immediately identifiable. There is the wonderful part of Maureen the hairdresser, quite superbly played by Sophie Heyman. Maureen is not educated at all. She has only three books in her possession, but she can certainly be articulate. Every time Ms Heyman appears she has an even more exaggerated punk hair style. Possibly because she is the outsider, she manages to survive without undue tristesse, though it is notable that throughout the piece the women tend to be tougher than the men. The rest of the cast make up an unhappy family. The Strattons own a northern building firm which may have cut corners and is now falling on hard times. Still, Gerry Stratton - played by Anton Rodgers - is celebrating his wife's birthday in the restaurant which the family has always used and where it again assembles for the occasion. Gradually, truths come out. Gerry's wife Laura (Gwen Taylor) confesses to having had a 15 minute-fling (if that is not too strong a word) with another man in 1974 - her only infidelity in 32 years of marriage. Then there is the inquest. 'We bought single beds in August 1970,' Laura says. 'It's engraved on my memory. I remember saying to myself 'goodbye the swinging sixties'.' And perhaps, given the title, that is what the play is about. The earlier Ayckbourn was never so sombre. Even the set, confined to the northern restaurant, is designed to be drab. Gerry thinks he can drive confidently home, but is killed in a car crash; Laura survives. Being Ayckbourn, of course, there are some depths and ironies. The characters sometimes believe they are happy when they are not and claim to be honest when they are no such thing. It is not deliberate hypocrisy, but rather a tortuous muddle. The grown up Stratton children turn out to make even less of a success of their lives than their parents, possibly (remembering Philip Larkin's line about the effects of Mum and Dad) because of their parents. Some sections of the play are below standard, notably the suggestion that foreign waiters in a restaurant are funny just because they are foreign. In short, a bit of a hotch-potch. Ayckbourn directs himself. Vaudeville Theatre. (071) 836 9987</p>

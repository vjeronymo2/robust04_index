			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar by </F> unidentified reporter on 11 January; place not given -- live or  recorded]    [Excerpts] [Reporter] Prime Minister, the meeting between  representatives of the four countries of the Visegrad group and  U.S. President Bill Clinton is to begin tomorrow. In this  connection the remark made by the British Prime Minister John  Major yesterday did not come out very optimistically; in  connection with the Partnership for Peace program as well as in  connection with our possible entry into NATO, he mentioned only  Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic. This was, however, not  the first time that Slovakia has been somewhat forgotten. What  do you see as the main reason for western countries adopting  such an attitude?    [Meciar] In the case of Mr. Major, this did not amount to a  fundamental political attitude. He was merely citing countries  as an example. What was decisive for us were the discussions  which we had with the U.S. delegation last Sunday, and those  discussions were positive. They involved several important  areas. The first one was that the question is no longer of who  will join NATO. The question is only when and how. The second  fundamental question is that the United States has an interest  in the security of the Slovak Republic. It belongs to its  sphere of immediate interests and we also discussed ways of what  kind of guarantees should be given to that security. The third  important area is that the Slovak government accepts without any  reservations and comments the Partnership for Peace in the form  it has been proposed. Already today the government has  instructed ministers to set up a working commission to enable us  to be among the first ones to conclude that agreement. We are  not concerned to be the first in respect of wanting to compete  against time, or in terms of prestige. We merely want this  matter to be resolved as soon as possible. The contractual  principle will enable contractual adjustments to all relations  which are of interest to both sides. They involve both our  interest and the interest of NATO.    Furthermore, in Prague tomorrow, apart from this question,  we  will also discuss bilateral questions of Slovak-U.S. relations.  Here, too, we are interested in intensifying them. The message  Mrs Albright read out to me as the message from President  Clinton was more than encouraging.    [Reporter] Would it be possible to say at this moment that  after the recent talks with Mrs Albright our chances for gaining  entry to NATO are good?    [Meciar] They are at least as certain as Polish, Hungarian,  and the Czech Republic. They are not worse.    [Reporter] Prime Minister, this is in effect your first  interview for the media this year. I would therefore like to  ask you what the government's working program will look like  this year.    [Meciar] The government will devote itself to fundamental  problems in 1994. [passage omitted] It is necessary to focus on  practical problems and not on questions of who is against whom  and who will triumph over whom. The outcome then will be  commensurate with what we want to achieve. Parties which will  want to cooperate with us will find partners in us.    [Reporter] Another meeting of the parliament is approaching.  It is rumored that apart from the proposal to dismiss Minister  Hofbauer, the opposition is again gathering support to force a  vote of no confidence in the government. It has been even  reported in the press today that Mr. Cernak [chairman of the  Slovak National Party] has been having talks with some  representatives of the Hungarian political parties in this  connection. Are you aware of these attempts, and how do you  assess them?    [Meciar] To force a vote of no confidence in the government,  it is necessary to secure 76 votes in the parliament. If they  are gathered, then the vote of no confidence will succeed. I  regard this, however, as hardly probable. Talks between  political parties about when and how to overthrow the government  have been going on for several months even in the highest  places. This is borne out by the call made by Mr. President on  1 January 1994 which I regard as very unfortunate and  inappropriate.    As regard circumstances determining political peace --  everyone has to know what he or she wants to provoke. There is  no other alternative to the government. It would be simple to  drive the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia into opposition but  who would then form a constructive government? To provoke  elections may mean for those who are sowing the wind at present  that they will not be in the next parliament. Decision making  in this respect is therefore relatively complicated.    I regard privatization issue as being the key problem that  will face the January plenary session of the parliament. The  Party of the Democratic Left has made certain proposals that  would lead to a system that would be akin to Treuhand used by  the Federal Republic of Germany, in its eastern part, which I  regard as rather unfortunate and inappropriate for the Slovak  economy and economic policy. We shall therefore have to discuss  it to ensure that the matter is resolved if possible before the  parliament meets.    [Reporter] It has been rumored that a certain tension is  prevailing in the government. It has been specifically rumored  that Vice Premier Roman Kovac and minister Moravcik may be  dismissed. Can you either confirm or reject these reports?    [Meciar] Two conditions must be met if they are to be  dismissed from their posts, either the parliament forces a vote  of no confidence in them and I know nothing about it, or the  premier will propose their dismissal and I also know nothing  about it.    [Reporter] The recent Saturday meeting in Komarno is still,  so to say, a hot issue. What is the government's stance to the  results of this meeting?    [Meciar] Roman Kovac, as the first deputy premier in charge  of minorities issues, is authorized to take stance on behalf of  the government.    As for the Komarno meeting, it has to be perceived from  several points of views, and the possibility of assessing it  varies accordingly. It begins by assessing the declaration  which continues in a pressure system calling for a certain  arrangement that would eventually stop, and ends by assessing  the definitive goal, the secession [sentence as received]. This  is already an area where such statements and political interests  come into conflict with the constitution.    The territorial set-up must be perceived from a broader  perspective, not merely as a set-up determined by the language.  [passage omitted]    We need to build the republic on the principle of civic  solidarity and not on the language principle. [passage omitted]    It is important that citizens of Hungarian origin distanced  themselves from those who think that they can speak on behalf of  all. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] Does it mean that you consider the results of the  Komarno meeting to be legitimate and that you are going to  discuss this issue or that you are going to deal with it in a  more systematic way?    [Meciar] I am not going to discuss the integrity of the  Slovak Republic's territory and its division, or steps that  could lead to the violation of this territory, with anybody.  There is nothing to discuss. This is a topic that will not be  discussed with me.    As for the demands that are related to some of the  requirements regarding the state administration, there can be an  opinion on small districts [obvod] that are to be be defined  within the territorial set-up. However, no ethnic principle  will be applied in Slovakia. It is not possible for us to force  somebody from Medzibrodie to travel to Komarno to get his  planning permission, and lose two days just because of that.  That is absolutely unworkable. There are also a number of  other activities that cannot be carried out in this way.    To summarize, the territorial set-up being drafted by the  government reflects the historical development of Slovakia. It  reflects either the large counties [zupa] after Czechoslovakia  was established or the territorial set-up that was in force here  until 1960-61, or -- in the event that they are not satisfied,  there is the danger of returning to three large regions  [sentence as heard]. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] Thank you for the interview.</p>

These forays will include allowing private companies to  introduce commercial loans for investment in facilities and  granting massive tax breaks to participating companies, an  official at the Economic Planning Board [EPB] said.    At the same time, participating companies belonging to the  30  largest business groups will be exempted from the application of  intricate rules of investment ceiling stipulated in the Monopoly  Regulation and Fair Trade Act for up to 30 years, the EPB said.    The EPB said these incentives will be contained in a new  draft bill now in the making. It is learned that the government  is due to complete the formation of the bill by this weekend and  the bill will go before the Democratic Liberal Party-controlled  National Assembly for legislation.    Officials said these incentives will be effective in  encouraging private companies to take part in the expansion of  social overhead capital projects.    Specifically, allowing private companies to introduce  low-interest commercial loans for their investments in  facilities will boost corporate eagerness to take part in the  expansion of social overhead capital, the officials said.    With regard to tax reductions, the government is allegedly  planning to cut acquisition, registration and corporate taxes.    The government has been preparing legislation to give the  private sector greater incentives to invest in public-works  projects in its belief that government spending alone is unable  to offer a clear-cut solution to the looming shortage of  infrastructure. [passage omitted]    In the past, the government had sought to encourage private  companies to invest in infrastructure but withdrew its plan in  the face of strong criticism about any "special favors" for the  large business conglomerates known as chaebol.    Conglomerates, for their parts, were also reluctant to get  involved in taking part in infrastructure projects as the  government didn't allow them to charge sufficient tolls to  recoup their investments.    This time, however, the government appears more aggressive.  "The government is mulling substantial incentives for  participants to ensure returns on their investments which were  hardly expected under the past regime," an EPB official said.    Under the new law, companies will be given more freedom to  levy tolls and rents from the public-sector projects in order to  help them recover their investments more easily.    They may also be allowed to build leisure and tourist  facilities alongside the roads or railways to attract more users.</p>

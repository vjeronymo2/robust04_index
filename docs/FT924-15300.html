			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Workers' rights to be tested in court A CHALLENGE to the government's interpretation of a European Community directive on workers' employment rights after takeovers begins in the High Court today. Natfhe, the lecturers' union, says the law should be changed to prevent organisations that acquire public-sector bodies from dismissing workers or imposing inferior pay and conditions. The union says UK law breaches the directive, as the law does not require employers to honour the employment contracts they inherit when acquiring non-profit-making organisations. Contracts must be honoured when one organisation takes over another in the private sector, and Natfhe argues that the rules should protect all workers. The government - under pressure from the European Commission - has agreed to add an amendment to its planned employment bill, due in the next parliamentary session, to extend equal protection to all workers. The Commission is also preparing to take the British government to the European Court of Justice. Natfhe is continuing with the judicial review proceedings, which affect 50,000 lecturers in polytechnics, because Employment Department officials are unable to announce the changes publicly before parliament debates them. The lecturers will face new employers next year when polytechnics move out of local-authority control in their switch to independent college corporations. The Local Government Management Board calculates that councils have lost almost 20,000 jobs since 1987 as a result of compulsory competitive tendering. A further 2,000 are expected to be removed from direct employment by March next year Many workers have been re-hired by private contractors on worse terms and conditions. The EC Commission has argued for five years that the UK rules breach the directive. Natfhe will also argue that employers must consult workers' representatives before any transfer of ownership.</p>

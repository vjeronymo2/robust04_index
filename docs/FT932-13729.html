			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Letter highlights Labour fears on housing benefit FUTURE arrangements for housing benefit for housing association tenants facing rent rises are in doubt, Labour said yesterday, following a minister's refusal to guarantee that increases would be met. Mr John Battle, the opposition housing spokesman, highlighted the issue after a letter from Mr Alistair Burt, the junior social security minister, earlier this month. On housing association rents, Mr Burt wrote: 'Although the Housing Benefit scheme can meet reasonable rents in full (and reasonable rent increases if the customer is in receipt of benefit), it cannot be assumed that housing benefit will automatically increase to meet housing association rent increases'. The question has been given added force by the cut in housing association grant and the government's drive towards market rents. Mr Battle attacked the government for allowing the two departments involved  -the Department of Social Security and the Department of the Environment - to contradict each other. 'At present the housing minister says social security will pay - something the social security minister has just denied. As housing association rents are already escalating, tenants have a right to know how they are to meet the cost of the increases,' he said. The letter reflects the tension between the two departments over aspects of housing policy in this area. One of the aims of the inter-departmental review of housing benefit is to resolve the problem of the effect of the DOE's plans for improving conditions for council and housing association tenants, at the cost of higher rents, on the DSS budget which bears much of the impact through housing benefit spending.</p>

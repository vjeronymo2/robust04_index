			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / International Company News: Southwest Airlines plans to open bookings centre SOUTHWEST Airlines plans to open a new reservations centre in Albuquerque that will employ 465 people by the third quarter of 1993, Reuter reports from Albuquerque. Southwest Airlines, based in Dallas, is the only sizeable US airline to have been consistently profitable during the recent industry upheavals. Southwest, a low-cost/low fare operation, concentrates on flying high-density commuter routes, rather offering national coverage via hub operations. Meanwhile, Trans World Airlines, one of the nation's bankrupt carriers, has announced plans to close its New York reservations centre, with the loss of around 450 jobs. The closure is scheduled to take effect on October 25. The airline currently emloys just under 28,000 people overall, and runs a number of other reservations centres in the US.</p>

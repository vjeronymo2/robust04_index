			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / A changing Dr Jagan in a changing world: Guyana's president with a past WHEN Dr Cheddi Jagan, the new president of Guyana, joins his colleagues at a Caribbean Community summit in Trinidad in a fortnight, they will all be more than slightly anxious to discard some mutual reservations. Over the past three years Dr Jagan had repeatedly prevailed on his Caricom colleagues to help correct what were widely held to be repeated irregularities in the process leading to elections in Guyana and which Dr Jagan claimed had kept the People's National Congress party of Mr Desmond Hoyte in office. Dr Jagan wanted Caricom to send a team of observers to monitor the elections. The Caricom leaders were, largely, unmoved by Dr Jagan's appeals and did not send a mission to Guyana. In the event the Caricom presence at the elections was contained in a Commonwealth team. This, said functionaries of Dr Jagan's People's Progressive party, was because no Caricom leader wanted to upset Mr Hoyte. 'Despite this, I will not hold it against the Caricom governments,' said Dr Jagan. Dr Jagan, a 74-year-old dentist and a former premier of Guyana, has said, rather, that strengthening ties with Guyana's colleagues in the Caribbean will be a foreign policy priority of his new government. Whatever reservations the Caricom members had about monitoring the elections, the new president will be welcomed by his colleagues. Dr Jagan, once an avowed Marxist, has been a victim of the ideological sea change which has overtaken many third world leaders over the past decade. However, his move towards moderation and his recent advocacy of a market economy have allayed concerns, held until recently by some of the more conservative Caricom leaders, that Dr Jagan was a closet communist. The new president will also do well in mending fences with the US, which he describes as one of Guyana's 'traditional friends'. In the administration of Mr Forbes Burnham, Mr Hoyte's predecessor in office, Washington found itself not easily able to decide who might be a better friend. Mr Burnham's state capitalism, in the pursuit of 'co-operative socialism', including the nationalisation of foreign property, was the alternative to Dr Jagan's Marxism in the days of the cold war. Mr Hoyte's volte face in economic policy in deregulating the economy and distancing himself from the economic and political excesses of Mr Burnham apparently only strengthened the appeal of the reformed Dr Jagan. The Hoyte administration's revised policies were part of a structural adjustment programme agreed with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Dr Jagan, in opposition, had attacked the government for implementing the programme, arguing that the measures were too harsh. The PPP now says that it will try to modify the IMF pact. 'We feel confident that the IMF can be persuaded to renegotiate the harsh conditions which have been imposed on the weak PNC administration,' the party said. In taking over the government of the English-speaking republic of 900,000 people located on the north-east shoulder of South America, Dr Jagan faces several formidable challenges. The first is that he is in danger of being an anachronism. Dr Jagan last held political office 28 years ago, and since then has had to lead parliamentary opposition to the PNC. Much has changed in the world since, and old habits die hard. The new president still speaks of his desire to act on behalf of the 'working people', and an apparent objection to the sell-off of state enterprises and the involvement of foreign investors has had to be reversed and clarified by his advisers in the face of questions raised by foreign business. Another challenge facing Dr Jagan is the economy, which is based on sugar and rice production and bauxite and gold mining. In breaking the mould of state capitalism and in deregulating the economy, Mr Hoyte took the hard decisions. But the price paid by Guyanese has been high. A 64 per cent depreciation which followed the floating of the currency last year contributed to high inflation and reduced the standard of living of most Guyanese and led to increased emigration. Foreign investors have looked favourably on Guyana. But Dr Jagan will need to encourage many more with significant amounts of money to rebuild the economy, which had been declining steadily until last year when it expanded by 6 per cent before growing by twice that rate in the first half of this year. Guyanese voted largely along ethnic lines, with the PPP being supported by those of Indian origin, about 52 per cent of the population, and the PNC by those of African descent, about 38 per cent. Dr Jagan has promised to work to end racial divisions, to begin with by appointing a multi-ethnic cabinet. Dr Cheddi Jagan, who was sworn in at the weekend as president of Guyana, is seeking the assistance of two small political parties, as his victorious People's Progressive party (PPP) has only a one-seat majority in the assembly, writes Canute James. Dr Jagan said he would ask the Working People's Alliance and the United Force if they were interested in a coalition. The left-of centre WPA and the conservative UF trailed the PPP and the former ruling People's National Congress (PNC) in elections last week. Mr Jagan said he would not be seeking PNC support. PPP officials said the most likely partner for the party was the WPA whose presidential candidate, Mr Clive Thomas, could be given a senior cabinet post.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by German Reyes] </F>   [Excerpts] Tegucigalpa, 8 Apr [date as received] (ACAN-EFE)  -- Honduran citizen Luis Hernandez Sosa has denied being the  mastermind of an alleged plot to assassinate President Carlos  Roberto Reina, and he told the press: "I am innocent, and I am  not an assassin."    Hernandez Sosa, 30, turned himself in on Thursday to  Honduran  judicial authorities through the government's Office of the  National Human Rights Ombudsman. [passage omitted]    When reporters asked him about his relationship with the  three Nicaraguans, Hernandez Sosa said: "I have no contact with  Nicaraguans or anyone else. I only have contact with God."    President Reina described the alleged assassination plot as  an act of "gangsterism and drug trafficking."    "No one has accused me. I am not an assassin, and tomorrow I  will clarify everything," Hernandez Sosa said before being  admitted to the Tegucigalpa Penal Center, where he was placed in  a special cell under tight security by Army personnel. [passage  omitted]    A presidential spokesman told ACAN-EFE, "it is absurd to  think that the president could be used as a smokescreen," and he  underscored that the plan "existed." The source added, "We have  information that Hernandez Sosa is involved in drug trafficking,  and this will allow us to clarify the situation for all of the  Honduran people."    Hernandez Sosa has six days, beginning on Friday, to respond  in court to the charges against him in a case in which there is  joint cooperaton between Honduran and Nicaraguan authorities.</p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEWS;  </P> <P> 'WATERWORKS': A SUMMER TONIC AT LONG BEACH MUSEUM  </P> <P> The lazy days of summer seem to call for no-sweat art shows involving a minimum  of mental energy on everyone's part. But every now and then, a summertime  teaser actually has something to say for itself.  </P> <P> At the Long Beach Museum of Art, "Waterworks" -- the final exhibit organized by  departing senior curator Josine Ianco-Starrels (with assistance from media  curator Michael Nash) -- offers photographs, videos and installations by  artists who deal variously with the sounds, grandeur, mystery, rituals and  wanton carelessness associated with water.  </P> <P> Michael C. McMillen's installation, "Fluxus Naturae" -- the only new piece in  the show -- invites viewers to pass through an old door into a small  basement-like room lined with rusted implements and old trunks. This cool, dark  place is dominated by the rushing sound of water passing through a series of  chutes mounted on the wall. Water also gushes endlessly from a faucet into an  old sink surrounded by plants and seedlings. Above the sink, a fat metal pipe  serves as a porthole through which the ocean -- the real one -- is visible.  </P> <P> In an Alice-in-Wonderland twist, a tiny glass door at foot-level leads to the  outside, where a "huge" (actually normal-sized) plant looms over a tiny flight  of back steps and microscopic garbage cans. An old clock is stopped at eight  minutes to 12. It's hard not to see the piece as a plea for eleventh-hour  attention to the crisis of water waste. (Even the spatial distortions and the  tacit comparison of sink to ocean suggest the need for a change in  perspective.) If this is preaching, it has the atmospheric charm of master  storytelling.  </P> <P> Mineko Grimmer contributes one of her sound-sculptures, a blend of quietly  austere sculpture and natural process. Black pebbles frozen into a triangular  block of ice are suspended above a shallow wooden trough. As the ice melts, the  pebbles randomly dislodge and skitter through a pair of fan-shaped sprays of  bamboo, making a pinging sound as they hit a metal bar projecting from the  water. Unlike Grimmer's more utilitarian-looking earlier pieces in this mode,  "Intermittent Composition" (1988) has a formal elegance that complements its  aural allure.  </P> <P> The team of video guru Nam June Paik and Paul Garrin present a twin-pack of  rapid-fire imagery in "Two Channel Music Tape: Spring/Fall" (1987). Fashion  models strutting, bits and pieces of a smiling nude woman, glimpses of visual  and performing artists (Merce Cunningham, Joseph Beuys, Laurie Anderson) and  purely abstract gyrations of color and line compete for the viewer's attention  in a weirdly riveting cacophony of fragmented and repeated activities. The only  thing that never changes is the sound of pounding surf, suggesting the dynamism  linking diverse modes of audience-oriented behavior.  </P> <P> In stark temporal contrast, Doug Hall's "Storm and Stress" (1986) leisurely  tracks the onset and growing fury of thunderstorms in different locations,  blending their peaks and valleys into a glorious and terrible symphony of sound  and visual effects. "Stress" is shown as the province of ordinary folks and  professional storm-watchers, all reduced to the status of passive bystanders  beholding a dream.  </P> <P> Bill Viola is represented by two early videos. In "The Reflecting Pool,"  (1977-79) the image of the artist's leap into a forest pool is frozen while the  light effects play over the water, marking the passage of time. Gorgeously  simple and complexly evocative -- Ianco-Starrels finds parallels to the myth of  Narcissus -- the seven-minute tape is one of Viola's most accessible works.  </P> <P> Robbert Flick's photo-grids of repeated surf imagery emphasize the constancy of  the tides and the glinting wonder of light on water. In photographs from  Richard Misrach's "Desert Cantos VII: Desert Sea" series, seductive washes of  light and color veil the latter-day fallout from a mismanaged irrigation  project of the early 1900s. Photo-documentation drains Lewis de Soto's  performance pieces at the ocean's edge of whatever mystic feelings they may  have embodied for spectators, however; the imagery comes across as little more  than pretty swirls, bars and scribbles of fire or colored light. (Long Beach  Museum of Art, 2300 E. Ocean Blvd., Long Beach, to Aug. 12.)  </P> <P> Signs of art: Look, look. See Paul McCarthy's art. Everything is painted on  electric signs. Some things look like cartoons, but not the kind for kids. A  man is crouching on the beach in "Corporate Puppy Love." He is doing something  to another man. A fountain is spraying from the other man. There is also a big  blue-and-red design that looks like a target. Did those men make that design?  Are they happy? Are they bad? Is Paul McCarthy mad at them? I'm not sure, but I  think so.  </P> <P> There are three plain black-and-red paintings, too: a radiation sign and a CBS  "eye" sign and a skull sign for "poison." These signs warn me against the bad  people who make harmful things. There is also a bunch of travelers' trunks  piled on a big table. I can't see into the trunks and I'd better not open them,  but it says on a piece of paper that they hold props from Paul McCarthy's  performances. There's another thing on the pile: a box with two holes, like  eyes. A long thing is sticking out from one of the holes. Paul McCarthy seems  to like those long things. I never saw any of his performances, but I hope they  were more grown-up. (Rosamund Felsen Gallery, 669 N. La Cienega Blvd., to July  28.)  </P> <P> Middle-aged humor: Steve Gianakos makes paintings that are really just  super-sized cartoon line drawings translated into a high-art medium. They used  to be genuinely witty in a deadpan way. It was hard to resist the "Dead Girl"  series, in which a smiling, blank-eyed girl rests her head at the same abrupt  angle no matter what she is leaning on, or what the setting happens to be -- at  the dentist or on a date. But in his recent images, Gianakos seems to have  succumbed to flabby middle-aged lechery that looks out of place outside the  back pages of "men's" magazines.  </P> <P> His Betty Boopish nudes are dimwitted innocents, displaying their charms for  unseen admirers or fretting -- in careless dishabille -- over difficulties  large and small. The tag lines generally replay the purple prose of trashy  novels ("She was trying to recapture the few moments of bliss he had given  her"). A number of the images contain cunning arrangements of colored  rectangles a la Mondrian -- suggesting, perhaps, vestigial evidence of  impress-your-date chatter about Modern Art. Everything in this work depends on  a knowing wink exchanged between artist and onlooker. If the onlooker happens  to be a woman, she's apt to feel mightily out of place. (Asher/Faure, 612 N.  Almont Drive, to July 28.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Visceral images: Judie Bamber's new paintings at Roy Boyd Gallery sulk and  snarl with an underlying bruised sensibility that derives partially from the  imagery and partly from the titles. Each square canvas is a monochrome field  with a small, meticulously described object in the center. Some of these are  just small (a chameleon); others have a viscous surface texture and erotic or  squeamish associations (a side view of a mussel that looks like a female organ,  a dead baby bird); and still others are simple man-made objects that coldly  represent male anatomy.  </P> <P> Bamber's titles -- "I'll Never Forgive You For This (Duo Tone Balls)," "I Don't  Want to Talk About It (Mussel)" -- inject a contemporary note of  relationship-on-the-rocks. The pairings of objects and titles sometimes give  seemingly innocuous objects devastatingly cutting significance. Still, the  heart of this work lies in the painfully visceral quality of some of the images  rather than in the pop psych by-play of the titles, which too easily become  vapid one-liners. (Roy Boyd Gallery, 1547 10th St., Santa Monica, to July 21.)  </P> <P> </P></p>

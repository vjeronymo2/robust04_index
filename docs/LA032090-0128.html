			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> PUPILS STAR IN TV ANTI-POLLUTION SPOT  </P> <P> Pupils at Linda Vista Elementary School in Orange became environmental  activists on Monday when their school participated in the filming of a public  service announcement about pollution.  </P> <P> The theme song for the event was a little ditty called "Take Me Out to the  Landfill," written by Jan Richards, the coordinator of the filming.  </P> <P> To the tune of "Take Me Out to the Ball Game," the 21 children belted out,  "Take me out to the landfill, take me out to the dump. Disposable diapers on  parade, 500 years till they biodegrade. . . ."  </P> <P> The youngsters, chosen from the third through sixth grades, wore hard hats and  sat on the city's colorful recycling bins for the filming. School Principal  Thomas Cooper said this was the first time that they had an opportunity to  participate in something like this and added that the children had memorized  and choreographed the entire event.  </P> <P> Richards, of KTTV in Los Angeles, said that Linda Vista was one of a number of  schools in Southern California chosen for the series of public service  announcements, which will air on Channel 11 in the beginning of April, to  coincide with Earth Day.

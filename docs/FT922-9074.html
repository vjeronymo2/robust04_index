			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: A painful pension split NOW YOU see it, now you don't. That might be one way to describe the state of many a wife's pension after her marriage has broken down. The most valuable assets in many cases of divorce are the family home and the husband's pension, but all too often the pension is forgotten, leading to distress for many ex-wives in later years. Pension rights are now recognised by the law as part of matrimonial property but there are no detailed guidelines on the way in which they should be allocated. 'In many cases (of divorce), the wife receives the greater share in the residence, as a trade-off against the value of the husband's pension rights,' comments the Working Group on Pensions and Divorce, in a consultative document released this week. With one in three marriages ending in divorce in the UK, there have been calls for a change to the law, specifically for the splitting of pension rights on divorce. The Working Group was formed earlier this year by the Pensions Management Institute and is receiving funding from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Its consultative document has been issued so that responses from organisations and people involved in the pensions field can be incorporated in a final report, when the Group will recommend changes to the present system. The courts do sometimes take a pension into account in a divorce settlement, but this is usually when a couple is nearing retirement age. Younger women are expected to have enough time to build up their own pension rights. However, those with small children often take time off work or resort to part-time work, so they cannot build up an adequate pension. Even married women in full time work are likely to earn a smaller pension than their husband. The law on pensions and divorce is different in Scotland, where 'matrimonial property' includes 'rights or interests of either party under a life policy or occupational pension scheme.' It requires this to be shared fairly on divorce; fair sharing means equal sharing unless there are special circumstances which dictate otherwise. The Working Group asks whether the rest of the UK should adopt a similar legal position. One big problem with allocating a pension after a divorce is assessing its value. There are two main methods. The first is to look at the 'cash equivalent', which involves valuing the husband's pension as if he had left the scheme at the time of the divorce. The other way is to base the value of the pension on his pensionable service to date and to allow for the possibility of future benefit payments and increases in pensionable pay. This is sometimes known as the 'past service reserve' and is likely to be larger than the cash equivalent because it projects pay in the future. However, determining which should be used as a basis for valuing the pension if it is to be divided will not solve a further problem, which is that a man's second wife will collect his pension benefits. Basing the value of the pension on the whole of the husband's past pensionable service risks reducing the benefits to the second wife and giving too much to an oft-divorced wife. The alternative to calculating the value of the pension at the date of divorce (or separation) would be to follow Scottish law, where pension rights that can be shared are limited to those arising during the length of the marriage.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Settlements vs. Dollars"] </F>   [Text] The recent decision of the Clinton administration to  penalise Israel by deducting $437 million from this year's U.S.  loan guarantees because of its illegal settlement activity in  the occupied Arab territories appears to be less serious than it  really is. What this penalty means in the final analysis is  that instead of the full $2 billion in U.S. guarantees Israel  would receive in 1994, it can now expect a maximum of $1.563  billion.    On the surface of things, Washington's "punitive" move is  predicated on its appraisal of Israeli spending on settlements  in 1993 in excess of what was originally expected and agreed  upon between the American and Israeli governments in 1992. The  catch is that any penalty against continued Israeli building of  settlements does not affect the $3 billion a year aid package to  Israel. Had the White House been really serious about punishing  Israel for its illegal settlement activity in the West Bank and  Gaza Strip, it would have opted to cut drastically its direct  financial, economical and military support programmes to the  Rabin government instead of relying solely on reducing its loan  guarantees.    Still, the U.S.' reaction, ineffective as it may be,  confirms  Arab suspicions that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin is  still bent on populating Palestinian territories with Israeli  settlers at a time when he pretends to be suing for peace with  the Arab side, especially the Palestinians. This is the newest  evidence yet that the Israeli pious pleas for a just and durable  peace in the region are cynical and hypocritical at best. At  the rate the Israeli colonisation programme is developing, there  would not be much Palestinian territory left to talk about at  the end of the 5-year transitional period.    This is where the U.S. can be expected to do more by way of  frustrating the Israeli settlement plans by cutting deeply into  its concrete aid to the Jewish state. It could be the only  language that Rabin understands, given the failure of all other  methods of persuastion.    What adds insult to injury, though, is the reaction of  pro-Israel activists in Washington who have expressed their  dismay at the announcement of the so-called penalty. Now Israel  and its supporters are pinning hopes on the U.S. Congress to  reverse the administration's decision. If congressmen end up  accommodating Israeli lobbyists on this score, then there is no  escape from the conclusion that what the executive branch in  Washington offers in support of the peace process on the one  hand, Capitol Hill readily takes away on the other.</p>

			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Letter: Hard look at defence spending You rightly note with concern the British government's volte face on planned military cuts, at the cost of Pounds 80m to the taxpayer ('Rethinking British defence', February 10), just as Germany and the US are looking at further cuts in their own budgets. The government and the defence select committee would not only do well to look hard and long at the imperial nostalgia which often propels Britain's disproportionate defence budget, as you suggest, but also to scrutinise the spending's effectiveness in dealing with the big threats to global security in a post-cold war world. To be well-spent, resources will have to be channelled not towards fire-fighting conflicts after the event, but increasingly towards tackling the root causes of the 'new' threats to global security, such as: the vicious cycles of economic crisis; poverty and conflict which drive millions in desperation from their homes and across the world's borders; or a drugs trade propelled by the desperation of peasant farmers forced to grow coca as traditional crops such as coffee slump to prices which do not pay a living wage; or the poverty and gross inequality upon which totalitarianism and fundamentalism feed.

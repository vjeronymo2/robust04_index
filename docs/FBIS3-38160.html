			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over still photograph of Prime </F> Minister Tansu Ciller]    [Excerpts] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has declared that  the government will take the necessary steps to eliminate both  economic and PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terrorism.  Contrary to claims by certain circles, Ciller announced that  the government, in doing this, will act with courage and  determination, without any ulterior motives, will consider only  the future of Turkey and the prosperity and happiness of the  Turkish nation.    In a written statement issued today, Ciller stated: From the  day we established the government, I seized every opportunity to  announce our determination to end PKK terrorism as well as the  terror in the economy. It is known that we have displayed this  determination without any consideration for party congresses or  elections. [passage omitted]    Ciller added: Only yesterday, our brave Turkish Armed Forces  conducted the biggest and most comprehensive operation of the  past 10 years and destroyed the Zhalah PKK shelter, 110 km from  our border.    Ciller announced that as a result of this operation the PKK  sustained great losses from the viewpoint of administration,  militants, weapons, and ammunition. The support of the Turkish  people for these efforts aimed at eliminating PKK terrorism is  well known, Ciller stressed, noting: Friendly countries and our  allies have also demonstrated through their recent decisions and  attitudes that they are on Turkey's side on this subject.    She said: Given these facts and the support of the people  for the elimination of both kinds of terrorism, I personally  fail to comprehend the logic alleging that bombing the Zhalah  PKK camp was aimed at veiling the adverse affects of the  decisions concerning the money markets. Advocating such a logic  would constitute an injustice to the government, to the Turkish  Armed Forces, and to those who are trying to restore the economy  by taking steps to continue the free market economy. In our  opinion, the recent economic operations launched in the money  markets as well as yesterday's Zhalah PKK camp operation are  great successes. Both operations were necessary. The two are  not related in any way from the point of timing. The government  weighed and used its political will and did whatever was  necessary in both cases. Our government will take the necessary  steps to eliminate both the economic and PKK terrorism.  Contrary to the allegations of certain circles, the government,  in doing this, will act with courage and determination,  considering only the future of Turkey and the prosperity and  happiness of the Turkish nation.</p>

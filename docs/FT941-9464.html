			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Banks 'misusing' clients' money Labour yesterday stepped up its campaign to put pressure on the high street banks over their use of the clearing system, as it accused three of Britain's big four of deliberately delaying the crediting of cheques to individual customers and businesses. Mr Nigel Griffiths, the party's consumer spokesman, said that National Westminster, Lloyds, and Midland earn an extra day's interest on retail deposits by advising customers that it take four days to credit a cheque. Banks are estimated to make Pounds 300m a year from the delay. His renewed attack on the banks was rejected by the British Bankers' Association, which insisted that the UK clearing system was 'the best in the world'. The association said yesterday: 'Any proceeds we do make go towards the overheads of operating the clearing system, which costs Pounds 4.5bn a year. This enables the banks and building societies to offer customers free banking.' Mr Griffiths said: 'With modern technology it takes seconds to switch money from one bank to another, yet banks are taking the money out of customers' accounts, investing it in the international money markets and three days later crediting the business or other organisation.' He added that Barclays was the only UK clearer to pay interest on retail deposits three days after they are made, saying that this had cost them some Pounds 70m in lost potential income. The Labour accusation comes against a background of wider criticism of the banks. A week ago Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said they had wasted an opportunity to make a marked increase in consumer protection when they revised the voluntary code of banking practice which covers the relationship with personal customers.</p>

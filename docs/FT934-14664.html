			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / A peculiar British practice When you run a brothel, it pays not to be too particular about your clients. When you are in the business of making and selling armaments, or even civilian equipment that can be used to manufacture weapons, you are obliged to be choosy. Tiresome officials will insist on denying you access to certain markets. Since you owe it to your shareholders to find ways of completing sales where you can, you will lobby against these official rulings. You may argue that if the government is concerned about employment it should be flexible in applying whatever rules it has devised. Before going any further, I must apologise for my opening analogy. It libels an ancient service industry that does comparatively little harm. It does, however, help to focus our attention on what is particularly important about the inquiry being conducted by Lord Justice Scott into the sale of defence-related equipment to Iraq. There are several troublesome questions before his lordship. Each matters in its own way. We'll come to these in a moment. But the most serious cause for concern is the continuing, if declining, dependence of Britain's manufacturing industry on the trade in armaments. This is the big one. Let us look at it first. Just a few weeks ago Sir Alan Thomas, who is the head of exports at the Ministry of Defence, boasted that in 1992 overseas orders were taken for Pounds 5.2bn worth of British armaments. Sales this year were already above that, he added. On checking yesterday it turns out that later information from suppliers puts the 1992 figure at Pounds 6bn in 1992 money, and that the current forecast for 1993 is Pounds 7bn-Pounds 7 1/2 bn. Communications gear, computers and high-tech equipment feature strongly in these orders. If the gadgets we were selling were, say, personal computers, portable telephones, transistor radios and copying machines, all sold in high street shops, we would not only be proud of that - we would be Japanese. As matters stand, the defence department happily asserts that Britain is now the second largest arms supplier. Its share of the world market doubled, to 20 per cent, last year. We are talking about missiles, armoured personnel carriers, trainer jets, tanks, and loads and loads and loads of ammunition. I make no moral point. That is either plain to you or it is not. Let the argument be about the value of this trade to Britain's economy. It is certainly high at the moment. The people in the arms business speak of 120,000 jobs directly involved, or two or three times as many if component suppliers and others are counted in. The total industry turnover may approach Pounds 15bn this year, although to reach that figure you have to assume that orders taken in 1993 are the same thing as goods delivered. That is a statistical quibble. The important question is whether the order books can be kept full for many more years. Just look at that concocted figure of Pounds 15bn for a few minutes and it begins to melt away. More than half - Pounds 7.7bn - represents purchases by taxpayers of weapons for British forces to stockpile and occasionally use. This is a two-way traffic in cross-subsidisation. The exports help to keep the unit costs of the domestic purchases low and vice versa. It is, however, a trade that is doomed to decline. The squeeze on public spending will reduce defence procurement, and thus the export subsidy, however cunningly defence secretary Mr Malcolm Rifkind may phrase his protests. Britain's armaments manufacturers employ a skilled workforce. Some of our best engineers work in the well-known supplying companies. Too bad. This is not, and should not be, a business of the future. The defence companies know this. All, even British Aerospace, are diversifying into civilian work. The arms trade may not be shrunk as rapidly as, say, coalmining but it is nevertheless yesterday's game. The Scott inquiry is about one aspect of how it has been played in the past. It may shed light on how Whitehall plays all its games. When its report is published we should be able to answer several specific questions with more certainty than anyone can now. Did ministers and/or officials deliberately seek to suppress information, knowing that to do so might lead to the wrongful conviction of three executives of Matrix-Churchill on charges of breaching export controls? Was there a failure to brief ministers? Mr William Waldegrave, who in 1989 was the foreign office minister directly concerned, told the inquiry this week that he was unaware of intelligence reports showing that the machine tools in question were being used by the Iraqis for military purposes. Was there a plot, or was Whitehall merely incompetent? These things matter. If ministers were willing to see individuals unjustly jailed, they must go. If the spies' information is not being properly used, the relevant civil servants must try harder. As to the third strand of the case - the Waldegrave doctrine that where delicate matters of diplomacy are concerned it is not always sensible to keep Parliament informed - the outsiders' judgment may well be: 'Tell me another, Mr Minister for Open Government.' More to the point is the light that may be shed on the peculiarly English nature of British administrative duplicity. Our masters are rarely corrupt enough to lie and cheat outright, nor straightforward enough to be trusted absolutely. The clever use of words, the economy with the truth, the deployment of 'no reason to believe' and 'might have been at the time' and 'could be for quite innocent purposes', and the painstaking twisting of definitions are well-known trademarks of perfidious Albion. The French do the same thing in their own peculiar way, but not, it appears, as effectively in terms of arms orders landed as the British. The most charitable explanation of the case before Lord Justice Scott may be that this player or that had the best interests of Britain's defence workforce, or its future civilian trade in a peaceful Middle East, in mind. The defence industry, and its lobbyists, will have played their part. We may read of a series of well-meant mistakes, for which no one in particular is to blame. That is the way of bland British inquiries. Yet this time may be different. It is just possible that one or more of the relevant protagonists will be seen to have been caught with his trousers down.</p>

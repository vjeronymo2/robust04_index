			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 11 (YONHAP) -- A South Korean  Government official denied Tuesday [11 January] a report that  North Korean Workers' Party Secretary for South Korean Affairs  Kim Yong-sun has been replaced with Kang Chu-il.    "Kang Chu-il was appointed director of the Reunification  Front Department last year, but not secretary for South Korean  Affairs. Kim Yong-sun seems to be still in office," he said.    "Usually, the party secretary is also a member of the  party's  Central Committee," another official said. "But since 1980,  there has been no report that Kang was appointed a full member  or alternate member of the Central Committee."    Kim was retained as chairman of the Reunification Policy  Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly Standing Committee, a  post traditionally held by the secretary for South Korean  Affairs, at the Sixth Meeting of the Ninth Supreme People's  Assembly late last year, according to the second official.</p>

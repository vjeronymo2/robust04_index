			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Luo Guojun (7482 0948 7486)] </F>   [Text] Hangzhou, 9 Apr (XINHUA) -- Relatives of the 24  Taiwan compatriots who perished in a fire on a pleasure boat on  Qiandao Lake left for Taiwan via Hong Kong at 1000 this morning.  Their departure marked a temporary close to the efforts dealing  with the aftermath of the accident.    On 31 March, a fire broke out on the "Hairui" pleasure boat  in Chunan County, Zhejiang Province. All 32 people aboard the  boat -- 24 Taiwan tourists, two guides, and six crew members --  were killed. Over the past few days, officials of Hangzhou city,  Zhejiang Province, in charge of dealing with the aftermath had  several discussions with relatives of the Taiwan victims on the  cremation of the bodies. Taking into account the wishes of the  victims' relatives and the customs of Taiwan, the departments  concerned did their best in making the most appropriate  arrangements. On the afternoon of 6 April, all the bodies of  the dead Taiwan compatriots were placed in coffins, and the 24  coffins were immediately shipped to a funeral parlor in Tonglu  County.    The remains of the dead Taiwan compatriots were cremated  yesterday morning. At about 0900, some 50 relatives of the  victims held a memorial service in Tonglu for the deceased.  Afterward, they bowed to the employees of the funeral parlor  and to the personnel in charge of handling the aftermath to  express their gratitude. Possessions left behind by the  deceased which had been recovered so far were claimed by the  victims' relatives. Lin Weiyang, deputy manager of Taiwan's  Changfeng Tourist Agency and who took part in the handling of  the remains from beginning to end, said that he was satisfied  with the assistance offered to the victims' relatives by the  relevant provincial and city authorities. He told reporters:  "The mainland authorities in charge of dealing with the  aftermath have done what they could. We all did our best, and  the rest remains in the hands of God. May the deceased soon  rest in peace."    Zhejiang Vice Governor Liu Xirong made two special trips --  on the day of the Qingming Festival [5 April] and today before  the relatives' departure -- to meet the victims' relatives and  to express his condolences. On behalf of the provincial and  city governments, he expressed profound condolences and  heartfelt sympathy to the victims' relatives. He said: "We all  are people of Chinese descent. The sorrow of Taiwan compatriots  is our sorrow, and their consolation is our consolation. Please  convey my regards to the other relatives back in Taiwan."</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ignacio Ramirez] </F>   [Text] The left-wing political groups that came to Chiapas  from Torreon took advantage of the religious infrastructure  created by the diocese of San Cristobal de las Casas and carried  on their work in the Highlands and the Lacandon Forest using  language that was not only Marxist but atheist as well. They  gave rise to the Emiliano Zapata Peasant Organization (OCEZ).  Close to 200 catechizers went into 200 communities to spread the  new ideas and set up economic and political organizations. They  had already changed their way of thinking. Later came the  repression and institutionalized violence. It was in this  context that the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) issued  its declaration of war.    This was, in summary, the account that Bishop Samuel Ruiz  gave of the way that the social movement which gave rise to the  EZLN was born. He was speaking at the meeting that the members  of the Plural Commission of the Standing Committee of the  Congress of the Union held in San Cristobal de las Casas on 13  January with bishops from the southern Pacific coast region. The  commission had been formed to analyze the events in Chiapas.    The members of the commission reported that they held this  and other meetings a few days after the outbreak of fighting on  1 January. They did not reveal their substance, however. PROCESO  now has a copy of the shorthand version of the talks between  lawmakers and bishops.    Attending the meeting, among other legislators, were  Benjamin  Gonzalez Roaro, Jorge Tovar Montanez, Blanca Ruth Esponda, Juan  Ramiro Robledo, Jorge Moscoso, Alvaro Salazar, Adolfo Kunz  Bolanos, Victor Manuel Tinoco Rubi, Jesus Martin del Campo, and  Alejandro Encinas. Representing the Ecclesiastic Commission  were, in addition to Samuel Ruiz, Felipe Aguirre Franco and  Felipe Arizmendi Esquivel, the bishops of Tuxtla Gutierrez and  Tapachula respectively; Adolfo Suarez Rivera, the archbishop of  Monterrey and president of the Mexican Episcopate; the  archbishop of Oaxaca, Hector Gonzalez; the bishop of  Coatzacoalcos, Carlos Talavera, and the Dominican bishop, Raul  Vera.    During the meeting Samuel Ruiz warned of the danger that  once  peace has been achieved, "if the military takes a military  approach, they will observe the subsequent pacification stage in  a military way, and there could be a witch hunt. I am not  emphasizing anything; I just want to point out this risk."    "If we are unable, right now, to see things in a positive  light," he added, "if we are going to look at our brothers with  prejudice, then obviously we are going to be the first ones to  hamper a reconciliation...This requires an attitude of fairness,  an attitude of honesty, an attitude of understanding, and an  attitude of humaneness, with a change on our part in order to  break with the structures that are hurting them." Chiapas is not  just the Zapatist National Liberation Army, was the comment at  the meeting, during which criticism of all sorts was voiced of  the Mexican political system, neoliberal policies, and the FTA,  inasmuch as the conflict is not only with the group that has  taken up arms "but also has other areas of concern in the  different spheres of government and society."    Bishop Felipe Arizmendi:    "The answer to why all this happened is mainly poverty,  exploitation, and injustice...The fact is that the entire  economic system in which we live, not just in Mexico but all  over the world, the entire neoliberal system of the market  economy has to be reassessed, and it has to be a serious  reassessment at the level of the world economy, not just  nationally and not just in Chiapas. What is happening to us?  These mechanisms are forgetting about the poorest people. All  this is for the big businessmen, the big power groups. And what  about all these people? In general, it is the type of economy  that we have in the world, which is not an economy of  solidarity, an economy of sharing, of justice. It is an economy  of seeing who can make more any way he can. We must not forget  this, because if we only take an Alka-Seltzer for the problem  and fail to treat it more seriously, sooner or later it is going  to explode everywhere."    "What do you know about the direction of this armed  movement?  Is it primarily local, specifically in terms of the top  echelon?" PARM [Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution]  Deputy Adolfo Kunz Bolanos asked Samuel Ruiz.    The bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas diocese gave a  wide-ranging account of how the social movement that led to the  actions of the EZLN was born. The following is a summary of the  verbatim transcription of his remarks:    That is a difficult question, because I do not know the  answer. I am going to say what I know.    I will go far back. When I arrived here, I knew that Castro  Ruz had gotten training in the Chiapas jungles and that he had  even been in Yucatan. This was mentioned there with great  admiration.    During Echeverria's term there were two guerrilla forces in  the jungle: a right-wing guerrilla force, maintained by the  left, and a left-wing guerrilla force, maintained by the right.  I mention this merely to point out that the situation in the  jungle, because it is a jungle, was tense. A favorable moment  arose, however, and the situation was gotten under control.    There was a pretty strong movement in Torreon, and several  agitators were jailed. Bishop Fernando Romo, a friend of mine,  was in very close touch with us on occasion. I went there, to  Torreon, and marveled at the discipline and organization of the  grass-roots forces, which caused quite a serious problem for him  that he could find no way to resolve.    I saw that organization over there and, seeing the political  backwardness of the community, I said here: When will something  like that come to Chiapas and raise people's consciousness? Some  of the people who were listening just stared at me because I was  talking with someone in that movement. "Some day," he told me,  but very cynically. Four months later we saw them here. And very  soon they started using our infrastructure. They were supposed  to give one poor nun some clothing in a package, and it turned  out to be outright subversive propaganda. They lied outrageously  to us...That situation was exposed.    They wanted to take over the entire religious structure, the  structure of the catechizing religion. Several members of the  communities, particularly catechizers, were "hauled off," and  some went voluntarily, with different tendencies. So, at a given  moment in some places in the Chol Zone, for example, that  movement co-opted several communities and turned the hermitages  into barns for growing coffee or storing corn.    At the same time, their language was not just Marxist but  atheist as well. I was very pained to hear one catechizer say:  "I wipe my ass with the Bible." Forgive me for repeating this.  But I was terrified at how these people had made a complete  turnabout. I also remember hearing the Indians say things like:  "We have to begin building a movement, not a political movement  but our movement." It was at this point, as far as I can recall,  that the Emiliano Zapata Peasant Organization was born, very  near to where we are speaking.    So this became more or less well-known and grew in different  areas. The southern Pacific coast region looked on when the time  came for the political opening to register parties. And the  entire southeast area, including Veracruz and this whole section  of Oaxaca and Chiapas, saw the extraordinary emergence of a  whole array of political positions, despite the cultural and  linguistic barriers, because they were a response to longing of  the Indians, of the peasants for specific support at that  moment, with the growing awareness that their lands had been  snatched from them. Their consciousness was raised, and we  ourselves are not far removed from a consciousness-raising  effort there.    Two-hundred catechizers went into 200 communities when this  situation arose. The catechizers are the ones who reap the  harvest of a community's thinking. Their way of thinking had  already changed. Imagine what sort of consciousness-raising the  communities were undergoing. Economic and political  organizations, ejido associations, internal organizations, and  cultural groups too emerged.    This is the background to what would be called evangelizing  action. It is clear that political decisions and choices were  made in the wake of it. I would have been the unhappiest bishop  in the world if after 30 years of work there had been no  consciousness-raising about the political involvement of the  laity.    Several other factors had an influence. Another result was  the subsequent repression, because there is institutionalized  violence: 15,000 Indians starved to death in Chiapas last year;  this is institutional violence. Then came repression in the  indigenous areas, and a second wave of violence, and finally a  desperate counterviolence, which we call violence without  remembering that a previous violence caused it.    The most recent movement and the repression arose in this  context. It was so discreet that four days before it began an  Indian brother, a father, came to me and said: "Bishop Ruiz,  what is going on? My son always obeys me, but he has taken off  on me. He is off to liberation, to freedom." It was so discreet  that not even families themselves knew who was in the movement  or not.    We obviously noticed certain signs. To tell them that what  they were thinking was crazy was not possible in historical  terms, because desperation is stronger than idleness. We only  knew very hypothetically what towns or municipalities they were  in. We thought that they were confined to a quite limited area,  but in the last few months of the year we got a broader, more  alarming picture.    As late as 4 November, when this sacred national emblem was  presented to me, I submitted to the authorities the latest  report by our Human Rights Center, listing all of the awful  violations that had been committed up to then. I put it there  along with a medal of the Virgin of Guadalupe. We always made  this effort, but they operated so discreetly, I repeat, that  although we noticed certain signs, we were never able to see  that the movement had external leadership, though I think there  is some internal leadership as well. But we cannot therefore  say: This is the leadership that is responsible for the  reasoning that the Indians are doing about their own  hunger-stricken conditions. [end of Ruiz remarks]    Deputy Jorge Tovar of the PPS then asked whether there had  been mass bombardments of the population. Samuel Ruiz replied  that he had heard of them from parishioners in several towns:    "We do not know how many people died there. We were told of  four missing persons in just one community, but I do not know  whether they have reappeared. Deputy Blanca Ruth Esponda has  told us that we all have to work together to prevent violence.  But there is a kind of violence that has nothing to do with the  violence of weaponry. It is the other kind of violence, which we  have already made a custom, which we have thoroughly accepted,  for which we too are to blame: institutionalized violence."    Bishop Suarez Rivera spoke up to say that based on Monsignor  Ruiz's explanation, the Zapatist movement is made up of people  from Chiapas, "but there must also be people from outside  Mexico."    "Monsignor Ruiz himself was telling us that in the past  there  were suspicions that Fidel Castro Ruiz himself (laughter)...Ruiz  and some other people were here...."    Ruiz remarked that people still think that the Indians are  mentally retarded: "During the Indian Congress we had to select  among 50 candidates who wanted to be translators, all of whom  spoke four or five languages besides Spanish. I am giving this  background so you know what we are talking about."    He reported that 23 percent of the Guatemalans in the  refugee  camps have relatives or close friends in Chiapas, according to  official figures, and that after their first return to their  country, 43 percent had become Mexican.    "In short, what we have seen so far is that there is a  single  presence and leadership (the EZLN), represented by Subcommander  Marcos. There may be some foreigners, we do not deny this, but  we would be getting off the track if we thought that since the  word for `hunger' in Tzotzil and Tzeltal is `huinal' and Marxism  calls it class struggle, they mean the same thing."    In response to a question from PRI [Institutional  Revolutionary Party] Deputy Alvaro Salazar, Samuel Ruiz  explained how he came to be the mediator in the armed conflict  in Chiapas:    "I hastened to give my response because I had already  offered  to do it. Rigoberta Menchu called me up and said: `Did you hear  what happened?' I became alarmed: `What happened?' `Haven't you  read LA JORNADA?' `No, it hasn't come yet. It's four in the  afternoon. What happened?, tell me,' I asked her anxiously. She  said: `Well, there's a communique, a fax, proposing me, you, and  Julio Scherer as intermediaries.' So, I then tried to get in  touch with Julio. He was not in. I left him a message...I would  have liked for us to agree on a joint statement about the  situation. Because no one received a direct communique, it  seems. They did not ask me in writing to mediate. Therefore, I  replied not to what they should have sent but to what appeared  in the press, because I reacted to the communique.    "When they were here at city hall, it would have been  extremely simple, but by the time I offered to mediate, the  Zapatists had already left the city. It would have been easy; I  was just a few steps away, and communication with the people was  extraordinarily good. I gave my sermon on the last day of the  year, summarizing the pope's words and talking very vigorously  about democracy and peace, without realizing that peace was  going to give way to shooting at midnight...."    At the meeting with the deputies and senators Bishop Samuel  Ruiz also stated that he had definite suspicions ("I think that  these suspicions are strongly confirmed") that there was no  fighting in several communities "because the people there are  Zapatists in their hearts, although they do not belong. Let us  consider how bad the conditions are and to what extent the  Indians have progressed. How could this have not exploded years  ago, don't you think?"    He then gave another lengthy explanation of the religious  conflict between Catholics and Evangelicals in Chiapas. He said  that the problem did not arise just a year or two ago; it has  been awaiting a solution for 20 years: "It should be made clear  that both Catholics and Evangelicals have been displaced by the  caciques, who wear religious masks but obviously have political  and financial interests. I have my theory. I could be wrong, but  we can see that Chiapas is the political springboard for  Mexico's Indian movement."    According to Ruiz, the cause of the conflict is the fact  that  the sects clearly identify those who do not belong to them and  have very odd recruitment methods and that some of their members  talk about the people whom they fail to recruit with remarks  like "they're children of the great harlot," "666, the mark of  the beast," and "we're going to burn their little idols on All  Saints Day." The reactions have been brutal.    "It finally got to the point that we refused to let them  into  the religious services on the feast of San Juan Chamula. And  then they called in pseudo-bishops. They said to us in so many  words: We are from the PRI. We have come here to help you. And  we are not going to ask you for anything, no requirements like  the ones Bishop Samuel Ruiz sets."    He said that "other interested parties arrived later.  Initially there were 40 people, and later 200, working as spies  who followed the Chamulas during their Catholic services and  putting their names on a black list. There was a little bit of  everything: jailings, torture, killings, taxes, looting,  robberies."    "Although the number seems exaggerated, there are 25,000  Chamulas living outside their communities, Catholics and  Evangelicals, who preferred to stick to their convictions rather  than hold onto their belongings. Our Chamula brothers have borne  witness to their martyrdom."    Samuel Ruiz recalled that the pastoral action of San  Cristobal diocese has also been blamed for the lack of unity  among indigenous communities. He related the following anecdote,  involving the Chamula mayor and an Indian:    "Domingo, you have to be patient. You know that things are  being taken care of."    "We have been patient for 20 years, sir. Right now our  patience has not run out on us yet. What we are running out of  is room to live."    Bishop Gonzalez Martinez said that since the middle of last  century the authorities have been encouraging the arrival of  [Protestant] religious sects in order to weaken the Catholic  Church.    "This event has changed Mexico, and we hope that people  realize now that in the specific case of Chiapas all sectors  must pay attention but also that we have to somehow change the  political situation in the state and find common ground among  all of the sectors in the state, above all to improve the living  conditions of the population," said PRD [Party of the Democratic  Revolution] Deputy Jorge Moscoso.    He said that he was convinced that the members of the EZLN  "are making a very difficult contribution that is being heavily  criticized for its methods but not its causes. No one in this  country has denounced the underlying causes of this situation.  So then, when all is said and done, this obliges us lawmakers  and bishops to get together and create a new framework in the  country."    PRD Deputy Jesus Martin del Campo explained that the  presence  of the lawmakers in San Cristobal de las Casas could do much to  reinforce the effort and develop a solution that would prevent  more Mexicans from dying in this conflict.    Bishop Adolfo Suarez:    "I would like to emphasize, as Bishop Arizmendi was saying  here, that only certain sectors in the state are being protected  because they are the ones whose voices can exert the most  influence. The most vulnerable sectors, such as the ones that we  have found in Chiapas, very specifically the Indian people, have  even been excluded from legislation that would more justly  acknowledge the value of their cultures, their values, and their  contribution to the country."    Bishop Carlos Talavera:    "Economic democracy, social democracy, and cultural  democracy  have already been mentioned. It seems to me that if we really  want a shift towards democracy, it must happen in all aspects of  life. I, for example, ask myself: Why are there caciques? Why?  And why can't we do anything about them?"    Bishop Raul Vera:    "In order to really begin building a more participatory  society, which would be the start of a true democracy, in order  to really bring about change in Chiapas and throughout the  country, we have to make a personal conversion, a change of  mind-set, whereby we value the whole individual as an  individual, and these individuals themselves can be major  players, in their own sphere and with their own resources, to  help exalt our country."</p>

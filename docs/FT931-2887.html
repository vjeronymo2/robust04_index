			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Iceland mounts bank rescue ICELAND'S government is rescuing Landsbanki, the country's largest bank, through a IKr4.25bn (Dollars 68m) support package in the face of the bank's soaring credit losses. State-owned Landsbanki has suffered badly from the Icelandic recession and in particular from the sharp downturn in the fishing and fish processing industries. It has set aside IKr5.8bn provisions for credit losses, and its international capital adequacy ratio has fallen below 8 per cent. Results due out in the next two weeks are expected to show a substantial loss. Half of the IKr4.25bn injection will be in the form of subordinated debt while the other half will be equity.</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Power companies await the crunch - A dilemma for investors Shareholders have been showered with statistics by the 14 regional power companies in England, Wales and Scotland during the past month's results season. But the question uppermost in their minds remains unanswered. They need to know how tough Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, will be in his coming review of price controls covering the companies' distribution businesses. His response is expected in the next month or so. The controls will, more than any other single factor, determine the profitability of the 12 England and Wales companies for the immediate future and will have a significant, although less powerful, impact on the two Scottish companies. Distribution - getting power into homes and commercial premises - accounts for more than 80 per cent of profits for the England and Wales companies, 40 per cent of Scottish Power and 20 per cent of Scottish Hydro-Electric. But the Scottish companies also are facing a review of their supply businesses, which buy and sell electricity. All this explains why the sector's shares have been falling in price more than the market in the past couple of months, even though most results for 1993-94 have been at the top end of City expectations. The companies have recorded impressive profits in the four years since they were privatised - those in England and Wales have outperformed the market by at least 65 per cent, and the Scots by about 20 per cent - and investors have had a far better return than they could have expected at the start. Helped by vigorous cost-cutting and improved efficiency, most of the results this month showed the companies had, once again, been able to boost percentage pre-tax profit growth well into the 'teens and increase dividends by between 11 per cent (Scottish Power and Hydro-Electric) and 19.8 per cent (Eastern). Even those companies that reported a decline in pre-tax profits were able to satisfy the City as to the reasons. The figure of Pounds 51m for East Midlands in 1993-94 was about Pounds 100m down on 1992-93, but that was because of Pounds 130m of exceptional costs associated with retailing and problems of diversification. Consumers have benefited from privatisation through improved service and price reductions. Yet, many feel there has not been enough progress. So, what will Littlechild do? The signs from his Birmingham office are that he will be reasonably severe on the companies in England and Wales but less so on the two in Scotland. They have been regulated more tightly since privatisation, partly because they were floated later when the government had more experience. The degree of severity, however, is a matter of vigorous debate among investment house analysts. John Wilson, of UBS, does not like any of the England and Wales companies and recommends clients to sell shares in all of them. He feels the best of a bad bunch are Eastern, Midlands, South Wales and Yorkshire, which could be held. But he much prefers the Scottish companies. Wilson predicts all the England and Wales companies will have to cut their distribution prices - which make up about a quarter of final electricity bills - by an average of 17 to 20 per cent from next April. The Scots may be allowed to raise prices or keep them steady. Wilson also expects that Littlechild will require all the companies, including the Scots, to raise prices only by the rate of inflation minus 3 or 4 per cent - which, in some years, will mean cuts. He bases his figures on the assumption that the regulator will stick to his policy of calculating assets - the value of which will help to determine prices - as the market value of the companies shortly after flotation. This value (about Pounds 8bn) is considerably less than the book value of Pounds 11 to Pounds 12bn which the companies estimate as the cost of replacing their assets. The logic of using flotation values is that they represent the asset price on which shareholders expected a fair return before it became clear that the companies were going to be far more efficient than they were before being privatised. Most investment houses are expecting a less severe outcome, though. Nick Pink, analyst at SG Warburg Securities, predicts distribution price cuts for the England and Wales companies at about 10 per cent, and expects future rises to be held to inflation minus 3 per cent. Warburg believes, however, that the companies' ability to lower dividend cover and continue cutting costs will allow those in England and Wales to increase dividends by at least 4 per cent above inflation during the period of review. Scottish real growth could be 5 per cent real. Warburg recommends buying shares in Southern, Yorkshire, London, Manweb and Eastern, and holds for the rest. At Hoare Govett, Nigel Hawkins forecasts dividend growth of 6 per cent real for the England and Wales companies. He recommends Manweb, Seeboard, Norweb, Midlands and Southern as buys.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- REGIONAL ELECTRICITY COMPANIES  --------------------------------------------------------------------             Pre-tax Profits (Pounds m)   Net dividends (pence)                    1994       1993         1994      1993  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Eastern           176.8      183.4         23.0      19.2 East Midlands      51.2      155.1         22.7      19.5 London            186.5      145.5         22.5      19.5 Manweb            126.0      111.2         24.4      21.0 Midlands          195.4      167.1         23.2      20.0 Northern          128.7      111.4         24.8      21.4 Norweb            178.3      157.1         23.0      20.0 Seeboard          131.7      112.7         11.8      10.0 Southern          222.0      187.3         22.7      19.6 South Wales       104.0       87.0         25.6      22.3 South Western     116.8      101.1         23.5      20.0 Yorkshire         149.0      156.3         23.5      20.4  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

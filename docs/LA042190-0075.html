			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'TOO MUCH' GATHERS NOT ENOUGH FOR SOME  </P> <P> In a letter on April 15, Jon K. Evans stated, "Hank Gathers died of greed" and  berated The Times for the excellent, thoughtful, well-balanced, four-page  article on Hank's life and tragic death. If Hank Gathers had been greedy, he  would have opted for the NBA last year when he became only the second player in  NCAA history to lead the nation in rebounding and scoring.  </P> <P> He returned to school primarily because his mother wanted him to obtain his  degree.  </P> <P> A greedy man would have taken the easy million-dollar insurance settlement.  Hank was greedy only of electing to pursue his lifelong dream of playing in the  NBA despite risks to his life. "A little too much on Hank Gathers," Mr. Evans?  For those who knew him, watched him play, or merely read about him with  compassion and understanding, four pages were not nearly enough.  </P> <P> JAMES J. SALZ, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Rates rebates help John Lewis to 74% advance John Lewis Partnership, the employee-owned department store and supermarket group, yesterday provided further evidence of the turnround in its fortunes with a 74 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 16.4m to Pounds 28.6m for the half year to July 30. The increase was flattered by the receipt of rates rebates following successful appeals against valuations of some stores this year. Last year's figures were also depressed by exceptional costs relating to the start-up of a Waitrose distribution centre and an accelerated depreciation charge on check-out equipment. John Lewis refused to give figures for the exceptional items, but said that taking them into account, the underlying increase in pre-tax profits was about 33 per cent. Trading profits, after pension costs, increased from Pounds 28.5m to Pounds 40.8m, while interest charges rose slightly from Pounds 12m to Pounds 12.1m. Mr Stuart Hampson, chairman, said strong sales increases in the group's 22 department stores and 109 Waitrose supermarkets, as well as in its textile and furniture manufacturing businesses, coupled with costs held at last year's level, were responsible for the improved performance. 'We should be well pleased with the progress made in improving our profit,' he said, although he advised partners to 'keep their feet firmly on the ground'. He added that this week's rise in interest rates had not changed his view that 'national economic conditions look set fair - not too much growth, not too little', but the rail strike was disrupting sales. Group sales for the half year increased from Pounds 1.13bn to Pounds 1.19bn. Sales in the department stores increased by 6.5 per cent to Pounds 567.3m (Pounds 532.5m). Mr Hampson said the stores had 'weathered the anticipated storm of the April tax increases' and furniture sales had been particularly strong. Sales in the Waitrose supermarket chain increased by 3.8 per cent from Pounds 577.3m to Pounds 599.3m. Only 0.5 percentage points of the increase was accounted for by inflation, with one new store opening during the period. Mr Hampson said the installation of check-out scanning in many stores had had a positive impact on sales, and Waitrose would also benefit from the decision to open stores on Sundays following the partial deregulation of Sunday opening. Three new stores will open during the second half. Sales in the wholesaling and manufacturing division increased from Pounds 17.6m to Pounds 21.3m, with sales outside the partnership up 20 per cent.</p>

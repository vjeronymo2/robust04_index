			<p>CSO     [Text] Asia is about to become the second-largest market  for loans from Japanese banks after North America. The reason is  that loans to governments, businesses, and projects have  increased sharply. According to international financial sources,  loan balances of Japanese banks stratified by region indicate  that, as of the end of 1993, they stood at about 25 percent for  Asia, rising substantially from the 19 percent at the end of  1990. Loans to Europe dropped from 32 percent to 27 percent.  Capital requirements in China and Southeast Asia for the  construction of social-manufacturing infrastructure have  increased and the higher yen has encouraged the continuing  exodus of Japanese bank clients' operations to Asia, signaling a  situation in which loan balances for Asia will exceed those of  Europe sometime during fiscal year 1994.    Loans outstanding at branches of principal Japanese banks,  including city banks, long-term credit banks, trust banks, and  leading regional banks were highest for North America,  comprising about 40 percent since 1990. In contrast,  recessionary conditions and businesses' actions to reduce debt  combined to effect a gradual reduction in the share of European  loan balances in comparison to the sharp increase in loans to  Asia.    Among individual leading Japanese banks, overseas loans  outstanding at Mitsubishi Bank converted to U.S. dollars as of  February were 35 percent each for both Asia and Europe, while  Sanwa Bank reveals that "Loans outstanding to Asia are nearing  the balance outstanding for Europe." Among leading city banks,  growth at some banks in fiscal year 1992 of three percent grew  sharply by a rate of over 10 percent for the 12-month period of  fiscal year 1993 alone.    In the case of Japanese banks, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank  officials  say, Asian regional loans "are not large on an individual case  basis, but margins are higher than in the United States and  Europe, leading to higher profitability." Recently, major  project loans have been noticeable for such items as petroleum  refinery construction projects in Thailand. Sources at Bank of  Tokyo provide the assessment that, "If the role of financial  adviser to large projects can be acquired, such appointments can  lead not only to the handling of loans, but to work including  underwriting of securities and acquisition of settlement  accounts, providing for expansion of profit-making  opportunities." Arrangements of that nature enable leading banks  to participate in corporate operations beginning with the  initial stages of business planning to actual operation of the  businesses.    Leading Japanese banks have already established their  overseas lending programs for fiscal year 1994. Sakura Bank  expects to increase loans outstanding to North America by 3  percent, while increasing the balance for Asia by 7-8 percent.</p>

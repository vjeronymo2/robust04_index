			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SOUTH EL MONTE;  </P> <P> RECALL PETITIONS TARGET 3  </P> <P> Critics of recent City Council actions say they will start collecting  signatures next week for the recall petitions they have filed with the city  clerk, charging Mayor Albert Perez and City Councilmen Stan Quintana and Art  Olmos with "corrupt practices" and "immoral spending."  </P> <P> Members of South El Monte Citizens Advocating Recall cited a vote for a  controversial trash hauling contract, the approval of the sale of federal and  county aid to other cities and support for layoffs of key middle management  personnel in the city.  </P> <P> The three elected officials denied that they were corrupt or wasteful. The  charges are "trumped up" and "gross distortions," Perez said. He added that the  recall effort is being financed by "a few disgruntled industrialists" who have  been stymied by city officials in expanding "obnoxious" industrial operations,  such as a smelter.  </P> <P> The City Council voted 3 to 0 last month to give Modern Service Co. an  exclusive rubbish hauling franchise, despite complaints from competing haulers.  Last year, the council approved the sale of part of its allocation of federal  Community Development Block Grant funds to the City of West Covina, and it  approved a 27% raise for City Manager Raul Romero after four other city  employees had been terminated.  </P> <P> If the dissidents begin the signature-gathering campaign as scheduled next  week, they will have 90 days, until mid-May, to collect the 1,253 signatures  necessary to put the measure on the ballot.  </P></p>

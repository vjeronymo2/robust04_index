			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by Heimar Lenk--from the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] From the first meeting, the most important question  for the Estonian side has been the withdrawal of Russian troops  from the republic and the most important for the Russian side  has been the protection of its citizens on the territory of  independent Estonia. Evidently neither of the sides intends to  retreat from their initial positions. Estonia has not softened  its conditions for local Russians to receive Estonian  citizenship. Russia, just as it promised three years ago,  intends to withdraw its troops by September this year, at the  same time it demands normal living conditions for military  pensioners who wish to stay and live in Estonia.    Commenting on the present situation, Estonian Foreign  Minister Juri Luik noted that Russia does not yet accept Estonia  as an equal partner. The concern of Tallinn politicians is  understandable since Russia, even after the withdrawal of its  troops, will still have a powerful weapon to influence Estonia's  policies -- the almost half a million strong Russian-speaking  community that has not yet received Estonian citizenship and is,  therefore, under Russia's particular attention.    So, although the talks are not justifying the hopes, it is  not worth breaking them off either, the Estonian Foreign  Ministry considers.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / BR sell-off plan suffers pensions blow in Lords: Treasury move to cut financial obligations blocked GOVERNMENT PLANS to priv-atise British Rail suffered another embarrassing reverse yesterday after it was defeated in the House of Lords over safeguards for the industry's pension fund. The defeat, along with a forced concession from the Department of Transport to guarantee the future solvency of the pension fund and its obligations to pensioners, blocked the Treasury's efforts to reduce its financial obligations. It also underlined the prospects of a damaging political row - and the risk of further government defeats - when the privatisation legislation returns to the House of Commons in 10 days. Rebel Conservative MPs are threatening to back an earlier Lords' amendment to the bill which would give BR the right to bid for the franchises under which the network will be gradually privatised. That would undercut a central element in the government's plans. The signs last night were that the rebel MPs may also support the Lords over pension fund safeguards if the government seeks to overturn the new guarantees in a vote in the Commons. The government's latest defeat centred on its plans to water down its obligation to Trustees of the BR fund on the Treasury's contributions to the pension. The Lords passed an amendment tabled by Lord Peyton, a former Conservative transport minister, which will reimpose an obligation on the government to secure written agreement of the trustees before altering its financial commitments. Earlier Lord Caithness, the transport minister, had argued that the amendment would effectively give the pension fund managers a veto over government expenditure, insisting that the obligation should be only to 'consult' with the trustees. But amid charges from the BR trustees that the government was seeking to renege on the provisions of a memorandum of understanding it had signed in July on the future of the fund, Lord Peyton's amendment was passed by 152 to 123 votes. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, was also forced to accept a demand from the Lords that the provisions of the memorandum of understanding should be incorporated into the privatisation legislation to guarantee the future solvency of the fund and the rights of pensioners. Opposition parties hailed the defeat as a step forward in ensuring the rights of present and former BR employees. Rail unions fear assault on pay, Page 10</p>

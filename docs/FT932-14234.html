			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Leading Article: Over-the-top pay TAME non-executive directors sitting on malleable remuneration committees advised by tame pay consultants appear to have pulled off the trick once again. According to the Institute of Management's latest annual salary survey, directors of British companies with a turnover of more than Pounds 600m received average pay rises of 8.6 per cent last year, more than twice the national average. Such is the monotony with which surveys reveal a higher rate of pay inflation in the boardroom than in the world outside that there is a growing risk that no one will notice. Yet notice needs to be taken, because the disparity is symptomatic of much that is wrong with British corporate governance and management. Over the past decade and a half, hidden unemployment has been substantially reduced in the British private sector. Big companies, where boardroom pay inflation is highest, have been net shedders of jobs and employment practice has moved closer to the US hire-and-fire model. This harsher industrial climate is unlikely to be compatible with harmonious labour relations, over the longer run, if there is a perception that the balance of risk and reward is being unevenly shared. The growth of hostile takeover activity and the increasing assertiveness of institutional shareholders have admittedly introduced a modicum of accountability into the British boardroom. The Cadbury report on corporate governance has also made some contribution. But the balance remains uneven. One tell-tale indication is the fact that the highest paid directors in the Institute of Management's survey were in the privatised energy sector, where the average salary was Pounds 110,981. This raises once again the question as to the justification for the large pay increases awarded to directors of newly-privatised companies, notably the utilities. At a more fundamental level, the tendency of companies in the Anglo-Saxon economies to offer much larger pay packages to top executives than their opposite numbers in Germany or Japan reflects an exaggerated view of what a single executive can achieve and too little respect for the symbolism of pay relativities between board and shop floor. Much of the problem with existing practice lies in the non-executive directors' shared interest in high levels of executive pay, since so many non-executives are executive directors elsewhere. Within the existing framework of company law, the Cadbury committee was probably right in arguing that the chief discipline must be openness. And in suggesting that the chairman of the remuneration committee should answer to shareholders at annual general meetings, Cadbury provides a constructive weapon to shareholders. It would have been still more constructive if the committee had been less timid in its disclosure recommendations. But institutional shareholders should not hesitate to make the most of it.</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Books: Tuned into the arts PAYING THE PIPER by Sir Alan Peacock EUP Pounds 30.50, Pounds 12.50 pb, 168 pages This is a fascinating book, filled with tables of statistics and musical anecdotes. If the two sound incompatible, that chimes with the career and character of the author. He describes leaving a cheerful lunch whilst Chief Economic Adviser to the DTI. On hearing a two-note fanfare of minor thirds uttered by a passing ambulance, he competes with his host in identifying 12 other themes that begin with minor thirds - from 'Colonel Bogey' to the Quartet from the first act of Fidelio. A rare competition for a mandarin. The centre-piece of the book is the Orchestral Resources Enquiry of 1969-70. Sir Alan Peacock, on the basis of his polymath knowledge of music and free-market economics, was commissioned by Lord Goodman, then chairman of the Arts Council of Great Britain, to head the enquiry. His committee, full of maestri, listened to a dialogue of the deaf orchestra managers who damned modern composers; composers who regarded the audience as necessary for acoustic reasons only; conductors who thought the orchestra was becoming a museum piece. The enquiry produced two particularly controversial recommendations: earnings in regional orchestras were to be raised to the same level as those for London; and direct subsidies were to be given to only two out of the four London orchestras. Peacock describes with relish how the main recommendations were thrown out by the Arts Council even in advance of publication. How familiar it all sounds, a generation later and not long after Peter Palumbo and Anthony Everitt bit the dust following similar attempts to reform the organisation and subsidies of the London orchestras] Peacock, though, is not a man given to falling on his sword. He went on to become a member of the Arts Council himself and chairman of the Scottish Arts Council. He compiles a delicious fantasy of complaints from dissatisfied Scottish arts organisations: 'Take Glasgow-based clients. They're a funny lot. Some don't make moan at all and seem almost trusting, and others write you polished letters which you know mean the Glasgae equivalent of 'A'll smash yer face in'. Edinburgh is different; very sniffy letters with postscripts like 'I would have you know that my Chairman is the brother-in-law of the Secretary of State's cook' - menacing words presaging a sleepless night for me.' He goes on to describe his vain attempts to design a policy that would eventually have put the Arts Councils out of business and helped the arts to become largely self-supporting: a triumph of hope over experience. He had a few successes - for example his Young Scots' Card that gave young people discounts to Art Centres all over Scotland and that he saw as a preliminary to vouchers entitling consumers to reductions in the price of cultural goods chosen from an Arts Council list. He wished to see public perception of the arts translated into the power of the consumer to choose which art-form to support. There is a gentler side to Peacock's cultural economics. He quotes with approval the comment of two American professors that, 'few of us are willing to take the responsibility of passing on to future generations a country whose beauty has been destroyed'. I suspect that this romanticism underlies the apparent harshness of much of Peacock's free-market approach. Peacock has a capacity for irritating experts. The forthrightness of his views and his natural iconoclasm are evident in Paying the Piper, which is compulsory reading for anyone entering the field of arts sponsorship. I trust Lord Gowrie will buy a copy and keep it under this pillow when he inherits, upon April Fool's Day, the mantle of Lords Goodman and Palumbo at the Arts Council. It will help him succeed.</p>

The result indicates a  traditionally high level of popularity, one that cannot be  achieved by other institutions or any individual in Bulgaria!    The president, who enjoys the confidence of 49 percent of  the  respondents, continues to lead the list of politicians, followed  by Aleksandur Tomov, Georgi Pirinski, and Lyuben Berov. The  police maintain the popularity figure of 43 percent that they  reached at the end of last year. Of those polled, 27 percent  have faith in the government, while parliament's rating  continues to be low -- only 12 percent. Despite this, more than  half of the 19 most popular politicians are National Assembly  deputies.</p>

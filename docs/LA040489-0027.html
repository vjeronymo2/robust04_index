			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> A PITCHED BATTLE IN 'THE DALLAS DRUG WAR' ON PBS  </P> <P> There isn't much in "The Dallas Drug War," tonight's edition of "Frontline"  (9-10 p.m. on Channels 28 and 15, 10-11 p.m. on Channel 50), that will be new  to anyone who lives in a large American city and watches television. But this  investigation of all that troubles poverty-stricken, drug-stricken south Dallas  (where most of the city's minority population lives) is so thorough that it  might put your view of the issues into fresh perspective.  </P> <P> Producer Hector Galan's camera sweeps over the entire panorama of "the war  zone," and all sorts of voices are heard -- from frightened, disgusted  residents to the police and politicians to the drug dealers themselves.  </P> <P> There are the crime-show segments you'd expect: on-camera raids and arrests, a  gun battle that rages outside a black family's house. But then we follow one of  the members of that family as she tries to express her desperation to a City  Council that seems so jaded to the crisis that the effort only adds to the  feeling of futility.  </P> <P> Even bleaker is what we learn about those given the chief burden of doing  something about drug-related crime -- the city's Police Department. We ride  with policemen who point out apartments they say are definitely crack houses,  and we see people in them and milling around them. Then we see police raid an  alleged crack house . . . and it turns out to be completely abandoned. The  camera crew catches people selling drugs and even holding regular gun battles,  but the police can't. What's going on here?  </P> <P> It's a vicious circle of a system that outlaws drugs and then cannot enforce  the laws, and the principal victims are the residents of the black  neighborhoods. The program returns to them in its slightly redundant final 15  minutes, focusing on the attempts of some to scare off crack dealers by forming  marching citizens' groups.  </P> <P> There's a glimmer of hope in this, and in the recent hiring of a new, possibly  more efficient and intelligent police chief. But all in all, the cure seems to  be killing the patient as much as the disease, and "The Dallas Drug War" paints  a picture of utter hopelessness, spiraling downwards. TERRY ATKINSON  </P></p>

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Letter: Criticism obscures complex issues faced by UN Sir, Mr Nicholas Hinton (Personal View, February 5) is right to be concerned about the international response to the massive humanitarian emergencies of the last two years. But his condemnation of the United Nations agencies is way off the mark and obscures one of the most complex issues facing the world today. Humanitarian crises caused by drought or natural disaster are difficult enough to address in most developing countries. But the crises Mr Hinton focuses on - not least the former Yugoslavia and Somalia - are infinitely harder to deal with, as these are rooted in complex and violent political conflicts. In these crises, it is mainly the Security Council, and not United Nations agencies, which has the key role in mustering international resolve and support to bring an end to the conflict, and create an environment in which humanitarian assistance can be delivered. The Security Council has, in fact, made a number of historic decisions in these crises. In Somalia, the council's actions - which included the deployment of 30,000 international troops - have enabled the international community to provide substantial relief from violence and hunger. The troop deployment of December yielded immediate results largely because UN agencies, along with the International Committee of the Red Cross and non-governmental organisations, had been striving for some time to establish emergency relief operations in Somalia. And this was done in an environment so hostile that relief workers themselves were targeted by warring factions. Contrary to Mr Hinton's assertions, the secretary-general is undertaking restructuring measures designed to make the UN more responsive to today's global challenges, including the need to provide effective emergency humanitarian assistance. UN agencies are also seeking new and imaginative ways to improve their humanitarian response capacity, including the involvement of non-governmental organisations in humanitarian strategies. But a much wider effort, with the active support of member states, is needed to establish effective mechanisms for limiting the human suffering caused by the kind of bitter, largely ethnic, strife now sweeping the globe. Mr Hinton's criticism belies the complexity and the dilemma which the UN faces today. Too many of our staff have sacrificed their lives in the struggle to provide relief to the helpless for anyone to believe that the UN does not take its humanitarian responsibilities seriously. Indeed, the UN's relevance in this new international environment will, in large measure, be determined by how it discharges those responsibilities.

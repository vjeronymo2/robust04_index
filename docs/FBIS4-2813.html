			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 14 (XINHUA) -- International  mediators David Owen and Thorvals Stoltenberg visited Sarajevo  on Wednesday [13 April] in a bid to resume the Bosnian peace  process and break the deadlock between Bosnian Serbs and the UN  peacekeeping forces since the NATO air strikes, political  commentators said.    After a meeting with EU mediator Owen and his UN Counterpart  Stoltenberg, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic told reporters  that Serbs would continue to participate in the peace process  but refuse to accept those who ordered air strikes against Serb  positions as international mediators.    Karadzic said that it is time for the EU to return to help  solve the Bosnia conflict because the United States has sided  with the Muslims and is directly involved in the Bosnia civil  war.    The United States has become a major mediator in the Bosnian  peace process since early last month when an agreement in  principle was reached on the U.S.-proposed Muslim-Croatia  Federation. The EU- proposed peace plan for Bosnia and  international mediators Owen and Stoltenberg have been desolated  since.    However, after the NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb  positions near the Muslim enclave of Gorazde on April 10 and 11,  Serbs announced that they were suspending all contact with UN  peacekeeping forces, especially the commander of the  peacekeeping forces in Bosnia Michael Rose, who ordered the air  strikes.    As the peace process was stalled, Owen and Stoltenberg came  to Sarajevo. Observers say their visit will show the Bosnian  peace process cannot proceed without the EU.</p>

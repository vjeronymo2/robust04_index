			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: Profits at Sharp fall by 36% to Y26bn SHARP, the Japanese electronics company, yesterday reported a 36.2 per cent fall in parent pre-tax profits to Y26.27bn (Dollars 215.32m) in the first half to September. Sharp will be followed today by other electronics companies, including NEC, Fujitsu and Matsushita Electric Industrial, whose interim results are likely to be much worse. Sharp's fall was stemmed by relatively strong sales of office and industrial equipment and components, including liquid crystal display screens, where Sharp is the world's leading manufacturer. Sales in this area advanced by 5 per cent to Y285.8bn. Total sales fell 3.4 per cent to Y583.6bn, led by a 6.4 per cent decline in domestic sales to Y304.4bn. Sales of television and video equipment fell 11.6 per cent to Y134bn. Audio and communication equipment sales fell 21 per cent to Y56.2bn. Home appliance sales were relatively stable, off 1 per cent to Y107bn. Net profits dropped 39 per cent to Y14.5bn. Sharp projected full-year pre-tax profits of Y53bn, a fall of 25 per cent.</p>

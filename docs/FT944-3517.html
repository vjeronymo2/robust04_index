			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Customs goes behind frontiers - In a Nutshell The UK's Customs and Excise is introducing a new procedure aimed at streamlining imports and export procedures. Instead of checking for fiscal and regulatory matters at frontiers, Customs officers will move surveillance to importers' and exporters' premises, which will be visited sporadically. This, Customs and Excise says, will save time for traders who develop a record of complying with the filing requirements. The first companies to be covered by the new system will be included in a pilot system to be introduced in 1996.</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Berlusconi earns short break in the sun: But his political and economic problems are not set to go away For the first time this summer, it looks as though Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, can relax and enjoy a few days at the seaside resort of Portofino, near Genoa. After the turbulence of last Thursday and Friday, Italian financial markets were calm yesterday - either snoozing after the Monday bank holiday, or tranquilised by television pictures at the weekend of Mr Berlusconi arm-in-arm with Mr Umberto Bossi, his coalition partner and principal critic, in the garden of the prime minister's villa near Milan. The main Italian equity indices rose by 1.4 per cent yesterday, bond yields were almost unchanged, and the Italian lira stabilised at around L1,023 against the D-Mark, ahead of yesterday's US Federal Reserve meeting. Dire warnings of a Black Tuesday to follow Black Thursday and Friday did not materialise. Analysts, however, warned that by patching up the cracks which had appeared in the governing coalition, Mr Berlusconi had only won his government a breathing space. 'Bossi and Berlusconi being friends again is not going to solve the issue; it's just a palliative,' said Mr Andrea Ruggeri of Goldman Sachs yesterday. The issue, in this case, is how the government will tackle the country's looming public debt, which stands at about 120 per cent of gross domestic product. Last month, the government confirmed that it would aim to cut the deficit from L154,000bn (Pounds 62.4bn) this year, to L138,600bn in 1995, but it postponed key decisions on the detail of budget measures until September, to the disappointment of industry and investors. That partly explains why markets reacted so nervously last week to indications that all was not well in the government coalition. Apart from Mr Bossi's well-publicised criticisms of alleged political misjudgments, some ministers hinted they would not accept the heavy cuts in pensions spending, needed if Italy is to balance its books. The efforts of the Bank of Italy to defend the currency with half-point interest rate rises on Thursday evening turned out in the end to be counter-productive, although the move may have served to remind the prime minister that firm action will be necessary to avoid further rate rises. Mr Berlusconi has had to work hard in order to achieve even the latest fragile political peace, using all his experience as a media magnate to soothe the Italian people, first with a series of you've-never-had-it-so-good television interviews on Friday night, then with the ostensibly good-humoured garden press conference with Mr Bossi on Saturday. In the meantime, he and his aides have continued to whip less co-operative coalition members into line with firm hints that opposition to the government is unpatriotic, and dark warnings that allies of the left, disgruntled after losing the March general election, are pulling against the interests of the country. Even with this effort, some observers pointed out yesterday that the markets had merely frozen at the levels reached at the end of last week, rather than recovered, as Mr Berlusconi might have hoped. 'There's a lot of indecision in the marketplace after the holiday, but the tone hasn't really changed,' said Mr Carlo Cimino of the Milan investment firm Aloisio Foglia Ventura. In the longer term, most analysts are still broadly optimistic about the Italian economy, and if Mr Berlusconi can win round his coalition allies to support a tough budget for 1995, they say he will be rewarded. For the time being, however, in line with the holiday spirit, the markets are simply treading water. World stock markets, Page 29</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: First-half profits at Intracom up to Dr6.7bn INTRACOM, the Greek telecoms equipment manufacturer in which Ericsson of Sweden holds a minority stake, lifted after-tax profits for the first half of 1993 to Dr6.7bn (Dollars 27.9m), from Dr3.5bn last year. Turnover rose from Dr13.12bn to Dr30.95bn over the same period. The results were consolidated to include the company's subsidiaries in software production, electronic games and construction. The company said completion of contracts for OTE, the Greek state telecommunications company, together with improved sales for its electronic lottery games, contributed to the sharp rise in earnings. Intracom forecasts that earnings this year will be Dr12bn on turnover of Dr70bn. Exports are projected at Dr8bn, led by sales of specialised software packages. The company is involved in a Dr40bn project, partly financed by the European Community, to upgrade switching systems and transmission networks for the Athens urban telephone network. Intracom is expanding its operations in the former Soviet Union, where it has joint ventures for electronic lottery games with Russia and Ukraine. It has signed an Dollars 1.5m agreement to provide new switching systems for 12 cities in Tadjikistan.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tehran, March 27 (AFP) -- An Islamic newspaper on  Sunday accused Armenians of shooting down the Iranian plane  which crashed in war-torn Nagorno-Karabakh killing 34 people and  criticised the government for its silence.    "All the evidence shows that Armenia is responsible for the  tragedy, the most important of which is the fact that the site  of the crash is occupied by Armenian forces," JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI  said.    The C-130 Hercules transport plane was carrying 13 crew  members and 19 relatives of Iranian diplomats in Moscow when it  crashed March 17 near Stepanakert, capital of Nagorno-Karabakh,  an Armenian-majority enclave in Azerbaijan fighting for  independence since 1988.    The plane was on a flight from Moscow to Tehran.    Armenians and Azerbaijanis have accused each other of  shooting down the plane, but Tehran has remained silent pending  an investigation.    Iranian foreign ministry and air force experts have visited  the crash site to investigate the incident.    However, Tehran Radio said Sunday that the investigation  committee had not been able to find the plane's black box.    The team met Armenian Vice President Gagik Arutyunyan in  Yerevan on Saturday and were to leave for Georgia on Sunday and  then on to Azerbaijan to continue their investigation.    A foreign ministry official said last week that the plane  had  exploded in mid-air, denying earlier reports that the crash  resulted from technical problems.    The daily JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI, close to Islamic hardliners,  criticised the ministry for keeping silent and urged it to  "reveal the truth and not allow the Armenian crime to be  eclipsed."    It also urged the government to pressure the Armenians into  accepting responsibility for the "crime" and compensating the  relatives of the victims.    Meanwhile, the English-language TEHRAN TIMES blamed the war  over Nagorno-Karabakh for the "spilling of Iranian blood" in the  crash and urged Armenians to show "goodwill" in accepting an  Iranian-mediated settlement.    More than 20,000 people have been killed in six years of  fighting between Armenians and Azerbaijani forces. Iran has  launched several peace initiatives but without success.</p>

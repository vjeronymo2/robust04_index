			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: Hollinger suffers loss of CDollars 32m in first quarter HOLLINGER, the Canadian listed holding company controlled by Mr Conrad Black, proprietor of the UK's Daily Telegraph newspaper, suffered a first-quarter loss as a result of a write-down in the value of its recently-sold investment in Britain's United Newspapers. Hollinger sold its 9 per cent stake in United Newspapers in April for substantially less than it paid when it started accumulating the shares in early 1989. The first-quarter loss was CDollars 31.7m (USDollars 26.4), or 63 cents a share, against earnings of CDollars 17.4m, or 24 cents, a year earlier. Operating earnings fell to CDollars 6.6m from CDollars 11.3m, due to an CDollars 8.1m jump in tax provisions, while revenues rose 9 per cent to CDollars 209m. Hollinger said the higher tax provision was due to tax loss carry-forwards at the Telegraph in the first half of 1991. Tax rates are likely to be more similar in the second half. Losses from the United sale are likely to be more than offset by gains from the forthcoming public offering of 20m shares in the Telegraph group. The Telegraph issue is expected to raise about Pounds 75m. Hollinger has also recently raised CDollars 135m through the sale of four series of preferred shares in Canada as part of its efforts to reduce debt. Mr Christopher Ondaatje, the Canadian financier, is bidding to buy back full control of the Toronto investment firm that bears his name, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Mr Ondaatje was a co-founder of Loewen Ondaatje McCutcheon in 1970, and he is offering CDollars 1.80 a share for all the firm's stock. He sold his original stake late in 1987 at CDollars 9 a share. His bid competes with an offer from two Vancouver businessmen who would buy 28 per cent of the LOM shares from five management shareholders at Dollars 1.64 a share.</p>

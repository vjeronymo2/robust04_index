Great changes have taken place in China over the past 15  years, Qiao said during a meeting with Gret Haller, president of  the National Council of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland.    "We will try our best to attain the second strategic goal  and  bring the Chinese people a comparatively comfortable life by the  end of this century," Qiao told Haller.    "Judging from the present situation, we can say that the  goal  is bound to be realized," he said.    Qiao said China's reform measures for 1993 brought about  fruitful results, which are well recognized world-wide.    To maintain its political stability, he said, China should  foster the development of its legal system.    China should draw up many new laws while some of the  existing  laws may need to be revised, he said. The NPC, as the  legislative body, and its Standing Committee, face arduous tasks  in this regard.    In addition, Qiao said, the central and local governments  plan to formulate some badly-needed administrative and local  regulations.    Qiao said China's status as a contracting party to the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has not been  resumed yet, but its economic reform in various fields should be  converged with the commonly used norms and methods in the world.    Haller said that as Switzerland and China are far apart  geographically and differ in culture, the exchanges between the  two countries' parliaments are more important.    Haller, who visited China in 1976, said she very much  admired  the tremendous achievements China has made in economic  development and other fields.    Qiao said he hoped that Haller would visit China again.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by West Europe editor Leonard Doyle: "Dutch Fight </F> EU Code on Secrecy"]    [Text] The Dutch European Affairs Minister yesterday  condemned a new secrecy code restricting access to European  Union [EU] documents as "worse than the behaviour of NATO at the  height of the Cold War."    Piet Dankert spoke as the Dutch government began legal  proceedings at the European Court of Justice, challenging a  Council of Ministers decision greatly restricting public access  to documents.    The Council in December imposed a blanket secrecy order over  a whole range of documents and proposals from the burgeoning  Euro-bureaucracy, despite earlier promises of openness. The  decision caused outrage in the Netherlands, which sees its  much-praised open system of government being eroded by European  integration and the secrecy of the Council.    The "code of conduct" was agreed by majority vote over  Dutch,  Danish and Greek objections, rather than by unanimous assent,  which Mr Dankert says is required for issues affecting European  citizens' rights.    This bout of Euro-censorship has made the EU even less  accessible to citizens than before, Mr Dankert believes, and by  taking the issue to the Court the Netherlands hopes to force a  wider public debate about the secretive nature of the EU.    The Maastricht Treaty put EU justice, foreign, security and  immigration measures outside the reach of national legislatures  and the European parliament. Now the latest gagging order has  smothered hopes of more accountability. Ironically, these were  expressed in a Council document, which hoped that the public  would in future be given "the widest possible access to  documents held by the Commission and the Council."    What began as a U.S.-style Freedom of Information Act to  grant widespread public access to all documents except where  public safety, monetary stability, privacy, the EU's foreign  policy, commercial and industrial secrets were involved, was  overturned by objections from Britain and Germany. Instead, a  sweeping catch-all provision was inserted allowing the EU to  refuse requests for information that are deemed "contrary to the  efficiency and good order of the institution."    The Dutch government, alone in the EU, provides its  parliament with copies of confidential documents so that debates  can take place before decisions are taken by the EU. This is in  sharp contrast to Westminster and other EU parliaments where the  general rule is that confidential Council documents are never  made available to parliamentarians.</p>

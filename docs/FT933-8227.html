			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / AT&amp;T mobilises with record telecoms deal: Andrew Adonis explains why the US industry leader is splashing out on McCaw In June British Telecommunications hailed its Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.6bn) purchase of a 20 per cent stake in MCI, the second largest US operator, as the 'telecommunications deal of the century'. Barely two months later AT&amp;T, the US giant itself, has trumped BT with a Dollars 12bn-plus takeover of McCaw Cellular Communications, one of the leading US mobile phone companies. The size of the deal - the fifth largest in US corporate history - is a shock, but not its nature. AT&amp;T is anxious to re-enter the cellular market, in which it has not played a part as an operator since the break-up of the old Bell company in 1984. Last November it announced an agreement to take a one-third stake in McCaw, with an option to take a majority holding in due course. Cellular subscriber numbers are taking off across the developed world, as mobile phones are marketed as a consumer product for the first time. At the end of 1992 the number of US cellular subscribers was estimated to have reached 11m, a growth of 46 per cent over the year, according to the FT's Mobile Communications newsletter. Revenues from cellular services were Dollars 7.8bn, 38 per cent up on 1991. Growth is expected to be lower this year, but subscriber numbers are likely to increase by more than a third. Mr Bob Allen, AT&amp;T's chairman, says: 'Wireless communications services are absolutely central to AT&amp;T's networking strategy and key to the company's future earnings growth.' McCaw is an obvious target for AT&amp;T. Although heavily indebted and still loss-making, it is the cellular operator with the largest metropolitan population coverage in the US. It is not a fixed-line operator, so poses no obviously insurmountable regulatory hurdles. Under Mr Craig McCaw, its energetic chairman and founder, it has a go-ahead reputation upon which Mr Allen is keen to capitalise. BT owns a stake of 17-18 per cent in McCaw, which it will sell to AT&amp;T as part of the deal. Despite their international rivalry, AT&amp;T is not motivated by any special desire to drive BT out of the US mobile market. AT&amp;T's agreement to buy BT's stake pre-dates BT's purchase of its MCI holding; and the bill for MCI made BT still keener to sell its McCaw shares. Mr Robert Morris, telecommunications analyst with Goldman Sachs, believes two factors decided Mr Allen to go the whole hog at once. First, 'negotiations with Craig McCaw seemed to have reached a bit of an impasse, and both of them recognised that using AT&amp;T's brand name and marketing was likely to add the most value.' Second, 'AT&amp;T saw McCaw's shares appreciating sharply because of what they wanted to do with the company, and they did not want to have pay still more further down the track.' Yesterday, however, Mr Allen was at great pains to stress what AT&amp;T did not intend to do with McCaw. 'We are not interested in re-entering the local telephone business: 99 per cent of all cellular calls go through local telephone companies, and it will be years, if ever, before that changes.' Insofar as cellular communications are still not remotely price competitive with fixed-wire local networks, Mr Allen is stating the obvious. Indeed, new digital networks have pushed handset prices sharply up in the short-term, and non-business usage is still low. Furthermore, there are no obvious regulatory hurdles which might lead AT&amp;T to play down its local ambitions. The 'Baby Bell' companies will renew their complaints about their exclusion from the long-distance market, but the 1984 divestiture left AT&amp;T free to operate in the cellular business, although it will have to apply to the Federal Communications Commission to transfer the operating licence in states where cellular is regulated. However, cellular is undeniably an alternative to fixed-line local networks, and one set to become more significant as mobile telephony spreads and its costs reduce. AT&amp;T's rivals may rightly fear its potential in the wireless business - not least through its capacity to market cellular services as part of 'all-in' packages for businesses and residential customers. To that extent, the McCaw takeover also highlights AT&amp;T's problem as a potential competitor to its own customers. As a telecommunications manufacturer AT&amp;T is a principal supplier to the regional Bell companies. More specifically, it is the leading supplier of cellular infrastructure to them and entered the handset market 18 months ago. Until now the Baby Bells, which have carved up much of the cellular market between them, have not seen AT&amp;T as a 'mobile predator'. If they do, their enthusiasm for its wares may wane. For BT, yesterday's deal offers a more graceful exit from the US cellular market than it expected last year. At AT&amp;T's current stock price, the value of BT's McCaw stake is up to Dollars 2.2bn from Dollars 1.8bn last year, although it will not be able to realise the gain until the 1994-95 financial year. It nevertheless closes a less than glorious episode in BT's post-privatisation history. BT paid Dollars 1.5bn for its stake in 1989, trumpeting its ambition to become 'world leader' in mobile communications and the need to diversify away from its regulated, recession-prone markets in the UK. Four years years later, BT is retiring from the US cellular market with a cash gain which looks distinctly modest compared with the 16.5 to 18.5 per cent cost of capital it is permitted on its regulated business under its current agreement with Oftel, the UK industry regulator. As for 'world leader', BT's only remaining cellular activity of note is Cellnet, its UK joint venture with Securicor. Unlike its UK competitor Vodafone, Cellnet has been barred by its parents from investing overseas. If world leaders in tomorrow's telecommunications industry need to be mobile, AT&amp;T is out in front. Lex, Page 16</p>

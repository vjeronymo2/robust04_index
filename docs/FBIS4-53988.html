			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, May 24 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Indonesia's  diplomacy in facing the Asia-Pacific conference on East Timor  (APCET) has been successful and a 90-percent victory has been  achieved, Ambassador Lopes Da Cruz said in Jakarta Tuesday  night. As an example of the effectiveness of Indonesian  diplomacy, he pointed to the cancellation of attendance of the  French and Portuguese first ladies who were originally scheduled  to deliver a keynote address at APCET in Manila, May 30-June 2.    "With the cancellation of the attendance of the two first  ladies, we have won 60 percent," said Da Cruz, who has just  arrived back from West Europe where he joined a religious  occasion.    Furthermore, with Philippine President Fidel Ramos banning  foreign participants from taking part in the conference,  Indonesia has achieved a 90-percent victory against its  adversaries, namely those who were against the integration of  East Timor into the Indonesian territory.    "Let us consider the remaining 10 percent is a `present' to  them," he said with a broad laugh.    Lopes Da Cruz, who knew a lot about Ramos Horta, the chief  adversary against the integration, said further that actually  all the international activities with regard to East Timor were  merely Horta's means of collecting money.    "He has nothing to do, and it is only from the seminars on  East Timor which he made a project that he could survive," he  said. Da Cruz also said that Ramos Horta was very shrewd. He  now turned to Asia for his East Timor seminars after failing to  turn the issue of East Timor into an international topic in  Europe. Da Cruz concluded that now Indonesia has the upper hand  in dealing with APCET.</p>

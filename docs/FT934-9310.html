			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Accountancy Column: Frustration down the line for litigation reform - The campaign by firms to limit liability is in danger of running out of steam PAPERS circulating behind the scenes among the UK's larger accountancy firms show that there has been considerable thinking on changes in the law to shield them from the effects of law suits. So far, there has been rather less of a result. At issue is whether the firms should be protected from the risks they currently run of being made responsible for paying out legal damages in excess of their culpability in an audit following the financial collapse or failure of a company. Against them stand parliamentary priorities perceived to be more important, intransigence, fears of jeopardising the public interest and a wall of unsympathetic investors, banks, and even accountancy firms. The UK profession has lagged behind its compatriots overseas in its campaign, in spite of its long-standing and relatively prominent position among firms both damaged by legal settlements - such as over Ferranti and Johnson Matthey Bankers - and by potential claims, most voluminously in relation to the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Australia and the US have seen longer-running efforts to bring about reforms, with sophisticated lobbies developed to appeal for changes in the law over several years. The first public indications that the UK was at work came this spring. Ian Greer Associates, a political lobbying firm, launched a programme of interviews with politicians, companies and opinion formers to assess their views on the subject. The largest eight accountancy firms have since commissioned Greer on a longer-term contract to advise on reforms. Steering the developments are a trio of senior partners, from Arthur Andersen, Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Price Waterhouse. A detailed, confidential discussion document obtained by the FT which was prepared in late March this year and runs to nearly 20 pages, provides an insight into the firms' strategies. It has since been updated, but is believed to still take broadly the same line. It cites despairingly from the Department of Trade and Industry-sponsored report on auditors' liability submitted in 1989, which was prepared by Professor Andrew Likierman - recently appointed as the government's chief accountancy adviser. The paper notes that little of its advice has been implemented, and that its recommendations are, in any case, 'somewhat more muted than one would have wished'. It stresses that the potential damages facing accountants have escalated considerably since and argues that the current system is unjust, jeopardises the range of services now provided, and risks larger firms shedding 'high risk' companies. It argues such a move would be against the public interest, no doubt much to the chagrin of smaller firms which might inherit these audits. It also hints that without reform auditors might refuse to honour their commitments in the recommendations of the Cadbury committee report on the financial aspects of corporate governance, notably in verifying statements on whether a company is a going concern and in ensuring that descriptions of internal controls are accurate. The paper suggests five options: Incorporation of accountancy firms so they would conduct audit business as companies with limited liability. The introduction by law of a statutory cap on liability, as already exists in Germany at DM500,000. Reforming the law on joint and several liability, to make damages proportionate to blame rather than the current system where a defendant can be made to pay all an award. Compulsory insurance for directors and officers of companies, to ensure that these individuals have assets worth pursuing through litigation, rather than accountants being the sole target for redress because they have 'deep pockets'. Amending section 310 of the 1985 Companies Act (as the Likierman report suggests) to permit auditors to limit their liability by contract. It goes on to dismiss the first three options. Incorporation, it argues, would still leave those involved in an audit vulnerable to personal liability in negligence cases and does not fully address the problem. A statutory cap would be most appealing, by giving certainty to the level of potential liabilities as a result of litigation. But it argues that such reform has twice foundered in Australia, and that there are 'real difficulties in convincing governments that capping legislation is necessary and equitable'. Reforming joint and several liability would require fundamental change on a principle which most parties consider equitable, and hence could prejudice other more likely proposals for reform. That leaves the provision of directors' and officers' insurance, which it endorses, and the amendment of the 1985 Companies Act. It suggests a minimum limit on liability in an audit contract of at least 10 times the audit fee, and not below Pounds 50,000 for a sole practitioner or Pounds 100,000 for other professionals. These figures are believed to be merely initial and illustrative, and the firms claim to be willing to be very open to negotiation on limits. They have also stressed in private that they have no problems paying out heavily where they are found to be at fault. But the campaigns for litigation reform seem to have been losing steam around the world. In Australia, proposals in New South Wales to introduce a cap on liability have foundered. In the US, many businesses have supported the efforts of Ceass, the coalition to eliminate abusive securities suits, which was spearheaded by the 'big six' accounting firms. It hopes for a draft bill next year, though sentiment at public hearings held in the summer was not entirely favourable. Similarly in the UK, the campaign also seems to have lost some of its steam. The great groundswell hoped for this year has been postponed. Deputations have returned empty-handed, though not without hope. Over the summer, the senior partners of the larger firms met Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs at the Department of Trade and Industry, and received what they considered to be a sympathetic hearing. Their representatives have since met officials several times. On the other hand, as one senior Whitehall official put it: 'There was a certain level of, shall we say, healthy scepticism about the proposals.' They have been asked to come back with a stronger case which stresses how no group would be prejudiced by their proposals. They have also agreed to provide further financial details on their case, by collating aggregate figures on the costs of insurance premiums, legal awards and other related expenses connected to litigation. Above all, they still need to demonstrate how truly financially damaging litigation is proving, and to clarify their stance in cases where there genuinely has been poor audit work. In the meantime, the firms plan to gather further support from industry for their proposals. They have drawn some comfort from a sympathetic statement calling for reform by the Confederation of British Industry. They can also hope for responsiveness from a new committee created by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, which expects to debate proposals by early in the new year. But many smaller and medium-sized firms seem to view the debate as irrelevant. They may approach government officials again during the spring, and aim to build support with a more public campaign over the summer. Even if things go extremely well, they are unlikely to be able to squeeze any proposals on to the legislative agenda as soon as next year.</p>

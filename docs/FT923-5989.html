			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Saving days are here again: Debt repayment, not borrowing, is the name of the game The profligate 1980s have given way to the prudish 1990s. History suggests that after two years of recession, Britain's consumers ought to be ready for a renewed bout of spending. Instead, they appear increasingly keen to save rather than spend, rent rather than buy, and pay off debts rather than borrow. Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of total domestic demand, has fallen further and for longer than in either of the past two recessions of 1974-75 and 1980-81. The hopes of the government, and of many economic forecasters, for a recovery this year rested on a fall in savings and a revival in spending. Yet savings remain stubbornly high and the much heralded post-election spending spree has failed to materialise. The failure of the UK economy to pick up suggests that the Treasury underestimated the extent to which high real interest rates, unprecedented levels of consumer debt and depressed expectations about medium-term prospects would discourage consumers. A year ago, Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, forecast that consumption would rise by 1.5 per cent this year, assuming a fall in net personal sector savings from 10.2 per cent of disposable income last year to 9.4 per cent in 1992. But savings rose instead, to 11.5 per cent in the first quarter, its highest level since 1982. The recession has reversed the past decade's pattern of falling savings and high borrowing. Net savings (the difference between consumer income and consumption) fell from 13.3 per cent of disposable income in 1980 to 5.4 per cent in 1988. But this fall was not matched by a drop in household investments in financial assets such as deposit accounts or shares. Gross savings flows into financial assets also fell, but only slightly. What allowed households to maintain their acquisition of financial assets, while increasing the proportion of income consumed, was the rise in borrowing. Gross borrowing rose from 6.5 per cent of disposable income to 16.5 per cent over the same period. Households borrowed to finance their gross savings and to purchase more durable consumer goods than their current incomes allowed. Household debt doubled to more than 100 per cent of income in 1988. The recession combined with high interest rates have encouraged consumers to reduce borrowing and pay off debts. The rise in net savings since 1990 is associated with the sharpest fall in consumer borrowing since the mid-1970s, as the chart shows. The annual growth of credit extended to households by banks and building societies reached a peak of 24.8 per cent in 1988 but fell to 5.8 per cent by the end of last year. The latest consumer credit figures reveal that outstanding credits, including bank loans and unpaid credit card bills, but excluding mortgages, fell by Pounds 55m in June, the first fall this year. The reasons for this decline in borrowing and consumption are complex. But the underlying message is not encouraging for those expecting an imminent pick-up in spending. From statistics and personal experiences (below), three factors stand out: Cashflow. Many consumers have cut their spending and decided not to borrow in order to service their interest payments and avoid losing their homes. The Bank of England estimates that up to 1m homeowners, one in 10 of households with mortgages, now owe more to building societies and banks than the value of their home. More than 180,000 homes have been repossessed and a further 305,000 mortgage-holders are more than six months in arrears. Mr David Roberts is caught in this debt trap. Currently battling to meet his mortgage payments, he is resigned to losing his current house and says he will not buy another. Nor will he borrow so readily again. Unemployment. Rising redundancies and the rising threat of unemployment mean that a much wider group than those facing the immediate threat of repossession is saving and repaying debts. The monthly rate of increase of unemployment has fallen in the past few months. But headline news of the decision by Ford UK to cut production will nurture the fear that further redundancies are in store. Mr Chris Poulter typifies the caution of the 1990s. A 23-year-old City foreign exchange dealer without a mortgage, he is saving rather than spending and will not run up debts until he is confident that his medium-term prospects are more secure. Costly debt. Most consumers are not threatened either by repossession or unemployment. But the combination of large debts with the highest levels of real interest rates at this stage in the economic cycle since the 1930s makes repaying debt a much more attractive investment than saving or borrowing. Consider the arithmetic. Paying off Pounds 10,000 in mortgage debt in a lump sum means a saving of about Pounds 1,000-Pounds 1,100 in interest payments over the year, equivalent to Pounds 1,300-Pounds 1,470 in pre-tax income. This implies an after-tax return of 13-14 1/2 per cent. Adjusted for inflation, the real return is 11-12 per cent. This compares with short-term real interest rates of a little above 6 per cent and no real return on investment in housing. So repaying debt makes sense. Mr John Williams, a 38-year-old businessman, has no mortgage and does not face the threat of unemployment. But he is repaying his debts. 'In the past I would have serviced my bank loans, hire purchase and credit-card debts by paying off the interest and a minimum amount of the capital,' he says, 'but now I am only concerned about paying off as much capital as I can.' One thing he will not do is borrow to buy durable goods. Consumers borrowed to buy cars and refrigerators in the 1980s when they believed incomes would keep rising. Now, depressed expectations and high interest rates mean many people are postponing purchases of durable household goods. The fall in durable goods spending has been far sharper than in overall consumption, as the chart shows. While real interest rates remain high and consumers such as Mr Williams continue to find debt repayment so attractive, a consumer-led recovery remains remote. Never has virtue been so rewarded - or so unwelcome.</p>

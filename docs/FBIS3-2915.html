			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Li Nanling (2621 0589 3781) and Zhang Yijun </F> (1728 4135 0193)]    [Text] Beijing, 14 Mar (XINHUA) -- Qian Qichen, vice  premier of the State Council and chairman of the Preliminary  Work Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region, hosted a banquet in the Diaoyutai  state guesthouse today for National People's Congress [NPC]  deputies and members of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee from Hong  Kong and Macao, who are in Beijing attending the ongoing NPC and  CPPCC sessions. During the banquet he said the principle of  "one country, two systems" will surely bear fruit in Hong Kong;  all the targets set by the Hong Kong Basic Law will be realized;  and Hong Kong will become more prosperous after 1997.    Qian Qichen said it was a great pleasure for him to have the  opportunity to get together with NPC deputies and CPPCC members  from Hong Kong and Macao. He said: Over last several days, you  have displayed patriotic enthusiasm and glowingly expressed your  views in discussing state affairs, despite travel fatigue. In  particular, you have put forward very good opinions and  suggestions on the Hong Kong question. We attach great  importance to those opinions and suggestions. On behalf of  Premier Li Peng and the State Council, I would like to take this  opportunity to express my thanks and respects to you. At the  same time, I wish the NPC and CPPCC sessions complete success.    He said: The NPC and CPPCC sessions this year are being held  in an harmonious atmosphere in which China has made great  achievements in reform, opening up, and modernization; and  enjoys steady economic development and social stability, and the  public is reassured. They are being held at a crucial moment  when our country is in an unprecedented period of development  and economic restructuring has entered a new stage characterized  by overall progress and breakthroughs in selected fields. Under  such a situation, NPC deputies and CPPCC members present at the  two sessions are taking the 20-character principle -- the  principle of seizing opportunity, deepening reform, opening up  wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability -- as a  basis in studying problems emerging during the course of  advance, and discussing major policies and strategies for reform  and economic construction. I believe the NPC and CPPCC sessions  this year will certainly yield a positive and far-reaching  impact on China's reform and modernization drive.    Qian Qichen said: On the eve of the current Second Session  of the Eighth NPC, the British Hong Kong authorities tabled the  remaining parts of Chris Patten's "political reform bill" to the  Hong Kong Legislative Council [LEGCO] for discussion. This is  another unilateral act to sabotage Sino-British cooperation by  the British side after LEGCO passed Chris Patten's partial  political reform bill, and the British side first publicized the  contents of Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political  structure in a White Book. Though the British side talked  loudly about cooperation with China, its acts and deeds on the  Hong Kong issue in recent years have shown the very opposite.  We cannot hold any illusion on this issue any longer.    He said: Before the Sino-British talks began, we made some  predictions. In New York in October 1993, I said to British  Foreign Secretary Hurd that there were only two possible  outcomes of the Sino-British talks -- one, an agreement would be  reached during the talks and the political structure elected in  the 1994-1995 elections would be extended beyond 1997; and the  other was that no agreement would be reached and the political  structure unilaterally elected by the British Hong Kong  authorities would remain valid up to 30 June 1997 only. We are  now going to join the Hong Kong compatriots who love the  motherland and Hong Kong, and rely on our own efforts to ensure  the smooth transition of power and long-term prosperity of Hong  Kong. Mr. Deng Xiaoping said as early as 10 years ago: "We  must believe the Hong Kong Chinese have the ability to  administer Hong Kong well. Any disbelief in their ability is a  remnant mentality of old colonialism." China today is not what  it was in the 1840's. The day when Chinese people were  subordinated to the oppression and humiliation of foreign  colonists has gone forever. The elaboration on the Hong Kong  issue in Premier Li Peng's Government Work Report is the solemn  declaration of the firm stand of the Chinese Government and  people.    Qian Qichen said: The Chinese Government has the  determination, confidence, and ability to realize the smooth  transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and to maintain the  stability and prosperity of Hong Kong because "Hong Kong's  prosperity in the past was created by Hong Kong people mainly  consisting of Chinese" and "Hong Kong people can administer Hong  Kong well." At the same time, the determination and confidence  rest with "our policy which precedes from the reality of Hong  Kong, and with the fact that the mainland's reform and opening  up policies are producing a positive influence on Hong Kong's  economic development." I firmly believe that, with the backing  of our great motherland and the concerted efforts made by the  vast number of Hong Kong compatriots, the principle of "one  country, two systems" will surely bear fruit in Hong Kong, all  the targets set by the Hong Kong Basic Law will be realized, and  Hong Kong will become more prosperous after 1997.    In conclusion, Qian Qichen said: As the day of the return of  Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland draws nearer and nearer, a  new epoch full of brightness and hope will arrive soon and the  responsibility on our shoulders is becoming even more important  and glorious. I cordially hope you will continue to carry  forward the fine traditions of "loving the motherland, Hong  Kong, and Macao" and use your experience, wisdom, and influence  to make new, greater contributions during the crucial stage of  the return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland.</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Surviving at home and away - A look at the challenges posed by Europe in 1993 The year ahead promises to be a challenging one for the smaller business. The creation of the single European market will present companies with threats and opportunities in the international context while recovery from the UK recession - if it comes - will pose problems at home. A continuation of the recession will not be welcome but an upturn may be scarcely less painful. If previous experience is anything to go by, failure rates will increase as swelling order books put yet more strain on cash flow. Small firms will be looking for a gentle upturn so that they can gear themselves up gradually. But it will be the long-awaited creation of the single European market that will dominate thinking in the first few months of the year. Those business owners and managers who took a decision to do nothing until the market was in place will start to see whether this approach was the right one. If they decide, after all, that the European market does offer attractive openings they will need to develop or improve exporting skills. They may need to contact the Department of Trade and Industry's export department* or their local chamber of commerce to start researching European markets. They should also consider taking part in exhibitions on the European mainland or joining trade missions. Managers may need to appoint agents or distributors in continental Europe or start to cultivate links with potential joint-venture partners. Contacts can be made through the European Commission's Business Co-operation Network,** linking more than 600 business advisers throughout the EC, or the regular regional partnership fairs known as Europartenariat.* They will need to think seriously about acquiring language skills and gaining familiarity with export procedures. These have been simplified but still need to be understood. Owner-managers may have to check with the experts whether their products are up to European safety norms and make sure that their promotional material and users' manuals are available in the appropriate European languages. They will probably want to target one or two continental countries, preferably those with which they are already familiar or for which management and staff have basic language skills. There is no sense in dispersing their export effort over too wide a front. Even if management has decided that it does not (yet) need to start making sales in Europe, it must be aware of the danger that continental European rivals will start to make inroads into British markets. This may require the UK company to improve quality, modify its products or adjust prices. Managers need to be aware of the continuing stream of directives coming out of Brussels. Businesses need to keep an eye on the Department of Trade and Industry's Single Market guides, which provide a regularly updated overview, as well as other government publications. Businesses that already do a substantial volume of import or export business within the community or that plan to expand their EC trade will need to take account of the considerable changes in dealing with VAT and trade statistics that took effect this month. The removal of most border customs posts means that companies are now directly responsible for compiling VAT data in a format acceptable to Customs and Excise and for filing trading information. Customs have said they will be lenient in the first few months but it is in companies' own interests to make sure their systems are operating efficiently. Regardless of how their continental rivals react to the single market, British companies will have to adjust over the next few months to the impact of sterling's departure from the Exchange Rate Mechanism. As sale and purchase contracts come up for renegotiation, UK businesses will need to adapt their costings and prices to take account of sterling's fall against several European currencies. This may be the time to rethink decisions on whether to price goods in sterling or the local currency. On the domestic front, British companies will be looking closely for signs of an increase in consumer confidence and an upturn in demand. This will be welcome when it comes but is already prompting fears about the ability of businesses to raise finance for growth. The banks have become so restrictive in their lending policies over the past 12 months that many companies fear they will not make the funds available for growth. There are also concerns that the banks will use an upturn as a reason to call in their security on some problem loans. The venture capital industry is going through a period of retrenchment and has anyway retreated from the financing of early stage businesses so there will be little relief from that source. Equity capital may be an option for some businesses however and small firms may need to review their dependence on overdraft finance. The next year will require businesses to maintain the defensive strategies they have had to adopt over the past two to three years. This means a close eye on credit control procedures, checking the credit-worthiness of new customers and regularly reviewing the status of existing ones. Businesses must continue to make sure that invoices are settled promptly and be prepared to chase customers who delay payments. This depends on financial reporting systems within the company being able to provide timely and accurate information. Tight controls must be maintained on cash flow and stock levels should be closely monitored. Despite, or because of, concerns about the willingness of the banks to finance the upturn, businesses must maintain good relations with their bank manager. *Exports to Europe Branch, DTI, Bay 956, Kingsgate House, 66-74 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6SW.

(Questions require Yes or No answer)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- If so: Have you appointed a European distributor or agent? Acquired language skills? Familiarised staff with export documents? Can information systems cope with new VAT reporting requirements? Are products up to European standards? Could European competitors threaten domestic sales? Do prices and costings reflect recent exchange rate changes?  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- On the home front Is there any sign of consumer confidence in your sector? Are credit controls sufficiently tight? Are stock levels monitored closely? Do financial reporting systems provide timely and accurate information? Could relations with your bank be improved?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

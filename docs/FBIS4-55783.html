			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava May 18 (CTK) -- If parliamentary  elections were held now, 27 percent of voters would support for  the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), according to a  poll conducted by the Slovak Statistical Office (SU SR) whose  results were handed to CTK today. In April, 32 percent of those  polled said they would vote for the HZDS. The HZDS-led  government fell in March following a parliamentary no-confidence  vote in former Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar.    The Democratic Left Party (SDL) with 16 percent support  fares  three percent better than in April.    The Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), led by ex-Premier  Jan Carnogursky, with 11 percent support also gained three  percent against April, followed by the coalition between  Egyutteles and the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement  supported by seven percent of voters.    In contrast, Premier Josef Moravcik's Democratic Union of  Slovakia (DEUS) with current support of five percent was the  only party in the current government coalition to receive less  voter preference than in April (seven percent).    The Slovak National Party (SNS) and the Greens Party would  each obtain four percent of the vote, the Social Democratic  Party in Slovakia (SDSS), the Slovak Workers' Party and the  National Democratic Party -- New Alternative (NDS-NA) each three  percent of the vote and the Democratic Party (DS) and the Party  of Slovak Entrepreneurs and Tradespeople (SSPZ) each two percent  of the vote. Eight percent of the respondents did not know for  whom they would vote.</p>

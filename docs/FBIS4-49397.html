			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 5 (XINHUA) -- The United States  today unveiled a set of new guidelines on its selective  participation in global peacekeeping missions that stresses U.S.  command and improved UN peacekeeping capabilities.    The guidelines, product of a government policy review that  started in the previous administration, was signed by President  Bill Clinton earlier this week, National Security Adviser  Anthony Lake said.    "The central conclusion of the study is that properly  conceived and well-executed peacekeeping can be a very important  and useful tool of American foreign policy," Lake told a press  briefing at the White House.    Under the guidelines, Lake said, Washington would seek to:    -- Ensure that the United States supports "the right  operations." The U.S. would only support or take part in  missions that advance U.S. interests and the operations should  have clear mandate, objectives and with forces and funds  available.    -- Reduce the cost of peacekeeping. The U.S. now pays for  less than one-third of UN peacekeeping operations. Lake urged  "other newly-rich countries" to "pay their fair share."    -- Improve UN peacekeeping capabilities, enhancing planning,  logistics, procurement, command and control, public affairs,  intelligence and civilian policing.    -- To ensure that there is effective command and control of  American forces when they are engaged in peacekeeping operations.    "The President will never relinquish command of United  States  forces," said Lieutenant General Wesley Clark, director for  strategic plans and policy of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.    "That is inviolable" although U.S. troops could be under  "operational control" of foreign commanders, Clark told the same  press briefing.    "The larger the U.S. military role, the more likely that the  operations involved entail combat, then the less likely we are  to place those forces under foreign operational control," Clark  said.</p>

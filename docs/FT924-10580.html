			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / The Property Market: Decline gathers pace There was a marked worsening of the property outlook last month, as reflected in September's IPD property index. For the market as a whole, the decline in total return accelerated to 0.7 per cent, the worst performance since January 1991. Yields shifted outwards across the board - to touch nearly 10 per cent overall - and capital values dropped 1.4 per cent over the month, the biggest monthly drop for more than two years. Year-on-year total return fell to 0.9 per cent for the 12 months to September. All three sectors covered by the index did poorly. Offices did worst, with a 1 per cent negative total return, down from -0.8 per cent the previous month. Year-on-year total return was negative, at -6.0 per cent for the year to September. The deterioration was most marked, however, in retail properties, which swung from a positive total return of 0.1 per cent in August to a negative return of 0.4 per cent in September. 'Despite these results,' says IPD, 'the retail sector is still attracting the bulk of such modest new investment as is available.' Industrial properties fell from the August return of -0.2 per cent to -0.6 per cent in September. Year-on-year total return for the sector, which recovered to 8.6 per cent in March, has since been falling and reached 3.1 per cent in September.</p>

			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AREA CONGRESSMEN'S NEWSLETTERS COST $619,802;  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT: SEVEN LAWMAKERS SENT 4.3 MILLION PIECES OF MAIL TO CONSTITUENTS IN  1989. REP. JERRY LEWIS SPENT THE MOST -- $214,549 FOR FIVE MAILINGS.  </P> <P> Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) used them to stress his opposition to military  base closings and support for a constitutional amendment outlawing flag  burning. Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) used them to talk about health  fairs and long-term medical care.  </P> <P> Across the country, lawmakers are using congressional newsletters to tell their  constituents about pressing issues, pending legislation and personal concerns  -- all at taxpayer expense and with minimal public reporting.  </P> <P> San Fernando Valley area congressmen say these mass mailings are a valuable way  to communicate with constituents about federal benefits and their  representatives' priorities. Congressional watchdog groups, on the other hand,  contend that they are the equivalent of publicly funded campaign pieces.  </P> <P> The Valley area's seven House members sent 17 districtwide newsletters -- or  about 4.3 million pieces of mail -- to their constituents at a cost of $619,802  in 1989, according to a recent study by the National Taxpayers Union, a  Washington-based group dedicated to reducing government spending.  </P> <P> Overall, the local members spent an average of 32 cents on each household in  their districts for postage and printing costs, matching the national average.  The figures were obtained by dividing a lawmaker's total newsletter spending by  the number of households in his district.  </P> <P> Leading the list among area legislators was Lewis, whose sprawling 35th  District includes part of Palmdale. He sent five newsletters at an estimated  cost of $214,549. He was followed by Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), who  mailed five at a cost of $185,179, the study found. Each spent 71 cents per  household in his respective district.  </P> <P> Gallegly used his newsletters to emphasize his support for an expanded federal  death penalty, a constitutional amendment against flag burning and tough  anti-drug measures.  </P> <P> Lawmakers were permitted to send a maximum of six newsletters last year;  Congress cut the figure to three this year. The House voted Sunday to limit a  member's spending on official mail to $178,000 a year and require individual  lawmakers to disclose mailing costs on a quarterly basis.  </P> <P> The newsletters -- which often contain multiple photos of lawmakers and portray  them as champions of their constituents and pet causes -- have long been  lambasted by congressional critics as a waste of tax dollars.  </P> <P> "Under the guise of so-called official mailings, the American taxpayer is being  asked to fund what often amounts to political campaigning," said James  Davidson, chairman of the 200,000-member Taxpayers Union.  </P> <P> The nonpartisan group said that its figures represent "just the tip of the  iceberg of congressional franking costs for 1989" because it is difficult to  obtain information about many of the mailing expenses for individual members.  The group estimated that House members spent $30 million to send out 215  million newsletter pieces last year.  </P> <P> The Taxpayers Union gleaned its figures from the files of the congressional  franking commission, which must approve each newsletter to determine that it  does not violate House rules, including a prohibition on overtly partisan  material. The Senate keeps records of individual members' spending on mail; the  House does not.  </P> <P> Most elusive are the public costs for letters or mailings that are addressed to  individual constituents with particular interests, such as senior citizens or  veterans. These sophisticated, and costly, targeted mailings were not included  in the Taxpayers Union survey.  </P> <P> Most lawmakers who send many newsletters, which are mailed to postal patrons,  also send numerous individually addressed pieces, said David Keating, the  Taxpayers Union's executive vice president.  </P> <P> This was not the case, however, with Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City),  who did not send any newsletters last year but mailed tens of thousands of  individually addressed pieces to various groups in his 26th District.  </P> <P> Berman sent 14 different targeted mailings in 1989, an aide said. Those living  near Burbank airport were informed about an airplane noise study; residents in  the vicinity of Hansen Dam were briefed about revitalization plans; and Jewish  constituents were told about the growing number of Soviet refugees unable to  come to the United States because of caps on immigration.  </P> <P> "Inevitably, a lot of information in the newsletter is not going to be of  interest to a lot of those people and it just becomes enormously self-serving,"  said Gene Smith, Berman's administrative assistant, in explaining why Berman  sends targeted mailings rather than newsletters.  </P> <P> The Taxpayers Union survey also did not include complete figures for postcards  sent to constituents to alert them to town meetings with their elected  representative. Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), who mailed only one  newsletter, on the federal budget deficit (at a cost of $36,249), also  distributed tens of thousands of town meeting notices.  </P> <P> Keating of the Taxpayers Union said that some lawmakers may wind up spending as  much as $800,000 in 1989 and 1990 for direct printing and postage costs for all  their mailings. In addition, congressional staffers spend much time planning,  writing and laying out the newsletters.  </P> <P> The newsletter cost figures for other Valley area lawmakers, each of whom sent  two districtwide mailings, were: $74,184 for Waxman; $71,841 for Rep. Carlos J.  Moorhead (R-Glendale); and $37,800 for Rep. William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield),  whose 20th District includes much of the Antelope Valley.  </P> <P> A favorite newsletter technique is to survey constituents about issues. In  1989, Beilenson asked about the federal budget deficit, Moorhead asked about  air pollution problems and Gallegly and Lewis inquired about major issues in  general.  </P> <P> Gallegly and Lewis also asked about the value of congressional newsletters in  their surveys. Spokesmen for each lawmaker cited the favorable response as  support for using tax dollars for the mailings.  </P> <P> "Our constituents do tell us they enjoy receiving the newsletters and we get  very, very little mail from our constituents saying they don't," said John  Frith, Gallegly's spokesman.  </P> <P> Professional pollsters, however, say that the response rates for these surveys  are so low that the tallies should not be considered a valid measure of public  opinion.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for the two lawmakers also noted that Lewis and Gallegly voted for  the measure that cut in half the maximum number of newsletters permitted this  year and support the latest reform proposal that is pending before Congress.  Lewis, in fact, sponsored last year's bill to cut the maximum number of  newsletters in half.  </P> <P> "Responding to constituent mail and sending occasional newsletters are a  legitimate means of communicating to my constituents," Lewis said. "Anything  beyond that . . . is excessive."  </P> <P> Waxman also defended the mailings to constituents.  </P> <P> "It helps me tell them what I'm doing," he said. "It gives them a sense of what  my priorities are."  </P> <P> And what about the political benefits?  </P> <P> "There are political benefits in doing a good job," Waxman replied.  </P> <P> CONGRESSIONAL MAILINGS  </P> <P> 1989 spending on newsletters by Valley-area congressional representatives  </P> <TABLE CWL="5.08IN:2.77IN:2.11IN:2.11IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Number of  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Cost per  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Cost  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> pieces  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> household  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Jerry Lewis  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $214,549  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,510,905  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 71 cents  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $185,179  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 71  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Henry J.

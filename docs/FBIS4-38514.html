			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol, May 28, RIA -- Vice-Admiral Petr  Svyatashov, chief of staff of the Black Sea Fleet, described  today as "absolutely untrue" the statement of the press service  of the commander of the Ukrainian national Guards.    The statement alleged, among other things, that marines of  the Black Sea Fleet are holding tactical exercises in close  proximity to the basing area of the National Guards of Ukraine  and that electronic countermeasures taken by the Black sea Fleet  suppressed for several hours the operation of the guards' radio  and interrupted telephone communications of Interior Ministry  bodies subordinated to Kiev.    Units of the fleet were and remain in places of their  permanent basing, the vice-admiral told a RIA correspondent.  "We have not moved our men there, on the contrary, we carry our  reductions, transferring men to the reserve, whereas the Defence  Ministry, the Security Service and the National Guards of  Ukraine are bringing in military units into the Crimea. They  are engaged in a build-up of strength in areas where units of  the fleet are based. Here, the strength of Ukrainian units is  already upwards of 52,000 personnel," Svyatashov said.  According to him, there are more than 2,000 National Guards  stationed at the former Simferopol building school.    "Some people seem to be eager to see the Ukrainian  presidential elections not to be held but be postponed  indefinitely," Svyatashov pointed out. In his view, those  quarters are dissatisfied with certain stabilisation of the  situation on the peninsula and are trying to aggravate it.  Therein lies the purpose of the statement of the press service  of the National Guards of Ukraine, just as the talk of the  possible introduction of direct presidential rule in the Crimea.</p>

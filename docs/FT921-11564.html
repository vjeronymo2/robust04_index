			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Brazil's turnaround is all in the mind: Inflation is not down, but everyone is behaving as if it was FOR A MAN who eschews magic solutions, Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, Brazil's economy minister, has performed a great conjuring trick. Without actually reducing inflation, he has convinced an important part of the sceptical Brazilian public that the all is under control. So much so that an estimated Dollars 3bn has entered Brazil in the last six weeks - much of it returning flight capital - and for the first time ever the black market dollar exchange rate is below the official rate. To cap Mr Moreira's success, the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday night at last put the seal of approval on his adjustment programme with a Dollars 2.1bn standby facility, paving the way for accords with Brazil's creditors. The same analysts who were predicting imminent hyperinflation just three months ago when foreign exchange reserves had dropped to critical levels, now say Brazil is poised for a take-off surpassing that of Mexico, Latin America's superstar. They point out that last year, despite the absence of a Brady debt reduction plan or IMF accord, Dollars 11.6bn in foreign capital entered Brazil - double that of 1990. So much money has been flooding into the stock market this year that it has already risen 60.8 per cent in dollar terms. But the question mark over the world's ninth-largest economy is still large. For Brazil's monthly inflation remains around 25 per cent and Mr Moreira's only weapons in play are a widespread confidence in his abilities and tight monetary policy which is crippling industry and causing mass dismissals. Moreover the volume of money entering Brazil is due less to confidence in the economy than to its undervalued shares and high interest rates. It is far from certain that the mild-mannered Mr Moreira will succeed in his attempt to follow the lead of other Latin American countries to move to an economy based on free trade, competition, and a reduced state. While rejoicing over the IMF deal he admitted yesterday that the hard work is still to come: 'We have had almost no significant growth for 12 years. What is important now is tight monetary and fiscal control if we are to avoid losing another year.' One of the biggest uncertainties is political feasibility. President Fernando Collor must convert an operating budget deficit of 0.6 per cent of gross domestic product (before debt interest payments) into a 2.4 per cent surplus by the end of 1993. To do this, he requires constitutional changes which will mean confronting traditional politicians who jealously guard their sources of state patronage. He must also cow the country's powerful cartels and oligopolies which have grown fat from protectionism and bleeding the state. On first taking office in March 1990, Mr Collor thought his 35m votes gave him the power to take on all these interests. Instead he found himself blocked on all fronts and unable to muster the 252 votes in Congress which would constitute a majority. Two weeks ago he suffered the ultimate humiliation when even the government bloc voted against him on important pensions legislation. Mr Collor's stance had been valiant but counter-productive in a country where nothing is achieved without deals. Left with few options last week he sacked four ministers and appointed traditional politicians from the PFL, a centre-right party, aiming to increase his political base. He now has 125 votes in Congress but, what is more important, retains the backing of the godfathers of Brazilian politics - Mr Antonio Carlos Magalhaes (known as ACM), governor of Bahia and communications minister in the last government, and Mr Roberto Marinho, head of the Globo media empire. To seal the deal ACM's son was appointed whip. Unable to work outside the system, Mr Collor appears now to have decided he has to operate within it. There is no firm evidence that the inflation rate or the rate of growth of the money supply is coming down. Moreover the IMF programme carries some inflationary pressures, such as a commitment to a 15 per cent real rise in public sector tariffs, as well as a heavy social cost. Brazil is already in its worst recession for a decade with the unemployment rate in Sao Paulo now 10.5 per cent. The big unknown on which all hangs is the Brazilian psyche. If enough people start to doubt the success of the programme and inflation heats up then business will push up prices, as happened last October, fearing a new price freeze and provoking further inflation. Mr Moreira has turned such a situation around once - he may not be able to repeat the trick.</p>

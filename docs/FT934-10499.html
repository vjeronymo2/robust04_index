			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Clinton joins war of words over healthcare PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has joined his wife in declaring verbal war on the insurance industry association most vigorously opposed to their healthcare reform proposals. Both have been stung by a series of radio and television commercials by the Health Insurance Association of America, a coalition of mostly small and medium-sized insurers which is estimated to provide health cover for about 65m Americans. The Clintons launched their reform programme by promising to work with anybody to achieve universal healthcare insurance. But on Monday, Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton accused insurers of bringing the country to 'the brink of bankruptcy because of the way they have financed healthcare'. On Wednesday, the president chipped in by turning the catch phrase of the commercials - 'There must be a better way' - against the association. 'They tell you they've got a better idea,' he told a rally in a Pittsburgh suburb, 'except that we're all still waiting for it.' Simultaneously, Mr Richard Celeste, former governor of Ohio and now an administration adviser on healthcare, disrupted an association press conference called to unveil a new commercial. Asked to leave, he shot back: 'When you go up with million dollar advertisements, you're fair game for a response.' The HIAA, which represents 271 companies, has seen some defections in recent years. Four of its biggest members - Aetna, Cigna, Metropolitan Life and the Travelers - have in the past two years set up their own association to promote managed healthcare, a concept that meets the approval of the Clintons. Prudential Insurance, while still a member of the HIAA, has refused to provide funding for the Dollars 5.5m commercial campaign, running in 10 of the bigger states, on the grounds that it was 'far too negative', according to a company spokesman, The commercials feature Harry and Louise, a thirtysomething couple, in assorted domestic and work environments agonising over the cost of the Clinton health plan. Explicit in most is the fear that their insurance will run out or be taken over by the government. Some radio commercials not sponsored by the HIAA are far cruder. One currently doing the rounds transforms a doctor's waiting room into a cattle round-up. Mr Willis Gradison, former Republican congressman from Ohio who retired last year to head the HIAA, argues that its advertisements are accurate and that, under the Clinton plan, many members will simply be absorbed into large insurance pools, at a considerable cost to the quality of healthcare.</p>

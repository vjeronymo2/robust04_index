			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian </F> negotiating delegation, in Jerusalem, by Fawzi al-Jundi, in  Cairo; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Al-Jundi] The Israeli Government has adopted  measures in an attempt to siphon off Palestinian, Arab, and  international anger following the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.  [passage omitted] The question is: Are these measures  considered political?    ['Urayqat] First, the Israeli measures have not risen to the  required levels. [passage omitted] The issue is extremely  sensitive. There must be international protection for the  Palestinian people. Israel cannot be entrusted with the  security of the Palestinians, especially as the Israeli army  killed more people after the massacre than fell in the terrorist  operation in Hebron. Second, with regard to the decision to  outlaw the Kakh and Kahana Hay Organizations, the Israeli  Government adopted a decision in 1988 banning political activity  by Kakh and preventing it from taking part in political  elections. What's new? Before leaving for the United States,  did Rabin want to send a message to the U.S. public to say that  something was done? This is the peak of Israeli indifference,  particularly, as I have said, as the Kakh Organization has been  banned from exercising any political activity from the start.    [Al-Jundi] Since you referred to Rabin's visit to the United  States, permit me to ask you: Did Rabin intend, by these recent  measures, to address a message to the United States and U.S.  President Bill Clinton to avoid pressure by the U.S.  Administration?    ['Urayqat] This is possible. But we must remember that the  United States has been trying from the first day of the massacre  to extricate Israel from its predicament. For example, the  first decision made by Washington was procedural, that is, to  transfer the negotiations from Cairo to Washington. The  decision disregarded the substance. The negotiations in Cairo  took place under Egyptian Government auspices on the highest  level. There was very strong, positive Egyptian intervention in  these negotiations. The United States has not intervened since  the Madrid conference in any of the negotiating tracks. The  second attempt to limit the damage has been the enormous  pressure we have been facing as the Palestinian people and  leadership at the UN Security Council. Everyone knows this and  it is tantamount to extortion. With these measures, which have  not risen to the required level of seriousness, Rabin wanted to  ameliorate world public opinion and convince it that he is  adopting measures. [passage omitted]    As we see on our streets and in our neighborhoods, the  settlers move around with their weapons and provoke the people.  Curfews are imposed on the victims. What we want to say is  that the Israeli Government measures are ridiculous. They are  surprising. They cast suspicion on Israel's credibility and  desire for peace. We have told Israel from the beginning that  the settlements are a time bomb. Israel said it will guarantee  that no settler will carry out operations against the  Palestinian people. After the terrorist operation in Hebron,  who will guarantee that no new crime will take place in a  mosque, church, field, university, or hospital? We must  consider these issues, because we don't want to turn the  occupied Palestinian territories into a new Bosnia in 10 years.    [Al-Jundi] Can we say that the Palestinian negotiating  strategy will take a new course, especially with regard to the  removal of the settlements, because they constitute hotbeds of  tension and time bombs in the occupied territory?    ['Urayqat] The negotiations are not an end in and of  themselves. Nor is their resumption. The issue is the  substance of the negotiations. After the massacre, we are  saying that any negotiations that do not have the settlements  issue on their agenda will be useless and will complicate  things. [passage omitted]    We are saying that the negotiations cannot proceed as they  did before the massacre. What we fear is that Rabin wants to  reorganize the occupation. The peace process was based on the  principle of land for peace and on Resolution 242, which  stipulated in its preamble that the occupation of others'  territories by force is impermissible. The time has come, not  only for a Palestinian, but also for an Arab stance, that is, a  stance by Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the PLO, one that  is directly concerned with the peace process. There is a need  to convene a summit meeting and I call on the Egyptian  Government to sponsor such an initiative and convene a meeting  in Cairo to discuss the overall peace process in light of recent  developments. It is unreasonable for this massacre to pass as  if nothing had happened and for life to return to normal as a  result of U.S. pressure and Israeli intransigence.    [Al-Jundi] Arab brothers, we thank our guest Dr. Sa'ib  'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian delegation to the Arab-Israeli  peace negotiations. Dr. 'Urayqat, thank you very much and happy  holiday.    ['Urayqat] Thank you. A happy holiday to all.</p>

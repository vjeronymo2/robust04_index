			<p>BFN     [Text] Chief Justice Luis Serpa Segura has fully endorsed a  resolution by the Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD) to  postpone the implementation of the new Code of Penal Procedure  for six months. He noted that this period of time will be used  to refurbish the infrastructural facilities needed for the code  to go into effect.    Although he did not explicitly say so, Serpa was thus  directly alluding to an executive branch decree that declared  all criminal justice buildings to be in state of emergency for  four months. These facilities will play a leading role in the  implementation of the new code.    Serpa added that the suspension of the implementation of the  new code will also make it possible to adjust its articles to  the new Constitution that was approved by referendum on 31  October 1993.    Furthermore, the 43 Lima criminal courts functioning at the  Justice Palace have not yet been able to move to their new  offices on the six lower floors of the new building that now  houses the Attorney General's Office (the former Economy  Ministry building). This move was ordered precisely to pave the  way for a better implementation of the new Code of Penal  Procedure. The 43 provincial criminal prosecutors have,  however, managed to move to the new offices, and are already  working in the upper seven floors of the said building.    The new code provides that criminal courts, prosecutors,  their respective clerks, and specialized offices should be  located in the same building -- such as the one designated by  the government -- for the purpose of ensuring that justice be  served promptly and in a timely manner.    The Justice Ministry has authorized the judicial branch to  hire directly, without calling for bids, contractors to renovate  the floors that will house the criminal courts.</p>

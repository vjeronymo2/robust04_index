			<p>CSO     [Text] An Islamic Center (Al Markaz Al Islami) to  accommodate Islamic community activities in the fields of  religion, education, health, and social and cultural affairs  will shortly be built in the middle of the city of Ujungpandang,  South Sulawesi.    The concept for the construction of an Islamic Center, which  was originally developed in the holy city of Mekkah, has been  positively received by a number of cabinet ministers, deputy  cabinet ministers, and community leaders, who have expressed  their willingness to make this idea a reality. This was stated  by retired Gen M. Jusuf.    At the program for opening the Muslim month of fasting in  Jakarta on 3 March the deputy chairman of BAPEKA [Financial  Inspection Board] said that the Islamic Center is intended to  help the government to train Indonesians to be healthy and well  educated and to believe in God.    The Islamic Center will stand on a nine hectare piece of  ground which formerly was part of the campus of Hasanuddin  University. General Jusuf said that a mosque will be built at  the Islamic Center to accommodate 10,000 of the faithful as well  as a meeting hall with a capacity of 5,000 people.    As quoted by ANTARA news agency, Jusuf added that in  addition  a building for Islamic educational programs will be constructed,  ranging from kindergarten through SLTA [senior technical high  school]. It will be equipped with a library, a laboratory, and a  polyclinic. For students who come from outside the city of  Ujungpandang dormitories will be built for both boys and girls.    A foundation to manage the Islamic Center has already been  established. A number of cabinet ministers and deputy ministers,  in their private capacities, have expressed their willingness to  sit on the executive council of the foundation.    They are: Azwar Anas (coordinating minister for the people's  welfare), Ginandjar Kartasasmita (minister of state for national  development planning and also chairman of BAPPENAS--the National  373 Development Planning Board), R. M. Yogi Suardi Memet  (minister of home affairs), Edi Sudrajat (minister of defense  and security), Tunky Ariwibowo (minister of industry), Mar'ie  Muhammad (minister of finance), Dr Tarmizi Taher (minister of  religious affairs), Doctor Sujudi (minister of health), Radinal  Moochtar (minister of public works), and Abdul Latief (minister  of manpower).    Other figures who have expressed their willingness to take  part in this activity are Gen Feisal Tanjung (commander of the  Indonesian armed forces), Gen Wismoyo Arismunandar (Army chief  of staff), and Dr Nurcholis Madjid. Meanwhile, Dr Munawir  Sadzali (deputy minister of home affairs) has stated that he is  willing to take part in this project.    Jusuf declared that the Islamic Center which is to be  constructed will belong to the religious community and  especially to the Islamic community. Therefore, he invited the  Islamic community to complete its construction successfully.    Aburizal Bakrie, general chairman of KADIN [Indonesian  Chamber of Commerce and Industry], led a group of businessmen  who attended the meeting, including H. Sudwikatmono, H. Ibrahim  Risjad, H. Yusuf Kalla, Fadel Muhammad, Tantri Abeng, Prayogo  Pangestu, and Henri Pribadi. They also expressed their  willingness to help in making this plan a reality.    Mar'ie Muhammad (minister of finance), who spoke in his  private capacity, said that the objective of constructing the  Islamic Center is not only to build a mosque and school. This  project reaches far into the future, involving national  development and the national character.    Meanwhile, Nurcholis Madjid, a young Islamic leader who also  spoke at the meeting, said that the construction of the Islamic  Center is an appropriate objective. This activity is a forward  step in anticipating the needs of the Islamic community during  the coming decades.</p>

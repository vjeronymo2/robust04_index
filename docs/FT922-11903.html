			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Havelock Europa blames recession for Pounds 2.47m loss HAVELOCK EUROPA, the storefitting group, reported a loss of Pounds 2.47m for 1991 blaming recession for what it called a 'very severe year'. The final dividend is being passed. Sir Lewis Robertson, the chairman who was installed by institutions in 1989, said there were no signs of any real improvement in the group's markets although the order position improved in the second half. Retailers had no plans for creating substantial new shopping centres in 1992. The group, which made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.5m in 1990, saw turnover fall from Pounds 46.8m to Pounds 37.7m. The bulk of the pre-tax deficit was incurred in the first half and included an exceptional loss of Pounds 458,000 due to redundancy costs. During the year big cuts were made in operating costs and overheads. The manufacturing plant at Inchinnan near Glasgow was closed to concentrate on factories at Dalgety Bay, Fife, and at Nottingham. The workforce was cut by 240 to 831. Sir Lewis said the group was building a strong base for the future by establishing its pre-eminence in the design and development of shopfitting equipment. It aimed to become a designated supplier of leading store chains rather than being one of a number of contractors competing purely on price. It had designed new fittings for Marks and Spencer and Boots, its main customers, and had recently won its first big order from Safe-way. Mr Hew Balfour, who Sir Lewis brought in as chief executive, said that Havelock would probably have failed altogether be-cause of the abnormally bad period in the storefitting business if it had not been restructured over the past two years. Sir Lewis said that distributable reserves did not justify paying a final dividend, so the interim of 1.5p stands for the year. In 1990 the group paid a total of 3.6p.</p>

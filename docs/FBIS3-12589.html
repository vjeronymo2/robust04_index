Our  correspondent Meron Tzur reports that the workers have  deliberately cut telephone communications to hundreds of  thousands of subscribers.    Dozens of company workers stormed the office of the director  general of the Telecommunications Ministry in Megdal Shalom in  Tel Aviv at noon today, shouting loudly to prevent him from  explaining the nature of the Bezeq Company's new license.</p>

Senior Conservatives said yesterday that the party would  have  far less than the 1 million pounds it spent five years ago when  Margaret Thatcher launched her doomed crusade against the  Brussels bureaucracy.    The indications are that for the first time in modern  electoral history, Labour will not be financially outgunned. It  spent just over 400,000 pounds centrally in 1989 and is poised  to fight the June 9 Euro-poll on an equal footing with the  Tories.    One Tory source said: "Money is a big problem. There is no  slush fund, and we cannot borrow another million. We are right  up against our overdraft limit."    The cash crisis, due to a slump in morale among party  activists, has forced a drastic reworking of the campaign for  the council elections, on May 5 and the European poll. In  contrast to 1989, when Central Office spent heavily on a  nationwide anti-Brussels poster campaign, funds will be  concentrated on the 87 Euro-constituencies.    Under electoral law, a ceiling of around 30,000 pounds  applies locally to each candidate for a Euro-seat. This sum is  still big enough, however, for Sir Norman Fowler the party  chairman, to divert some money from the centre. Conservative  MEPs [members of the European Parliament] have received around  440,000 pounds from the European Parliament this year to promote  its work, but this cannot be used for campaigning and cannot be  spent after February 9.    "We'd rather a constituency spent 10,000 pounds on keeping  its agent in place or a couple of leaflet drops than put the  money towards a page of advertising in a national newspaper," a  source said.    Neither Mr Major nor Sir Norman, however, intends to give up  without a fight. Central Office will move to a war footing well  before the elections for district councils and London boroughs,  and party chiefs are treating the two elections as a single  campaign.    They concede that they have been blown off course by the  uproar over Back to Basics and taxation, but intend to go on the  offensive as soon as the dust settles. "What we want is the  Labour Party voting against us clause after clause in the  Criminal Justice Bill, attacking us over deregulation, along  with the steady drip of good economic news," an insider said.    In 1989 the Tories lost 13 seats on a vote split of Labour  40  percent, Conservatives 35 percent. With their support now under  30 percent in the opinion polls, Mr Major faces another  drubbing, and some projections suggest that his party will be  reduced to a rump of around a dozen seats.</p>

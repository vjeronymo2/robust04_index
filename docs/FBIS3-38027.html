I believe, said Luzhkov, there are two important problems in  the message: the combating of crime and the stabilization of  the economy. These two problems must be solved as early as  possible and to do so available forces should be used  efficiently.    The Mayor said he was completely unsatisfied by the words  said by the president about privatization.    The problem should have had more emphasis in the message.  The state has received nothing from the voucher privatization  campaign: neither money nor a new owner. The completion of the  campaign means a failure for the Russian economy, said Luzhkov.    The Moscow Mayor believes that the president did right when  in his message he spoke about the protection of the  Russian-speakers in the CIS countries.    I have just returned from Sevastopol and I am alarmed by the  fact that the forceful "Ukrainization" of the Russians is taking  place there. There are 75 percent of Russians living in the  city. I intend to report to the president about this, he said.    The Moscow Mayor said that if in such historically Russian  cities as Sevastopol and Narva, Russian residents are being  forced to take on an alien life style, culture, language and  their rights are infringed upon, the problem could develop from  a diplomatic one to one with grave social and political  consequences.</p>

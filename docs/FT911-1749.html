			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: EFG warns of Pounds 2.2m deficit EFG yesterday fleshed out its earlier warnings with an announcement that pre-tax losses of about Pounds 2.2m are expected for the half-year to March 31. Interest costs are expected to account for Pounds 850,000 of this and in addition there are likely to be exceptional and extraordinary charges and provisions amounting to some Pounds 800,000 relating to the board's strategy of divestment and cost cutting. Shares in the USM-quoted company, which is involved in forestry, horticulture and specialised non-food retailing, fell 7p to 19p. Directors added that trading conditions remained tough and full benefits of the cost cutting exercise would not be felt this year.</p>

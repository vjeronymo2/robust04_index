			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 18 January the Ministry of Finance [MOF] decided  to provide approximately 8.99 trillion yen [Y] for public works  projects in fiscal 1994, up 5 percent from the previous year.  The growth rate of the entire budget will remain relatively low  since serious revenue shortages are certain for fiscal 1994, but  public works expenditures will be increased to boost the economy.    The total amount of public works expenditures for fiscal  1994  will be calculated as the sum of general public works  expenditures, disaster-relief funds, and Y1.23 trillion in  interest-free loans from funds raised by the profits from  selling stocks of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation  (NTT). Among the government agency budget requests submitted on  31 August 1993, public works plans for fiscal 1994 totaled  Y8.939 trillion.    In consideration of the current economic situation, the MOF  intends to approve almost all budget requests from government  agencies. In addition, the public works budget will include  funds for constructing nonpublic subways, which is usually  classified as "miscellaneous projects."    To reinforce subway networks, the Ministry of Transportation  is asking for Y58.5 billion for urban railway projects, and Y2.6  billion for the new-town railway project of the Housing and  Urban Development Corporation. The MOF intends to allot about  Y60 billion for these projects, with the amount of the publics  work budget totaling Y8.99 trillion.    The 5-percent growth of the public works budget is the  largest since fiscal 1988 (up 19.7 percent), when NTT stock  loans were introduced to the initial budget.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary from the 209th issue of KORDESTAN magazine; date </F> not given: "Let Us Not Forget the Political Prisoners" ]    [Text] The inhuman crimes and acts that the Islamic  Republic has been perpetrating against the people of our  country, and especially against its political opponents during  its more than 15 years of rule, have made the world realize its  nature as a state completely against freedom. This is why not a  year passes without the Islamic Republic being listed among the  world's bloodthirsty and arbitrary regimes and without its being  criticized on a world level.    Some of the most heart-rending crimes by this regime are  perpetrated against combatants who disagree with the clergymen  and are opponents of the regime. During the 15 years of the  regime's existence, hundreds of Iranian citizens have been  thrown into the torture chambers of the Islamic Republic because  of their political beliefs and have received long prison terms,  while thousands have received the death penalty.    Here we do not intend to refer to all these crimes and to  the  inhuman acts that have become ordinary in the dungeons of the  Islamic Republic. These crimes have been revealed on many  occasions. Revelations have been made of heart-rending acts  such as the mass murder of political prisoners, extortion,  depriving them of the right to a lawyer, summary trials, rape of  girls before their execution, dozens of kinds of psychological  and physical tortures, and leaving the world uninformed of the  situation of the political prisoners and so on by presenting no  documentary proof. Actually very few are unaware that all types  of crimes have been perpetrated in clerical Iran against  political prisoners. Thus, in this article we intend to only  list the duties that the families and relatives of the political  prisoners, our country's masses, opposition parties and  organizations, and world humanitarian groups and organizations  have toward these political prisoners.    If we accept the fact that the struggle against dictatorship  and strangulation is a holy mission--and we do--and if we  believe in the fact that the Islamic Republic is the  full-fledged enemy of human rights and freedoms and the  strangler of these rights and freedoms--and we do--both we,  those who live in Iran and face the bullying and arbitrariness  of the clerical regime, and the humanitarian circles and  organizations and, in general, progressive humanity, the human  values and criteria of which the Islamic Republic is ridiculing,  we will have certain duties to perform as far as the political  prisoners in Iran are concerned.    We would first like to list the duties of the families and  relatives of the political prisoners. We know that for some  time now the clerical regime has wanted to pretend that there is  no such thing as a political prisoner in Iran and that the  combatants who are under arrest have been cast into prison on  charges of ordinary crimes. For this reason, the relatives and  families of the political prisoners should use every possible  means to contact opposition organizations and to give them any  information that they have on their dear imprisoned ones such as  their name, age, educational background, profession, political  activities and stands, the date and place of their arrest, and  whatever they know about their trial. They should try to hand  over the necessary information and documents on their imprisoned  relative to representatives of the Human Rights Commission and  Amnesty International when they visit Iran. If possible, they  should make their voices heard by the foreign mass media and by  those humanitarian organizations and groups that are ready to  reveal the crimes perpetrated by the Iranian rulers.    Many of these duties do not concern only the families and  relatives of the political prisoners. Each and every  respectable and sensitive person should consider himself a  next-of-kin of the political prisoners and to consider it his  duty to inform the people and political forces of Iran, as well  as the world, of the situation the imprisoned freedom-lovers are  in. The duty that our country's masses have in relation with  this is even heavier. While revealing these crimes and giving  the necessary information to the competent circles, they should  also be active in another field. They should become a backbone  and a mouthpiece for those families who are facing numerous  psychological and material problems because their daughter, son,  or the head of the family has been arrested. The more the masses  sympathize with the families of the political prisoners and  strive to remove their problems, the more they will be resisting  the executioners and the prouder they will defend their demands  which are the demands of the majority of the people in our  country as well.    A political prisoner should feel that if he has welcomed  torture and death for the sake of fulfilling the demands and the  freedoms of the people of the country, the people too are  appreciative, and they are not indifferent toward their families  and their sacrifices. More important yet, our compatriots should  organize protest movements related to the political prisoners  and demand that the regime end their behind-the-scene trials,  publish the number of political prisoners and a report on the  true situation of the prisoners, allow political prisoners to  meet with their families and relatives on a regular basis,  provide suitable health and food facilities, and allow them  access to radios and newspapers, and the books that they wish to  read. All the staged acts that the Islamic Republic of Iran is  carrying out in connection with the political prisoners should  be neutralized, and especially when representatives of  organizations defending human rights come to Iran to assess the  situation of human rights, our compatriots should try to  organize antiregime protests and to inform these representatives  of the dire situation that the political prisoners in Iran are  facing.    Iran's political forces that are engaged in a struggle  against the regime should inform world public opinion of all the  documents and information that they acquire through their  members and supporters and through the people of our country in  connection with the political prisoners. Many of these forces  have some sort of propaganda means such as radio stations,  newspapers, and so on. Therefore, while publishing such  information and documentation, they should pay more attention to  directing and encouraging the masses of our country and to  further informing them of the duties that they have toward the  political prisoners.    During the past few years, all the antiregime forces have  strived to inform the world abroad of the situation of the  political prisoners in Iran. Undoubtedly, if there is more  cooperation and coordination among the opposition organizations  and personalities and if a common plan is laid out, their  efforts and the activities in this field will be more widely  reflected and there will be more solidarity than is seen on the  global level today.    Until now, Amnesty International, the Middle East Watch, the  Human Rights Commission, the UN General Assembly, and many other  world pro-human rights groups and organizations have revealed  the unprecedented crimes that the Islamic Republic of Iran has  perpetrated and is perpetrating against the political prisoners.  But the repeated condemnation of the Islamic Republic by these  organizations and groups has not put an end to the massacre of  political prisoners in Iran or, at least, helped to bring about  a major development in relation to them. One of the reasons for  this is that the governments of the world have not attached  great importance to the views and stands of pro-human rights  organizations on the Islamic Republic and, ignoring the  antipopular nature of this regime, they have continued their  political-economic relations and cooperation with the Islamic  Republic.    It is by taking these facts into consideration that  pro-human  rights organizations and all sources, forces, and personalities  who consider their struggle against the massacre of  freedom-seekers in Iran to be their humanitarian duty should  mobilize world public opinion and place governments under  pressure to stop transactions and cooperation with the Islamic  Republic, and to isolate this regime in the world on charges of  fighting against freedom and crushing freedom-lovers.    We hope that everyone will help to serve the political  prisoners of Iran.</p>

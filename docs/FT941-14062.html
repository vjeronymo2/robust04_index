			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading A dull but reflective session in the derivatives sector saw the Footsie March future challenge but fail to break through the 3,500 barrier, though turnover in the traded options remained high, writes Joel Kibazo. The first trade in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 was struck at 3,485, down 16 points from Wednesday's record close, and was followed by sporadic selling which sent it lower. Several mid-morning buying orders brought about a rally, which drove March strongly forward to the day's peak of 3,499, after which it ran out of steam and drifted for the next few hours. The failure of the Bundesbank to make any move on interest rates, flushed out more sellers sending March to its low point of 3,471. It finished at 3,482. With the premium having been maintained throughout the session, the closing level was 9 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of about 6 points. Volume returned to more modest levels finishing at 11,962 lots. Dealers said volatility in several FT-SE 100 stocks was responsible for continued high volume in the traded options which saw a total of 50,153 contracts traded. Volume in FT-SE 100 options was significantly down at 10,335 lots against Wednesday's 25,082 but the Euro FT-SE 100 was busy, trading 10,354 lots. British Gas was the busiest stock option with a total of 6,005 contracts following a big trade carried out by SG Warburg. It was followed by Abbey National at 2,135 lots and Guinness at 1,881 contracts. BTR at 1,226 and Glaxo at 1,191 were the other stocks in the league table.</p>

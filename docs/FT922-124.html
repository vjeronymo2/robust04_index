			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Hitachi long-term debt downgraded MOODY'S Investors Service yesterday downgraded the long-term debt rating of Hitachi, Japan's largest electric machinery maker, citing 'fundamental weakness' in the company's information systems and electronics operations. The difficulties facing the business were illustrated by a 37.4 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y128.9bn (Dollars 1.02bn) in the year to March, mainly due to weak markets for computers and semiconductors. Moody's said adequate returns on Hitachi's investment in electronics and information systems would be hampered by excess capacity in semi-conductors, which could take years to absorb, and by weakening demand for mainframe computers. 'In consumer products . . . earnings have been suffering, primarily as a result of market maturation and the lack of major new products,' Moody's said. The power and industrial systems division of Hitachi was expected to provide increases in profits and cash flow in the years ahead, because of growing demands for equipment. Treuhand, the German privatisation agency, has been assigned the top credit ratings for its short-term and long-term debt by the leading international rating agencies, writes Sara Webb. Standard &amp; Poor's has assigned an implied long-term triple-A rating and an implied short-term rating of A1+ to the agency, while Moody's said it expected to assign a Aaa bond rating to long-term debt issues once it began its borrowing programme. Treuhand, the government-owned institution charged with reorganising and privatising the former east German state-owned assets, currently has about DM7bn of debt issued in the German commercial paper market, and is able to draw on a commercial paper programme of DM10bn. In addition, the agency is expected to borrow outside the German commercial paper market, possibly tapping the international capital markets, Moody's said.</p>

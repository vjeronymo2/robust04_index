Police said the mother had  taken her sons to visit their father where he was being treated  at a local hospital, and was returning home. The attack occured  as she stopped the car at a traffic light in Alberton.    "As the car stopped...an unknown gunman or gunmen opened  fire  from behind the vehicle they were travelling in. The woman and  her two sons were hit several times," police said.    A R150,000 [rand] reward has been offered for information  leading to the arrest of the attacker or attackers. SAP [South  African Police] ground patrols and a police helicopter combed  the area until late Thursday in an attempt to track down the  killers but were unsuccessful.    The names and addresses of the victims have not yet been  released because their families have not yet been notified. The  SAP statement said police believed other motorcars in the  vicinity at the time of the attack might also have been hit by  flying bullets. These motorists were asked to contact the East  Rand Murder and Robbery Unit at 8452820.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Fair play with Russia in the world weapons market  would not hurt U.S. strategic interests, Sergey Yushenkov,  chairman of the State Duma Defense Committee said today.    He told INTERFAX that Washington's obstruction of Russian  weapon export, as in the case of the failed sales of MiG-29  fighter planes to Venezuela, forced Russia to deal with  undesirable partners.    As a result, Yushenkov said, odious dictatorial regimes  obtained weapons through third or fourth countries and created  tension for the entire world community.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by army affairs correspondent Roni Daniyel] </F>   [Text] The defense establishment views the discontinuation  of the peace talks as an indication of a struggle over  negotiating modalities, and not merely details. For the defense  establishment, the return to Taba means an understanding with  the Palestinians that any agreements achieved there would be  final, and that it will not be necessary to rush every agreement  to Tunis for Yasir 'Arafat's approval or rejection.    The Taba talks will address the Qatif Bloc's area and  defense  mechanism; road traffic and how it is to be made secure; and  that ancient issue of the control in border crossings, including  that of Rafah. In all the talks, the Cairo understandings and  agreements will be the starting line, nothing else.    If the Taba encounter proves successful both in terms of  negotiating modalities and the Palestinian delegation's mandate,  the civilian track will be launched in full scope in the coming  days.</p>

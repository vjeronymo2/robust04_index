Mr John Jacobs, the group's 74-year-old chairman, yesterday also announced plans to retire. He said that this would 'definitely be my last report . . . as chairman.' Turnover advanced to Pounds 2.84m, compared with Pounds 2.25m. The deficit came through as 2.3p per share, against earnings of 11.5p last time. A final dividend of 1.4p has been proposed, making a total of 3.3p for 1993. This included an interim payment of 1.4p which was in lieu of a final dividend for 1992, when a total of 0.5p was paid.</p>

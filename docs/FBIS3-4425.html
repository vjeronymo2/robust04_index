This means that all such restrictions throughout  the province have been lifted. In view of the fact that Yushu  and Golog prefectures are located in remote areas, and that real  difficulties of long transport line, slow turnover, and high  costs have existed in the grain trade, the provincial government  has decided that while lifting restrictions over grain trade and  prices, some preferential policies are still applied to the  above-mentioned two prefectures.    These preferential policies are mainly: The provincial  government's overall subsidies for the two prefectures' deficits  in grain business will not be reduced, and will continue to be  retained. These subsidies will mainly be used to establish  grain supply funds, and to support grain enterprises to develop  diversified business operations [words indistinct]. In  accordance with the principle sharing transport expenses among  the state, enterprises, and individuals, the provincial  financial department will provide proper subsidies for grain  freight of the two prefectures. After the lifting of control  over grain prices, pensions of retirees in grain sector will be  paid by the provincial financial authorities, and 70 percent of  the wages of workers and staff members in the sector will also  be subsidized by provincial financial authorities. In addition,  to enhance the capacity of the two prefectural governments to  exercise macroscopic regulation and control after the lifting of  controls over grain prices, the amount of their provincial-level  grain reserves will also be properly increased.</p>

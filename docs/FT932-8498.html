			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Latin American buyers in retreat LATIN American art had been one of the few bright spots during the three-year decline in the international antiques market. But in New York on Monday night even this sector experienced difficulties. Christie's auction brought in Dollars 8.25m (Pounds 5.4m), but half the 64 lots on offer were unsold. There are still buyers for exceptional works. Rufino Tamayo's vast painting, (almost 4 metres by 14 metres) 'America', commissioned by the Bank of the Southwest in Houston in 1955, sold for Dollars 2.58m, a record for this Mexican artist. Three other works by Tamayo also sold well. In contrast only four of the nine paintings by the Colombian artist Fernando Botero, famous for his portraits of fat men and women, found buyers. Sentiment was not helped when the painting on the special catalogue of his works was withdrawn as a fake before the auction. There was also no buyer for 'My dress hangs here', a claustrophobic view of Manhattan by the fashionable Frida Kahlo, which was expected to break the Dollars 1m barrier. The Latin American market is dependent on newly enriched Mexican, Colombian and Venezuelan collectors. The unexpected blip in demand is partly attributable to higher reserves imposed by sellers, and partly to fears about the prospects of their national economies. Another market which has continued to thrive in the recession is Pre-Columbian art, which started from a low price base. At Sotheby's on Monday an Olmec cylindrical ritual container, dating from the first millennium BC and found at Chalcatzingo in Mexico, sold for Dollars 233,500, an auction record.</p>

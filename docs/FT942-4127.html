			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Motorway service-area freeholds to be sold The government yesterday announced plans to sell the freeholds of the 47 motorway service areas it owns. However, potential purchasers predicted that hopes of raising substantial sums would be disappointed. Healey &amp; Baker, the estate agents engaged by the Highways Agency for the sale, estimated that they might raise Pounds 25m. The operators of the service stations, which are the most likely buyers, said they would be worth much less. Thirty-three sites will go on sale in the first tender round, due in September, with the other 14 later. The problem for the government is that service areas have at least 37 years to run on 50-year leases, with the leaseholds requiring the payment of only a peppercorn rent. Purchasers would own an asset that would bring no return for a long time. Forte, which has 25 motorway service stations, said the government had initially indicated that the freeholds would be transferred automatically to the operators. Mr Richard Power, communications director, said: 'Going through a bidding process is a nonsense. They were to have been transferred free. We won't pay much more than a nominal amount. The only people to benefit will be the consultants and the agents.' Forte did, however, welcome the fact that ownership of the freehold would remove some of the restrictions on activities that can be carried out at service stations. The service-station operators paid a total of Pounds 50m to acquire the leases on the sites in the early 1980s. Mr Power said: 'We paid a purchase premium in the first place so we have already bought them once.' Granada Hospitality, which has 20 sites, said it had not decided whether to bid. The company said: 'It is not exactly the most exciting investment for anyone who is not an existing tenant. You would have to have a very long-term view.' Healey &amp; Baker were more optimistic about the sale. Mr Gordon Pipe, a partner, said: 'We expect an enormous interest from the operators. This will give them more incentive to improve them. Property companies, investors and the owners of land adjoining the service areas will also be interested.' But Granada said it had not been dissuaded from investing in its sites by the fact that it held only the leasehold. It had spent more than Pounds 15m on improvements in the past few years. The government first announced plans to deregulate motorway services in 1982, but it was not until January this year that it unveiled plans to allow the private sector to build and operate 24 new service areas. It reduced the minimum distance required between sites from 30 miles to 15 miles.</p>

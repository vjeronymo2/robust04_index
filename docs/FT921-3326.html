			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Israel charges US with false arms leak SENIOR Israeli officials, stung by allegations that Israel may have sold Patriot missile technology to China, yesterday bitterly accused the administration of President George Bush of deliberately leaking to the press what they said was a false report. The issue, made public just as Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister arrived in the US for a visit, has focused attention on Israel's well-established clandestine international arms links, including to China and South Africa. It was a further blow to a US-Israeli relationship already badly dented by Israel's struggle to persuade a reluctant Washington to grant at least some of its request for Dollars 10bn in US loan guarantees to aid Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union. Mr Eliyahu Ben Elissar, chairman of the Knesset foreign affairs and defence committee and a senior Likud party MP, said the Bush administration was trying to 'sully' Israel. 'It is not the first time the administration uses the press as a convenient opportunity, usually when we have an important visit like the defence minister or when the administration is trying to pressure us with slander,' he told Israel television. Mr Arens, who is to see Mr Dick Cheney, the US defence secretary on Monday, took care to exclude President Bush, Mr James Baker, the secretary of state, and Mr Cheney, from his remarks. But he said 'somebody out there is trying to muddy the waters'. He said the administration should have approached Israel privately before going public. The Washington Times newspaper, quoting an unnamed senior US official, reported on Thursday that the administration was investigating US intelligence reports that suggested Israel may have sold a Patriot missile or part of its technology to China. The European Commission yesterday pressed China to curb the Community's growing deficit with Beijing, writes David Buchan in Brussels. In the first visit of a top Chinese leader to Brussels since the 1989 massacre of students in Tiananmen Square, Mr Qian Qichen, the foreign minister, was also reminded by Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, of the need for political reform in China.</p>

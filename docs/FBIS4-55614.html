			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 17 May (TANJUG) -- Patriarch of Moscow and  All-Russia Aleksiy II, Serbian Patriarch Pavle, and Zagreb  Archbishop Cardinal Franjo Kuharic, signed the Sarajevo  declaration for peace at Sarajevo airport today. The  declaration says:    It is high time to say that the nations in this area must no  longer destroy each other and that such action aginst the life,  rights, freedom and dignity of other nations is predominantly  directed against one's own nation, against one's own  grandfathers, fathers, sons and grandsons. It is high time one  understood that it is only a peaceful and just solution of all  conflicts and misunderstandings present in relations between  nations in this area that can bring real happiness to people;  their future will be salvaged only when we offer each other the  possibility of living as we are accustomed and as our ancestors  used to. It is time for us to recall that the present tragic  conflict in the Balkans is a sin against every religion, because  it is in no way compatible with any religious principles  whatsoever. Taking advantage of religion for the sake of  justifying hostility and divisions is an immoral and unlawful  act.    True believing Christians and true believing Muslims are  striving toward peace. This is their genuine desire and this is  also in conformity with the Creator's commandments. And what  can we do, we who believe in the one God?    We should and must pray and work and keep on believing that  our prayers will be answered. We are also appealing to everyone  in the world who believes in God to join us in our prayers for  peace, and all those responsible for political decisions to  re-examine their conscience before God and history. What will  prevail and how can peace be attained?    May the Lord bestow peace, progress, wealth, and success in  the pursuit of righteousness on all those divided today by  deadly animosities.</p>

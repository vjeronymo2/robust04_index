			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, EPA has not verified that the operating modes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed test procedures are the optimal representation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what happens in actual use. Any test cycle is at best an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximation of the operating conditions experienced by engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in actual use. Indeed, any one engine will be installed in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range of equipment types and will experience a different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating environment in each application. To determine if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test procedures are doing the best possible job at estimating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> real world operation, EPA intends to collect data on a full range  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of operating conditions that are not represented in the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test cycle. Manufacturers have presented histograms of a range  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of equipment operations such that, for purposes of this notice,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the test cycle is directionally acceptable. Further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigation may result in a determination that the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cycle adequately covers the range of operation. However, time is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not available to make that determination in this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any of the above mentioned changes to the current proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test cycle or procedures would require extensive testing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development. All emission data to date is based on the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test procedures. Before introducing any change in the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures EPA would have to develop emission standards based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the revised procedures and would have to assess emission impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the procedures. The current timeline constraints provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neither adequate time to properly assess whether any of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes would benefit the program, nor adequate time to develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate emission standards using the revised procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Faced with these constraints, EPA believes that the proposed test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures are the best available to ensure early emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction from the engines covered in this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> L. Alternative, Oxygenated, and Reformulated Fuels <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is not proposing the requirement of any specific type of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel to be used in engines produced to meet the proposed emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. EPA's proposal would require that all SI engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under 19 kW meet the proposed standards. This includes SI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines which run on ``alternative'' fuels, such as liquid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petroleum gas (LPG) and natural gas. A few research papers have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been published which indicate well calibrated spark-ignition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines running on LPG fuel may be able to meet the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards with less difficulty than an equivalent engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> running on gasoline. EPA proposes to let the engine manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decide what type of fuel a given engine application will use and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not require any specific engine to use a ``cleaner'' fuel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's proposal would not allow engines which are designed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> run on gasoline to perform certification emission testing using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an alternative fuel. EPA understands that oxygenated and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reformulated gasoline fuel is currently available in different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas around the United States. However, availability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oxygenated and reformulated fuels varies widely across the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> country. EPA does not have information that would provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate assurance that the alternative fuel, and not gasoline,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be used in these engines in actual use. Faced with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficulty of tracking small SI engine owners, EPA does not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate resources, nor an adequate tracking mechanism to enforce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a requirement that small SI engine owners use only the specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative fuel. At the same time, preliminary tests performed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on small engines using reformulated and oxygenated fuels show  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately a three to five percent improvement in exhaust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission levels of CO and total HC. See the draft RSD in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> docket for further discussion of this issue. Reformulated fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was designed to lower HC levels from on-highway vehicles,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primarily engines with fuel injection and catalytic convertors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is not convinced it can reasonably expect the same type of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefit from carbureted single and two-cylinder engines. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solicits comment on the feasibility of requiring small SI engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to run only on oxygenated or reformulated fuels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> M. HC + NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  Standard for Class I and II Engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is considering two options for setting Class I and II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HC and NOx standards. Option 1 would consist of setting a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combined standard for emissions of HC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for Class I and II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines. Under option 2, EPA would set separate HC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission levels for Class I and II engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regardless of which option EPA chooses, it anticipates that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission rates from engines meeting this proposed rule's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards will be generally higher than those extremely low NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels emitted by current engines. The Agency views this as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inevitable consequence of the level of HC reduction being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieved in this rule. Furthermore, EPA estimates that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting increase in NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission inventories would be slight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enough in this particular case to be warranted given the much  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater decrease in HC emission inventories. See ``VI.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Benefit Assessment'' in this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nonroad small SI engines currently operate on an extremely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rich fuel and air mixture_in other words, one that contains a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> very high proportion of fuel relative to that used by, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, automotive engines. Because this results both in less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete combustion and much lower peak combustion temperatures,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhaust concentrations of unburned HC are extremely high, while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  are extremely low. As a result, small SI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines contribute appreciably to HC emission inventories, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> very little to NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission inventories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan, U.S. Should Lead New Trade Framework"] </F>   [Text] A global trade framework was newly established at  the GATT Uruguay Round ministerial conference in Marrakech,  Morocco.    The Uruguay Round of the multilateral trade negotiation  started in Punta del Este, Uruguay, over seven years ago.  Negotiations were repeatedly deadlocked, but finally achieved a  historic success.    Including agreements on trade, farm products, textile,  antidumping, and trade subsidies, the Uruguay Round worked out  documents numbering over 20,000 pages. Thus, the rule book of  international trade was drastically revised, and new rules were  provided for farm and service trade, as well as protection of  intellectual property rights.    We would like to extend our congratulations to all persons  who contributed to the settlement of the unprecedented  negotiations. The new trade framework will play an important  role in preventing bloc economy like in the 1930's.    The world economy is undergoing fundamental changes.  Economic growth of industrialized nations is slowing, but such  nations as China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina,  Poland, and Turkey are becoming new key players with stronger  competition power.    In particular, China is demonstrating its presence as a  major  economic power that leads fast-growing Asia. Uneven growth in  the world economy is intensifying frictions and tension between  existing and new emerging economic powers.    In January 1995, GATT will be replaced with the World Trade  Organization (WTO). As a new watchdog of the free trade system,  it will mediate trade-related disputes, and fight against  protectionism and bloc economy.    Here, we would like to stress how Japan and the United  States  played important roles in the conclusion of the Uruguay Round.  After the G-7 summit in Tokyo last July, the two nations jointly  contributed a lot to the successful conclusion of the round. To  achieve the goal, Japan had to endure great pain of the partial  liberalization of its rice market.    The initiative of Japan and the United States is very  important for the WTO. Since some quarters in the U.S. Congress  are against U.S. ratification of the WTO agreement, President  Bill Clinton is supposed to try his best to obtain support from  his nation.    Meanwhile, during the Marrakech conference, Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor failed  to agree on a resumption of the Japan-U.S. economic framework  talks.    In the "economic reform guideline," Japan has pledged to  hammer out tangible measures for settling the top three trade  disputes with the United States -- macroeconomic policy,  government procurement, and insurance and auto trade -- before  the end of June. We hope the government will try its best to  carry out reduction of trade surplus and expansion of imports  for the sake of the Japanese public.    At the same time, we have some requests for the Clinton  administration. The United States should drop its demand for  "objective criteria" which may impose restrictions on trade  partners as target figures.    The United States is proposing "labor criteria," which is  intended for controlling imports from developing nations on the  pretext of inadequate wage and labor right policies of these  nations. However, this should not be brought in the new trade  framework because this is another form of protectionism.    Regarding ways of handling trade disputes, the United States  should not lean on unilateral measures such as the Super 301  provision (which stipulates sanctions against unfair trade  practices of specific nations). Such an attitude is to neglect  the WTO's grievance mechanism from the starting point.    Aggressive market opening policies may bring about  deindustrialization, but Japan cannot be free from competition  in the world market. Based on a concept that the free trade  system makes the world prosperous, both Japan and the United  States must overcome temptation of protectionism, and jointly  support the WTO at any rate.    Such positive approaches will benefit Japanese and U.S.  public eventually.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (15): How this exercise works This feature is not a competition but an allocation exercise. The purpose is to see how four professional fund managers manage a Pounds 250,000 portfolio on behalf of a hypothetical client of their choice. In each case, the client is assumed to be either a wealthy individual or a small self-administered pension fund; and all four emphasise that they are investing for the long term (10 years or more) rather than for short-term gain. The exercise started at the beginning of October 1990. The portfolios given here were drawn up as at the beginning of this month, and will be reviewed at the end of September.</p>

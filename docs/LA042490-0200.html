			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> GROANS GREET 'BONFIRE' FILMING  </P> <P> Moaning merchants and gawking passers-by greeted Hollywood's arrival in the  Bronx for filming of "The Bonfire of the Vanities," starring Tom Hanks as a  bond dealer brought low by the Big Apple.  </P> <P> There were cranes, trucks, traffic jams and plenty of stars Monday during  filming at the courthouse.  </P> <P> The movie is based on Tom Wolfe's best-selling novel of avarice, ego and  corruption. And the flames of discontent did leap Monday as a 200-person movie  crew worked.  </P> <P> "It's making everybody's life miserable," groused Nick Kavalos as movie trucks  jammed the street outside his delicatessen. "The bread guy had to park two  blocks away and carry in my delivery."  </P> <P> The courthouse and its players take a prominent role in the book, Wolfe's  depiction of New York's lowlifes and high brows. Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman  and Melanie Griffith are also in the movie.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Khabarovsk June 23 ITAR-TASS -- Russian Vice-Premier  Sergey Shakhray today said the situation with the delivery of  goods to the northern regions of Russia was alarming as a whole  and bordering on emergency in several regions. The government  commission headed by him met on Thursday to discuss deliveries  of goods to the northern areas of the Russian far eastern  Khabarovsk territory.    More than two million tons of goods are to be delivered to  the regions within a brief navigation period. The operation  costs an estimated 624 billion rubles, according to the  territorial leaders. Because of the appalling shortage of  financial resources, the deliveries of goods are being conducted  extremely unsatisfactorily. The main supplier enterprises have  vast debts and are unable to pay off even last year's credits.    There are no stocks of fuel, foodstuffs and other goods in  ports. The Amur Shipping Line's ships lie idle in docks.    This year, a new system of financing northern deliveries was  introduced, a new 5.5 trillion-ruble federal fund was set up and  regional funds are being established, according to Shakhray.    Forty-five billion rubles were earmarked for the Khabarovsk  territory from the federal fund and 47 billion rubles were given  as credit resources. According to the governmental commission,  Shakhray stressed, despite insufficient financing, this money is  enough to pay for a more intensive delivery of goods to northern  regions. The money goes first of all to pay for the deliveries  of oil products, coal and foodstuffs.    Members of the commission visited the Khabarovsk port,  examined local power plants and other enterprises. A working  protocol identifying tasks and priorities for ministries,  departments and other structures for the next few months and for  the perspective was signed.    The government commission members are scheduled to leave  Khabarovsk for Irkutsk on Thursday.</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Talks break down after employers refuse 26% rise ARBITRATION talks for east Germany's metal and electrical workers broke down in Saxony-Anhalt on Monday night after Gesamtmetall, the employers association, told IG Metall, Germany's giant engineering union, it would not pay the sector a 26 per cent wage increase. The breakdown of the talks means that IG Metall will have to decide what room there is for compromise without losing face, or gauge whether its 280,000 members have the stomach for an all-out strike in an industry facing increasing unemployment. Throughout the talks in the five east German states, Gesamtmetall had offered IG Metall a 9 per cent rise, an increase which is becoming the accepted target in other industrial sectors of the eastern economy. However, IG Metall officials yesterday said such an increase ignored the fact that east Germans had to pay west German prices with east German incomes. It also accused employers of reneging on a contract agreed in March 1991 which would bring east German wages up to west German levels by April 1994. Wages for eastern Germany's metal, electrical and steel sectors are currently 70 per cent of west German levels. A 26 per cent increase next month would have brought them up to 82 per cent, even though productivity is about 70 per cent below west German levels. Arbeitgeberverband Stahl, the steel employers association, which yesterday started arbitration talks in Berlin with IG Metall for the steel sector, said it too was prepared initially to offer eastern German steel workers a 9 per cent pay increase, instead of the planned 20 per cent stipulated in the March 1991 contract. A spokesman denied the association was breaking the contract. 'A clause in the contract legally entitles us this year to revise the timetable and wage increases, if economic expectations radically changed from the original agreement.' But IG Metall believes the employers are not negotiating in good faith. 'What is at stake is the entire principle of collective wage bargaining,' Ms Dagmar Opoczynski, a spokesperson for IG Metall said. 'The employers want to opt out of collective wage bargaining and set their own wage levels in eastern Germany. If they break the wage contract in eastern Germany, they can do it in western Germany,' she said. IG Metall has responded to the breakdown of talks by organising demonstrations.</p>

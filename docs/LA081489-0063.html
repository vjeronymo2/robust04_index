			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: CIGARETTES, COCAINE PERIL PREGNANCIES  </P> <P> Two studies released last week document the dangers of pregnant women using  cocaine and smoking cigarettes.  </P> <P> Women who use cocaine early in their pregnancies are nearly five times more  likely to produce babies with serious birth defects, government researchers  reported in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. In a first-of-a-kind  study, researchers found that pregnant women who used cocaine had a much  greater chance of giving birth to babies with deformities in their kidneys or  other parts of their urinary tracts.  </P> <P> Researchers believe that cocaine use during pregnancy may decrease the amount  of oxygen getting to the developing fetus, causing malformations in the  development of certain organs, such as the kidney, said Dr. Gilberto Chavez, an  epidemiologist at the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta who  conducted the study.  </P> <P> A Swedish study reported that women who smoke during pregnancy increase the  risk of a late miscarriage by 40% and double the chance that their child may  suffer crib death. The study, published in the Swedish Medical Assn.'s journal,  was based on all 300,000 births in Sweden between 1983 and 1985.  </P></p>

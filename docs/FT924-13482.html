			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses mixed before Bundesbank meeting The continent put in a mixed performance yesterday, and trading remained thin ahead of today's Bundesbank meeting, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT fell as the government was told to raise income tax allowances, the market taking the view that the lost revenue would have to be made up elsewhere. Among individual stocks, Veba came under pressure as the Dax index ended 6.97 lower at 1,458.53. Veba fell DM10.90 to DM341.10, hit by two rumours: that the company faced large costs for environmental cleaning at a Berlin site, though this was denied by the company; and that Dresdner Bank had downgraded its earnings forecasts for the utility group, but this was also denied by the bank. Leading chemicals were also the subject of profit revisions from two research houses, DB Research and CSFB, which cut back their profit forecasts and predicted 1992 dividend cuts from Hoechst and BASF. But dealers said the news had no impact on the sector which moved in line with the market. Pharmaceutical shares, led by Degussa and Schering, posted the day's strongest gains. Degussa closed at DM287, up DM8.50 Schering DM13 higher at DM663. MILAN jumped 2.7 per cent on the final day of the October trading account on a combination of professional short-covering and buying by domestic funds and brokers in anticipation of a firm start to the new account. But foreign investors were largely absent, taking the view that the recent rally was mainly technical. The Comit index rose 10.48 to 404.76 in turnover estimated at a high L250bn after Tuesday's L164bn. Fiat and Generali continued to fuel the market's rise. Fiat rose L291 or 7.1 per cent to to L4,391 on continued rumours, denied by the company, that the car group was close to some kind of agreement with Toyota of Japan. Fiat was also lifted by the short covering of a reported 12m shares. Generali rose L1,150 or 4.2 per cent to L28,760. PARIS remained short on ideas, which was reflected in the paltry turnover of FFr1.28bn. The CAC-40 index ended 17.16 down at 1,667.93. Euro Disney continued to rise, adding FFr1.80 to FFr76.50, but off the day's high of FFr77.80, on a report that its US parent planned to reduce the financial pressure on its subsidiary. The fall in the dollar contributed to the decline in building material stocks, with Lafarge losing FFr8.50 to FFr271 and Saint-Gobain dropping FFr14 to FFr482. AMSTERDAM finished on a weaker note, following a softer dollar and declines on most European bourses. The CBS Tendency Index fell 0.4 to 106.7. Chemicals shares sustained the heaviest losses as several analysts downgraded their profit forecasts. DSM fell Fl 1.50 to Fl 87.80 and Akzo lost Fl 1.40 to Fl 133.40. MADRID followed the downtrend established elsewhere, the general index closing 1.03 lower at 191.65. The talking point of the day was the fall of Pta45 to Pta925 in Telefonica, apparently due to selling by one domestic broker. The company held a presentation for analysts in Madrid yesterday, but this was expected to be neutral in its effect. OSLO closed mixed with the airline, DNL, up and rig stocks down. As the all-share index fell 1.05 to 335.91, DNL rose NKr2 to NKr58 on news that a small competitor named Norway Airlines faced bankruptcy. Most rig shares fell after rising by some 30 per cent in a week, Wilrig losing NKr5 to NKr20 and Ross Offshore NKr3 to NKr24. STOCKHOLM was little changed as the Affarsvarlden General index eased 0.9 to 674.9 in turnover of SKr354m after SKr264m. Astra remained firm, with its A shares adding SKr7 to SKr517, while profit-taking took Procordia B shares down from SKr74 to closed unchanged at SKr69. S-E Banken C shares fell SKr0.50 to SKr12.50 ahead of its eight-month earnings report today. VIENNA's 18-share ATX index rose just 0.06 to 778.73 in quiet trading ahead of the Bundesbank meeting today. ZURICH's SMI index fell 4.2 to 1,889.3. Chemicals saw some profit-taking, with Ciba bearers SFr9 easier at SFr621. HELSINKI was slightly higher ahead of interim results from five Finnish banks today. The HEX index rose 0.35 to 606.78.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- October 14                                        THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes         Open      11.30       12.00      13.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   992.47     991.36     991.99     993.22 FT-SE Eurotrack 200  1075.97    1074.94    1074.69    1073.39  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        14.00      15.00      16.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   993.77     991.91     992.16     992.09 FT-SE Eurotrack 200  1074.83    1073.58    1073.13    1074.77  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Oct 13    Oct 12     Oct 9     Oct 8   Oct 7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    999.62    984.55    987.08    986.33    971.05 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1085.38   1069.79   1070.52   1060.95   1052.71  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 994.37; 200 - 1076.93 Low/day: 100 - 990.72  200 - 1071.17  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

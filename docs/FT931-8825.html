			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government's response to Tomlinson receives broad welcome THE government's proposals won a broad welcome yesterday from most of the London hospitals affected, Robert Rice and Richard Tomkins write. Both Guy's and St Thomas' said they were pleased that Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, had accepted the recommendation that they should merge as a single NHS Trust. St Thomas' said it particularly welcomed the government's recognition of the need for a merged accident and emergency department for south London on one site. A Pounds 3.25m expansion of accident and emergency facilities is already under way at St Thomas' to cope with expected rise in attendances following the closure of the nearby Westminster Hospital. University College and the Middlesex said the planned merger of the two hospitals was in line with their own strategy. They expected to merge on the UCH site, redeveloping it to incorporate the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital. The Royal London said it was uneasy about the proposal to strip it of responsibility for community services, but it strongly welcomed the forthcoming review of specialities. If the accident and emergency services department of Bart's was closed, it said, it could easily handle the extra work. The reaction from Charing Cross, which remains under the threat of closure, was more cautious. It said the report clearly recognised that the hospital's specialty services had a future: it now had to be established exactly what form that future would take.</p>

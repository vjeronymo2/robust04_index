			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> 3-PERSON SHOW RUNS FROM COMPLEX TO SITCOM SUPERFICIAL  </P> <P> After the ninth installment of its New! Improved! annual juried show which  closed last month, the Orange County Center for Contemporary Art seems to be on  a roll. In a three-person show (through Sept. 16), work by recent CalArts  master of fine arts graduate Thaddeus Strode yields a level of wit and  brain-teasing complexity seldom seen at this low-profile artists' cooperative.  </P> <P> In his huge "Hexamethalynetetramine" painting, Strode plots big gray-white  globs in varying shapes and sizes, black spirals and a couple of old-fashioned  funnies characters atop a loose grid of fat gold and pink stripes.  </P> <P> The reference, of course, is to one of those unpronounceable ingredients of  modern-day foodstuffs. Strode compresses various tasks in the painting:  imagining what the molecular components of the chemical would look like under a  microscope, tacitly comparing this dismal age of over-processed food to the  never-never land of the funnies pages, and turning the whole thing into a  purely visual joke on such art-world subjects as pattern painting and  appropriation.  </P> <P> Another highly involved piece by Strode is "Shangri-la: Self-Portrait, Los  Angeles Times, New York Times, London Time, Tokyo Time," in which he juxtaposes  photographs of himself with photos of the Abstract Expressionist painters Mark  Rothko and Theodore Stamos, and top personnel at Marlborough Gallery in New  York, adding corny or teasingly allusive "incorrect" captions such as "one of  TV drama's arch-conspirators."  </P> <P> The viewer needs to know that the execution of Rothko's will (1972-82) provoked  one of the protracted court cases in modern art. Rothko's daughter Kate brought  a successful suit against Stamos (one of the estate's executors), Marlborough  Gallery owner Frank Lloyd and former gallery secretary-treasurer Bernard Reis  (another executor), accusing them of conspiracy and conflict of interest in  selling Rothko's works.  </P> <P> Elsewhere in Strode's piece, clock hands point to four times, a painting mimics  the style of Joan Miro and the OCCCA gallery is pinpointed on a Thomas Brothers  map. The hard-to-decipher ideas here seem to circle around the global nature of  the contemporary art market, the status of art as an "original" object and the  artist as media pawn.  </P> <P> Also on view is work by Chris Gallup and guest artist Laurie Pincus. In "The  Notion of Framing Expanded," Gallup creates a fly-by-night sales lot with  strings of pennants a la car dealership, an array of empty frames in various  ersatz materials (mock leopard skin to faux marble), and a bunch of slogans  ("One Size Fits All," "Your Art Here"). Unfortunately, the spoof on  art-as-commodity wears thin long before the viewer has examined all the  merchandise.  </P> <P> Pincus' "Lessons in Life" is a series of paper doll-like figures standing on  separate little platforms with phrases chalked on little blackboards explaining  the psychological block each one faces. "Afraid of Her Life" reads the sign  next to the cut-out woman in the long print dress with her forearm plastered in  front of her face; the man in a fedora clutching a briefcase is "Leaving His  Mother for the First Time." This is l-i-t-e stuff, as perky and harmless as a  TV sitcom.  </P> <P> Other pieces by Pincus chirp about such phenomena as wallflowers at a party,  personal taste and reactions to art. As conversation pieces for the yuppie set,  these brightly colored little wooden tableaux are just the ticket.  </P> <P>  Work by Laurie Pincus, Thaddeus Strode and Chris Gallup is on view through  Sept. 15 at the Orange County Center for Contemporary Art, Space 111, 3621 W.  MacArthur Blvd., Santa Ana. Hours are 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday through  Sunday. Admission is free. Information: (714) 549-4989.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Economic Diary Other economic news Tuesday: The twice-yearly economic outlook from the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development will give an upbeat view of economic prospects for the OECD's 25 industrialised member states over the next two years. Governments will be urged to maintain prudent policies to secure steady growth with low inflation. Wednesday: Britain's trade with countries outside the European Union is expected to show some improvement in November. The City consensus points to a deficit of Pounds 375m after October's mildly disappointing shortfall of Pounds 410m. Thursday: UK third-quarter balance of payments figures will attract more attention than usual because some analysts believe the fall in the UK visible trade deficit to a near 10-year low in the three months to end-September could presage current account equilibrium or surplus. During the week: German M3 growth is expected to slow further in November. However, the consensus forecast of 6.4 per cent annualised growth from the base in last year's final quarter would still be above the 4 per cent to 6 per cent target range.</p>

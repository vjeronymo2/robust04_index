			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of Kuwait (10): Heroics speed recovery / A report on the oil industry DURING the days of soot-laden skies last summer it appeared inconceivable that Kuwait should not only have extinguished all 727 of its burning oil wells, but be on target to restore production to pre-war levels by the end of 1992. However, as the emirate's rivals-cum-fellows in Opec know only too well, Kuwait is firmly on course to pumping more than 1.5m barrels a day (b/d) of oil - its last Opec quota - by the year's end, thanks largely to the engineering heroics of the international coalition of fire-fighting teams which doused the last blazing well in early November. The subsequent restoration of output, which began in June last year, is accelerating well ahead of a targeted rate of 50,000 b/d a month. Output next month, says Mr Homoud al Rqobah, the oil minister, will be 710,000b/d, including the emirate's 150,000 b/d share of output from the joint Kuwaiti-Saudi Arabian neutral zone, and will hit 920,000 b/d by June. To some extent, this speedy restoration is possible because, despite the graphic horror of the blazing wells, oil engineers have discovered that a good number of Kuwait's total of 1,080 wells are more or less serviceable. Mr al Rqobah has said that 65 per cent of the Iraqi-detonated wellheads can be readily repaired, while more than 100 wells survived the Iraqis completely intact. Present output is being achieved from just over 120 wells. Repairs on up to 60 of the least-damaged wells in the southern Burgan field, Kuwait's biggest, are taking as little as two-10 days each. Bechtel, the private US engineering group, is co-ordinating the recovery in the southern fields as part of its open-ended contract with the Kuwait Oil Company (KOC), while the Kuwait British Group, a consortium of AMEC, Wimpey and Taylor Woodrow from the UK, are repairing the pipelines and gathering stations in the main northern fields. Some re-drilling has already begun and, again, the Oil Ministry is optimistic that this will present few problems, particularly given the friendly geology of the main Burgan and Wafra fields where oil lies close to the surface beneath uniformly soft rock. Some 28 wells have already been re-drilled in the southern fields, each taking little more than 12 to 15 days each. Such drilling as will be necessary in the north, where none has yet begun, is likely to take one or two months per well, given the region's tougher and more complex geology. KOC has so far commissioned Santa Fe, the Kuwait-owned engineering group, to co-ordinate the drilling programme, with a target of 100 new wells sunk by the end of June and perhaps a further 200 over the next two years. The government aims to restore output capacity to at least 2m b/d by late 1993, compared with sustainable capacity of 2.5m b/d before the war, and is hinting that it may consider increasing this capacity eventually towards at least 3m b/d. However, its present thinking is to hold production at a ceiling of about 1.6m b/d-1.7m b/d, once it is attained, for six months. This would enable studies into possible damage to the reservoirs caused by the well fires. 'We're like a man just recovering from a disease,' says Mr Rqobah. 'We need time to recover.' To date only superficial studies into reservoir damage have been conducted, although oil engineers report that oil pressure in wells already functioning in the the southern fields is unchanged from pre-war levels. However, some analysts, including the local Al-Shall economic agency, have suggested that the race to restore output is drawing damaging amounts of water into the oil reservoirs - a charge disputed by the Oil Ministry. 'Our studies show that there is no problem with the reservoirs up to 1.5m b/d or 1.7m b/d; after that we will have to wait and see,' says Mr Rqobah. Restoring Kuwait's downstream operations, however, appears to be proceeding with much less urgency and some western diplomats suggest that the necessary steps to mend the country's refining capacity and revive its petrochemical ambitions may be hampered by bureaucratic cramp. Short-listed contractors for the management contract to oversee full repairs to the country's three refineries - favourites among which are Foster Wheeler, Fluor Daniel and Brown &amp; Root of the US - have been waiting since early last Autumn for a final decision, which government officials say is due any week now. The government is nevertheless expecting to restore 650,000 b/d of refining capacity, from a pre-war ceiling of 730,000 b/d, by early next year. Early repairs made under Bechtel's auspices have revived 170,000 b/d of capacity at Mina Ahmadi and 100,000 b/d at Mina Abdulla - enough to meet Kuwait's domestic power and petrol needs. Shuaiba, which was severely damaged by the Iraqis, remains moribund for now. The government has also, through the state-owned Petroleum Industries Corporation, suggested it wants to proceed with a pre-war Dollars 2.5bn project to build a petrochemicals export plant at Shuaiba, with a 750,000 tonnes-a-year ethane cracker. No formal tender for the project, which may be slightly modified from original proposals, is expected for several months, however. The overall cost of Kuwait's oil reconstruction programme, which aside from its ambitions in defence procurement make up the biggest slice of its total reconstruction bill, is still the subject of informed guesswork - particularly since no-one appears able to assess exactly what Bechtel's clearly lucrative deal with Kuwait will finally amount to. Mr Rqobah says the oil fires cost Dollars 2bn to extinguish, including the purchase of Dollars 600m worth of heavy equipment which will be resold in what amounts to a spectacular boot sale. He has puts the industry's total reconstruction bill, over the next three years, at Dollars 10bn-Dollars 15bn, although external government and industry observers suggest the final figure may be little more than Dollars 8bn, including the emirate's petrochemicals plan.</p>

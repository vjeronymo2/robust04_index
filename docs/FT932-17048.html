			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Leading Article: A wasted day of strikes TODAY'S one-day strike by some rail, bus and mine workers will be supported by little more than 100,000 people and will have a minimal impact on the UK economy. It is not the general strike that miners' leaders had been hoping for. Nor is it a sign of rising labour militancy throughout the economy: the number of strikes in January was even lower than last year, a record at the time, and the government's 1.5 per cent public sector limit is being accepted with scarcely a murmur of protest. But it is a powerful reminder of how the strike weapon can still be abused by public sector workers providing monopoly services, and a depressing indicator of how little some unions have learned over the past decade. The mineworkers' present plight is at least in part a result of their industrial action in the 1970s and 1980s; and the greatest success the miners have helped to achieve in recent times - temporarily blocking the government's pit closure programme - happened without losing a single day in strike action. But the mineworkers at least have the excuse that they have grand historic traditions to salute as they dwindle into industrial irrelevance, and in any case are today harming nobody but themselves. The rail workers have no such excuse. They are causing a great deal of bother to many hundreds of thousands of commuters. But it is not at all clear how the anger of those commuters is going to help the cause of job security on the railways or in the mines. If RMT, the rail union, has real grievances about job security or privatisation, it should be using its resources to win over public opinion and to lobby legislators, as it has done with some success over the issue of the British Rail pension fund. Strangely, the union seems to have forgotten the lessons of its own successful strike in 1989 when it put a great deal of effort into winning over the public rather than ignoring it. Similarly, action by the London bus workers is not going to win much public sympathy for the wage cuts that are accompanying privatisation, and which have been accepted by most bus workers. The strike could also act as a useful advertisement for the private operators whose routes overlap with London Buses. Strikes can have long-lasting and unintended effects, especially where customers have alternatives. Mr Malcolm Kitchener, managing director of Parcelforce, said recently that his group has just won back the first contract from a mail order company, which deserted the Post Office en masse after the 1971 postal strike. In the case of all three groups taking action today, the strike weapon is being used in a cavalier fashion which can only weaken the union case. For the railworkers the strike is essentially an act of political solidarity with the mineworkers, and British Rail is, rightly, making it clear to the union that if it takes such action again it will turn to the law.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lucia Helena Gazzola] </F>   [Text] Despite its open opposition to constitutional  revision, the PT [Workers Party] would have to amend several  provisions of the Constitution to implement its government  program -- if this is passed without amendment, and if the PT is  successful at the polls. Many of the proposals in the PT  government program, which is still under discussion, directly  contradict the Constitution and would entail making deep changes  in nearly all its chapters.    By way of example, the endorsement of abortions to be  performed at state-run health care centers jars directly with  Article 5 of the Constitution, which guarantees the  inviolability of the right to life and thus bans abortion.  Another example of conflict is the PT's proposal to guarantee  the right of homosexual couples to get married at a registry  office, to have access to social security benefits, or to share  or bequeath their assets to one another. Paragraph 3 of Article  226 of the Constitution clearly recognizes the family unit to be  the stable union between a man and a woman, thus excluding a  union between people of the same sex.    The PT wants the Armed Forces' role to be circumscribed to  defense of the borders, while the Constitution in Article 142  provides for other duties, such as enforcing law and order and  guaranteeing constitutional authority. The PT is campaigning  for voluntary military service, while Article 143 of the  Constitution stipulates that it is compulsory. The PT program  proposes creating a Defense Ministry, to "guarantee cohesion in  defense policy and reduce the corporate interests of each branch  of the Armed Forces." Article 91 of the Constitution, however,  takes the existence of the three military ministries (Army,  Navy, and Aeronautics) for granted.    The federal system of government does not escape from this  conflict, either. The PT intends to decentralize power and  financial resources so that they will be equitably shared  between the federal government, states, and municipalities.  This would require amendments to Articles 25-31 and to Article  145. The PT program jars with several points on the  organization of the three branches of government as provided for  in the Constitution. The PT program's defense of the principle  of "a vote for each citizen," in referring to representation in  the Chamber of Deputies, goes against Article 45 of the  Constitution, which stipulates that all states are to be  guaranteed a minimum of eight deputies and a maximum of 70.    Other examples include the PT's proposal to eliminate the  revisory role of the Senate, which goes against Article 65, and  the items pertaining to party affiliation and parliamentary  immunity, which go against the provisions of Article 55.</p>

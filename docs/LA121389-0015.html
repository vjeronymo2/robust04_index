			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTERN GADGETRY? SOVIETS VOTE NO  </P> <P> Members of the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies spent 20 minutes figuring  out a new automatic voting system Tuesday -- and then took the first vote by a  show of hands.  </P> <P> The Dutch-made Philips computers installed in the Palace of Congresses baffled  many deputies despite a lengthy explanation by Valentin Tetenov, chairman of  the Information and Communications Commission. He asked for a mock vote to see  how many were present, and the electronic board at the front of the hall  displayed the figure 333. However, 2,106 deputies were registered.  </P> <P> A second attempt at using the new gadgets produced a head count of 1,985. "We  have done a bit better this time but still seem to have lost a few deputies in  the process," Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev remarked.  </P> <P> "Equipment is equipment, but let's elect a counting commission just in case we  need it," Gorbachev said.  </P></p>

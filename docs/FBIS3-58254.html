			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, Jan 10 (AFP) -- Saudi Arabia's Eastern  Province governor Prince Muhammad Bin-Fahd arrived here on  Monday [10 January] for a three-day official visit and meetings  with French President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur scheduled for Wednesday [as received].    The governor, a son of King Fahd, was to hold talks Tuesday  with Industry and Foreign Trade Minister Gerard Longuet, Defence  Minister Francois Leotard and Interior Minister Charles Pasqua.    Prince Mohammad, sometimes described as the king's  "businessman" although he has no government portfolio, was also  scheduled to dine with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and  meet with French business leader Francois-Xavier Ortoli.    The governor's visit, arranged some time ago at the  invitation of both Mitterrand and Balladur, follows the latter's  weekend visit to Riyadh during which France hoped to clinch  major arms deals.    Instead, Balladur's visit ended only with the establishment  of a committee of experts charged with Franco-Saudi economic  dossiers.    Saudi Arabia is currently faced with financial problems  resulting from falling oil prices and a debt backlog from the  Gulf war three years ago.    The governor, whose province produces most of Saudi Arabia's  oil, was likely to continue discussions with French leaders  raised by Balladur at the weekend, French Foreign Ministry  sources said.</p>

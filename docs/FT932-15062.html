			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: Prior placing for Pounds 2.37m PRIOR, the property trading and investment group, is proposing to raise about Pounds 2.37m through an issue of new shares at 2 1/2 p each. The shares are being conditionally placed by Paribas, but there is an open offer to shareholders on a 7-for-2 basis at 2 1/2 p. In addition, it is proposed that the balance of a loan of Pounds 300,000 made to the company by Ardenbell, controlled by the family trust of Mr James Prior, chairman, be converted into 12m new shares at the placing price. As Mr Prior and a company associated with him will not be taking up their full entitlement under the offer, their holding will fall from 61 to 34.74 per cent of the capital. It is also proposed to convert each 10p share into one ordinary 1p share and one 9p deferred share, which will be cancelled. Agreements have been reached with the group's banks to restructure its Pounds 4.93m debt. Syndicate banks have agreed to release Prior from its guarantee of a Pounds 12m loan to a former subsidiary, for Pounds 100,000.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Pound firms as base rate rises to 6.25 per cent Sterling gained ground on the foreign exchanges yesterday after the UK base rate was raised to 6.25 per cent, from 5.75 per cent, writes Philip Gawith. The Bank of England's decision to lift rates, announced before 10am, took the market by surprise. While a minority of analysts had predicted that rates would rise this month, there had been little expectation of an announcement before today. The early move would appear to be the result of the Treasury and the Bank of England wanting to calm markets, following the government's defeat in parliament the night before on a VAT vote. Analysts agreed that sterling should benefit from another pre-emptive rise in interest rates, but said political uncertainty would continue to cap its gains. The pound closed in London at DM2.4576, up from DM2.45 before the rate announcement. Against the dollar it finished at Dollars 1.5644, down from an earlier high of around Dollars 1.5685, as the US currency strengthened in afternoon trading. Elsewhere, the dollar staged a strong recovery after congressional testimony from Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, raised expectations of another rise in US interest rates. The dollar had earlier fallen below Y100 as the bankruptcy of Orange County, California, unsettled investors. The dollar ended in London at DM1.571, some  1/2 pfennig up from an earlier low of DM1.5647. Against the yen it finished at Y100.15, up from a low of Y99.70. It closed in New York at DM1.5675 and Y99.95. Ahead of today's Bundesbank council meeting, a Reuters poll of 20 City economists found none of them expecting official interest rates to be cut. Sixty per cent of them believe there will be no further reduction in German rates. The measure of the market's approval of the rise in UK rates could be found in the behaviour of the short sterling futures contracts. The general message, over all maturities, was that the market believed UK short-term interest rates would now have less to rise than had been anticipated before this latest move. Volumes in the futures markets were heavy, with the March contract trading around 71,000 lots, to finish at 92.56, up from 92.50 on Tuesday, and a low for the day of 92.40. One money market source said he now doubted whether rates would be moved again before February at the earliest. He predicted a slowdown in the economy during the first quarter of 1995. He said the levels of rates being discounted in the futures market - 7.4 per cent in March 1995, 8.8 per cent by December 1995 - were 'ludicrous'. As regards sterling, Mr Avinash Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan in London, said political uncertainty could depress the currency in the short term. After that, though, the monetary tightening would be seen 'ultimately, as a bold gesture, designed to keep inflation at bay and likely to bring credibility to UK policy, if not its politicians'. Mr Persaud added that high real interest rates could push sterling to DM2.50 in the next three months. Mr Jonathan Griggs, economic adviser at Barclays in London, said the base rate rise was a 'significant boost for sterling'. While political uncertainty remained a problem, he said the pound would benefit from the authorities having removed any doubt about the monetary policy outlook. The combination of Mr Greenspan, and the release of the Fed's beige book, was enough to perk up the dollar. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America in London, said they 'greatly increase the chances of a tightening at the December 20 FOMC'. Mr Persaud said the spate of recent stories, indicating weakness in the US financial sector, could undermine the dollar; if the Fed took financial sector weakness as a reason not to raise rates, 'that would be a very dangerous cocktail for the foreign exchange market'. In its daily operations, the Bank of England provided late assistance to UK money markets of Pounds 170m, after fore-casting a Pounds 950m shortage. Earlier it had provided Pounds 573m assistance at the new rate of 6 1/8 per cent, where bills were purchased outright, and 6 5/32 per cent where bills were for resale to the market. Three-month LIBOR was unchanged at 6 7/16 per cent.</p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (1): The worst has passed - World oil production is more closely aligned to demand than for many years. But there are fears of renewed instability once the UN decides to end its embargo on exports by Iraq THE WORLD'S oil and gas companies have been living through difficult times in 1992, but there are signs the outlook may be improving. More than ever before, the global oil and gas industry is dominated by questions of balance, and a delicate balance is now returning to some key areas. Oil prices drive the whole industry, and these have generally been firmer and more stable, thanks to a very tight balance between supply and demand, although there was a worrying Dollars 1-a-barrel retreat last week. One of the principal factors that could upset the balance this year is not the actions of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or Middle East politics, but something more mundane: the weather. A colder-than-average winter in the northern hemisphere for the first time in five years could add up to 75 cents to the price of a barrel of oil. That price is already expected to rise close to Dollars 22 a barrel for North Sea Brent crude this winter, and to Dollars 20.50 or more for the Opec basket of world crudes  - close to the target of Dollars 21 a barrel Opec adopted in July 1990. However, with Opec production now within 1m barrels a day of its estimated total capacity, analysts say any short-term disruption in supply  - for example, from the former Soviet Union  - could still produce a price spike of up to Dollars 25 a barrel. That fact illustrates the continuing dominance of Opec over the world's oil markets, but the post-Gulf war era has seen signs of change within Opec. Many believe the organisation is becoming more market-oriented, responding to the changed outlook which sees demand for Opec oil rising in the 1990s, unlike the 1980s when its market shrank. Most members, including Saudi Arabia, are in debt and keen to maximise revenues, and yet they are carefully being nudged by Saudi Arabia into extracting the highest price the market will support, while still ensuring there is enough oil to meet market demand. There is, however, one black cloud on the horizon that threatens to shatter the delicate balance within Opec and the world oil market: the possible lifting of the United Nations ban on oil exports by Iraq. Opec may find itself in 1993 having to absorb 2.5m b/d or more of Iraqi oil, something bound to provoke disagreement. While oil prices are still crucial to oil companies, they must pay increasing attention to gas prices, as gas consumption grows across the world. Here, too there is better news. Balance is returning to the US gas market, and the 'gas bubble' which has severely depressed prices is finally thought to be over. Prices dropped from about Dollars 2.50 per thousand cubic feet in the early 1980s to Dollars 1.63 in 1986, and bottomed out at a mere 90 cents in February this year. They then climbed to a peak of Dollars 2.60 in September  - buoyed a little by the drop in production caused by Hurricane Andrew. They have since settled back to about Dollars 2.40, but supply and demand are seen as being closely matched for the foreseeable future. The only threat is that if prices climb too high, some users might switch to burning fuel oil. The higher prices are especially good news for the exploration and production companies without downstream interest who specialise in finding, producing and selling oil or gas. Natural gas stocks were the best performers on the New York Stock Exchange for the six months to September, according to a recent report by First Boston. Meanwhile, in the UK, the devaluation of sterling in mid-December has helped push the sterling oil price above Pounds 12, compared with an average of little more than Pounds 10.50 for the first half of the year. Expectations of a continued strengthening of the dollar are prompting analysts to reassess their 1993 earnings forecasts for UK independent oil companies, and some of these have seen their share price rise 30 per cent or more since mid-September. The outlook for the major integrated companies, whose activities encompass not only exploration and production but refining and marketing and petrochemicals operations, is less bright. Slower economic growth in the Far East, hesitant economic recovery in the US, and continued weak economic activity and recession in parts of Europe are likely to keep refining and chemicals margins under severe pressure. Such pressures have forced the majors into aggressive cost-cutting, but here, too, they face a question of balance. They must weigh the need to cut costs against the growing necessity of replacing their reserves  - something they have consistently failed to do in recent years. As many of the traditional producing areas such as the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico reach maturity, and no longer hold out the prospect of giant field discoveries, the quest for reserves is taking oilmen into uncharted and often risky territories, from Laos to Colombia. The oil companies' drive for international expansion has conveniently coincided with the opening up of many traditionally closed areas of the world, and many analysts expect there to be virtually no countries where international oil companies cannot operate by the end of the decade. The republics of the former Soviet Union, with the world's sixth-largest known reserves of oil and largest reserves of gas, are proving a magnet for oil companies. But, nearly a year after the break-up of the Union, progress is still sluggish. While a number of new joint ventures have been formed with Russia, the biggest deals have been done with Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, and the smaller republics seem to be proving more fleet-of-foot than the lumbering Russian bear when it comes to attracting Big Oil. Oil companies must also balance the need for spending on exploration with the investment required to meet ever stricter environmental legislation. The threat of a carbon tax has, for now, receded. But Mr David Simon, chief executive of BP, told September's World Energy Congress in Madrid the estimated cost to oil companies of meeting environmental legislation in the US was between Dollars 15bn and Dollars 20bn, and in Europe Dollars 9.5bn  - equivalent to the net annual income worldwide of Europe's top seven oil companies. Environmental concerns may also alter the global balance between oil and gas consumption. The US energy Bill that finally cleared Congress last month encouraged the use of natural gas as a fuel for motor vehicles and power generation, and gave tax relief to gas drillers. Gas advocates say the US could cut its reliance on foreign oil, its trade deficit, and its emissions to the atmosphere, by switching to a gas-based economy from oil. On the other side of the Atlantic, the decision last month to close 31 of the UK's remaining 50 coal mines (a decision now being reviewed) was blamed on the 'dash for gas' by the privatised electricity generators. The ensuing row has reopened the whole debate about the UK's energy policy. An important plank of that policy has been privatisation, but there have been numerous difficulties stemming from the fact that British Gas, the former monopoly supplier, was sold in 1986 as a single entity. Attempts to speed up the development of competition have had limited success. A series of rows between British Gas and its regulators, the Office of Fair Trading and the Office of Gas Supply, culminated in the decision in August to refer the whole UK gas market to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for a wide-ranging investigation. The result could be fundamental changes in the gas industry. The US began deregulation of its gas market in 1984, but the process is still continuing. What is intended to be the final phase, the Federal Energy Regulation Committee's Order 636, is due to be implemented next year. The Order will finally spell the end of the dominant merchant role of the interstate pipelines, allowing hundreds of suppliers to compete to provide reliable long-term gas services without having to own long-distance pipelines. But analysts predict its implementation could be dogged by uncertainty and controversy. European countries are unimpressed with the sometimes clumsy attempts by the UK and US to develop a competitive gas market, and powerful monopolies in many countries will resist any attempts to make similar changes. While the UK said it would use its presidency of the European Community to push for a single energy market, this has been overtaken by a fundamental debate about the future of the Community.</p>

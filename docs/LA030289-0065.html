			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> INGLEWOOD OKS PLANS FOR PSYCHIATRIC CENTER  </P> <P> In a defeat for one of Inglewood's largest employers and most powerful  institutions, the City Council unanimously approved a 14-bed psychiatric  treatment facility opposed by Centinela Hospital Medical Center.  </P> <P> Hospital officials, who said they fear residents of the facility would endanger  their patients and employees, said they will challenge the decision in court  unless their dispute with the operators of the facility can be resolved.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Meet With Councilmen  </P> <P> Representatives of the hospital and the Didi Hirsch Community Mental Health  Center, which wants to build the facility across the street from the hospital,  said they will meet with Inglewood Councilmen Anthony Scardenzan and Daniel  Tabor next week.  </P> <P> The vote came after several months of angry words and energetic lobbying by  both sides.  </P> <P> The debate evoked the larger mental health crisis in Los Angeles County, and  included references to last week's fatal stabbing by a mental patient of a  Santa Monica mental health worker.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rekindled Tensions  </P> <P> The debate has also rekindled tensions between Centinela and city officials,  some of whom privately accuse the medical center of throwing its considerable  weight around in an effort to run the city.  </P> <P> They and Hirsch supporters said the hospital was fomenting unreasonable fear of  the mentally ill. They charge the hospital wants to acquire the site, which the  hospital disputes.  </P> <P> Centinela officials say the hospital has taken justifiable interest in  important issues over the years. And they said the City Council's vote in favor  of the Didi Hirsch organization Tuesday was a serious mistake.  </P> <P> "The decision made by the City Council shows ineffectiveness on the part of  representatives elected to protect their constituents . . . ," said Centinela  Vice President Eric Tuckman in a prepared statement. "We would be abrogating  our responsibility if we allowed an unlocked crisis treatment center for the  most severely and critically mentally ill to be located directly across the  street from our emergency room and child care center."  </P> <P> Dr. Ellen Brand, executive director of the Didi Hirsch center, was full of  praise for the council members, some of whom acknowledge that their vote might  push the hospital to oppose them at the ballot box. In the past, political  action committees affiliated with the hospital have contributed heavily to  political candidates and to campaigns on local ballot measures.  </P> <P> "Here is a small municipal body that took a courageous stand in the face of  incredible odds," Brand said. "Hopefully it sends a signal to those who would  ignore the need for these services."  </P> <P> Council members said they agonized over their votes. But they said state law  and city zoning made it clear that Didi Hirsch had the right to build the  center on the site. The facility is intended to provide treatment for selected  mental patients released from hospital care.  </P> <P> The city's Planning Commission granted the clinic a special-use permit in  December, which Centinela appealed to the council.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Voted My Conscience'  </P> <P> "I feel good that I voted my conscience," Councilman Tabor said Wednesday. Like  other council members, he cited state law that prohibits discrimination against  the mentally ill in the approval of health-care facilities.  </P> <P> Councilman Scardenzan said he hopes Centinela and Hirsch can reach an  agreement, and expressed resentment at being caught "between a rock and a hard  place" in the controversy.  </P> <P> Centinela officials will bring suggestions for alternative sites to next week's  meeting with Scardenzan and Tabor, hospital spokesman Julius Mason said.  </P> <P> Dr. Brand said the Hirsch organization would consider the possibility of  another location, but said it would be difficult to find another properly  zoned, reasonably priced site. She said the mental health center must proceed  quickly with the planned facility or risk losing $500,000 in county mental  health funds.  </P> <P> As for possible political fallout from the decision, Centinela government  relations director Leona Eglund said before Tuesday's vote that the hospital  had withheld all endorsements in the city's April elections.  </P> <P> Tabor and Scardenzan are up for reelection, and a vacant council seat will also  be contested April 4.  </P> <P> Eglund made no threats, saying merely that the hospital had decided to withhold  support of any candidates until the mental health center issue was resolved.  </P></p>

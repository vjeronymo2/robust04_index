			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Berisford talks to Clark over bid: Board of shoe company yet to decide as commodities group renegotiates BERISFORD International, the property and commodities group, yesterday met the board of C&amp;J Clark to renegotiate elements of its Pounds 160m-plus bid for the family owned shoe manufacturer. Observers were speculating that the Berisford bid, the highest by a small margin, could well have won favour a majority of the board. The property and commodities group is thought to be renegotiating some of the conditions of its offer. These include exclusive rights of due diligence and an indemnity for costs if a majority of the board agreed to recommend Berisford, but shareholders rejected the bid. Clark yesterday said it had not decided on which of three bidders to recommend and it planned to meet again on Friday. An announcement would be made after shareholders had been informed. However, insiders said a majority of the directors had decided, although a final attempt at reaching a unanimous decision would be made this week. At least four members of the 11-strong board have objected to a sale to any of the bidders: Berisford, Fii the shoe manufacturer and a consortium of existing shareholders backed by Electra Investment Trust. There is a fourth institutional bidder which has been rejected. If Berisford's offer wins approval, shareholders should expect that Clark will be one of four divisions in the international holding company which Mr Alan Bowkett, chairman of Berisford, intends to build. Cost-cutting is likely to be a priority although - like all the bidders - Berisford says it is committed to UK manufacturing. Berisford intends to chase volume overseas, with opportunities in the children's market. The Clark brand, Mr Bowkett believes, has languished for too long as a mainly British product. Berisford intends to keep the struggling retail division, but reposition the products. Emphasis on fashion and keeping up with trend changes are key elements of Berisford's strategy. The other bidders, by contrast, aimed to make Clark their main business. Fii would, in fact, treble its size if it succeeded in a bid for Clark. The company is believed to have stressed to the board the opportunities presented by combining its fashion-oriented range with Clark's children's and casual shoe expertise. It planned to introduce a high quality range of children's and casual shoes to its main customer Marks &amp; Spencer. Fii also sought to stress its commitment to UK manufacturing, and has said its bid would not mean significant job losses. The consortium, meanwhile, has made a bid in which existing shareholders would be offered a 49 per cent stake in the business. The new vehicle will back current management strategy, although under a new leader. It would pursue 'global economies of scale' such as increasing the investment in brand promotion, both at home and abroad. Reebok for example, has been reported to spend some Pounds 190m a year on advertising, while Clark spends a mere Pounds 5m. Yet Reebok is only twice the size of Clark. The emphasis would be on the group's strength in the children's and men's shoe market. The final goal of the institutions is a flotation in five years. However the board decides between these options, it is difficult to escape one basic fact: the very public row which has rocked this intensely private Quaker company for the past seven months is unlikely to disappear when the board finally announces its decision.</p>

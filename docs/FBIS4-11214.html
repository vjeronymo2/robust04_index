			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires 21 Apr (NA) -- Economy Vice Minister  Carlos Sanchez today stated that the enactment of a patents law  to protect pharmaceutical products "will neither entail an  increase in the price of medicines nor necessarily foster the  establishment of monopolies" on the Argentine market.    He said: "We must assess the effect that the new law on  patents may have on prices, bearing in mind the market  regulation mechanisms we have at our disposal."    Health and Social Action Minister Alberto Mazza, by  contrast,  conceded that the price of patents "may affect overall health  costs." He nonetheless made it clear that this "may also depend  on technology."    Mazza emphasized that a patents law "will encourage  scientific development, and will permit Argentina's efficient  incorporation into the world community."    Sanchez and Mazza made these remarks during a public  appearance in the Senate's lecture room. The meeting was  sponsored by Industry Committee Chairman Jose Genoud of the  Radical Civic Union.    The executive branch submitted a pharmaceutical patents bill  to the Senate in May of last year. Five different committees  have been studying it since then.    The officials' public appearance is part of a series of  talks  that are being organized by the Senate. In the next few weeks  Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo and Foreign Minister Guido Di  Tella will also participate in it.    Provisional Senate President Eduardo Menem introduced the  speakers, and then said that the issue of patents "was not  shelved, as many people say. On the contrary, legislators are  seriously analyzing it."    Mazza denied that the new patents law will negatively affect  the quality of medicines, adding that "in any case, quality will  be guaranteed by the National Medicines, Food, and Technology  Administration."    Mazza stressed the organization's efficiency, and said that  it "was created with the participation and technical advice of  the World Health Organization and the Pan-American Health  Organization."    The health minister said: "This administration filled the  vacuum left by state control organs, which did not operate  properly because their work was not properly coordinated."    The economy vice minister in turn said that Argentina's  acceptance of the international law on patents "will not  necessarily affect prices, and if it does, the state has  instruments to regulate the operation of markets."    "When we talk about patents we mean respect for intellectual  property, not its effect on prices," the economy vice minister  said.    Asked if the patents law will imply the installation of  monopolies in the medicines market, Sanchez said: "There is a  national law on defense of competition and a National Commission  for the Defense of Competition. This commission is responsible  for strict control of the performance of various companies with  monopolistic powers, and for determining whether they abuse  their dominant position in the market."    Sanchez said that the assumption that monopolies and high  prices go hand in hand "is not necessarily correct, because we  have the instruments to control that relation."    "The patents law will not create monopolies. It will protect  property rights on scientific development. In any case, the  existence of monopolies depends on the characteristics of each  market," Sanchez added.    The vice minister said: "Some markets are necessarily  monopolistic, as they cannot operate in any other way. But that  does not mean that prices must increase. The computer business  started with two monopolistic companies, and it is well known  that prices did not increase. Instead, they dropped and are  still dropping," Sanchez concluded.</p>

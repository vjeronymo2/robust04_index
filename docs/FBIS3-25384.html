Dr. Shamuyarira said the UN had asked Zimbabwe for more  troops because of the good work the first contingent had  accomplished in Somalia. He said the new deployment would  consist of about 1,000 soldiers. The UN and Zimbabwe are also  conducting talks about sending Zimbabwean troops to Liberia.</p>

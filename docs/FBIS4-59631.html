			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gaza Mayor Dr. Zakariya Makki by Shadiyah </F> Riyad; place and date not given]    [Text] [Riyad] Dr. Makki, with the departure of the last  Israeli soldier from the self-rule areas in Gaza, what changes  have taken place since the signing of the agreement and what  changes do you expect to occur in the next few days?    [Makki] The departure of the Israeli occupation from Gaza  or,  to be more precise, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from  densely populated areas ended a nightmare for the Palestinian  people and spread rapture among Palestinians everywhere. A step  has been taken toward building a foundation on which our  Palestinian people may stand until they move toward establishing  their free Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital.    The situation in the West Bank and Gaza is one of great  jubilation. Most people were thrilled by the departure of the  Israeli troops, who used to kill children, women, and youths and  throw them in prison. Now Palestinian flags flutter over every  house and children rejoice. But there is sadness for those  heroic martyrs who fell during the eight years of the intifadah.  We say to them: You died to give us a new lease of life. It  is a new beginning and we hope it will be auspicious, God  willing.    [Riyad] We certainly hope so. The self-rule authority in  Gaza and Jericho has considerable responsibility. Would you  like to tell us about the situation in Gaza concerning the  economy, education, and the infrastructure?    [Makki] For 27 years, Israel has been trying to link the  occupied territories with Israel in the hope of integrating  these areas into the Israeli territories. This policy left  quite a scar on the infrastructure and the economy of Gaza and  the West Bank. We need to rebuild the infrastructure in Gaza  from scratch. This applies to electricity, water, sewage, and  all public services. The Israelis left us with another serious  problem. Over 70,000 Palestinians are jobless. The economy in  the occupied territories is very bad and we need to think of a  way to improve it.    [Riyad] During the signing ceremony of the Gaza-Jericho  accord, President Mubarak called for political and financial  support to promote the step. What is required now from all the  parties concerned with this accord--the Arab states, European  states, the cosponsors of the conference, and the United Nations?    [Makki] President Mubarak and the Egyptian people have  always  strongly supported the Palestinian people. We say that it is  the duty of the brothers everywhere, be they Egyptians or  Palestinians, to cooperate with each other. We focus on a very  important thing, namely, that the states that support this peace  must entrench it on the ground by strengthening the Palestinian  economy. The European Union, the United States, the IMF,  Russia, and the United Nations must support the Palestinian  people, who need the prerequisites for establishing this  authority on strong bases. Without a strong economy, the  Palestinian people will face great problems. The Palestinian  authority will face economic problems. It cannot solve these  problems alone; it needs the help of the Arab countries. I  appeal to all the Arab states and especially to all the Gulf  states, the European states, and the United States to support  the Palestinian people in their hardship and during this  critical interim period.    [Riyad] What is the stance of the opponents of the self-rule  accord in Gaza and Jericho and what is their reaction to the  entry of the Palestinian police force to these two areas?    [Makki] The Palestinian people are very intelligent. The  Palestinian opposition is a healthy and intelligent opposition.  According to reliable information, they will receive the  Palestinian police force with amity and appreciation.  Palestinians might differ among each other ideologically but  this does not conflict with the entry of the Palestinian force  from among our sons, who will protect us and safeguard the  property of the Palestinian people, individuals, and their  lives. I believe that the opposition, in light of the  statements it has issued, will not oppose; on the contrary, it  will receive the Palestinian police force with an open heart.    [Riyad] Do you wish to address the Palestinian people on the  birth of the first Palestinian entity?    [Makki] We tell our brothers the Palestinian people in the  West Bank and Gaza Strip that it is the duty of the Palestinians  to unite in these difficult conditions and to support each other  so that we can move from this step to build our independent  Palestinian state. God willing, the capital of this state will  be Jerusalem.</p>

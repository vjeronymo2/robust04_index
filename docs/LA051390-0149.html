			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CYCLING TOUR DE TRUMP;  </P> <P> CLIMB PROVES TOO TOUGH FOR SOVIET; ALCALA LEADS  </P> <P> Mexico's Raul Alcala displaced weeklong leader Vladislav Bobrik of the Soviet  Union Saturday, taking a 43-second lead heading into the final stage of the  Tour de Trump bicycle race.  </P> <P> "I know what to do now," Alcala said.  </P> <P> "I will see what happens tomorrow, but I don't believe there will be danger."  </P> <P> The 13-stage, 1,107-mile race ends today with the flat 108.5-mile  Northampton-to-Boston Road Race.  </P> <P> Alcala took the lead over the toughest stretch of the race, a 123.7-mile climb  from Catskill to Albany. James Urbanos of Boulder, Colo., used a finishing  seven-mile solo ride to win the stage by 30 seconds over Steve Speaks of  Longmont, Colo.  </P> <P> Urbanos broke away as a pack of about 20 riders crested the first of three  grueling hills. Urbanos' time was 4 hours 55 minutes 45 seconds.  </P> <P> "This is the biggest stage win I've ever had," Urbanos said. "It hasn't really  sunk in yet, but in a few hours I'm sure I'll freak out."  </P> <P> Alcala was among several riders credited with the same time as Speaks.  </P> <P> Alcala, 24, overtook Bobrik shortly after a lead pack of 19 cyclists completed  a 1,500-foot, three-mile climb to Devil's Kitchen, about 23 miles into the  stage. Several thousand spectators, the largest turnout of the race, lined the  sides of the narrow road up the climb.  </P> <P> Alcala, eighth last year in the Tour de France, remained with the lead group  while the main trailing group, including Bobrik, fell as many as seven miles  behind.  </P> <P> Alcala, who won the prologue when the race began May 3 in Wilmington, Del., and  also won the eighth stage, leads Norway's Atle Kvalsvoll by 43 seconds. Erik  Breukink of the Netherlands is third, 1:44 behind.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon from the "First Thing" </F> program]    [Text] The Nonaligned Movement's [NAM] 11th ministerial  conference attentively heard and included in the final  declaration basic Cuban foreign policy concepts that Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina's delegation expounded in Cairo. Cuba  terms as satisfactory the fact that the Cairo Declaration issues  an appeal to end the U.S. economic blockade against the island,  guarantees the Movement's continuity, and demands the  establishment of equitable relations between developed and  underdeveloped nations to achieve justice and equality.    The 109 countries represented at the ministerial conference  urged the U.S. Government to abstain from carrying out actions  against Cuba if these contradict the good-neighbor policy. They  also requested the return of Guantanamo Naval Base and the  effective and immediate implementation of the UN resolutions on  the blockade. It may be recalled that the UN General Assembly  issued statements in 1992 and 1993 advocating suspension of the  economic blockade against Cuba, but the United States has yet to  comply with the letter and spirit of the appeal.    During his so-called message to Cubans on 20 May, President  William Clinton not only manipulated Cuban history with evil  intentions but also reasserted that he will maintain the  economic boycott against the island. The Cairo Declaration  signed at the NAM's 11th ministerial conference also said the  adjustment programs and the foreign debt should not affect human  development programs, a concept that coincides with Cuba's  views. Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina had emphasized before  the plenary session that the NAM's number one priority is to  sponsor Third World nations' economic and social development.  Robaina said in Cairo that the best guarantee for a permanent  and durable peace is to end hunger. He said: If we do nothing,  we will be condemned to disappear, meaning two-thirds of mankind  would disappear.    The conference in Egypt also discussed a reorganization of  the United Nations so that it fulfills the wishes and goals of  the poorest countries, which represents one of the basic points  in Cuba's foreign policy. The decision adopted by those  gathered in Cairo to grant the Colombian city of Cartagena de  Indias the right to host the 11th summit of NAM leaders and  heads of state also represents encouraging news, given the need  to review specific problems in the region. Most of those  problems are similar to the ones which prevail in Cuba, except  the old Cuban-U.S. dispute.    The NAM's ministerial conference, which just ended, proved  Cuba's active role in the Movement and the endorsement that its  proposals, views, and demands for support receive in that forum.</p>

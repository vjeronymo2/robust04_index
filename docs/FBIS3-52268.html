			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Executive Committee member </F> Sulayman al-Najjab by correspondent Sa'id Mu'addi, carried  within the "With the Events" program; place and date not  given--recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Mr. Sulayman al-Najjab, [PLO] Executive  Committee member, good evening.    [Al-Najjab] Good evening.    [Mu'addi] Mr. Sulayman al-Najjab, the PLO leadership is  holding intensive consultations and contacts in light of  political developments. What is the PLO's position on these  developments?    [Al-Najjab] If you mean the negotiations held with the  Israeli side within the framework of the joint Liaison  Committee, we are actually interested in reaching a solution to  the issues this committee discussed in Oslo, at Versailles, and  in Cairo recently. Regrettably, however, and as you know, the  Cairo talks ended in nothing. To say that an agreement was  reached is totally untrue. What really happened is that the  Israeli side presented its viewpoint on the three issues;  namely, the control of the crossing points, the Jericho area,  and the settlements in Gaza and the security area required for  them.    We replied to this Israeli position by submitting clear  proposals to which we have committed ourselves since the  Versailles meeting. Regrettably, we noted that in Cairo the  Israeli position retreated from the approach on which we agreed  in Paris, France.    Still pending is the issue of full Palestinian control of  the  crossing points leading to Gaza and Jericho in harmony with our  control of these territories, from which the Israeli Army will  withdraw.    [Mu'addi] What are the amendments requested by the  Palestinian side concerning the agreement reached?    [Al-Najjab] No agreement was reached. As I told you, it was  only an Israeli viewpoint that we regarded as an incomplete  viewpoint. We still insist on controlling the crossing points  leading to Gaza and Jericho. The Israeli Army's control of  these territories, including the crossing points, will end when  it withdraws from them.    We also demanded that the Jericho area be expanded, so it  would include the Maqam al-Nabi Musa, which is a holy site for  Muslims, and the site of al-Maghtas [the place where Jesus  Christ was baptized in the River Jordan], which is, as you know,  a holy site for Christians. We also demanded access to the Dead  Sea coast and full control of the crossing point between the  bridge [on the River Jordan] and the Jericho area. We adhere to  this stand, and we believe that it is possible to reach  practical solutions that can balance the [Israeli] principle of  external security and the principle of no encroachment on the  Palestinian control of these territories.    [Mu'addi] Will this new situation return us to square one?    [Al-Najjab] The new situation is supposed to return us to  the path we began to follow at Versailles where viewpoints were  close and where it was agreed to balance the two principles as I  told you; namely, the control of the crossing points by the  Palestinian side, and safeguarding the principle that external  security will be in the hands of Israel. The crossing points  are directly linked to internal security. As is stipulated in  the agreement, this kind of security will be the responsibility  of the Palestinian side, whether in Gaza, Jericho, or elsewhere  in our occupied territories.    [Mu'addi] So, where are matters heading now? What are the  coming steps?    [Al-Najjab] We indeed regard the Israeli position as a  strange one. As I said, there is a clear retreat in this  position. There is also an attempt to impose conditions on us.  Of course, to resume negotiations based on the Israeli position  defined in Cairo will not happen. Rabin said: Let the  Palestinians sweat a little. We tell Rabin: We may sweat if we  are in Jericho where the weather is warm now, but in Tunis the  weather is cold and no one will sweat.    [Mu'addi] Sulayman al-Najjab, do you believe that the  obstacles can be removed in the next few days and that the  negotiations will resume in Taba?    [Al-Najjab] For our part, we are making every possible  effort to remove these obstacles in a way that will grant us  control of the crossing points to Gaza and Jericho. We are  really interested in advancing the negotiations, so the  Palestinian side will not be held responsible for wasting this  historic opportunity. It all depends on the conduct of the  Israeli side.    [Mu'addi] Mr. Sulayman al-Najjab, PLO Executive Committee  member, thank you very much.    [Al-Najjab] Thank you.</p>

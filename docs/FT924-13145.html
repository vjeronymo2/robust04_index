			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Lower interest helps Maunders advance 10% John Maunders, the property developer, lifted pre-tax profit by 10 per cent in the year to June 30, after reduced interest charges. Units sold increased 13 per cent to 783, but at an average selling price of Pounds 65,900 (Pounds 78,300) turnover fell to Pounds 51.6m (Pounds 54.4m). With interest charges cut to Pounds 1.83m (Pounds 2.59m) the pre-tax profit worked through at Pounds 4m (Pounds 3.63m). Mr John Maunders, the chairman, said the result was outstanding taking into account the atrocious trading conditions. The final dividend is held at 2.65p for a maintained total of 4.95p. Earnings per share were 10.92p (9.81p).</p>

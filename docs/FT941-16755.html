			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Japanese rates decline as pessimism deepens: Doubts grow over economic recovery prospects Japanese long-term interest rates fell to a new six-year low yesterday because of mounting pessimism over the economy and speculation of an imminent discount rate cut. The yield on the No 157 ten-year benchmark government bond fell to 2.97 per cent, breaching the 3 per cent level for the first time since June 1987. Delays in the government's announcement of an emergency economic package together with a big income tax cut have raised doubts over prospects for economic recovery soon. The inability of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, to take economic initiatives because of a parliamentary wrangle over political reform has fuelled expectations of a cut in the official discount rate, which is already at an historic low of 1.75 per cent. Long-term interest rates have fallen steadily over the past year as hopes over the government's promised economic recovery have faded because of falling consumption, an ailing financial system, and a sharp rise in the yen. The yield on the 10-year benchmark has declined by more than 150 basis points from the start of last year. Even if the government announces a package of fiscal support measures later this month, analysts do not expect interest rates to rise. 'People need some convincing signs of an economic upturn to take profits, and that won't come until the spring,' said Mr Robert Feldman, an economist at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo. Another reason for the bond market rally has been the poor performance of the Tokyo stock market. Additionally, investors wary of foreign currency risk have avoided placing funds in overseas markets and have opted for domestic government bonds. Although some investors are becoming cautious at current levels, many still expect yields to fall further, with the 10-year benchmark falling through the record low 2.55 per cent reached in April 1987. Meanwhile, a fall in construction orders highlighted intensifying economic gloom. The Japan Federation of Construction Contractors said orders in November fell 16.6 per cent from the year before.</p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ad hoc groups sidestep formalities MR JOHN MAJOR met senior colleagues yesterday for his first full discussion of the pit closures since his return from India and the Gulf. The small group most involved, however, is not in Downing Street's updated list of cabinet committees. It is counted as an ad hoc group rather than a committee. The same is true for the group under Lord Wakeham, leader of the Lords, which has been set up to look at unemployment and possible employment measures. The only new listed committees are EDX, the public expenditure committee, chaired by the chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, and the group on refugees from the former Yugoslavia, chaired by home secretary, Mr Kenneth Clarke. EDX comprises Mr Lamont, Mr Clarke, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary; Lord Wakeham; Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons; Mr William Waldegrave, public service minister; and Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary. The refugees group comprises Mr Clarke; Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary; Mr Newton; Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary; Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary; Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary; Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary; Mr John Patten, education secretary; Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary; Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary; Mr Portillo; Sir Nicholas Lyell, attorney general; Baroness Chalker, overseas development minister; and Mr Charles Wardle, a junior home office minister.</p>

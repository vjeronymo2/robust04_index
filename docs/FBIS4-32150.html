			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, June 19 (BTA) -- Dr. Petar Dertliev was  reelected president of the Bulgarian Social Democratic Party  (BSDP). Mr. Stefan Radoslavov was reelected chief secretary.  The congress elected a 101-member National Committee and a  14-member Inspection Committee. Changes were made in the  party's constitution. Until recently former members of other  parties were not allowed to hold key posts for at least 3 years  in locals and for at least five years in the National Committee.    The party's strategic goal is Bulgaria's transition to free  civil society based on parliamentary democracy, to local  self-government and social market economy, runs a resolution of  the congress on the strategic goals and future guidelines of the  BSDP. The party is for early parliamentary and local elections  to be organized by a caretaker government. The BSDP disapproves  of the attempts of the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] and SDS  [Union of Democratic Forces] to pass amendments to the  constitution to extend parliament's life to the very elections.    If the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) continues the  boycott  of parliament and obstructs its legislative work, there will be  no elections this year, Dr Dertliev told a news conference later  today.</p>

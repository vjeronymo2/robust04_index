			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Hills Finds Airbus Loan 'Disturbing': U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson  Hills, who is complaining about European subsidies to Airbus Industrie, finds a  loan that the jet maker made to Northwest Airlines "particularly disturbing," a  spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Hills believes that the $500-million loan was an unfair inducement to get  Northwest to buy 75 jets built by Airbus, a four-nation European consortium. In  a Sept. 14 letter to the European Community, Hills said she wants  "clarification and information" about the loan as soon as possible, said  spokeswoman Torie Clarke. Representatives of Airbus and the European Community  deny that the loan was unfair.  </P></p>

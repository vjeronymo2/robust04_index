			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Student, cab driver shot in separate Florida incidents An Egyptian student and a cab driver from England were shot yesterday in separate incidents in Florida, AP reports from Daytona Beach. Mr Ehab Souka, 24, the student, stopped at a railway crossing when he was approached by two men who attempted to get into his car. He saw a flash and felt a sharp pain to his left temple. Mr Souka was able to drive himself to hospital. The cab driver, Christopher Bartley, 28, was called to a Daytona Beach motel to pick up two men. He drove them to their destination where, neither having said anything, one shot him in the face, police said. He jumped out of his cab and ran away, then returned to the car and found the men had gone. Mr Bartley managed to drive back to base and call an ambulance. Both victims were in a stable condition in hospital last night.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 25 Jun -- The main result of the trip to the  United States by Viktor Chernomyrdin, head of the Russian  Government, was the achievement of fundamental accords on the  cancellation of the discriminatory Jackson-Vanik Amendment and  the reforming of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral  Export Controls by Russia's participation. This was said today  by Viktor Chernomyrdin at Vnukovo-2 airport on his return from  the United States.    In all, the work of the Gore-Chernomyrdin intergovernmental  commission resulted, the Russian prime minister said, in the  signing of 22 documents on technical cooperation, including in  the joint conquest of space. Russia signed space contracts  worth in all 200 million dollars. In addition, four agreements  were signed with the World Bank on the provision of credits  totalling 500 million dollars for road construction and  agricultural support.    In effect, Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed, it was a beginning  of a breakthrough toward the practical side of Russia's  cooperation with U.S. partners.    Viktor Chernomyrdin pointed at a close link between the  results of his visit to the United States and Russian President  Boris Yeltsin's visit to the island of Corfu, where Russia had  signed a document of cooperation with the European Community.  "From talking about cooperation we have now come really close  to specific actions," Viktor Chernomyrdin said. "During my  meeting with Clinton we managed to consolidate the results  achieved by the Gore- Chernomyrdin commission." In his view,  all the conditions are now in place for the upcoming G-7 meeting  in Naples, which is to be attended by President Boris Yeltsin,  to end in a transformation of the G-7 into a G-8.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Fear of China cap on power profits - Rumours of investment return limits Foreign companies and investors with an interest in China's capital-hungry power industry have been thrown by reports Beijing is planning an unacceptable limit to the profits they can earn from electric power. China will spend more than Dollars 120bn over the next decade if it is to realise its planned power expansion. Foreign companies and large investors are lining up. ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish power engineering group, plans to invest Dollars 500m over the next four years. Mr George Soros, the US investor and speculator, has set up funds totalling Dollars 3.5bn with both GE Capital and Peregrine Capital, the Hong Kong based brokerage and corporate financier, to tap such opportunities in Asia, especially China. ABB has built four power stations in China and operates there through 11 joint ventures. But earlier this week Mr Percy Barnevik, its chairman, said attempts to limit returns to foreigners would deter investment. For the past few weeks rumours have been circulating among project financiers that Beijing will limit to 12 per cent the return investors can earn on power projects on the mainland. It is not clear whether the rate of return referred to is on equity or capital employed. Mr Nick Hann, manager with Wardley Capital, says: 'If the project internal rate of return is 12 per cent (assuming it is funded with 100 per cent equity), then you have an option to increase your return to shareholders by gearing the project up. Our understanding is that the 12 per cent return is on the whole project, which gives the possibility of getting up to around a 16 per cent internal rate of return to the shareholder.' Some investors, however, see the rumoured change as no more than part of a rational redesign of the electric power industry. Executives at Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, say there may have been a misunderstanding and investors and their advisers have got the wrong end of the stick. This week Salomon Brothers is taking representatives of 40 of America's biggest fixed-income investors on an Asian tour, including China and its power industry. Mr Lindley G. DeGarmo, head of Salomon's global independent power group, says he has been told by Chinese officials that the 12 per cent figure refers to the return on assets which is deemed appropriate for already established power generation facilities in China. Earning a positive investment return is part of the government's attempt to reduce subsidies to industry which come from the under-pricing of electricity to consumers. To achieve this the authorities want to push ahead with tariff increases so that within three to four years these purely state-owned power plants will earn 12 per cent on assets employed. Mr DeGarmo says that for foreign joint venture power plants the Chinese government appears prepared to allow returns of 15 to 20 per cent on capital employed. Allowing for a large slice of debt financing this would push up the returns available to equity investors. He believes foreign-funded ventures will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Other advisers report a variety of financing methods which various regional governments and agencies have suggested to would-be investors to control profits. One example is offering guaranteed rates of return on foreign investment by indexing the price paid for the electricity. Alternatively, Chinese authorities can set an electricity price which will in effect cap the return at desired levels. At present there are just two examples of limited recourse to power project financing in China, both installed by Mr Gordon Wu's Hopewell Holdings and now operated by its spin-off, Consolidated Electric Power Asia. For the rest, foreign interests have generally played a minority role and the lending has been fully guaranteed, normally by Beijing. Mr Wu secured a two-pronged financing package for Shajiao C, located in Guangdong's Pearl River delta, in December 1992 which provided for an early completion bonus, and thereafter a standard operating rate, where any increase in the cost of raw materials, such as fuel, will be countered by a rise in the cost of electricity. For investors, says Mr Hann, the risks of projects such as these are largely to do with construction and, to a limited extent, the level of output. 'We have been approached on at least 60 large-scale power projects, all with substantial companies interested in them,' he says. 'Unfortunately, only a fraction of these will get foreign financing: there is a great deal of difficulty in putting in place a structure that is sufficiently robust to achieve foreign project financing, and that difficulty has been compounded by the foreign exchange changes introduced earlier this year.' On January 1, Beijing abolished the official exchange rate and announced plans to do away with the swap centres around the country and replace them with a centralised electronic network. For lenders looking for reliable revenues in foreign exchange, this switch changed the game in three significant ways: It prevents electricity prices being denominated in foreign exchange. Guarantees can only be provided in yuan, which makes them worth less than hard currency guarantees. People no longer have easy access to the swap markets to convert money following the restructuring of the foreign exchange markets. In the absence of a government or joint venture partner guarantee, investors must ensure firm off-take obligations by a creditworthy company and a firm fuel supply if they are to sleep easily at nights. But China is not yet a country where such obligations are easily won. Mr Hann believes the obstacles which have been put in the way of foreign investors this year will push projects into the hands of the sovereign backed credit agencies, which are less concerned about the convertibility risks of the yuan, such as the US Eximbank. In the meantime investors may look elsewhere. As Mr Wu points out, there is no shortage of opportunities for investors interested in power projects in the rest of Asia and Beijing officials may come round to the realisation that it is better to have the lights on, even if it means foreigners earning higher profits than officials would like.</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / U-turn on proposals for shorter teacher training The government yesterday withdrew controversial proposals to shorten the training period for infant-school teachers to one year. Under plans announced in June by Mr John Patten, education secretary, mature adults with A-levels and relevant experience could have qualified as teachers in England and Wales after only one year of training. The 'mum's army' plans have been withdrawn after sustained opposition from teachers' unions and parents' organisations. Ms Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said the decision to drop the plans was a further government U-turn on education. She said: 'It is a victory for all of us who have spent months campaigning against de-professionalisation of teaching.' But Mr Patten is to proceed with measures to reform teacher training, with a higher proportion of courses to be spent on practical training in schools. Trainee teachers will also have to spend more time learning how to teach English, mathematics and science. Mature recruits will be encouraged to enter teaching by taking a new one-year course to qualify as specialist teacher assistants. They will help qualified teachers with teaching basic skills in the classroom. Mr Patten said: 'The development of the new specialist teacher assistant certificate will ensure that mature people who are already making a valuable contribution as classroom assistants can extend their role and gain qualifications to build on if they decide to go forward to teacher training.' There was a welcome from the teachers' unions for the withdrawal of the 'mums' army' plan and for Mr Patten's willingness to listen to teachers' views. Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: 'We have no objection to exploring appropriate routes by which non-teaching staff could become teachers, providing there is no question of diluting academic and professional standards.' The announcement came as the Commons debated education and home affairs in the fourth day of debate on the Queen's speech. Opening yesterday's debate Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, underlined the government's commitment to combatting crime, and implementing measures on crime prevention, tougher sentences and judicial changes. He announced that trials of a US-style expandable side-handled police baton will go ahead as soon as possible. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, accused the government of concentrating too much on punitive measures in their intended legislation. 'The main criticism is that they only focus on one element of a successful strategy: the criminal justice system,' he said.</p>

The man under arrest is Raul Eduardo Reyes Torres, one of  Ecuador's most wanted criminals. The Ecuadoran authorities  accuse him of being part of the Reyes Magos cocaine clan, the  radio network reported.    Reyes was captured in June 1993 in the city of Cali in  possession of false documents that say he is a Colombian  citizen. According to the report, Reyes Torres is wanted by a  Denver federal court on drug-trafficking charges.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dan Damian: "Romanian Companies Trade With </F> Radioactive Material and Armaments From the Former Soviet Union"]    [Text] The changes that have taken place in the Romanian  society after 1989 have enabled the small and large  entrepreneurs that have emerged in the business world to amass  capital. The expansion of business links in the wake of the  opening of the borders of the former socialist camp has led to  the emergence of a new sale market, where the relationship  between the sellers and buyers is determined by the offer.    Aside from big deals, such as the import of infested sugar  and corn and of other foodstuffs from the Middle East, a special  place among the various products currently on offer is taken by  the trade with arms and radioactive materials.  <H5>  Armaments and Radioactive Materials Are Delivered From the </H5> States of the Russian Federation    The dismemberment of the former Soviet Union in 1990 has led  not only to the appearance of new political forces and of new  concepts about whether to remake "Great Russia" or not, but also  to the redivision of the huge military arsenal of the former  USSR.    Part of this arsenal -- the nuclear part, which is deployed  in such areas of the former USSR that were suitable, from a  geographic viewpoint, for pointing missiles at capitalist  targets -- are under the control of the Western powers and will  be dismantled by 1996. The other part of this arsenal, which is  active, can jeopardize life in Central Europe and throughout the  world at any moment, not only because of the political  instability prevailing in the area of the former USSR, but also  because of the maintenance of various armed conflicts, which can  generate true nuclear holocausts at any time.    In keeping with existing treaties on nonproliferation and  nuclear disarmament, one portion of the nuclear charges  resulting from the dismantlement of the nuclear weapons of the  former USSR is earmarked for peaceful purposes, while the other  part is meant to be securely destroyed, so as not to endanger  human life and the environment.    Since the quantity of radioactive material resulting from  the  destruction of nuclear weapons is very large, a good part of it  was sold for further use either to countries in the Middle East  or to other countries currently interested in producing or  acquiring nuclear weapons. Equally true is the fact that the  former USSR countries possess mineral resources containing very  many radioactive elements, such as radium, scandium, osmium,  plutonium, and other strategic elements used in the manufacture  of nuclear weapons.    The new trade in radioactive materials has attracted people  from both the former USSR states and from the former Warsaw Pact  countries, since the profits inherent in this trade are large  and immediate.    Among the Russian companies involved in the sale of  radioactive substances, we would mention just two: LUCH-3,  whose owner is Sergey Alekseyevich Pushkin, and LEGION,  represented by Russian citizen Klynchagov [name as received].  <H5>  Romanian Firms Are Involved in the Traffic of Radioactive </H5> Materials    In a short period of time, several people from Romania --  including Niculae Costel, representative of several Romanian  companies such as ROMBEL and SIRCOM, and Elisabeta Ana  Stefanescu, owner and sole associate of TECHNOTOURS company --  have managed to establish contacts with Russian companies from  the Russian Federation and with various firms in Romania.    Under the cover of ROMBEL company, Niculae Costel managed to  contact several people and representatives of certain foreign  companies, such as EURONOR BUSINESS PARTNER Ltd., with  headquarters in Norway, DB FINANZ CONSULTING AG from Germany, or  DHS MERGER-Alois Geissler, offering to deliver red mercury,  osmium 192, radium, and scandium in quantities varying between  15 and 200 kilograms, at a cost price of $73,000 per gram, which  would be tantamount to a profit of $1 billion.    Throughout the 1992-93 period, Niculae Costel made several  visits to Russia to decide on the ways and means of delivering  the goods as well as on the amounts of hard currency to be paid  into various banks.  <H5>  Codes Are Used for the Transactions of Radioactive Materials </H5>   The offers of the supplier of the respective commodity were  sent by fax, with the analysis certificate attached. The  analysis bulletins also specified the purity of the radioactive  material and the density of the other component substances.    In order to ensure the secrecy of the transaction, the two  sides used codes. The codes, containing various names such as  "Sunshine," "Apple," "Stardust," or "Nautilus," were used to  codify both the transaction and the product. For instance, the  code "Nautilus" was used to denote osmium 187, while the code  "red oil" was used for the red mercury-RM 20/20.    The letters of intent received from the party interested in  buying the product always mentioned that the transaction can  only take place after a sample of the respective material was  submitted to chemical analyses that would attest to the purity  and quality of the product. Only analysis certificates in  accordance with the "Karpov" and "Frieberger" methods are valid  for such radioactive substances.   <H5>    The Transport of Red Mercury Samples Is Done With TAROM </H5> Airplanes    Although red mercury is a nonactive substance, its  characteristics can turn it into a very strong explosive when it  merges with other chemical substances. As a matter of fact, red  mercury RM 20/20 is used in the manufacture of the neutron bomb.    Using not only her imagination, but also her relations, the  owner of TECNOTOURS company, Elisabeta Ana Stefanescu used the  Bucharest-Rome TAROM flight of 5 July 1992 -- which landed in  Rome at 1415 hours local time -- to transport a sample of red  mercury.    The red mercury sample was handed over to the airplane  captain by Rosca Stanescu, deputy commander of Otopeni Airport.  In Italy, the "small package" was handed over by the airplane  captain to Florin Groman, head of the TAROM office in Rome. The  package was then passed on to another man within the Rome  Airport by Florin Groman himself, who was ostentatiously  carrying a sign with the name of the individual supposed to take  over the package, namely the Italian citizen Egidio Musso.    Once the transaction was completed, Elisabeta Ana Stefanescu  told her Italian business partner, Egidio Musso, to open a  dollar account for her at the Italian bank Credito Italiano,  with herself as the only one entitled to withdraw money from  that account.    Using the "Rosso" code for the red mercury, Elisabeta  Stefanescu informed the Italian company OMNIA TECNO SRL, with  headquarters in the town of La Spezia, that the "Rosso" sample  was brought to Romania by an agent of an embassy empowered to  deal with this affair. In the same message, Elisabeta Stefanescu  -- who until 1989 had occupied various administrative posts at  several foreign diplomatic missions in Romania -- expressed the  fear that she had attracted "too much attention" at home.    For the same material, RM 20/20, Elisabeta Stefanescu used  the code "992/LDEASGC/101-M" in a transaction involving 138 kg  of red mercury for the MUELLER TREUHAND company of Zurich,  Switzerland, asking for $340,000 per kilogram. She also made  clear that the deal was concluded in Moscow with Russian  partners, with the red mercury procured from the Russian town of  Chelyabinsk.    In the July-December 1992 period, Elisabeta Stefanescu spent  a "long vacation" in Italy, more precisely in Lerici town,  staying at the most luxurious hotel in the region. On that  occasion, she got in touch with the business connections in  Italy and also established new contacts with people interested  in purchasing radioactive material.    At the end of a prosperous business trip abroad, she  returned  home with two boxes full of jewelry, two fur coats, two Mercedes  220D, a Nissan Patrol cross-country vehicle, and "small gifts"  for her connections in Romania. In May 1992, Elisabeta  Stefanescu moved out of her parents' home in Londra Street No.  25 into a villa (number 45) in Snagov, which she is renting for  500,000 lei per month.  <H5>  From the Trade in Red Mercury to the Trade in Military </H5> Technology    TECNOTOURS' business turnover, which in 1992 stood at 2  billion lei, exceeded 23 billion lei in 1993, but registered  zero profits??! All this was achieved with only three employees  and a sole "single associate," Elisabeta Ana Stefanescu. All  was made possible by expanding the company's sphere of activity  to include the trade in military technology.    By establishing several contacts with the Russian citizen  Anatoliy Ivanov, general director of the BIISIK [name as  received] Ltd. company, and with Eduard Hiznicenco, director of  the COMINET SRL company from Odorheiul Secuiesc, Elisabeta  Stefanescu began offering the Middle East "market" a whole range  of products from the Russian armaments industry: from AKM and  AK-47 machine guns -- each costing $170, with some 3 million  pieces on offer -- up to MI-26 and MI-35 helicopters, T-72 and  T-80 tanks, and MiG-29 planes, with the prices varying between  $19 million and $55 million.  <H5>  The Use of Coded Messages and Other Codes in Arms </H5> Transactions    Another private entrepreneur involved in the transactions  with radioactive materials and armaments, Niculae Costel,  representative of SIRCOM company, contacted the ROMTEHNICA  company.    In a letter marked "confidential" and "ultra confidential,"  Niculae Costel informed Rear Admiral C. Raducanu, deputy chief  of the Army Supply and Equipment Service, of an impending  transaction, namely the confidential project "Yacht," whose  destination was the Great Lakes region in Canada. The customer  was demanding that the name of the vessel should be kept secret  and that the Romanian crew should train the foreign crew during  the voyage. In exchange, the customer was offering, in codified  terms, "stinger, hot, and patrol" plus "some money." Meanwhile  we have managed to identify the meaning of "stinger" and "hot,"  which stand for antitank missiles.</p>

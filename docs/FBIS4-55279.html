			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(jap)": "CBOS; Europe, Europe"] </F>   [Text] Almost every second Pole would like to wake up  tomorrow in a united Europe--so suggests research conducted by  the Public Opinion Research Center [CBOS].    In March 1994, integration with the European Union [EU] was  backed by 70 percent (three years ago it was 80 percent). Jacek  Syryusz-Wolski, a government expert on integration, says  comfortingly that we are more pro-European than the  Danish--members of the Union. Experts warn, however, that the  EU's rating will drop unless the Common Market opens up to  commodities from Poland.    Of the respondents, 40 percent believe that we should join  the Union of Twelve right now. Every fourth respondent would  prefer to wait five years.    At the same time, Poles seem to be forgetting about the EU:  Right now, 80 percent know what it is, whereas a year ago 86  percent knew. Only 17 percent of respondents knew about the  Maastricht Treaty, which established the Union. More than half  of all respondents were not able to answer this question.    Advocates of Poland's integration into the EU are private  entrepreneurs, managers, and school and university students.  Indifferent to the EU or negatively disposed to it are peasants,  inhabitants of rural areas, elderly people, and people with  elementary education.    The research was conducted in late March on a representative  sample of 1,230 adult inhabitants of Poland.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Jan 27 (AFP)--Russia's domestic political  upheavals will not affect the priority it attaches to ties with  China, visiting Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said here  Thursday.    Kozyrev, who arrived Wednesday for a three-day visit, told  his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen that the strengthening of  bilateral relations would remain a "top priority" and that he  hoped Chinese President Jiang Zemin could visit Moscow for a  summit later this year.    The two foreign ministers met for more than two hours of  "sincere and cordial" talks on bilateral and international  issues, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said, adding that  one hour of the talks was held in private.    No details were given of their closed-door session.    Relations between the two neighbours would not suffer as the  result of "political changes in Russia's domestic situation,"  Kozyrev was quoted as saying.    According to the spokesman, Qian said high-level contacts  over the past year, including the visit here by President Boris  Yeltsin in December, had lent "great impetus" to the development  of Sino-Russian relations, particularly economic and trade links.    Bilateral trade last year soared 30 percent from 1992 to 7.7  billion dollars, with border exchanges alone accounting for 2.5  billion dollars.    Following their talks, Kozyrev and Qian signed an agreement  for regular consultations on the establishment of "transit  ports" along their 4,500-kilometre (2,800-mile) common border.  About 20 such ports are currently in operation.    The spokesman did not say if the two foreign ministers had  discussed the possibilty of visa restrictions to stem the flood  of people crossing the border daily.    Some 2.5 million people crossed the border in 1993 and  Kozyrev admitted before leaving Moscow that the number of  Chinese in Russia had become "a very serious problem."    Kozyrev was quoted as telling Qian that Moscow's military  policy was strictly "defensive" and he reiterated Russia's  commitment to a bilateral agreement pledging non-use of nuclear  weapons against each other.    After the Sino-Soviet rift that developed at the beginning  of  the 1960s, the two communist giants officially reconciled in  1989 during a visit to China by Mikhail Gorbachev. Since  Yeltsin became president of Russia in 1991 following the  collapse of the Soviet Union, Moscow and Beijing have enjoyed  close military cooperation.    While the two foreign ministers discussed cooperation in  various areas, the spokesman said they had not specifically  touched on military issues.    Kozryev also voiced hopes that Russia would be able to  participate in several large-scale construction projects in  China, including the massive Three Gorges hydroelectric dam  being built on the Yangtze River.    Qian said he would welcome Russian cooperation, the  spokesman  said.    Kozyrev is due to hold talks with Jiang on Friday before  leaving for a tour of the southern Chinese special economic zone  of Shenzhen.</p>

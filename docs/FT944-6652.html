			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Minister renounces his earldom The government's chances of securing victory in the vote on the European Communities finance bill were boosted yesterday after a minister renounced an earldom which he had recently inherited. Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, a junior Scottish Office minister and MP for Edinburgh West, announced that he would not adopt the title Earl of Selkirk following the death of the 10th earl, his uncle, five days ago. Lord James could have been barred immediately from the Commons chamber and unable to vote in last night's crucial division. Lord James's present title is a courtesy title and he can therefore sit as an MP. He said yesterday that he would renounce the earldom under the provisions of the Peerage Act 1963. He had already submitted documents of disclaimer. He said he had been unhappy to take the decision so soon, but added: 'I owe it as a duty to my constituents whom I wish to continue to serve, and as a matter of loyalty to the prime minister and to the Conservative party, to support John Major in the voting lobby tonight.' He had discussed the matter with Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, before making up his mind. Mr Lang said last night: 'Lord James's decision is greatly to his credit. It reflects his strong commitment to the welfare of his constituents.' The Peerage Act was used by Mr Tony Benn, the Labour MP, to renounce the title Viscount Stansgate in 1963. Mr Quintin Hogg, the former Lord Chancellor, now Lord Hailsham; and Sir Alec Douglas-Home, the former prime minister, now Baron Home of the Hirsel, also renounced peerages in order to sit in the Commons. Several MPs pointed out yesterday that Lord James's decision was particularly significant because he had a majority of just 879 in Edinburgh West at the last general election.</p>

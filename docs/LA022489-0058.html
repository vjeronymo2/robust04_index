			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> CITY COACHES TAKE PARTING SHOTS AT RELEAGUING  </P> <P> Howard Levine of Grant and Steve Miller of North Hollywood were outspoken  critics of the City Section's releaguing plan when it was announced last  summer.  </P> <P> Both basketball coaches objected because traditional East Valley League rivals  Grant and North Hollywood were realigned in different leagues.  </P> <P> In previous years, Grant and North Hollywood met twice, setting up a  playoff-like atmosphere during the regular season, according to Levine.  </P> <P> But this year, the Lancers and Huskies met only once -- in a Valley Pac-8  Conference opener won by North Hollywood -- and both coaches said that fact  could have contributed to their first-round losses in the City Section 3-A  playoffs last Friday.  </P> <P> "It's all conjecture now," Levine said. "But I wonder if it would have made a  difference if we had played them twice. After all, neither one of our teams  were challenged during the league season. And that puts you at a disadvantage  when the playoffs start. You need to experience those tight games."  </P> <P> Miller, whose Huskies (15-5) had won 11 consecutive games before losing to  Jefferson, 73-69, in the first round, agreed.  </P> <P> "Those were big, playoff-intensity-type games," he said of the meetings with  Grant. "And we only played in one of them this year. We really didn't get  challenged after that."  </P> <P> Grant (17-4) was 6-0 in East Valley League play and had an average victory  margin of more than 21 points a game; North Hollywood's margin of victory was  almost 24 points during a 6-0 Mid-Valley League campaign.  </P> <P> Record check: Although he has coached at three high schools in the past five  years, Reseda's Jeff Halpern has compiled a varsity coaching record of 52-17.  </P> <P> Halpern coached Van Nuys to a 21-3 mark and the City Section 3-A semifinals in  1984-85, guided Birmingham to a 22-3 record and the City 3-A final in 1986-87  and his Reseda squad was 9-11 this season, losing to Wilson, 56-54, in the  first round of the City 3-A playoffs last Friday.  </P> <P> David vs. Goliath, almost: Poly figured to be headed into a buzz saw when the  Parrots traveled to Los Angeles High for last Friday's first-round playoff  game.  </P> <P> After all, Los Angeles had a front line that included 6-foot-9 Adam Henderson,  6-6 Khari Jaxon and 6-5 Richard Champion, while Poly's tallest starter was 6-2  Juan Estrada.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the Parrots gave Los Angeles a scare before falling, 85-75.  </P> <P> "We knew we had to shoot well to have any chance at all," Poly assistant Tim  Bruen said. "And that's what we did. . . . There was no way we were going to go  inside on them."  </P> <P> Poly -- ignited by forwards John Bruner and Scott Cooper -- hit 26 of 42 shots  from the field, including nine of 12 three-point shots.  </P> <P> Bruner finished with a game-high 28 points and Cooper had 27.  </P> <P> Burnham update: Angela Burnham of Rio Mesa, the defending state champion in the  100 and 200 meters, returned Tuesday from a recruiting trip to Nevada Las  Vegas.  </P> <P> Burnham, Track and Field News' female high school athlete of the year in 1988,  visited Tennessee in November, Texas in January and USC, UCLA and UNLV this  month.  </P> <P> Spring fever: The Notre Dame baseball team will stage a 100-inning fund-raiser  Saturday at the Sherman Oaks campus. The varsity will play the junior varsity  beginning at 9 a.m. A barbecue is scheduled for 1 p.m.  </P></p>

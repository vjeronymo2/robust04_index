			<p>BFN     [Text] The Group of 15 developing countries, or G-15, will  take a common position to ensure that interests of South  countries are protected and informed at the GATT ministerial  meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco next month. This is agreed upon  by leaders attending the fourth G-15 summit in New Delhi, India.  Briefing Malaysian journalists, Foreign Affairs Minister Datuk  Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said the leaders agreed that ministers  representing the group at Marrakesh should meet before the  meeting to coordinate their positions.    He said the subject on the need to impose a global minimum  wage raised by Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir will be  viewed with concern. Efforts should be made to ensure such a  move is not approved or endorsed. If a global minimum wage is  imposed, it will have serious negative consequences in the  industries and economies of the South countries.</p>

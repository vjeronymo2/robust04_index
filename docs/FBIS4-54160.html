			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>   [Text] Japan and the United States have formally decided  to resume the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks that  have been a focal point in Japan-U.S. relations. The resumption  of the framework talks has created a situation that gives a "ray  of hope" for the future of Prime Minister Hata, who is facing  difficulty in handling the political situation with his minority  government, (according to a close aide to the prime minister).  The prime minister intends to use the resumption of the  framework talks as a good opportunity to keep "his besieged  minority government" floating by breaking a deadlock over  Japan-U.S. economic relations prior to the summit (Naples  Summit) of major industrialized nations scheduled for July.  With the issue of continuing tax cuts still remaining unsettled  between Japan and the United States, the prime minister aims to  "normalize" Japan-U.S. relations by cutting the income tax prior  to raising the consumption tax rate and then use the normalized  Japan-U.S. relations as a lever to retake the leadership in  handling the political situation.    Nevertheless, it would be difficult for the prime minister  to  use those steps as a means to neutralize the opposition Liberal  Democratic Party's [LDP] strategy to vote the Hata government  out of power. The prime minister is likely to be plagued by  "double tortures," which means his struggle to keep his minority  government in place and to deal with a no-confidence vote  against his government.    The prime minister watched with strained attention progress  in Japan-U.S. vice ministerial talks on reopening the stalled  Japan-U.S. framework talks that began in Washington on 19 May.  On the morning of 23 May, the prime minister called bureau  chiefs in charge of the framework talks in the Finance Ministry,  the Foreign Ministry, and the International Trade and Industry  Ministry into the prime minister's official residence to  instruct them to do everything they could to get the stalled  framework talks resumed. The prime minister appears to have been  considerably wary of sluggish progress in informal consultations  between the two countries on resuming the stalled talks. Asked  by reporters to comment on progress in the informal  consultations, the prime minister has always reacted cautiously  to the request, saying: "I do not like to comment on it because  the informal consultations are now in a delicate stage."    For the prime minister, whether the stalled Japan-U.S.  framework talks are resumed or not is a crucial issue that  "determines the fate of his government." As a minority  government, the Hata government is being forced to handle the  difficult political situation with the prospect that a  no-confidence motion against it will be introduced to the Diet  after the 1994 budget bill is passed in the Diet. At this time,  if the Hata government fails to have the stalled framework talks  resumed, it would further worsen Japan-U.S. relations, the  improvement of which is the most important matter on the Hata  government's domestic agenda.    If Japan-U.S. relations worsen, the Hata government would be  placed in a very difficult position in dealing with the issue of  North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons and it  would be in a "state of complete impasse" in handling its  domestic and foreign policies. The prime minister is literally  "surrounded by foes on all fronts." Officials close to the  prime minister are increasingly apprehensive about the Hata  government, saying: "A situation may be created where the Hata  government runs for its life."    There is a possibility that the latest decision by Japan and  the United States to reopen the stalled talks has made it  possible for the Hata government to avert that worst scenario  and given the government a momentum to strengthen its cohesive  force (says a senior ruling party member). Many officials in  the prime minister's official residence believe that "the  resumption of the stalled framework talks has opened bright  prospects for the Hata government, whose future has been  uncertain."    Nevertheless, no prospects are seen for resolving the "issue  of taking measures to open the Japanese market and cutting  taxes", which are seen as one of the hurdles to normalizing  Japan-U.S. relations. Meanwhile, the LDP is reacting coolly to  the resumption of the framework talks, saying: "The Hata  government has only narrowly averted the worst situation that  could trigger a trade war between Japan and the United States."  The LDP is poised to submit a no-confidence motion against the  Hata government to the Diet after the 1994 budget bill is  passed, arguing that "the Hata government does not deserve to be  given any high marks for resuming the stalled framework talks."    Commenting on the prospect of resuming the stalled framework  talks on the morning of 24 May, a government source close to the  prime minister said: "Mr. Hosokawa resigned as prime minister  that way. It might be better that he resigned that way because  government officials at the time felt a sense of crisis over the  future of the Japan-U.S. framework talks."</p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> LATIN TO BE TAUGHT AT MIDDLE SCHOOL LEVEL  </P> <P> To give high school Latin students a head start, the Orange Unified School  District this week unanimously approved teaching the language at the middle  school level.  </P> <P> For the last year, Latin has been taught before regular classes begin at El  Rancho Middle School.  </P> <P> The program will now be expanded for students at all five of the district's  middle schools.  </P> <P> High school officials wanted first-year Latin taught to students earlier so  they could be eligible to take advanced placement courses for college credit by  their senior year, said Tom Schrodi, director of instructional services for the  district. French and Spanish are already offered at the middle-school level.  </P> <P> Latin courses are popular with students and parents, Canyon Principal Jack Fox  said, largely because of their application to modern languages like French and  Spanish. Latin also "teaches good discipline," he said.  </P> <P> "The parents really went for it," Fox said. "I think also, for kids who are  taking SATs, the Latin really helps."  </P> <P> After pre-registration for the middle school courses, the district will  evaluate whether or not additional teachers are needed.

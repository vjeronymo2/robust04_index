			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Canadian company to print banknotes for Tajikistan THE former Soviet republic of Tajikistan is enlisting Canadian help to print its currency, under a pact with the Ottawa-based Canadian Bank Note Company (CBNC) to build a banknote printing plant. CBNC, which will build the plant in a joint venture with the central Asian state, hopes that it will be working within a year, and that it will eventually export banknotes to other former Soviet republics, the Middle East and Asia. The deal highlights fierce competition among western banknote manufacturers for opportunities in those former Soviet states leaving the rouble zone. In the most important order to date, CBNC, which prints banknotes for Canada and Caribbean, Middle East and South American countries, has agreed to print 1.5bn notes of the new Ukrainian currency, the hryvnia. This CDollars 36m (Pounds 15.2m) order was backed by a CDollars 50m Canadian government credit line. Among the Baltic states, Estonia has introduced its own currency, the kroon, printed by the UK-based De La Rue, the world's biggest security printer, and US Banknote, the biggest US security printer. Giesecke &amp; Devrient, the Munich company which prints 50 per cent of the Bundesbank's D-Marks, has won an order for Latvia's new currency, as has US Banknote for Lithuania. Mr Michel Aime, managing director of the Paris-based Oberthur banknote printing group, confirmed they were seeking orders from former east bloc states. 'The biggest problem is the financing.' Among executives of De La Rue Giori, the 50 per cent-owned Swiss-based subsidiary of De La Rue, assigned to market its capabilities with the National Bank of Ukraine last year was Mr Maxime Mitterrand, nephew of France's President Francois Mitterrand. Mr Mitterrand is no longer employed by De La Rue Giori.</p>

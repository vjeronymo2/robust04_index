			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN: ANYTHING GOES  </P> <P> Apparently the dress code for cocktail parties is in no danger of getting  stale. Not when Ali MacGraw can wear blue jeans to the same party where Valeria  Golino wears gray satin. They weren't the only ones testing the fashion limits  Wednesday when Matthew Rolston, just named photographer of the year, invited  them to celebrate. Amanda Pays' ivory-colored outfit could have passed for  elegant pajamas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ring-a-Ding-Ding  </P> <P> Michael Dawkins, owner of the M Gallery on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood,  tells us singer Janet Jackson dropped by to look for jewelry the other day. Her  outfit was notable: "ripped jeans, a cropped T-shirt, dark glasses and a  cellular phone," Dawkins says. Jackson actually found time to select a  Dawkins-designed silver bangle and earrings, despite spending about 30 minutes  on her phone, which, according to Dawkins, "would not stop ringing."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Scouting Out the New Looks  </P> <P> Be prepared for the Boy Scouts of America's new uniforms to hit the streets  this fall. It's all part of a continued effort to make scouting appear more  attractive to boys who might think it's a tad too "geeky" for their tastes.  Styled-up outfits will supplement, but not replace, the standard dress uniforms  the boys now wear, says Don Rogers, who works in the organization's council  services division at its Irving, Tex., headquarters. The new look -- a  short-sleeved tan cotton dress shirt and matching shorts -- is for casual  occasions and active sports. There's now a short-sleeve red dress shirt as  well. As for changing the nerdy image, Lee Sneath, national spokesperson for  the Boy Scouts of America, said the organization is gearing up to change it.  "There will always be a faction of people who think scouting isn't cool. We  want to present the fun side."  </P> <P> </P> <P> I Don't Wanna Grow Up  </P> <P> We know at least one grown-up who still likes to shop with his mother. It's  twentysomething talk-show host Byron Allen, who took mother and executive  producer, Carolyn Folks, along when he selected cool threads for his new  Saturday night show on ABC. Sherman Oaks retailer Rick Pallack tells us Folks'  input was "more like a friend's," and viewers have already seen some of the  clothes. For Allen's first show, which included guests Whoopi Goldberg and  Patti LaBelle, the music-minded comedian wore an oversized teal linen shirt,  black-white-and-teal glen plaid jacket and black pleated, baggy trousers. Stay  tuned, because Pallack says Allen, unlike others in his line of work, is not  going to stick with just one look.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Think Pink  </P> <P> Zandra Rhodes has changed her hair -- from Day-Glo pink to aubergine. The  richer -- dare we say more passionate -- red color seems to complement her  Queen of Hearts dresses, including one she created in pink silk chiffon, tulle  and ribbons for the Duchess of York. The hearts on the fabric she used for the  duchess were most discreet, Rhodes explained at Neiman Marcus, where she  presented her new styles. "They have to be," she said. "If you do something  with hearts, it has to make a woman feel wonderful and not as if she's in fancy  dress for Valentine's Day."  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Height of Fashion  </P> <P> When actor Chris Lemmon flies, he travels in style -- aviator style, that is.  On a recent Alaska Airlines run from Burbank to Portland, the star of the new  Fox-TV sitcom "Open House" sprawled out in first class, National Lampoon  magazine in hand, wearing kick-back jeans and T-shirt. Then, during a stopover  in Oakland, Lemmon pulled on his jacket: a '40s-look, distressed-leather  bomber. Now that's dressing for the occasion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Model Citizens  </P> <P> Add Alexander Julian's name to the list of fashion designers and retailers  using "real" people (not models) in their ads. His national menswear promotion  this fall features five Boston businessmen whose jobs range from bond salesman  to software honcho to magazine marketing specialist. The men did not have to  wear makeup or assume outrageous poses, but they did get free haircuts.  Professional model shots, Julian said, "paled in comparison."  </P></p>

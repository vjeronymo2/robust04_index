			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The transportation minister is opposing the  opening up of the Orly [Paris airport]-London route to the  British airline TAT from next Monday [16 May]. Bernard Bosson  has said he does not believe it is in keeping with the  regulations in force and expressed the strongest possible  reservations concerning the consequences that attempts to  operate flights outside the law could have. Yet the European  Commission recently gave its agreement, and the company TAT was  even preparing to open up this route. Michel Polacco:    [Polacco] [passage omitted] The European Commission's  decision of 27 April makes it obligatory for Orly to be opened  up to competition, and TAT -- which has become a subsidiary of  British Airways -- pleased with this decision, has decided, like  British Airways and Air UK, to enter this market niche.  [passage omitted] The French Government has lodged a complaint  with the European Court of Justice, and in the meantime has  banned the first three flights scheduled to leave Orly from  Monday for three reasons: Orly is overloaded, and to add to this  burden would cause environmental problems; Heathrow, which is  the Orly of London, is not offering any slots to new companies  -- Air France, for example, who would be interested; third, the  time limit set by the Commission does not make it possible for  the carriers to prepare these flights properly. The plans of  the three airlines have thus not been approved. The flights are  not authorized for the time being. [passage omitted]</p>

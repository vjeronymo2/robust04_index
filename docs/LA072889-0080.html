			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> David Mamet's "Speed-the-Plow" will have its Southern California premiere next  season at South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa, running June 8 to July 15 on the  Mainstage. The three-character play originated at New York's Lincoln Center and  ran on Broadway last year with Joe Mantegna and Ron Silver as a couple of  sleazy movie producers and Madonna in her stage debut as an office temp. "Since  it's set in Hollywood, I'm a little surprised that we're the first theater on  the West Coast to get the play," South Coast artistic director Martin Benson  said Thursday. "If I were running a theater in Los Angeles, I would have been  all over it. It's delicious, delightful and bitchy -- everything that makes  good, trenchant theater." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 31/5/1994 -- Romanian President  Ion Iliescu offered an official dinner on Monday, 30 May,  evening in honor of Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma, who  is paying a state visit to Romania.    In his toast, the Romanian president said that the talks he  had the pleasure to have with the Indian head of state had  permitted an examination of the basic aspects of the bilateral  relations and especially the recognition of the main directions  and ways of developing and deepening the Romanian-Indian  collaboration in all fields of mutual interest.    President Iliescu expressed his confidence that the  concluded  agreements, synthetically expressed by the Declaration on  Principles and Directions of Cooperation and by other documents  that were going to be signed, would open a new chapter of the  bilateral relations.    The Romanian president said that Romania was attaching a  particular importance to the achievement of substantial  progresses in the field of the commercial exchanges and economic  cooperation.    The Romanian Government expresses its readiness to establish  the inter-governmental juridical frame able to encourage actions  of mutual interest between Romanian and Indian companies, said  President Iliescu.    The Romanian president expressed his hope that the meetings  between the businessmen who were accompanying the Indian  president and Romanian businessmen would lead to results  encouraging for both parties.    The exchange of views which we had, said President Iliescu,  evinced the common preoccupations of the governments of Romania  and India to promote understanding, collaboration, and peace in  the world, and the common attachment to the universal values of  the democracy.    In the field of external relations, Romania is engaged in  the  process of integration within the economic, political, and  strategic European structures, and it develops cooperation  relations with the countries with democratic traditions and with  all its neighbors, said President Iliescu.    At the same time, within the strategy of its foreign policy,  Romania grants special importance to the development of the  traditional relations with the countries in the Asian-Pacific  zone, one of the regions with the highest economic growth and  healthy prospects for continued development in the coming  decades, India holding a front-line place in that respect, said  President Iliescu.    In his toast, Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma said  that  in the latest years there have been active contacts at various  levels between Romania and India.    While the mutual visits by parliamentary delegations  revealed  the mutually shared political beliefs, the agreements signed in  the fields of trade, science, and technology are an expression  of the common decision to substantiate the bilateral relations,  said the Indian president.    The economic restructuring taking place in India and the  reform program launched in Romania create considerable  possibilities for cooperation to mutual benefit, said the Indian  head of state.    The prominent businessmen -- members of the Indian  delegation  accompanying the Indian president -- are expressing India's  decision to diversify, increase, and stimulate economic  cooperation with Romania, said the Indian president.    President Shankar Dayal Sharma expressed confidence that  Romanian-Indian relations would gain substance and diversify.  The Indian Government wishes to cooperate with the Romanian  Government in order to carry out some common objectives, said  the president.    The last decade of the century is offering chances, but also  responsibilities. The magnitude of the problems confronting  mankind shows that there is no country that can afford to live  in isolation. Peace and prosperity are really indivisible in  this world, in which we all live. India, as well as Romania  have committed themselves in promoting the cause of peace and in  building a fair, safe, and prosperous international order. I am  convinced that our concerted actions will bring a significant  contribution to this cause, to the mutual benefit of our  countries, to the benefit of the entire humanity, said the  Indian president.</p>

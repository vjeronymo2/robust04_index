			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The pro-government sector of the Colorado Party  will reportedly oppose the coming of a U.S. military mission to  carry out civil construction in San Pedro Department. [passage  omitted]    [Begin Francisco de Vargas, president of the Chamber of  Deputies, member of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party  recording] I believe that President Juan Carlos Wasmosy  initially agreed with the coming of the mission, but after  pressure from military leaders who demanded Paraguayan  participation, which was not granted, this project was  obstructed. This is the information I have. I hope the permit  will be granted to allow them to come. I do not see any  unsuitability. It is said that the mission's hidden objective  would have been the struggle against drug trafficking. If this  is the case, I welcome it. [end recording]</p>

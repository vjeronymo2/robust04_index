Nearly 2,000 members of the CPPCC National Committee  listened  to a report on proposals handling, and six members spoke at the  meeting.    Today's executive chairmen were Hong Xuezhi, Dong Yinchu and  Ma Man-kei. Some senior officials of the Communist Party of  China (CPC) and State Council attended the meeting.    Zhou Shaozheng, director of the subcommittee for handling  proposals, reported its proposals handling work since the first  session last spring.    He said that CPPCC members, democratic parties and people's  organizations have raised 1,981 proposals since the first  session and 99 percent of them have been handled.    Through raising proposals, CPPCC members, democratic parties  and people's organizations have performed the function of  political consultation and democratic supervision and played an  active role in the implementation of the principles of the 14th  CPC National Congress, promoting economic and social  development, consolidating the political situation of unity and  stability.    Wan Guoquan, vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the  China Democratic National Construction Association, proposed  that deepening reform of state-owned enterprises should start  from clarifying who represents state assets, restructuring the  management of state assets and defining the ownership of state  enterprises' property rights.    Fang Jiade, vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of  Trade Unions, proposed relying on the working class  whole-heartedly in the establishment of a modern enterprise  system.    "The board of directors, the supervisory board and the  assembly of share-holders should consist of a certain number of  representatives of workers," he said.    Guo Guoqing, a professor of the People's University of China  and two other members, raised proposals on bringing into full  play the role of special supervisors, inspectors, auditors and  educational inspectors and other discipline enforcement workers.    Li Hongchang, vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of  Industry and Commerce, suggested that a law governing chambers  of commerce be enacted.    Gu Shengzu and Wang Chuanlun spoke on the need to guide the  massive movement of rural labor and the ongoing anti-corruption  drive.    Ye Xuanping and 11 other vice-chairmen of the CPPCC National  Committee were present at today's meeting.</p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHENEY TO CUT TOP BRASS ON STAFF  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered Monday that the number of generals and  admirals assigned to his staff be cut in half.  </P> <P> Cheney directed that 13 of the 27 spots on his personal staff that are saved  for Army, Air Force, Marine generals and Navy admirals be eliminated, filled  with civilians, or given to lower ranking military officers, a Pentagon  statement said.  </P> <P> The effect isn't necessarily immediate, since the changes will be made when the  officers in the present positions finish their tours of duty or move on to  their next assignments, the statement said.  </P> <P> The change is in line with the Defense Department's moves to pare the nation's  armed forces in response to "world changes and tighter budgets," the statement  said. The affected job positions include the adviser for NATO affairs, the  deputy assistant secretary of defense for legislative affairs, the assistant  inspector general, and the assistant to the assistant to the secretary of  defense for atomic energy.  </P></p>

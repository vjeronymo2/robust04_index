No contamination of the plant's  territory, irradiation of the personnel, or discharges into the  environment took place. There is no danger either for the  population or for people working at the plant.    It has been tentatively found that radioactive water entered  the compressed-air pipeline from the fourth power unit due to  the lack of tightness in one of the locking valves in the  compressed-air line, which is used for processing the  ion-exchange resins in filters of the special water-purification  installation.    Work on decontaminating the compressed-air pipeline has  already been completed. Therefore, the incident was local in  character and had no effect upon the plant's operation.    A commission is investigating the causes of the accident.</p>

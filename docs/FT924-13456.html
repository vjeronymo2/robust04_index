			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Wool prices in terms of Australian cents have been edging slightly lower at sales this week. The change in the Wool Corporation's market indicator is small, down 5 cents to 527c/kg on October 14. This is, however, a new low for the season, and fractional though the change may be, the tendency is not helpful to the trade. The recession is frequently mentioned as a factor throughout the world, with Europe as depressed as the UK itself. Currency volatility and uncartainty holds back buying confidence at every stage, and there are no signs of an about-turn.</p>

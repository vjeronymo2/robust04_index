			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> SCHOOL BUDGET APPROVED  </P> <P> The Culver City Unified School District board approved a tight $16.8-million  budget for the coming school year, which includes increases for campus security  and books and supplies.  </P> <P> The budget compares to last year's budget of $16.9 million, which included a  reserve of $1 million.  </P> <P> The district's $65,000 security program, which includes two full-time night  guards and several part-time campus supervision aides, was increased by $42,200  to add a security manager and two full-time day security guards, chief  financial officer James Lively said.  </P> <P> The budget includes $7.7 million for the salaries of the district's 240  teachers, librarians, counselors and nurses. That figure does not provide for  any pay increases, Lively said.  </P> <P> A part-time education technologist and two part-time special education slots  were cut from last year, Lively said.  </P> <P> Sources of funds include about $15 million from the state, including $760,000  from the lottery. The district is also getting $2.35 million from the Culver  City Redevelopment Agency, most of it in a one-time payment.  </P> <P> He said there may be more money coming from the state. It is not yet clear  whether school districts will receive the 4.75% cost-of-living increase for  schools approved by the Legislature, or the 3% allowance approved by Gov.  George Deukmejian in the final version of the state's fiscal 1990-91 budget.  </P></p>

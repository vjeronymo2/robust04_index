			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Former Fed Banker Director Sentenced: Robert A. Rough was sentenced to six  months in prison for leaking secret interest rate data. U.S. District Judge  Dickinson R. Debevoise in Newark, N.J., also ordered the 50-year-old ex-banker,  who made an emotional plea for mercy before the sentencing, to perform 200  hours of community service during two years of probation. Rough sat on the New  York Fed's board from 1982 to 1984 while president of the National Bank of  Sussex County in Branchville. While there, Rough admitted in a plea bargain, he  regularly disclosed advance word regarding the Fed's discount rate to a  now-defunct Livingston brokerage firm, Bevill, Bresler &amp; Schulman Inc.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Young Party Elects Real Values"] </F>   [Text]A presentation of the Party of Russian Unity  and Accord (PRES) in the Republic of Tatarstan was held  yesterday at the Kazan national cultural center.    There are more than enough of all sorts of presentations  happening in Kazan. True, it is not always that they are  attended by politicians of such caliber as the Russian  Federation's deputy prime minister, Sergey Shakhray. Putting  aside all business for a day, he came to Tatarstan to "bless"  another regional branch of his party.    This visit, of course, was not to the taste of activists of  some political organizations of a nationalist orientation: There  were pickets at the entrance to the former Lenin memorial, with  posters whose content the population has become accustomed to  lately.    The introductory word at the presentation was delivered by  Insaf Sayfullin, chairman of the board of the PRES regional  branch. Judging by all signs, he does not have to worry about  party affairs--they are on the upturn. When the PRES registered  two months ago at the Republic of Tatarstan's Ministry of  Justice, it had 67 Tatarstan residents as members. Now the ranks  have more than doubled.    A number of [line(s) missing], heads of major industrial  enterprises, and members of the technical intelligentsia reacted  positively to the new entrant in the republic's political arena.  Some even joined the PRES; some are still looking with an  appraising eye at the political organization which proclaims  itself a national conservative party adhering to traditional  values: state, family, property, morality. After the signing of  a treaty between Russia and Tatarstan, even many officials  accept with a great deal of understanding the main ideological  tenet of PRES--federalism, the strengthening of the Russian  Federation through a diversity of forms of regional economic,  political, national, and cultural development.    The young party probably will gain new supporters after S.  Shakhray's speech yesterday, in which he outlined the PRES' main  task as forming a concept of civil accord. His party's  like-thinkers are represented in the Federation Council, and 30  State Duma deputies follow PRES aims. Neither can one call its  position in the Russian Federation government shaky--four  ministers are active members of the party. All this enables the  party, in Deputy Prime Minister S. Shakhray's opinion, to  conduct a purposeful regional policy using economic and treaty  mechanisms.    An announcement was made at the presentation that PRES has  proposed a concrete draft of a confederation treaty, which  envisages creating within the CIS framework a "core" consisting  of three or four states ready for greater integration in matters  of economics, collective security, and coordinated foreign  policy. In the author's conception [line(s) missing], it is  possible to form a confederation that envisages equal subjects  voluntarily joining into a commonwealth. The key to the problem  is how this process will proceed: on the basis of mutual  understanding or "a la Zhirinovskiy"--by way of the absorption  and destruction of republics and turning them into provinces.    Tatarstan's Vice President Vasiliy Likhachev predicted a  good  future for the PRES. In particular, he said that high political  and legal culture are in Tatarstan's interests. We should not  forget that not a single of the most complex issues at state  level can be resolved without the consent of all sides. And it  is good that a party whose activities revolve around the  regional theme is currently strengthening its positions. This  will help us to act together, to understand one another.    A press conference followed, where detailed replies were  provided to journalists' questions. For instance, in S.  Shakhray's opinion, very soon three directions will play a  decisive role in the Russian Federation: [words indistinct],  which will include communists; conservatives--on the basis of  the PRES; and liberals, but spearheaded by Russia's Choice  rather than the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]. Time  will tell whether this prediction will come true.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: PC manufacturers launch new-generation range A NEW generation of personal computers, based on Intel's new high-performance Pentium microprocessor, were introduced yesterday by several PC manufacturers. However, short supplies of the chip are likely to limit sales severely. The Pentium chip is Intel's fifth generation of PC microprocessors. The Silicon Valley company dominates the field. It's 486 microprocessor is the 'brains' inside most current PC models. Intel began shipments of Pentium chips to PC-makers in March, but said supplies would be limited in the current quarter. Intel said Pentium had 3.1m transistors and would be capable of 112m calculations per second, about five times faster than the 486. Mr Albert Yu, Intel senior vice-president, said yesterday: 'The Pentium processor enables a whole new class of systems. We expect initial products to be high-end servers, as corporations downsize applications, and high performance desktops for customers who require increased performance.' Intel expects to ship 'hundreds of thousands' of Pentium chips this year and to 'cross the 1m mark' in 1994. Leading the companies offering Pentium PCs are Compaq Computer, with machines ranging from a Dollars 5,000 (Pounds 3,247) desktop computer to network servers priced from Dollars 18,000. Other PC-makers introducing Pentium systems include AST Research, NEC, NCR, Zenith Data Systems, Dell Computer and Advanced Logic Research. Unisys and Hewlett-Packard are launching Pentium servers. Notably missing from the companies introducing Pentium PCs was IBM PC, the largest PC-maker. IBM is expected to wait until the new chip is available in higher volumes before launching products. Initially , Pentium PCs are expected to appeal to users of advanced applications such as computer-aided design and financial analysis that rely on the performance of the microprocessor 'brain' in a PC. Analysts predict it will be about two years before the Pentium chip supplants the 486 in the 'mainstream' PC market. Several PC manufacturers are already offering 'upgradeable' 486 PCs , with a socket to plug in a Pentium microprocessor at a later date. However, the design of Pentium systems is more complex than current PCs because the new chip requires special cooling systems. This may cause problems in 'upgradeable' PCs that are not equipped with specially designed fans, analysts said.</p>

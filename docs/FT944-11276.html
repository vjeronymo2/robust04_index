			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / International Company News: Santander regains stake in Ebro The fall of Barcelona financier Mr Javier de la Rosa, the former chief Spanish executive of the Kuwait Investment Office, who is being held pending investigations into his business dealings, has prompted the return of Banco Santander as a major shareholder of Ebro, the leading domestic sugar and rice producer. The development raises questions about the continuation of Grupo Torras, the KIO's investment arm in Spain, as Ebro's biggest shareholder and could prompt a major equity restructuring of Spain's unsettled sugar sector, paving the way for new investment, both domestic and foreign, in the industry. Santander recovered 9.9 per cent of Ebro through the execution of the stake held in the company by Mr de la Rosa. The banking group had sold the equity to Mr de la Rosa in 1992 and the shareholding had been offered by the financier as collateral for the loan he had received from Santander for the acquisition. Santander is now the second-largest shareholder of Ebro after the 36.5 stake held in the company by Torras, a purchase that was masterminded by Mr de la Rosa before Torras began losing heavily two years ago and the KIO severed its relationship with the financier. The return of the shareholding to Santander eases the instability at the company which followed the fall-out between Torras and Mr de la Rosa, and could prompt the removal of its chairman Mr Manuel Guasch, who was brought into the company by Mr de la Rosa. The banking group, which has a policy of disinvesting from industrial assets, is likely to sell its Ebro stake as soon as it judges the price to be right and the unresolved question is whether the KIO will use this development to dispose of its equity. 'Torras has to take a drastic decision: whether it finally pulls out of Ebro or whether it stays as a stable shareholder and contributes to the growth of the company,' said Mr Juan Bastos, of Madrid brokers Ibersecurities. Last year, Torras indicated its willingness to sell its stake in the food group, which controls 54 per cent of Spain's sugar quota, but the continued presence of Mr de la Rosa as a major Ebro shareholder kept prospective buyers away. At the time Torras was understood to have sounded out Tate &amp; Lyle, Germany's Sudzucker and Ferruzzi of Italy. The potential disposals at Ebro come in the wake of an attempt by Banco Central Hispano (BCH), to sell its controlling stake in General Azucacera, the second-ranked domestic sugar producer, to Saint-Louis of France and the UK's Tate &amp; Lyle. Last week BCH was forced to drop the sale following strong objections from the Spanish agriculture ministry. The ministry said it opposed BCH's planned sale to protect Spain's sugar quota in the European Union and stressed that any change in Azucacera's equity should be part of a wider restructuring of the big domestic sugar groups.</p>

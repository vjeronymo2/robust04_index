			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Beijing cautions Patten on tough line CHINA HAS cautioned Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor-designate, about trying to act tough with Beijing, and said he should work instead for a smooth transition of the colony's sovereignty to China in 1997. The Beijing-controlled Ta Kung Pao newspaper said in a commentary yesterday that Mr Patten should take no notice of the 'empty comment' in the British press urging him to be tough with China. 'It is far away from the reality in Hong Kong,' the commentary said. This, the most forthright commentary by Beijing to date, follows a cautious welcome given to his appointment by China's foreign ministry spokesman in Beijing at the weekend. The ministry said it hoped Mr Patten would contribute to the maintenance of the colony's long-term stability and prosperity, and to a smooth transfer of power in 1997. Improvement of relations with China will be one of Mr Patten's most pressing challenges when he arrives in the colony in July. He will find that Beijing is seeking an ever-larger role in the colony's affairs while it is dragging its feet in bilateral talks about the transition from British to Chinese sovereignty. Ta Kung Pao said that Mr Patten's real achievement as Britain's last governor of the colony should be in co-operation with China to achieve a smooth transition for Hong Kong. 'From Mrs Thatcher to John Major, British prime ministers have successfully resolved Hong Kong problems on the foundations of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and co-operation with the Chinese government. It has nothing to do with attitudes.' Months of speculation over the successor to Lord Wilson, the colony's present governor, were ended on Friday when Mr Major announced Mr Patten's appointment to the governorship. He will be the colony's 28th British governor.</p>

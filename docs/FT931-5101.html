			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Construction Contracts: Carbon improves the taste of Thames ANGLIAN H&amp;G (AH&amp;G) has been awarded a Pounds 15m contract by Thames Water for a 25 tonnes per day granular activated carbon (GAC) reactivation plant to be built at Kempton Park, Surrey. The scope of work includes design, procurement, construction and commissioning. The design has already started and the plant is scheduled to come into production early in 1995. GAC is being used increasingly by the water industry to improve the quality of drinking water in order to conform to EC directives. It is particularly effective at removing herbicides and pesticides whilst also improving the taste and odour of water. The energy efficiency of Anglian H&amp;G's reactivation process has been optimised and raises internally all the steam required for the process. The company is building an additional eight plants in the UK for the removal of pesticides from water. Anglian H&amp;G is a 50/50 joint venture between Anglian Water and H&amp;G Process Contracting, part of the Jacobs Engineering Group.</p>

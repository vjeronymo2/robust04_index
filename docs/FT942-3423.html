			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / World Trade News: S Korean train contract sealed GEC-Alsthom, the Anglo-French group, yesterday signed a Dollars 2.1bn (Pounds 1.4bn) contract with South Korea to provide grande vitesse trains (TGV) for the country's new high-speed rail system, writes John Burton in Seoul. The deal will be financed by a Dollars 2.3bn loan from a consortium of French banks led by Banque Indosuez. The contract signing in Seoul concludes three years of negotiations that involved GEC-Alsthom, Siemens of Germany and Mitsubishi of Japan competing for the prestigious rail contract. GEC-Alsthom offered a low bid and extensive technology transfers to win the contract to provide 46 locomotives which will run on a 410km track between Seoul and the port city of Pusan. All but two of the trains will be assembled or built in South Korea by three main subcontractors, including Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry, Daewoo Heavy Industries and Hanjin Heavy Industries, with localised production amounting to 50 per cent.</p>

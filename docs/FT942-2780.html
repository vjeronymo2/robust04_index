			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Slough offer for Bredero to fail Slough Estates' privatisation offer for Bredero closed today with few expectations for success. Slough already owns close to 50 per cent of the troubled property developer, but the offer is conditional upon 90 per cent acceptance, and it will not achieve this. British Land last week acquired 6.9 per cent of the company, and a number of other shareholders, amounting to a total of more than 25 per cent, have indicated that they will not accept.</p>

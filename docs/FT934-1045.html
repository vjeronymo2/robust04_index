			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow drifts to slightly firmer close Wall Street US blue chip stocks inched ahead yesterday while the wider market edged lower in subdued pre-holiday trading, writes Frank McGurty in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 3.64 higher at 3,755.21, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.53 to 465.85. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was off 0.12 at 464.08, but the Nasdaq composite firmed 0.92 to 760.15. NYSE volume came to 256m shares. Stocks opened lower but quickly reversed course in a pattern that typifies trading on Monday mornings following 'triple witching days', when the quarterly expiration of options and futures contracts generates heavy volume and exaggerates underlying market trends. On Friday the Dow industrials gained 25.43 at 3,751.57. However, with no fresh macro-economic news due until later in the week, investors yesterday were left adrift, with only the listless bond market to offer guidance. Activity in US Treasuries was subdued ahead of today's keenly awaited meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, in which the policy-making panel was expected to adopt a bias towards tighter money, shifting from its current stance of neutrality. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  5/16 lower at 99 9/32 , yielding 6.298 per cent. Blue chips, which were ahead 8 points at mid-morning, meandered in and out of negative territory most of the day, before closing with a slight gain. However, some cyclical issues, which should benefit most from improved economic conditions, were strong. Goodyear Tire added Dollars 5/8 at Dollars 44, Cummins Engine Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 51 3/4 , Caterpillar Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 87 5/8 and Tennaco Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 52 1/8 . Allied Signal edged up Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 77 1/2 even though the stock was downgraded by Oppenheimer. Union Carbide put on Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 22 1/4 . CPC International, the agricultural products company, was 1 3/8 higher at Dollars 47 3/4 after CS First Boston raised its rating to 'buy' from 'hold'. IBM fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 58 1/4 on the announcement that technical problems would delay delivery of updated versions of its PS/2 personal computer models. In banking stocks, Wells Fargo climbed Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 128 3/4 after Brown Brothers Harriman boosted its estimate of the company's 1994 earnings. Borden was marked up Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 18 5/8 on reports that its directors were considering a plan to sell the ailing food and chemicals company, either as a whole or in parts. On the Amex, US Bioscience dropped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 9 1/4 on concern that the US Food and Drug Administration would delay action on approving its Ethyol ovarian cancer medication. Canada In spite of a rise in gold and other mining issues, Toronto ended flat as the market came under pressure from tax-loss selling. Investors are making use of the federal capital gains exemption for fear of it being scrapped in February's budget. The TSE 300 index was just 0.06 up at 4,223.6. Volume came to 59.3m shares and falls outscored rises by 464 to 382. The mining and gold indices rose 1.4 and 1.1 per cent respectively. The transportation group had the day's biggest fall, 1.7 per cent.</p>

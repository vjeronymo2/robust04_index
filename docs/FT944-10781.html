			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Personal View: Goodbye to 'good chaps' government Sir Robin Butler, cabinet secretary and head of the British civil service, subscribes, it has been said by a former senior civil servant, to the 'good chaps theory of government'. And why not? When I first came to the UK in the 1950s, everybody did. Good chaps ran the royal colleges, the chartered institutes, the inns of court, the merchant banks, public companies, Lloyd's insurance market, Oxbridge colleges, public schools and the House of Commons. Former prime minister Harold Macmillan - a little too clever to be a really good chap - presided over the nation with wit and cynicism, turning aside from cares of state to read Aeschylus in the original. Bowler-hatted good chaps poured from the underground every morning, properly dressed for their stations in life, umbrellas rolled, detachable collars firmly held in place by studs and waistcoats with the bottom button undone. They wore the right ties and held the right views. They knew what was done and what not. After six o'clock, one put on black shoes. Gentlemen and players changed in separate dressing rooms at Lord's cricket ground. I remember asking a director of the Hamburg bank where I trained why we lost consortium business to the City. 'Ah,' he replied sadly. 'We cheat. They play according to the rules.' The good chap was a type. The English gentleman belonged, along with the Jesuit father, the German general staff officer or the southern American planter, to a group of human beings instantly recognisable and, even more important, utterly predictable. As Gilbert and Sullivan, whose comic operas chronicled the Victorian good chap, put it, 'he never thought of thinking for himself at all', and this was his greatest advantage. Educated at Marlborough and Balliol, he knew how 'to play the game'. His degree in classics helped him to learn Urdu or Swahili. He could be sent up the Zambezi or into the Indian hill country for months without orders from headquarters or modern means of communication. He kept a straight bat, maintained no concubines and remarkably rarely took a bribe. The less he thought for himself, the more rapid his promotion. The good chap was the product of brilliant Victorian social engineers, men like the Reverend Elijah Woodard, who founded Lancing, Ardingly, Denholm, Bloxham and countless other public (ie private) schools. These schools created the 'gentleman', a social type which blurred the distinction between noble and bourgeois, a cause of revolution on the continent. Rules were understood, not written. Hence Britain ran its affairs without those cumbersome documents known as constitutions, without state examinations to regulate the professions, without government agencies to control business and commerce. Victorian and Edwardian governments probably produced better value for money than any governments in modern history. The system responded heroically to the challenge of two wars and the introduction of the welfare state, but it began to creak in the 1960s and 1970s. Unwritten rules turned into cosy arrangements to avoid conflict, and economic decline wrote its verdict on British performance. Margaret Thatcher - not a good chap herself - understood that the system had to go and she dealt it every sort of blow. She hated establishments, corporate bodies and restrictive practices, closed societies and tacit understandings. Like her great predecessor, Robespierre, she was a Jacobin democrat, the descendant of those furious Parisian shopkeepers who destroyed ancien regime France. She hoped that banishing the good chap would liberate Britain from the dead hand of customary rule. Her great experiment failed. The boom of the 1980s proved artificial, rouge on the cheeks of a corpse. But in forcing us to be free she centralised the state and destroyed local autonomy. The legacy of her unfinished revolution is state power without control. Now good chaps no longer regulate themselves, nothing has taken their place. Britain has the least representative electoral system and offers its citizens the lowest civil rights of any developed state. They have neither the written constitution and bill of rights of the Americans nor the continental system of administrative courts which protect citizens against the agencies of the state. Sir Robin Butler may still believe in the 'good chaps theory of government'. The rest of us can see that it no longer works in practice.

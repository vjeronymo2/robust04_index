			<p>BFN     [Text] Defense Minister Joe Modise says he is willing to  testify before the government's proposed commission on  reconciliation and truth. Speaking in Cape Town, he said the  ANC had nothing to hide and that everybody who was supposed to  testify before the commission would do so. However, he added  that he had said all that he needed to say in testimony to an  internal ANC commission last year.    Mr. Modise was among ANC leaders named in that report as  having perpetrated or allowed human rights abuses in ANC  detention camps in Angola. Mr. Modise's statement is a sequel  to a request by nine former generals of the SADF [South African  Defense Force] and the police that senior ANC members set an  example by giving evidence before the truth commission. The  group, including Freedom Front Leader Constand Viljoen, is  demanding fairness toward all parties regarding past misdeeds.</p>

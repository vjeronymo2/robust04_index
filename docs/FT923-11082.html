			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Lamont defends tough strategy MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, hardened his defence of the government's tough economic strategy yesterday in the face of renewed calls for other approaches to remedying Britain's economic woes. In an interview with BBC Radio 4, Mr Lamont said the pursuit of low inflation was the only policy that would bring lasting economic recovery and improve Britain's competitiveness. He again ruled out a devaluation of sterling within the European exchange rate mechanism, saying such a move was 'not on the agenda'. His comments came on the eve of more bad news for the domestic economy. Tomorrow the Confederation of British Industry's quarterly industrial trends survey will show there was a sharp drop in business confidence during the past month and that manufacturing companies do not expect their orders to increase over the next few months. Figures will also be released this week showing that mortgage lenders repossessed more than 30,000 homes in the first six months of the year, only a small decrease from the record 38,000 in the previous six months. Over the weekend, several mortgage lenders again warned that they might have to raise rates, even if base rates stay unchanged, to make up for bad debts and heavy losses from repossessions. Mr Lamont admitted that the recession had lasted longer than he had expected but said this did not justify 'alarmist' talk of a 1930s-style slump. Although he understood why people were impatient for some improvement, he insisted that the government's anti-inflation strategy was a pre-condition for sustained recovery. On the same programme, Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative cabinet minister and prominent Euro-sceptic, accused the chancellor of surrendering economic control to Germany. 'At the moment the German economy needs high interest rates. I suspect that the British economy needs rather lower interest rates and we have locked ourselves into a position where the Chancellor has no discretion at all,' Lord Tebbit said. The Labour party accused the chancellor of 'breathtaking and arrogant complacency'. Mr Gordon Brown, the new shadow chancellor, said: 'He is now misleading us in saying there are no alternative policies to follow.'

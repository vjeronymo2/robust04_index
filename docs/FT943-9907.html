			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Sarajevo military ban urged The commander of UN troops in Bosnia called yesterday for a demilitarised zone around Sarajevo after Nato aircraft struck at defiant Serbs last Friday. Lt-Gen Sir Michael Rose was trying to set up a meeting with the commander of the Bosnian Serb forces, Gen Ratko Mladic, to discuss the issue, a UN official said. The plan calls for a withdrawal of all armed and uniformed soldiers and would allow both Serb and Moslem forces to take their weapons out of the zone for use elsewhere. However, there has been no response from Gen Mladic, whose forces in Sarajevo have been blamed for an increasing number of sniping incidents. UN sharpshooters are reported to havekilled one or two Serb snipers in the past two days.</p>

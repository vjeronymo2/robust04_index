			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH SEEKS PAY RAISE FOR 7,200  </P> <P> President Bush today asked Congress to give 7,200 federal executives pay  increases of 8% to 25%, with even higher raises going to a selected 200 with  special skills.  </P> <P> However, the President coupled his pay raise plan with a proposal that the  officials justify their right to the higher salaries every three years to keep  receiving them.  </P> <P> Bush's proposal would give 25% hikes to just the most senior officials,  matching a salary hike he has already advocated for federal judges. More junior  officials would get smaller increases under the plan.  </P> <P> The plan would raise the pay of top federal officials, including Cabinet  members, to $124,400 from the present $99,500.  </P> <P> It would also raise the salary of Vice President Dan Quayle from $115,000 to  $143,000. But it would not affect Bush's $200,000 salary.  </P> <P> The total pay package would cost taxpayers $101 million in the fiscal year that  begins Oct. 1 and $147 million in the following fiscal year, Fitzwater said.  </P></p>

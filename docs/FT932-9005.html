			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Revenue squeeze on pension plan abuses BRITISH tax authorities are taking a hard look at what goes into and out of pension schemes - particularly the small, self-administered type which caters for the retirement future of top executives. Robert Lusk, controller of the Inland Revenue's pension schemes office (PSO) told the National Association of Pension Funds this week that the PSO aimed to audit an additional 2,000 schemes this year. In addition, it would expand its audits beyond the small, self-administered schemes (SSASs) - which account for the majority of tax abuses - into slightly larger ones. In January 1991, the PSO set up a compliance unit to monitor how pension schemes adhered to the relevant tax laws. So far, 3,700 audits have begun, nearly half of them of SSASs for fewer than 12 people and most of the other half covering schemes administered by insurance companies. Of these, 2,400 have been completed. The unit has found 'unsatisfactory' features in a quarter of them, mostly in the form of benefits paid out which exceeded Revenue limits. 'We have identified over Pounds 1m paid out in excessive lump sum benefits,' Lusk noted. Inland Revenue limits cap the tax-free lump sum retrievable upon retirement to a quarter of the lump sum value of the pension. In too many cases, Lusk indicated, the overpayments appeared to be deliberate. 'We see examples of manipulation in areas where it is difficult to believe it is anything other than manipulation.' One common example was under-reporting pension benefits. A senior executive coming into a company at age-40 might indicate that he had no prior pension anywhere; this allowed him to accrue pension up to Revenue limits at his new place of employment. Lusk said: 'Perhaps 20 years ago, it might have been quite common for someone in middle age to join a scheme, having had no previous pension provision of any kind. But I would suggest that someone claiming the same now might at least merit a follow-up question.' In particular, Lusk said, the Revenue was concerned by the number of cases it found of vast over-payment into insured schemes. 'We have plenty of evidence that significant over-funding of insured schemes and arrangements is commonplace. When challenged, some insurers even admit that, in money purchase schemes, no checks are done until the member actually retires.' Several companies had been identified as persistent abusers. In considering how to deal with tax abuse of pension schemes, Lusk suggested that a new range of penalties should be enacted. Present ones either were too lenient or too harsh and individuals simply were forced to pay the tax they should have paid in the first place, or the tax status was revoked from the scheme itself. 'Withdrawal can have a scatter-gun effect, which means that it is not always the right weapon to use where there has been a failure of administration,' he added.</p>

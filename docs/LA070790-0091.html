			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY OK OF RANCHLAND DEVELOPMENT RULED  LEGAL  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge ruled Friday that Los Angeles County legally approved  the Paramount Ranch development in Agoura, handing a stinging defeat to  opponents who claimed the luxury 150-home development did not get an adequate  environmental review.  </P> <P> Under Judge David P. Yaffe's ruling, construction could start soon on the  scenic, oak-studded tract where the Renaissance Pleasure Faire was formerly  held. State and federal parks agencies had tried to buy the 320-acre site for  the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.  </P> <P> The Sierra Club, the Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation and Friends of the  Santa Monica Mountains had contended that the county rubber-stamped an  environmental impact report prepared by developers' consultants.  </P></p>

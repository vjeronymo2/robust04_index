			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Bad news for the papers: French government concerns over press revelations The prominence that the French press has been giving over the past few months to the corruption scandals wracking the country is provoking a political reaction. It is not as harsh as that of Shakespeare's Cleopatra, who told a messenger he should be 'whipped with wire and stewed in brine' for bringing her bad news. It is more a desire among politicians to put a stop to the torrent of corruption stories in the press. These have precipitated the fall of three government ministers: Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, Mr Alain Carignon, communications minister, and Mr Michel Roussin, foreign aid minister. They have also hit the share prices of top companies implicated in the scandals, such as Alcatel, Generale des Eaux and Lyonnaise des Eaux. In many of these stories, the press has been able to draw on investigating magistrates' dossiers, even before they have been presented to the suspects. A recent amendment to a justice bill passed by the National Assembly would prevent the publication of information relating to people who are the subject of an inquiry or judicial investigation without their consent. The amendment, proposed by Mr Alain Marsaud, a Gaullist MP and former magistrate, may get no further. It was voted through by only a handful of deputies in a late-night session, and may be defeated when it goes before the Senate later this month. Even if the amendment falls, however, the Balladur government is working on ways to prevent magistrates' dossiers leaking to the press. Yesterday, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's commission on anti-corruption reform insisted that secrecy must be maintained. These attempts to clamp down on press leaks come at a time when the French press has been flagellating itself - or, more specifically, the magazine Paris-Match and journalist Mr Philippe Alexandre - for breaking the taboo on delving into the private lives of politicians. The weekly news magazine revealed what all self-respecting Paris journalists now claim to have known for years, that President Francois Mitterrand had, in addition to his official 'first family' of wife Danielle and two sons, a 'second family' on the side. When Paris-Match ran some touching photos of the president and his 20-year-old daughter, and Mr Alexandre detailed their relationship in a book, the condemnation was as loud from the press as from any other quarter. Mr Jean Miot, a director of Le Figaro and president of the French press federation, said the profession was in danger of 'falling into the gutter with some of its Anglo-Saxon counterparts'. Even Mr Claude Angeli, editor of the satirical weekly, Le Canard Enchaine, joined the chorus. The magazine has been ready to have a go at France's quasi-monarchical presidency since its revelations about the diamonds ex-President Giscard d'Estaing received from 'Emperor' Bokassa, dictator of the Central African Republic. But Mr Angeli said he was 'completely against this unbundling of the private lives of politicians'. What went virtually unremarked was the legitimate public issue that President Mitterrand had maintained his second family on government property, and therefore at taxpayers' expense. But the French law on privacy, which strongly protects individuals against press intrusion, is strongly upheld by the courts and by public opinion. Politicians generally expect to keep their personal lives to themselves. They are also expected to keep quiet about them: the aberration of Mr Michel Rocard, the former Socialist prime minister, in announcing to the press in 1991 that he was separating from his then wife was partially excused on the ground he was a Protestant. Some of the moral outrage directed at Paris-Match and Mr Alexandre has been tactical. As in countries such as the UK, the tabloid press is constantly warned that its latest antics may precipitate legislation to control it. The French press, therefore, does not want allegations about invasions of privacy used as a pretext to muzzle it just when it is getting its teeth into political corruption. The semblance of government control over the French press has been slow to disappear in France. It was only last summer that Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister, moved to disband the 'political police' function of the Renseignements Genereaux, a French security service, after an RG agent was found to have eavesdropped on a Socialist party meeting. Up to then, French national newspapers always had an RG man stationed at their printers to check the first editions for anything sensitive or objectionable to the government, though this rarely ended in an attempt at censorship. In addition, French politicians still routinely insist on vetting the wording of interviews they give to the press before these appear in print. And the government gives newspapers some FFr4.2bn (Pounds 490m) a year in cash and postal subsidies. But the French press is as aggressive in its pursuit of the government and business establishment as its Anglo-Saxon counterpart. In exposing recent scandals, it has been able to ride on the back of a judiciary that has suddenly taken the bit between its teeth in investigating corruption. Magistrates' investigations are normally protected from exposure by the secret d'instruction (secrecy of judicial investigation), which prevents law and police officers from disclosing details of the case during its early stages. Secrecy is necessary because, during the long process of investigation, suspects have fewer rights than under Anglo-Saxon law. They are, for instance, not allowed to have a lawyer present for the first 19 hours of their detention, and even after that can find it hard to discover the charges against them. However, the press is exempted from the secret d'instruction by the freedom of expression provisions of the Declaration of Human Rights of 1789, and can therefore legally print any leaks it gets. Some magistrates have been quietly happy to leak details of cases to the press to prevent them being stifled by the judicial hierarchy. A prosecutor in Valenciennes, for example, has been giving open press conferences about his investigations into football bribery allegations concerning Mr Bernard Tapie's Olympique-Marseille team. A new balance between an individual's right to be protected by judicial secrecy and the public's right to know will have to be found, as Mr Pierre Mehaignerie, the justice minister, recognises. A degree of secrecy may be maintainable, he says, provided French magistrates can shorten their often interminable investigations. But even during the investigation period, 'windows of information' might be arranged when more details might be released, particularly in cases involving politicians. Perhaps magistrates could be given their own press officers, he suggests. The most thrusting of French investigative reporters might scoff at this. But it would suit most of their colleagues. The French press in general certainly does not want the public coming to agree with the retort of Cleopatra's messenger: 'The nature of bad news infects the teller.'</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Reichmann selects fresh team from O&amp;Y staff MR PAUL Reichmann, the guiding light in the rise and fall of Olympia &amp; York, has recruited several former O&amp;Y employees to help him rebuild his reputation in the international property business. Reichmann International, Mr Reichmann's new company, has rented offices in Toronto formerly occupied by O&amp;Y. The restructured, but much-shrunken, O&amp;Y emerged from bankruptcy protection this month under the effective control of its creditors and the day-to-day management of an administrator. The debt-restructuring included the creation of a modest-sized property management company, O&amp;Y Properties, under the management of Mr Philip Reichmann, Mr Paul Reichmann's nephew, and Mr Frank Hauer, his son-in-law. The elder Reichmann signalled his ambition to play on a bigger field by setting up Reichmann International. He recently announced he was teaming up with Mr George Soros, the New York investment manager, to create an international property fund. RI's recruits include Mr Peter Anderson, an American finance specialist. Mr Anderson spearheaded the abortive attempt by Canary Wharf, O&amp;Y's former flagship project in London's Docklands, to raise money in the months before its collapse through an Enterprise Zone unit trust.</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / UK Company News: National &amp; Provincial hits Pounds 100m NATIONAL &amp; Provincial, the UK's seventh largest building society, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 100.4m in the year to December 31 despite bad debt provisions of Pounds 52.1m. The result represented a 68 per cent improvement on 1990 when taxable profits were Pounds 59.8m. At the same time there was a strong improvement in the society's market share, which rose from 2.3 per cent of net building society lending in 1990 to 6.4 per cent, and in its cost/income ratio which dropped sharply from 54 to 46.6 per cent. The figures were hailed in the City as showing that despite the housing market depression, N&amp;P was now back on course after several troubled years. 'This is by far the most improved set of results that the building society industry will see this year,' said Mr John Wriglesworth, a building society analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the stockbroker. 'It is an outstanding achievement considering the state they were in only a year ago.' National &amp; Provincial's total assets grew from Pounds 9.26bn to Pounds 10.7bn. Net lending over the 12 months more than doubled from Pounds 563m to Pounds 1.32bn. Its gross capital ratio weakened slightly from 6 to 5.7 per cent, but its free capital ratio rose slightly from 5 to 5.1 per cent. The Pounds 52.1m provisions, up from Pounds 44.6m in 1990, reflected the society's view that the growth of mortgage payment arrears in 1991 would cause repossessions to continue to rise in 1992. Post-tax return on reserves was up from 9.3 to 13.8 per cent.</p>

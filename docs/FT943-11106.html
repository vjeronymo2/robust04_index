President Herzog has welcomed the invitation from Poland's president, Lech Walesa (left), as 'courageous', and there is every sign that he intends to follow in the steps of his predecessor, Richard von Weizsacker, and do all he can to improve relations between the two neighbours. William Perry, the US defence secretary, returns to Washington from Rwanda. Some 200 US troops arrived in Kigali, the Rwandan capital, yesterday to prepare the airport for relief flights.

Rwandan crisis: Donor countries meet in Geneva to discuss the United Nation's humanitarian aid effort for Rwanda and pledge contributions to the UN's Dollars 434m appeal launched on July 22.

US vice-president, Al Gore, arrives in Kiev for a one-day official visit with Ukraine's new leadership. Mr Gore comes on the personal invitation of President Leonid Kuchma, just two weeks in office.

The Commerce Department's report on leading economic indicators for June is expected to climb, pushed by rises in orders for new plant and equiment and materials prices.

Tin mine: Managers at Britain's last operating tin mine, South Crofty, Cornwall, will know today if their share offering has raised enough to get them through the next 18 months, when they hope tin prices will be higher. If Pounds 1m is raised by midnight, the UK government and RTZ Corporation will write off loans of Pounds 30.4m (Dollars 47m). Otherwise, the future looks bleak.

The talks will be the first main test for North Korea's new leader, Mr Kim Jong-il, the son of the late president.

It is not expected that a sum to match the Getty's purchase price will be raised. 6-7 WEEKEND Samper becomes president Outgoing Colombian president, Cesar Gaviria, is due to hand over power on Sunday to president-elect Ernesto Samper, who narrowly won the May 19 election. Mr Gaviria is to become secretary-general of the Organisation of American States. Hiroshima ceremony: Peace Memorial ceremonies take place on Saturday to mark the anniversary of the 1945 atomic bombing of the city. Aids conference: The 10th international conference on Aids starts on Sunday. This year's week-long event in Yokohama is likely to be smaller than last year's in Berlin, not because of a lack of scientific developments, but simply because of the expense of travelling to and staying in Japan. The conference is expected to yield details of trials showing that the drug AZT can inhibit transmission of HIV from mother to child, and news about the effectiveness of using three drugs in combination. Guinea-Bissau vote: The second round run-off in the presidential elections in the west African republic is held on Sunday.

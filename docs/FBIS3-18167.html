He also said he is  concerned about the repercussions of the measures adopted by the  Greek Government. [passage omitted]    Van Den Broek said that all problems, including the issue of  the Greek measures, will be discussed in Brussels and he will  brief the EU foreign ministers.    Referring to the Greek measures, Van Den Broek said the  Greek  side's arguments must also be examined and that this issue will  be discussed in Brussels as soon as Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou's message is received. He stressed, however, that  the solution of this problem will help resolve future tensions.    Generally, Van Den Broek said he is grateful for the  cooperation he found as well as for the willingness to continue  joint efforts to find a solution. [passage omitted]</p>

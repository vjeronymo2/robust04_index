			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORALITY PLAY IN THE SOUTH BRONX;  </P> <P> TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE THE OUTLANDISH STORY OF WEDTECH BY JAMES TRAUB (DOUBLEDAY:  $21.95; 368 PP.);  </P> <P> FEEDING THE BEAST HOW WEDTECH BECAME THE MOST CORRUPT LITTLE COMPANY IN AMERICA  BY MARILYN W. THOMPSON (CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS: $22.50; 320 PP.)  </P> <P> John Mariotta, the Puerto Rican immigrant businessman who founded the now  notorious Wedtech Corp. of the South Bronx, was consumed with a desire to make  it big -- for himself, for his family, for his employees and for his country.  </P> <P> So much so, we are told, that the trappings of success became almost more  important to him than the bottom-line corporate figures of his fledgling  defense-contracting enterprise: big limos to take him and his fellow executives  to meetings; dinners at expensive restaurants.  </P> <P> But it seemed Mariotta never knew where to stop. As with many aspects of  Wedtech, the money spent on furnishings alone was beyond all bounds of  propriety. Flushed with his initial success at winning some Army and Navy  contracts, Mariotta turned the executive suite of his former machine shop in  the downtrodden Bronx into a palace worthy of the last days of the  Austro-Hungarian Empire. He bought miles of heavily brocaded silk to cover the  ceiling-high windows of his office, adding Persian carpets and antique  breakfronts. A chandelier fit for a grand ballroom hung in the plant's small  entrance foyer.  </P> <P> The almost bigger-than-life story of how the founders of this "house of fraud"  corrupted congressmen, lawyers, officials of the Small Business Administration,  former White House aides and New York state officeholders is told in an  entertaining fashion by free-lance writer James Traub, who pored over thousands  of pages of court records and interviewed many of the defendants and federal  prosecutors. The influence-buying scandal broke in late 1986 and eventually  resulted in about two dozen convictions for bribery, conspiracy, fraud and  racketeering. It wound down last year with the convictions of San Francisco  lawyer-lobbyist E. Robert Wallach, a longtime friend of former Attorney General  Edwin Meese III, and New York Congressman Robert Garcia, the second of two  congressmen to fall.  </P> <P> "Too Good to Be True," James Traub's well-organized narrative, laced with humor  and replete with anecdotes, captures the human side of all the malefactors who  peopled this major domestic scandal of the Ronald Reagan years. (The other big  case would be HUD, and the foreign-affairs scandal, of course, was Iran-Contra,  which Traub notes ironically broke about the same time.)  </P> <P> By way of explaining his book's title, Traub shows us that what gave Wedtech  its initial entree to the Reagan Administration was the makeup of the firm.  Originally known as Welbilt Electronic Die Corp., its founder, Mariotta, was an  energetic Latino, and a Republican to boot, at a time when Reaganites wanted to  woo Latino voters and to encourage the principles of private enterprise instead  of government handouts, particularly in an area such as the economically  ravaged South Bronx. Invited to attend a White House meeting of small  businessmen, Mariotta and his company soon became what Traub has labeled "the  White House poster child."  </P> <P> But folks who at first promoted the firm for free in the inner circles of  government -- folks like Wallach, Meese's friend, and Reagan political director  Lyn Nofziger -- ultimately latched onto high fees from Wedtech in return for  their lobbying work. Nofziger, of course, waited until after he had left the  White House.  </P> <P> Such importuning by paid friends of Wedtech (it changed its name in going  public in 1983) helped win for it a no-bid $30 million minority-enterprise  contract to produce Army engines and other government work, including a Navy  portable-bridge contract that eventually would have been worth $400 million if  Wedtech had performed well.  </P> <P> But the company's reach exceeded its grasp; high living by its executives,  payoffs to congressmen and state officials and excessively high fees paid to  lawyers and political consultants in return for their influence drained the  small company. All that, combined with poor management and shoddy workmanship,  brought Wedtech to eventual bankruptcy. The dream vanished when its several  hundred workers, mostly blacks and Latinos, lost their jobs as Mariotta and his  colleagues, along with public officials, went off to jail.  </P> <P> Traub suggests we may look upon Wedtech as sort of a morality play that  includes the cynical bribe-payers -- the top officers of the firm -- and  recipients who surrounded the company like flies around a honey pot. But the  play, he suggests, is neither straightforward nor satisfying. It has to do with  deceit and self-delusion, that faculty which permits men to believe what is  useful for them to believe. Mariotta and his executives believed they were only  doing on a smaller scale what large defense contractors accomplish with their  campaign contributions and their employment of top officials who retire from  the Pentagon.  </P> <P> Traub's painstaking account of the rise and fall of Wedtech is at its best in  using the Wedtech case to illustrate how the Washington influence game works;  at its worst when it is burdening us with minute details about too many bit  players in the military-contracts and lobbying field. Yet, even without an  index, which would greatly assist serious scholars of this scandal, Traub's  book organizes a complex and often confusing array of criminal charges into a  sprightly narrative of novel proportions.  </P> <P> Where in American literature, for example, is there a more rapacious figure  than Mario Biaggi, the corrupt New York congressman, who -- unhappy with the  prospect of straightforward payoffs -- demands a piece of Wedtech itself and 5%  of every government contract he can swing its way? Or where a more tragic  figure than lawyer Bob Wallach, a longtime liberal identified with human-rights  and civil-rights causes in San Francisco, who receives a stiff six-year prison  sentence for allegedly receiving illicit payments from Wedtech to lobby Meese  and work for a cause he probably deemed just?  </P> <P> Marilyn Thompson's "Feeding the Beast" is a more detailed book on the  characters who people the Wedtech story. An investigative journalist who came  to know them first-hand, Thompson began investigating the scandal for the New  York Daily News in 1986, and her award-winning articles helped bring the case  to national attention.  </P> <P> While Traub relies largely on legal documents and the official transcript of  the Wedtech criminal trials to tell his story, Thompson bases her book heavily  on interviews with federal prosecutors, defense lawyers and many of the  principals themselves. It results in a somewhat slower-paced but richer telling  of the Wedtech story.  </P> <P> Thompson is at her best when she is describing the background and character  traits of the Wedtech malefactors. Describing founder Mariotta as a masterful  manipulator "who could convince a host of government agencies that his two-bit  machine shop deserved better than the small contracts on which it had  subsisted," Thompson reveals that the up-by-the-bootstraps Puerto Rican  struggled with an inferiority complex traceable in part to the fact that he was  illiterate until adulthood. His co-founder, Fred Neuberger, was a Romanian-born  Jew who escaped the Holocaust, became an Israeli "freedom fighter," was known  for his hot temper and once plotted to murder Mariotta because of a policy  dispute, Thompson tells us.  </P> <P> Despite her closeness to the case, Thompson tells her story as a straight  reporter without interpretation. One wishes she had drawn more lessons from  Wedtech, much as Traub does.  </P></p>

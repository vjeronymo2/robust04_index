			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Supply threat to Norway's gas sales SPIRALLING demand for gas from Europe's electricity industry is threatening Norway's ability to supply all its potential customers in the second half of the 1990s. In spite of indigenous North Sea gas reserves exceeding two trillion cubic metres, the problem of meeting demand has arisen from the lack of a national gas export strategy. Only two years ago, Norway was concerned that it might be unable to increase gas sales and that its oil-dependent economy would suffer as declining oil production cut sales revenue. Norway, one of Europe's largest gas producers, is also the region's biggest oil producer, apart from Britain. Earlier pessimism over the possibility of expanding gas markets has been transformed into optimism by a 'green wave' sweeping Europe in which gas is considered a more environmentally friendly fuel than oil in power generation. Gas sales in recent years have been in the range of 25bn cubic metres (bcm) but this could double by the turn of the century. Europe's rising gas demand is also being spurred by increasing technical problems in the Soviet Union, Europe's biggest supplier, over boosting exports. Under the Troll/Sleipner gas sales agreement signed in 1986 between Norway and a consortium of European buyers, 30.51 bcm is committed under the contracts. The Troll and Sleipner East fields have reserves of just 26.5 bcm. To help to fill the shortfall, the owners of the Troll field have agreed to sell an additional 3.7 bcm from two other fields - the Veslefrikk and Brage  -on behalf of those fields' owners. The Troll field owners will charge these owners a handling fee. This agreement forms a model for a 'brokerage' operation for other gas fields to be taken under the Troll umbrella. However, not all owners want to sell their gas through the Troll field owners but instead wish to make their own sales deals. Norway's supply quandary is complicated by gas purchase options contained within the Troll agreement which could boost the buyers' total demand to 40.82 bcm. But before the buyers exercise their purchase options Norway must guarantee it can meet this demand.</p>

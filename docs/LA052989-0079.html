			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO CRUISE ACROSS THE SILVER SCREEN  </P> <P> Despite the new competition among the auto makers for Hollywood exposure, the  Japanese remain surprisingly reluctant to get deeply involved in movie product  placement.  </P> <P> Toyota has not agreed to work with any television or feature film production  since "Back to the Future."  </P> <P> Honda officials say their firm has never agreed to work on a television show or  movie, and has no plans to do so.  </P> <P> Nissan has worked with only two movies recently, including "Blind Date," a  Bruce Willis film that featured a Nissan 300ZX.  </P> <P> Among the major Japanese auto makers, only Mazda has retained a Hollywood  agent.  </P> <P> Car agents believe that the Japanese don't work with Hollywood because they  have never had to do much marketing in this country to sell their cars. At the  same time, agents say, the studios and production companies generally aren't  interested in small cars, and the Japanese have only recently started selling  larger models.

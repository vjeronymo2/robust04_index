			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / 'Boom' mood on Latin America recalls 1970s: Stephen Fidler on a resurgence of confidence in the private sector BANKERS, businessmen and investors in their thousands have converged on Hamburg, Germany, this week illustrating a resurgence in private sector confidence in Latin America not seen since the 1970s. The annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank - a few years ago a desultory gathering of officials and debt negotiators - is once more a focal point for deal-makers from the world's financial capitals. 'Boom Times]' shouted the headline in yesterday's conference newspaper. For some, however, the feeling is too reminiscent of the pre-debt crisis 1970s to be comfortable. At issue is how secure are the widely-praised pro-market economic reforms seen in the region in the last five years, and what are the priorities for the years ahead? While the experience from country to country is varied, there is no doubt that the extent of the reform has been greater and more sustained than would have been predicted a few years ago. A new generation of technocrat economists, represented in Hamburg by Mexico's finance minister Mr Pedro Aspe, Chile's Mr Alejandro Foxley and Argentina's Mr Domingo Cavallo, have put budgets in balance, opened their economies and moved to reform the structure of their economies. 'We have been seeing a lot of things that help efficiency,' one official from an international financial institution said yesterday, 'but we have not  -except for Chile - had a breakthrough in growth.' Chile, with the region's longest-standing economic reform programmes, grew at 10.4 per cent last year, and inflation fell to 12 per cent. But the largest economy - Brazil - shrank by 1 per cent. For the rest of the region, its average 4 per cent growth translates to less than 2 per cent per capita after population expansion: modest after the sharp falls in income during the 1980s. Brazil's economic performance, and the path of future reform, remains an important question, in spite of the government's espousal of orthodox rhetoric in confronting these problems. 'Would we talk about western Europe being in good shape if Germany was in a mess?' asked one official. But beyond Brazil, in two countries where reform is significantly more advanced - Mexico and Argentina - some basic economic questions are still to be answered. The main issue is the sustainability of widening current account deficits, presently being financed but perhaps with an excessive reliance on short-term volatile capital inflows. Beyond this, politicians are now addressing what Mr Angel Gurria, president of Bancomext, Mexico's export promotion bank, calls 'second and third derivative' economic reforms. He is talking about the privatisation of road-building and other infrastructure projects, as well as social security and pension reforms. Pension fund reform is important for two related reasons: it is seen as central in boosting domestic savings, thereby reducing the region's dependence on unreliable foreign capital. It also furthers the development of a domestic capital market, allowing businesses to raise funds locally. At the same time, some Latin American governments are starting to look seriously at questions of longer-term development - in particular improving primary and secondary education. Education is viewed as the single most important issue in raising the living standards of the poor and as critical in enhancing the region's attraction to international and domestic investors. Furthermore, the need to attain long-term stability in government finance, along with expanding social and educational programmes, will see the need for fundamental reform of the region's woefully inadequate systems of taxation. And that will require a change of mentality, most significantly among the region's elites who have long escaped the tax net. In the next two years most countries in the region will be electing new administrations. Given reasonable external conditions, there is little expectation among officials in Hamburg that this will herald a sharp reversal in economic policies. Until the new governments are in place, however, there will remain the question articulated by Mr Shaheed Husain, head of the World Bank's Latin American division: 'We still can't be sure that economic reform will survive its founding fathers.'</p>

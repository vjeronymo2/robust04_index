			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The San Diego Unified Port District has agreed to a request by the America's  Cup Organizing Committee to identify waterfront sites for 20 syndicates in a  1992 defense, pending a decision by the New York Court of Appeals on whether or  not the San Diego Yacht Club will keep the Cup.  </P> <P> The district also allocated $125,000 to start planning an international regatta  in May 1992.  </P> <P> By locating sites for syndicates from a record 15 countries expected to be  entered in America's Cup XXVIII, organizers say they'll be ready to meet the  rush for waterfront space if a New York appellate court ruling expected this  spring keeps the trophy with the San Diego Yacht Club.  </P> <P> The appeal by New Zealand's Mercury Bay Boating Club contends San Diego's  unprecedented America's Cup use of a catamaran defender to beat Michael Fay's  monohulled sloop off San Diego in 1988 was illegal under century-old rules of  competition.  </P> <P> A Feb. 8 hearing on the matter is scheduled before the New York Court of  Appeals, that state's highest court. A ruling is expected in March.  </P> <P> The ACOC said it has 14 solid and nine potential entries from challengers --  the difference being those that have paid the $25,000 fee.  </P> <P> ACOC officials requested the Port District study partly because of logistical  problem posed by the new International America's Cup Class yachts that will be  used in the next regatta.  </P> <P> Hulls of those 75-foot boats extend about 13 feet below the water. Most docks  in San Diego Bay are too shallow to accommodate IACC yachts, and those where  the water is deep enough are so far from Pacific Ocean race sites that it would  put those syndicates at a competitive disadvantage.  </P></p>

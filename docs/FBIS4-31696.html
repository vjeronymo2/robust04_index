			<p>BFN     [Text] The 440-megawatt second reactor at the Kozloduy  Nuclear Plant was restarted and connected to the country's grid.  It is expected that by the end of the day it will be  functioning at 50 percent of its capacity. The reactor was  switched off for three months, during which time it was repaired  and refueled. Three additional reactors are functioning at a  total capacity of 1,400 megawatt. The plant's fourth and fifth  reactors are being repaired.</p>

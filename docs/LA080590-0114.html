			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAW OF ECONOMICS PLAYS HAVOC WITH STATE'S MEDI-CAL PROGRAM  </P> <P> The editorial "Medi-Cal Rejection in County Shameful" (July 29) was too  simplistic in its presentation. You made it seem like it is the fault of  doctors and hospitals that there is inadequate health care for Medi-Cal  recipients in our county; yet, I have never heard you claim that it is the  fault of landlords and developers that we have homelessness.  </P> <P> The subject of Medi-Cal contracting with hospitals is complex and  non-intuitive. It may well be that Fountain Valley Regional Hospital will  continue to serve Medi-Cal patients at a higher reimbursement rate without a  Medi-Cal contract than with one.  </P> <P> I understand that the state planners have seriously considered canceling all  Medi-Cal contracts in Orange County so that each hospital will have to take its  share of Medi-Cal patients. Many of these hospitals will receive a higher  Medi-Cal rate without a contract than with one.  </P> <P> Another large Orange County hospital has just signed a Medi-Cal contract. The  medical staff at that hospital is concerned that a large number of Medi-Cal  recipients may inundate their facility once the word gets out about the  contract, creating another Fountain Valley situation.  </P> <P> The fact is that many physicians do treat Medi-Cal patients; we just do not  advertise the fact. Doctors are concerned that a reputation of accepting  Medi-Cal patients may have a negative impact on their colleagues and private  patients.  </P> <P> Today's problems of poverty, medical indigence and homelessness were not  created by the medical community, and these problems will not be solved by that  community alone.  </P> <P> DR. MARTIN J. ROSENFELD  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

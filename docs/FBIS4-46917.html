			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gennadiy Belotserkovskiy, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI </F> correspondent: "Contacts Are Not Turning Into Contracts"]    [Text] Rostov Oblast has developed regional programs  for economic restructuring. It is the beginning of their  implementation that is currently giving people there hope for  the future, however illusory that hopes may be.    One of the main programs pertains to conversion of the  defense industry, which comprises 6 percent of the oblast  economy. The administration made the right choice when it  entrusted creation of the program to the staff of the  defense-related Gradient All-Russian Scientific Research  Institute, whose director, V. Blokhin, became chairman of the  oblast committee on conversion. What eventually resulted was a  collection of specific business plans for which R5.3 billion  [rubles] in loans on favorable terms and R4.3 billion in  subsidies were allocated by the central government. The oblast  came up with another billion. According to estimates, within a  year those investments will yield R2.0 billion in profit, and  R2.6 billion within three years.    The region's unique location and the unique position of  Rostov itself as southern Russia's transportation hub, a point  where principal water, air and land transportation routes meet,  also dictates that the authorities devote priority attention to  the rapid development of those routes. All sorts of firms and  joint-stock companies are springing up like mushrooms along the  Don River, specializing in the creation of such programs and the  search for serious investors to finance them. One example is the  Port Petrovskiy Joint-Stock Company, which is intent on building  a modern seaport near Taganrog.    The administration realizes that the meager local budget  will  not be enough to solve every problem. Therefore they have  selected the most important ones, and then of those selected  those that can be accomplished. Investment priorities have been  established: the social realm, the agro-industrial complex,  physical infrastructure, and construction of housing for retired  military personnel. Incidentally, in one year the flow of  investment into non-production-related construction increased  from 26 to 32 percent. Housing completion increased by 4 percent.    But not everything is going so smoothly; some mistakes have  also been made. It is has proved virtually impossible to attract  foreign investors to the Don and get them to commit to major  investments. Administrators from the Don region are busily  traveling abroad and eagerly welcoming visitors, but contacts  are not turning into contracts. Many talks with foreigners are  for some reason being conducted quietly, in secret from local  business people, prompting objections from the latter and the  suspicion that there is some personal stake in this for the  officials, some of whom would not mind dabbling in international  business themselves. The Rostov Chamber of Trade and Industry,  established by major enterprises and banks (with the oblast  administration among its founders, incidentally) has for some  reason met with a cool reception from the oblast  administration's Foreign Economic Affairs Department, which  views it as an unnecessary competitor, though they should both  be pulling in the same direction. Incidentally, staff members of  the Foreign Economic Affairs Department are, in violation of the  "Statute on Federal State Service," also employed by the  Integratsiya Fund To Assist Foreign Economic Operations.    Incidentally, a commission of the President's monitoring  administration has studied the administration's foreign economic  activities in Rostov. Its conclusions were, one must assume,  serious, though for some reason they have not yet been revealed  to the local public. True, soon after the commission's departure  the head of the oblast administration signed Decree No. 93,  which was sharply critical of activities by the Foreign Economic  Affairs Department. Yevchenko was given until the end of May to  come up with a program.    Of course, the programs by which the oblast administration  is  managing the region are only a first step. But, as the ancients  said, if you do not know to which shore you are sailing, no wind  will seem fair to you.</p>

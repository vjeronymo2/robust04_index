			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GANGS FAIL TO SIDELINE GAME 2ND TIME AROUND  </P> <P> The pageantry of prep football returned to Nogales High School in La Puente  Friday night, in a sea of miniskirted cheerleaders, green-and-white pompons,  and a feather-capped marching band that played "New York, New York."  </P> <P> At the same time however, the occasional ugliness of the outside world made for  another kind of presence: Beefed-up school security officers at all entrances,  sheriff's deputies cruising side streets, and undercover guards combing the  stands.  </P> <P> Still, there was little sign of the jitters over gang violence that had forced  school officials to take the unprecedented step of canceling last Friday's  varsity football game.  </P> <P> "Alive and well," grinned Principal Ron Tyler, standing at the sidelines in a  green satin Nogales jacket as his team was trouncing the Baldwin Park Braves.  "It's just another Friday night game."  </P> <P> A satin-gowned color guard circled the field twirling silver flags to the roll  of a snare drum, chants for a touchdown were barked through white megaphones,  banners urging "defense, hold tight!" were stuck to the chain-link fence, and  the first dance of the fall was scheduled in the school gym after the game.  </P> <P> In fact, on the slightly cool autumn night illuminated by a half-moon. the  closest thing to danger for the Nogales Nobles was a stray punt that nearly hit  a cheerleader. "People are a little nervous," said Ilke deLeon, a 17-year-old  senior. "But we're not going to let the situation with gangs stop us from  having fun."  </P> <P> At least four West Covina police and sheriff's squad cars were assigned to the  area, and the number of Rowland Unified School District police armed with  flashlights and billy clubs was upped from a regular crew of 6 to 10.  </P> <P> "They're making a big deal out of nothing," said George Hunn, head of district  security. "I think we're four men over staffed."  </P> <P> The decision to cancel last Friday's game was made several hours before  kick-off, after a spate of gang-related shootings earlier that week, including  the slaying of a 16-year-old former Nogales student and a flurry of shots fired  at the Nogales marching band during a practice session Sept. 18 on the football  field.  </P> <P> "It was an obvious precaution but there's no paranoia here," said Dawn  Schlatter, 17, a senior and a band instructor 17. "I doubt the band was  targeted. We don't play that bad."  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies, however, were most concerned about an anonymous tip they  received indicating "there was going to be a shooting taking place at the  football game," said Capt. Mike Nagaoka, head of the sheriff's substation in  nearby Industry. "I think we had a responsibility to make the school aware."  </P> <P> Sharon Robison, superintendent of the 19,000-student school district, said she  was reluctant to give into criminal threats, but decided it was better to be  safe.  </P> <P> In the past, area high school games have been disrupted by fights or shootings.  </P> <P> Last year, about 20 rounds of gunfire ignited panic at Jack Robinson Stadium in  Los Angeles during a high school game. No one was injured. Three years earlier,  two people were wounded and at least six others injured in a stampede set off  by gunfire at a Monrovia High School game.  </P></p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / VAG to reduce staff further VAG (United Kingdom), the importer/distributor of Volkswagen and Audi vehicles, has introduced a voluntary redundancy and early retirement programme in order to make further reductions in the company's workforce of 780. The company has already cut its workforce by 38 per cent in the past three years from 1,250 in 1989. VAG, taken over by Volkswagen of Germany from Lonrho for Pounds 124m late last year, refused to specify any target for future job cuts. It said, however, that cost reduction programmes, including the possible contracting out of some operations, would continue for the next two to three years.</p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / A rather nasty British disease: Pride in one's country is fine. Jingoism is something else I HAVE spent most of the past week in Morocco. It was difficult to sleep, but I blame neither the heat nor the flies. I blame the Olympic Games. On the first day Khalid Skah, of Morocco, won the men's 10,000 metres race. All night there was a strange chanting, which I took to be a celebration. The next day Skah was disqualified, for reasons which were not altogether appreciated by the man in the casbah. So the quiet of the night was this time rent by peculiar ululations which I took to be the Arabic for 'we wuz robbed.' Then, on the third day, Khalid Skah rose from the dead. His disqualification was revoked. There followed another night of howling, this time accompanied by the beating of distant drums. In England, of course, we are above such primitive and pointless patriotism. We are above it because the newspapers and television do it for us, beating the drums which resonate in every home in the land. On my first day back in England, I turned to the BBC to watch what purported to be the highlights of that day's events in Barcelona. Virtually the entire programme was given over to an interview of stupifying banality with Sally Gunnell, the British winner of the women's 400m hurdles. The race was shown - I might have lost count - four times, once accompanied by music, giving it the full Chariots of Fire treatment. How much I would have preferred it if the BBC had delivered one programme of genuine highlights of the Olympics and then, for those of a more Moroccan disposition, a late-night programme consisting of Sally Gunnell's race replayed endlessly against a soundtrack of Land of Hope and Glory, God Save the Queen, I Vow to Thee My Country, Rule Britannia, and other suitable anthems. The following day, British runner Kriss Akabusi won the bronze medal in the men's 400m. This was an interesting piece of news for sports fans, but I cannot be alone in finding it odd that the BBC commentator noticed this fact before realising that the winner of the race, the American, Kevin Young, had broken the world record. I don't suppose the British media are biased uniquely in this respect. I am even prepared to believe that every country has an equally absurd concentration on its own athletes' performances, all ignoring completely the real pattern of success, achievement and failure at the Barcelona Games. Doubtless, we would laugh if we were able to tune into the television of a small African country and watch countless repeats of its man coming third in the steeplechase. But I find the British version of this disease upsetting, because it seems to me characteristic of a small or inconsequential country so starved of success that it exaggerates wildly and overplays even the most minor triumphs. In Britain's case, this minor state nationalism has been accompanied by an increasingly boorish attitude to opponents. There was a time when visiting foreign football teams were applauded at Wembley, partly out of courtesy. Nowadays, if a visiting team crushed England, as the Hungarians did in the 1950s, rather than simply marvel at the skill of the foreigners the UK press would demand that the English manager be sacked, as if anything less than perpetual victory was a national insult. The biggest danger is that Britons somehow take sporting success as symbolic, or even proof, of some great national virility - as, in our case, a triumph of Englishness over foreignness. The old communist regimes of eastern Europe understood the propaganda value of this very well. One reason why we in the west believed all the nonsense about the 'showpiece' East German economy was because we found it hard to imagine that a nation which could produce so much success on the sports track could be, at the same time, decadent, corrupt and redundant. There is nothing wrong at all with patriotism. Pride in one's country is an admirable sentiment and is often the well-spring of heroic acts of altruism, particularly in times of war. But the achievement of a plain Essex girl in leaping over hurdles at unbeatable pace tells us nothing about ourselves and nothing about our country. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kyrgyzstan's President Askar Akayev and China's  Premier Li Peng "are profoundly satisfied" with the level,  prospects, and pace of bilateral relations. This was declared  at a briefing in Bishkek on Saturday by Akayev's spokesman Iman  Rysaliev, who informed journalists about the talks between the  two leaders.    He noted "certain progress" reached in talks on disputed  territories between Kyrgyzstan and China. "President Akayev  believes that these issues will be settled in the spirit of  mutual understanding and cooperation," Rysaliev said.    He revealed that the situation in Tajikistan had been in  focus at the talks. In his words, Akayev believes that the  Tajik government and opposition should renounce hostility and  solve all problems by political means through negotiation. For  his part, Li Peng declared that China "treats with understanding  the difficulties, experienced by Tajikistan." He is convinced  that these difficulties must be overcome within the framework of  CIS. At the same time, he stressed the readiness of China as a  UN Security Council member to contribute to the adoption by the  world community "of appropriate steps toward solving the Tajik  problems."    In an exclusive interview with INTERFAX, Rysaliev reported  that during the talks, Akayev had welcomed the establishment of  proper relations between Russia and China. In Akayev's opinion,  a successful dialogue between these two countries "is a  guarantee of peace in Eurasia and a major factor of stability in  Central Asia."    He also voiced Kyrgyzstan's desire to foster relations with  Russia. In Rysaliev's words, "the president highly appreciates  the fact that China understands why Kyrgyzstan gives priority to  friendship with Russia and other CIS states."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 17 (YONHAP) -- South Korea will first  verify the exact meaning of North Korea's suggestions to former  U.S. President Jimmy Carter and consult with Washington before  deciding on future action, Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang  Ki-ho said Friday.    "They are all indications," Chang said at a press briefing  in  reaction to reports that North Korean leader Kim Il-song told  Carter he would let International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  inspectors remain in North Korea and was willing to keep  monitoring equipment in operation.    U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci issued a  statement from the White House after receiving a report from  Carter, suggesting that Washington may enter into the next round  of high-level dialogue with Pyongyang if these positive  indications are confirmed.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu talked with U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher three times Friday morning to discuss  Carter's report and consult on the wording of Gallucci's  statement, Chang said.    Noting North Korea's desire to resolve the nuclear crisis,  Gallucci said the Stalinist nation's suggestions would indeed be  constructive "if it means that North Korea is also committed to  freezing the major elements of its nuclear program while new  talks took place -- that is, not refueling the reactor or  reprocessing the spent fuel it has just removed and permitting  the IAEA to maintain the continuity of safeguards."    "The government plans to continue to pursue negotiations on  the sanctions resolution at the United Nations," Chang said.    "We will be briefed by Carter tomorrow on the results of his  North Korean visit. We will decide what to do after  consultations with the U.S. side," the spokesman noted.</p>

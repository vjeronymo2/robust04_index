			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Brussels closes off a multimedia gateway: Technology may be running streets ahead but Germany's MSG venture finds a dead-end A tough application of European competition law led yesterday to the blocking of a pay-television joint venture between two German media companies, Bertelsmann and the Kirch group, and the state telephone monopoly  -as the Brussels Commission moved to to prevent what it saw as a potential distortion of three markets. But if the decision looked good for competition, it raised questions about the development of multimedia in Europe, and whether the Commission was trying to control an essentially uncontrollable and speedily evolving industry. For the Commission, the decision was clear-cut. 'If you have big players dominating the gateway to a market, then you have to intervene,' said a Commission official yesterday. 'We have to ensure that no one shuts off the potential for new players coming in.' Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, said Brussels blocked the deal because it considered, after discussions with more than 100 companies and industry bodies, that the proposed concentration was likely to create or reinforce a dominant position in three separate markets. First, Bertelsmann and Kirch would dominate the market for pay-television services, distinct from traditional television, as it is mainly financed by subscribers. The market is a potential pot of gold since from next year, digitalisation is expected to lead to an explosion in the number of pay-TV programmes. Second, MSG - as the proposed merger was known - would have dominated the market for the technological services associated with pay-TV operators, limiting if not preventing the entry of competitors. These services include the provision of decoders, leased to subscribers to unscramble those services for which they have paid. They also include 'access control systems' which enable operators to restrict pay-TV channel reception to subscribers. Third, the Commission argued that the merger would have allowed Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, the state telephone monopoly, to reinforce its dominant position in the market for cable network services. Mr Rolf-Dieter Leister, chairman of Deutsche Telekom's supervisory board, reacted by saying he considered the decision a blow for the German pay-television market. 'We want to get a market moving which hardly exists in Germany and Europe, otherwise this technology will be introduced in Germany much later.' Industry analysts agreed that outdated competition and ownership rules, as applied by national governments and the Commission, could hinder the development of an industry where technology is running streets ahead of government thinking. 'The message to industry from this decision is that here is yet another thing which is going to delay the generation of revenue from the digital superhighway,' said Mr John Scaife, media consultant at Charon Capital in London. The key to development, argues Mr Scaife, is the combination of delivery networks together with ownership of programmes and films. Such a combination would allow companies to package services to customers, offering them, for example, both telephone and television services to justify the price of subscription. Yesterday, the Commission was adamant. 'Telekom owns most of the cable network in Germany and controls its development,' it said. 'It also controls the return channels necessary for interactive services, and has direct access to more than 4m cabled households; Bertelsmann and Kirch already have Premiere and own incomparable programme resources; moreover, Bertelsmann is a major operator of book clubs.' 'No competitor has such advantages nor could reasonably enter the MSG market,' it concluded. Last-minute concessions offered by the merging parties were not accepted by the Commission. These included development of a system whereby competitors could have used the decoders, and an undertaking not to discriminate against other pay-TV operators when it came to renting contracts for decoders, and use of commercial information. 'These undertakings are in fact a mere declaration of intent not to abuse a dominant position on the market for administrative and technical services to the detriment of competitors,' said the Commission. Lastly, MSG undertook to develop the digital cable network to ensure that there was no shortage of transmission capacity. This too was rejected by the Commission, as too difficult to check and already linked to the regulatory obligations imposed on Telekom. With the development of digital TV technology set to transform television services over the next few years, the Commission is likely to have to consider other complicated multimedia cases. But as the technology changes and evolves, consideration may need to be given on how best to apply competition rules.</p>

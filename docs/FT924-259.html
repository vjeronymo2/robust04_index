			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / International Company News: Upjohn to restate results following Dollars 224m charge UPJOHN, the US pharma-ceuticals group, said it would take a Dollars 224m after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 1992 to adopt new accounting standards for retiree healthcare benefits, Reuter reports. The company said the charge, which amounts to Dollars 1.26 a share, would be effective January 1 1992, and the previous quarterly results would be restated. Upjohn said the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rule number 106 would result in a one-time transition obligation of Dollars 378m, or Dollars 237m after tax. The charge will be partially offset by a one-time gain of Dollars 13m, or 7 cents a share, for adoption of FASB 109, which allows US companies to change the way they account for income taxes. The adjustment wipes out more than half of Upjohn's earnings for the first nine months of the year. Upjohn reported a net profit of Dollars 411.47m for the year to September 30, up from Dollars 401m in the same period last year. The company is due to report its 1992 financial results in February.</p>

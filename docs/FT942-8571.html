			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Hungarian rescue costs WestLB DM32m Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB), the German bank, said yesterday its investment in WestLB Hungaria had grown to DM72m (Dollars 42.3m) because of the cost of bailing out its troubled Budapest-based subsidiary. In addition to the DM40m purchase price paid in 1992, WestLB injected DM32m into the bank in December, diluting minority shareholders and lifting WestLB's stake to 96 per cent from 60 per cent. This was necessary because provisioning for bad loans and investments dragged WestLB Hungaria to a loss of Ft1.89bn (Dollars 19m) in 1993 and left its capital adequacy well below the Ft1bn minimum set by Hungarian regulators. Mr Dieter Falke, board member of the Dusseldorf-based regional bank, denied the investment in the bank was a mistake: 'We undoubtedly came two years earlier than we should have.' WestLB blamed last year's results on the hangover from its Hungarian unit's earlier incarnation as Altalanos Vallalkozasi Bank (AVB), a joint venture bank in which WestLB took a minority stake in 1992. Hungary's state banking supervisor closed down AVB on discovering the bank was unstable. WestLB rescued AVB, changed the bank's name and is turning it into a subsidiary.</p>

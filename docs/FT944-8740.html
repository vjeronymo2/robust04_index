			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: No power to block the poll tax Sir, In his interesting review of Failure in British Government: The Politics of the Poll Tax (November 17), my former cabinet colleague, Kenneth Baker, writes: 'The Treasury was not helpful: Nigel Lawson, then chancellor, opposed the poll tax but was not prepared to block it.' As I recount in my memoirs, I did everything I could to stop the poll tax. However, the novel constitutional doctrine that chancellors have it in their power to 'block' a proposal which has the enthusiastic backing of the prime minister, supported by an overwhelming majority of his or her cabinet colleagues, is (perhaps regrettably) un-founded. Lawson, House of Lords, Westminster, London SW1</p>

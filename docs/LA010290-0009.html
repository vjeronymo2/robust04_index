			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALVADORAN WITNESS  </P> <P> The Times editorial on Dec. 15 ("Will Peace Be Given A Chance?") suggested that  if two fundamentally important points agreed to at the Central American  Presidents summit were honored, "this could go a long way toward ending the  civil war in El Salvador and the Contra war in Nicaragua." The two points are:  (1) that he FMLN rebels resume negotiations with Salvadoran President  Cristiani, and (2) that the U.S. stop supporting the Contras and instead devote  its aid to disbanding them.  </P> <P> In the case of the Salvadoran war, however, resumption of negotiations would  only put the parties back on square one, where they were before the rebel  military offensive started last month. In the negotiations taking place shortly  before the offensive began, the Salvadoran government negotiators refused to  accept any proposals for changes oriented toward democratization, economic  reform, greater social justice, or an end to repression. Instead the government  launched a series of attacks against churches, peace and human rights groups,  labor unions, the university, and other elements of the popular movement.  </P> <P> As long as the tiny, wealthy Salvadoran oligarchy and the military refuse to  change the grossly unequal, unjust socioeconomic system and refuse to end the  barbaric repression with which they maintain the system, the Salvadoran civil  war will continue. And as long as the U.S. continues to send massive amounts of  economic and military aid to maintain the Salvadoran system, the oligarchy and  the military will cling to their wealth and power and refuse to make  concessions or to permit reforms.  </P> <P> SHIRLEY CERESETO  </P> <P> Executive Secretary  </P> <P> Orange County Committee  </P> <P> on Central America  </P></p>

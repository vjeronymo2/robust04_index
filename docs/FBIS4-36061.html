			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Mohammad Attar] </F>   [Excerpts] Aden, Yemen, June 5 (AFP) -- Northern warplanes  on Sunday [5 June] blew up an oil storage tank at the refinery  in the southern stronghold of Aden as Yemen's civil war entered  its second month, a southern military spokesman said.    The spokesman said a fire "broke out in a fuel storage tank  at the refinery," about 10 kilometers (six miles) from here and  the main source of fuel for southern troops loyal to 'Ali Salim  al-Bid.    It refines some 140,000 barrels of crude per day.    Anti-aircraft fire shot down one of the warplanes but the  others escaped, the spokesman said.    Witnesses meanwhile said the north fired two  surface-to-surface missiles at Aden overnight, but the southern  city's air defenses shot one out of the sky over an uninhabited  area and the other plunged harmlessly into the sea.    And a northern military spokesman in Sanaa said southern  forces fired two Scud missiles at residential areas of the  northern city of Ta'izz but both were "intercepted" without  causing casualties.    Both sides accused the other of cowardice in the attacks.    A southern spokesman said the raid on the refinery was a  "flagrant challenge to the will of the international community,"  referring to a UN resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire  in the month-old war.    But the north also called the attack on Ta'izz, about 156  kilometers (90 miles) northwest of the southern stronghold of  Aden, "a violation" of the resolution.    Neither side in the war which has pitted rival north and  south troops since May 5 has respected the ceasefire call  adopted Wednesday by the UN Security Council.    Heavy artillery fire continued throughout Saturday evening  north of Aden as southern forces fought to hold back an  offensive by northern troops of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih.    The northern forces were reported Friday to be only 15  kilometers (nine miles) from Aden where al-Bid, the country's  former vice- president, proclaimed an independent state on May  21 after a failed four-year union.    Southern soldiers have launched a counter-offensive to  retake  the town of Lahij about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Aden,  according to soldiers near the front.    A southern spokesman said "several members of the Jihad"  Moslem fundamentalist organisation which backs Salih had been  captured at Kharaz.    'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, appointed vice president of the  breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic, told AFP that his forces  might call for Saudi military support in battling northern  troops.    He said southern leaders had "not yet decided", but added  that "everything is possible and legitimate to protect our  people." Southern forces are outnumbered by those of the north.  [passage omitted]    Gulf Arab states met Sunday in Abha, southwest Saudi Arabia,  to debate the Yemeni conflict after Saudi Foreign Minister  Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal warned that the Gulf Cooperation Council  (GCC) could intervene if the fighting continued.    Five foreign ministers from the six-member council attended  the talks after Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jabir  Al Thani returned home suffering from an illness, sources said.    The south's appointed prime minister Haydar Abu-Bakr  al-'Attas met in Jeddah Saturday with Saudi Defense Minister  Prince Sultan Ibn-'Abd-al-'Aziz, the Saudi Press Agency said  without giving details.    Al-'Attas is expected Sunday in Cairo for more talks on the  conflict.</p>

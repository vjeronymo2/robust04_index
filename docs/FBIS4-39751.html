			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [RIA report under the "In Brief" rubric] </F>   [Text] Moscow -- An initiative group has been created in  the State Duma to formulate a law on compensation of Savings  Bank deposits made by the population before the freeing of  prices in January 1992. Grigoriy Bondarev, a "Yabloko" faction  deputy and one of those who first formed the idea for the future  law, has said the possibility of compensation in stocks,  enterprises, apartments, and even service facilities up for  privatization, rather than in money, is being considered.  Well-known jurists from the Moscow Private Law Center have been  asked to draft the law. Bondarev said, however, that the 70  million affected depositors "should not celebrate victory yet."  According to him, the idea for such compensation is being  worked on at the State Committee for the Management of State  Property but "with no special enthusiasm."</p>

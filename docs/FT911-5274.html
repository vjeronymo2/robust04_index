			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Threat to finance for exhibition centre expansion NEGOTIATIONS to attract private capital to help finance a Pounds 115m expansion of the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham are on the verge of failure. Birmingham City Council, the owner of what is the UK's largest purpose-built facility for trade fairs, will seek to persuade the Department of the Environment to relax financing restraints to enable the expansion to take place. Previous expansions have been financed by council-guaranteed borrowings. Whitehall's refusal to allow a similar course for an extension of the trade fair facilities from the existing 125,000 sq metres to 155,000 sq metres led to the search for private capital. The management company of the National Exhibition Centre has been talking with an unnamed group of trade exhibition organisers and building contractors for almost a year over terms for a joint venture on the planned new extension. The talks have reached the stage where the private-sector companies either have to accept what is on offer or reject it. A final meeting between the management company and the private-sector companies will take place within a month, said Mr Terence Golding, NEC chief executive. It is clear that the terms for private-sector involvement are not acceptable to the companies. 'This is not the right climate to plan a long-term investment, a property-based investment,' Mr Golding said. 'We never thought it would be easy to persuade the private sector to invest in the NEC - there are too many other investment vehicles.' The council will attempt to persuade the Department of the Environment to approve an alternative means of funding the expansion or enable loans to be raised pending a disposal of part of the asset to the private sector when the economy recovers. The city council will argue that because the NEC is a UK, rather than a local, asset the constraints on local-authority borrowing should be lifted. The council will emphasise that since the early 1980s the NEC has not only serviced its loans but has also made a contribution to the city's general rate fund. It will argue that constraints on local-authority borrowing are selectively applied. For example, Manchester airport's second terminal will be financed with council loans.</p>

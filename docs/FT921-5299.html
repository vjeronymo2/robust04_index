			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Jordan suspends call-up Jordan, still officially at war with Israel, yesterday announced plans to suspend compulsory military service to try to help forge a more cost-effective, modern army, Reuter reports from Amman. Mr Sharif Zeid bin Shaker, the prime minister, asked the lower house of parliament to give the government authorisation both to stop the two-year draft programme and to reactivate it when needed. The 80-seat house is likely to endorse the plan on Sunday. The small army, a major source of King Hussein's power, is widely respected as a disciplined, well-trained force. Bin Shaker said lessons drawn from the Gulf war last year showed career soldiers performed much better than conscripts.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Erik Kotlyar report on news conference given by V.F. Yerin, </F> minister of internal affairs; place and date not given: "The  Growth of Crime Can Be Stopped If All Forces in Society Get  Involved in Fighting It, Believes V.F. Yerin, Minister of  Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation"]    [Text] The minister informed journalists about this at a  news conference, adding that a reduction in the rate of growth  of crime last year was successfully achieved through collective  efforts, although the exceptional role of the functionaries of  the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] organization and the  militia cannot be diminished. In essence, they are waging, in  peacetime, a real war on the escalation of violations of the law  which is invisible to the eye of a common citizen.    At present, the signs of crime can be seen in the increased  number of serious crimes: murder, robbery, and criminal  violations in the economic area. All of this is very alarming.  The minister thinks that being better informed about the actions  of the militia is necessary so that the faith of the people of  Russia in the possibility of defeating the criminal underworld  will be reinforced. To this end, law enforcement organs must  strengthen contacts with the journalist corps. The examples  given suggest that objective publications that are beneficial  immediately receive practical evaluation through the actions of  MVD organs. On the contrary, unconscientious pen-pushers not  only misinform the mass reader in so-called "made-to-order"  pieces but also clearly play into the hands of those who are on  the wrong side of the law. Until recently the authors got away  with such information, whereas now, in an aggravated situation  bordering on an emergency in terms of tension, special attention  will be paid to such opuses.    A report to the people of Russia that was published in the  press is an example of open information on the operations of the  internal affairs organs. In the opinion of V. Yerin, this is the  continuation of a tradition started by V. Bakatin in his time.  The excessive atmosphere of secrecy in which the MVD  organization was continuously shrouded is alien in spirit to a  genuine democracy.    The minister sees hopeful prospects for rooting out the  criminal flaws of our reality in the provisions of the Federal  Program for Crime Control in 1994-1995. As V. Yerin admits, he  is not particularly fond of directive documents; in solving  practical tasks, he sees the benefit of primarily practical  actions. However, the advantage of the newly developed program,  and its specific distinction from related directives, edicts,  and decrees, is that it is based on a set of specific endeavors  which are truly capable of bringing an end to the exuberant  bloom of evil anomalies in the life of our society.    First of all, the financial support program is realistic.  All  ministries and departments participated in its development, and  each of them is financially responsible for a portion. The state  budget accounts for just about 2 trillion rubles [R], which did  not make the Ministry of Finance tremble. In particular, the  program comprehensively embraces measures to eliminate the  obstacles into which the organs applying the law usually run.  Consider, for example, illegal trafficking in weapons. The  program requires that functionaries of the MVD organs and  militia employees verify in detail the "biography" of each  firearm from the fitter's bench where it was made to the  criminal shot fired. Since the process of inquest and subsequent  investigation is on occasion incomplete because of the absence  of exhaustive data on the instance of violation of law, the  Federal Program calls for creating specialized bureaus for  debriefing people who for various reasons are not capable of  making an important report on their own. Of course, the program  pays much attention to the methods for combating corruption and  organized crime. However, in this instance everything will  depend on laws which deputies at various levels will pass soon  or will not pass for a long time to come.    In the words of the minister, it is also important that the  program takes into account social protection for marginal  populations--the cadre reserve of career criminals. The program  also has a point on support for the victims of criminal actions.  Notably, communications between the militia and the population  on the principle of a fire alarm call will finally be put in  order. In general, this means restoring justice: After all, we  remember well how prompt the response of the 02 service was in  recent times.... It is a pity that we again have to restore  things that operated without fail in the past. The minister  asked journalists to refrain from excessive emotions--the MVD is  flexing and will flex its muscles in the future, although this  is not to say that these muscles can be used contrary to the  law. The MVD is first of all an organ applying the law whose  actions are strictly based on upholding the law.    There are many skilled and well-versed criminal  investigators  within the organization of the MVD, although, in the words of V.  Yerin, there has been a certain slump in their work. The young  directorates for combating organized crime drew praise from the  minister, whereas the former Department for Combating Theft of  Socialist Property, which is currently an organ for combating  economic crime, was rebuked for being slow to adjust to the new  situation.    A question by a correspondent from Baku concerning  cooperation between the Russian Federation MVD and the law  enforcement organs of nearby foreign countries drew a  categorical response from V. Yerin: Foreigners not protected by  diplomatic immunity incur criminal liability under the laws of  Russia, especially when such violations of the law as illegal  importation of drugs to the territory of Russia are committed.  It appeared that the man from Baku took offense, although he  should be taking offense at his countrymen who have turned the  markets of Moscow into a drug market!    The minister answered a question by the leader of the Pamyat  Society, D. Vasilyev, on the attitude of the MVD toward various  political groups: If it occurs to Pamyat or another entity of  any political hue to create their own armed units, the MVD will  immediately use all lawful sanctions against them. At the same  time, V. Yerin agreed that D. Vasilyev's remark about the  inadequate cultural standard of the actions and professional  training of individual militia functionaries was quite  legitimate. One would think that D. Vasilyev's well-meaning wish  that the guardians of the law would behave better will be taken  under advisement. In response to a question put by our  newspaper--is it not high time to begin patrolling the  streets?--the minister stated that he is prepared to take the  harshest criticism but, in his opinion, young soldiers who have  not seen action cannot be placed in areas where bullets fly.  Apparently, this is a more suitable role for pedestrians, who  have every right to defend themselves.... Some information media  were reprimanded for exaggerating the role of the "Russian  mafia" abroad. Information on opening up a direct channel for  police communication between Russia and Germany sounded  sensational.    In his concluding remarks V. Yerin praised Mayor of Moscow  Yu. Luzhkov for the proper interpretation of the tasks of the  militia and the allocation of official housing and monetary and  technical resources for the city militia.    Well, it is possible that new times will begin in Russia, if  everything that was mentioned at the press conference is indeed  implemented.</p>

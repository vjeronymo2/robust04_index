			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Economic Watch: Norway's deficit below forecast Norway's budget deficit could fall below NKr30bn (Pounds 2.82bn) in 1995 if prices for the country's North Sea oil remain strong, the Finance Ministry said. For the current year it said the deficit would be less than NKr40bn, compared to a forecast of NKr42.5bn. Norway, Europe's biggest oil producer, produced a record 2.67m barrels per day in June. The Labour government has forecast a 1994 oil price of NKr110 a barrel. Car sales in Spain rose 16.6 per cent to 101,748 in July compared with 87,247 in the same month last year, the national carmakers' association said. The increase in the first seven months was 18.9 per cent, but the total of 555,599 was still far less than the 646,570 registered in the same period of 1992 and 8.1 per cent below the average for the previous five years. A seasonally adjusted 4,917 French companies failed in January, 0.1 per cent more than the 4,866 judged bankrupt in December, Insee, the national statistics office, said. However the number of companies failing in the three months from November 1993 to January 1994 was 1.5 per cent down on the same period a year earlier.</p>

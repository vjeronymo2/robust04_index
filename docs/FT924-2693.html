			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Consumer retail spending stays steady RETAIL spending during the run-up to Christmas is showing more stability than last year, according to Transax, the Birmingham-based cheque guarantee organisation. Last Saturday, retailers requested Transax to guarantee more than 27,400 personal cheques - 0.5 per cent more than the previous Saturday. In the corresponding two Saturdays last year, there was a decline of 6.6 per cent in the number of cheque guarantee requests, with trading picking up only in the last weekend before Christmas, Transax reported. The fact that cheque payments in shops have not fallen away this year offers a further indication that consumer confidence may be slowly reviving. It follows official figures this week showing a slight increase in the amount of net consumer debt during October. Transax provides a cheque guarantee service to about 23,000 shops and stores. Retailers, offered a cheque by a customer for a sum greater than that specified on the cheque card, seek authorisation to accept it from Transax. Once Transax gives that authorisation, it guarantees full payment to the retailer even if the cheque bounces. The volume of calls from retailers over the last two Saturdays suggested that, in comparison with last year, trade has been higher in jewellery stores, off-linences and wine merchants.</p>

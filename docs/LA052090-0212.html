			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'HOUSE-MACHINE' AT HOME ON SOUTHLAND'S HILLSIDES  </P> <P> "If we eliminate from our hearts and minds all dead concepts in regard to the  houses and look at the question from a critical and objective point of view, we  shall arrive at the 'House-Machine' . . . beautiful in the way that the working  tools and instruments which accompany our existence are beautiful."  </P> <P> With this famous statement, included in his 1923 book "Towards a New  Architecture," the Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier sounded the rallying cry  of a radically new manner of design that came to be called the International  Style.  </P> <P> The International Style, also known as Modernism, was a deliberate and total  break with the traditional fashions in house design -- such as the local  preference for Craftsman bungalows or Spanish Colonial Revival styles -- that  prevailed in the 1920s.  </P> <P> Despite its austere ideology, its penchant for plain flat roofs, large glass  windows, Cubist white stucco shapes and open floor plans, the International  Style was soon adapted to a more livable mode to suit Southern California's  easy climate and relaxed folkways.  </P> <P> Modernism was introduced to Los Angeles and adapted to its ambience by Richard  Neutra and Rudolph Schindler, two gifted emigre Viennese architects. Schindler  built Los Angeles' first purely Modern house in 1922 on Kings Road in what is  now West Hollywood.  </P> <P> A series of low pavilions intimately linked to outdoor spaces through glass  walls, the design of the Kings Road house fused the garden with interior rooms  in a manner that became a major characteristic of the Southland version of the  International Style.  </P> <P> For a time the Schindler and Neutra families shared the Kings Road house, which  became a meeting place for a generation of young Angeleno architects such as  Gregory Ain, Harwell Harris and Raphael Soriano, who would further gentle the  Modernist severity to our topography.  </P> <P> Neutra's own early 1930s house in Silver Lake, sponsored as a research project  by the Dutch industrialist C. H. Van der Leeuw, embodied many of the standard  characteristics of the style.  </P> <P> A two-story oblong in white stucco with ribbon windows, the VDL House, as it  was known, had an open plan and a rooftop solarium. A sleeping porch  overlooking Silver Lake reservoir opened off the living room.  </P> <P> Both Neutra and Schindler designed landmark International Style houses for  Philip and Leah Lovell, a Los Angeles physician and his wife, who were  prototypical Californian health faddists and political radicals.  </P> <P> Schindler designed a beach house for the Lovells at Newport Beach in 1926;  Neutra finished a house for the Lovells in the hills overlooking the Silver  Lake reservoir in 1929.  </P> <P> Neutra's Lovell House exemplified another Californian characteristic of the  International Style -- a fondness for dramatic sites, often on a steep slope.  </P> <P> The 1937 Ernst House, designed by Gregory Ain in the Ferndell section of Los  Feliz, is a fine example of dramatic siting. Perched on the edge of a ravine,  the house is a Cubist composition of flat, off-white stucco and wraparound  glazing with spectacular long views toward downtown.  </P> <P> Owner Bob Tollefson, who bought the house in 1963, said he is an unexpected  convert to the International Style.  </P> <P> "My wife, Donna, and I were looking for a Spanish house, but as soon as we  walked through the front door we were dazzled by the simplicity and openness of  the spaces here," he said.  </P> <P> Like many Modernist houses set on slopes, the Ernst House inverts the living  room and bedroom levels. The bedrooms are below the living room, which is  entered off the street level.  </P> <P> All of the main rooms share vistas opened up through floor-to-ceiling corner  windows that make the landscape seem part of the house's interior.  </P> <P> The simplified details, built-in closets and flush surfaces typical of the  style reinforce Le Corbusier's notion of a house as a "machine for living in."  </P> <P> Following this mechanistic metaphor, the movable furniture found in  International Style houses was often restricted to the barest minimum -- so  much so that there's a feeling in many Modernist homes that if the architects  had had their way, the clean-limbed rooms would be free of all objects and the  occupants would sit cross-legged on the floor.  </P> <P> All the purists permitted might be a solemn array of Mies van der Rohe's famous  chrome steel-and-black-leather Barcelona chairs, or maybe a laminated bentwood  chaise designed by Finland's Alvar Aalto. These carefully placed pieces could  be accompanied by Marcel Breuer's elegant cantilevered tubular metal chairs  arranged around a Le Corbusier dining table made of plate glass floating on a  light steel frame.  </P> <P> The decor might permit a painting by the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian, whose  abstract geometric canvases were much favored by International Style  architects.  </P> <P> In the 1920s and '30s, the dictum of "form follows function" -- coined by  turn-of-the-century Chicago architect Louis Sullivan -- became the slogan of a  movement in Europe and the United States that expressed a visionary faith in  the beauty of machines as an ideal of social and aesthetic perfection free of  fake historical nostalgia.  </P> <P> The name International Style was coined at a landmark 1932 exhibition of modern  architecture at New York's Museum of Modern Art that introduced Modernism to  the United States, barely a year before Adolf Hitler closed the famous Bauhaus  School in Dessau, Germany, and its most influential teachers were forced to  flee to America.  </P> <P> In 1945, John Entenza, editor of the Los Angeles-based Arts &amp; Architecture  magazine, sponsored a Case Study House program that experimented with an  evolution of the International Style in Southern California.  </P> <P> Twenty-six Case Study houses designed by local Modernists -- including Charles  Eames, Raphael Soriano, Craig Ellwood, Quincy Jones and Neutra -- epitomized  the International Style at the height of its post-World War II popularity  through the 1950s and early '60s.  </P> <P> Case Study House No. 22 in the Lookout Mountain area of Los Angeles, designed  by Pierre Koenig in 1959, is one of the program's most dramatic residences.  </P> <P> A light steel I-beam frame supports a deeply cantilevered roof plane covering  an L-shaped plan wrapped around a pool on the edge of a precipice. The living  room, with floor-to-ceiling glass on three sides, offers spectacular nighttime  views over the lights of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> After the Case Study House program petered out, several International Style  architects continued to design in the Modernist manner.  </P> <P> Soriano and Ellwood persisted with the purity of Modernism's expression for  another decade, while others, including Neutra, began to play around with less  hard-edged materials such as wood and natural stone, and with more romantic  plan forms.  </P> <P> Modernist maverick John Lautner elaborated Modernism's rectangular geometries  with the dramatic addition of swirling circles and lush curves in a series of  striking houses that continues to this day.  </P> <P> In the 1950s, a fourth generation of local Modernists further domesticated the  International Style to Southern Californian conditions.  </P> <P> Ray Kappe, Calvin Straub, Douglas Honnold, Rex Lotery, Bernard Zimmerman, James  Pulliam, Thornton Abell, Quincy Jones, Whitney Smith, Ed Killingsworth, Carl  Maston and many others developed the simple post-and-beam Modernism first seen  in Schindler's Kings Road house into a series of sophisticated and humane  homes.  </P> <P> But the International Style's severe abstractions, much admired by avant-garde  architects and a few adventurous patrons, never really caught on with the  public. No tract developer ever adopted Modernism for the mass market.  </P> <P> These machines-for-living-in may have elevated the occupants' sense of living  on the cutting edge of innovation, but they offered little comfort to the body  or the soul.  </P> <P> In an International Style house there are no gloomy corners or "unhealthy"  nooks and crannies where curious cobwebs or compelling dark thoughts might  lurk.  </P> <P> Yet even in our comfort-seeking, historically nostalgic Postmodernist times,  the ghost of the International Style will not die. The abstract purity of  Modernism appeals to many designers by comparison with the convoluted, often  sentimental gestures of the fashions that have followed the International  Style.  </P> <P> The image of Le Corbusier's classic 1931 Villa Savoye at Poissy, France, haunts  the imagination of contemporary architects.  </P> <P> A stark white stucco cube topped by Platonic cylinders, floating clear of its  greensward on slender columns, the Villa Savoye stands as a superb and enduring  icon of Le Corbusier's credo that, "starting from conditions more or less  utilitarian, you have aroused my emotions; this is architecture."  </P> <P> RECOGNIZING AN INTERNATIONAL-STYLE HOUSE  </P> <P> A preference for horizontal, rectangular, flat-roofed shapes composed of white  stucco and large areas of glass.  </P> <P> Frequent dramatic siting on hillsides.  </P> <P> Open interior floor plans with a minimum of internal divisions and an emphasis  on clean lines, with most furniture built in.  </P> <P> Fusion of indoor and outdoor spaces through sliding-glass walls.  </P> <P> Smooth surfaces, with an absence of purely decorative details inside or out and  free of color, except for a very occasional use of primary reds, yellows or  blues.  </P></p>

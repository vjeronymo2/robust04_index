			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Survey results reported by Professor O. Mushtuk, head of </F> the Political Sociology Department of the Moscow Institute of  Economic Statistics and director of the Institute of Political  Management of the the Moscow International University of  Business and Information Technologies: "Business: A Group  Portrait Against the Background of Politics"]    [Text] Among the mysterious strangers who have suddenly  appeared in society as a result of Russia's movement toward the  market, perhaps the most unfamiliar and mysterious is the  class of Russian entrepreneurs. Because of the almost  complete absence of reliable information on the entire range of  "specific" characteristics of this class, it is more likely to  be perceived by many Russians with a "minus" sign rather than a  "plus": if one is not a "highway robber," then he is not "one  involved in hard work."    This perception is far from wrong all the time. However, it  can hardly be considered a mirror image, that is, an objective  reflection of reality. It should be taken into account that in  the exceptionally complex and agonizing processes of "class  formation" and "class creation," it is not always what comes to  the surface and is apparent to the naked eye that represents the  deep-seated essence of a phenomenon. In order to establish a  really true picture of what is taking place, painstaking work  with "reality"--that is, serious scientific research work by  sociologists, political scientists, and psychologists who are  engaged in applied science in the very midst of the  entrepreneurial class--is required.    The Center for Political Research attached to the Institute  of Political Management of the Moscow International University  of Business and Information Sciences [MMUBiIT] conducted a  survey of students in a special department of the institute in  February. These are young Moscow entrepreneurs (average age 30  to 35) who work in the finance field and are studying the  "subtleties" of market economics in time "outside their  principal employment"; they are clearly aware that their future  (and the future of Russia's entire entrepreneurial class,  incidentally) depends primarily on knowledge. The 33 respondents  were given a questionnaire with testing elements in the  questions integrated with the problem of relationships between  business and politics.    Question: Which of the three definitions of  politics is closest to reality in Russia? (A.  Politics is a method of producing legal orders and directions  for society; B. Politics is the struggle for power  and competition among individuals and groups in the distribution  of rewards and benefits within society; C. Politics  is the art of living together, the art of unifying a large  number of people.)    Results of the answers (A-0, B-30, C-3) speak for  themselves: the overwhelming majority of respondents perceive  politics not as socially useful management, but solely as  an arena of struggle for power and access to "the state feeding  trough." There is no need to demonstrate that in Russia,  where property and power continue to be intertwined with each  other, this is really the predominant aspect of politics.    Question: Which of the three statements impresses  you the most? (A. When the authorities become  involved in economics, it is bad; B. Any state  intervention in economic life is useful to the extent that its  harm is recognized; C. The state's regulatory  intervention in the economy is a necessary condition for its  balanced development.)    Results of the answers (A-4, B-7, C-22) reflect  the realization that a market economy cannot exist in  Russia without the appropriate state support. Removal of  the state from this sphere entirely is no more than social  utopia.    Question: Is the solution of most of the problems  related to the public's survival a priority function of the  state? (A. Unquestionably; B. To a certain  extent; C. No.)    Results of the answers (A-6, B-23, C-3, and  undecided-1) indicate the predominance of those who  advocate a socially oriented model for the market, within  the framework of which the state provides for a certain  guaranteed level at which the public's needs are met for the  services of public health, education, housing, and so forth and  provides for social protection of the poor and unfortunate.    Question: What obligations with respect to  business should be assumed by the Russian State, in your opinion?    The answers received make it possible to establish three  basic groups of such commitments:    --provision for the personal safety of entrepreneurs and  protection from mafia structures, racketeering, and extortion by  officials;    --reasonable taxation which stimulates entrepreneurial  activity; and    --legal support for entrepreneurial activity and improvement  and strict observance of the laws.    Question: Do you agree with the statement "A free  market has many advantages, but they do not include fairness"  (AFL-CIO President L. Kirkland)? (A.I fully agree;  B. I agree in part; C. I do not agree.)    Results of the answers (A-9, B-19, C-4, and  undecided-1) indicate that the majority of respondents are not  afflicted with the "market romanticism" syndrome (such as:"give  complete freedom to business, and order and fairness will be  established automatically in society"). Most of the  respondents realize that entreprenuerial activity needs a  definite system of checks and restrictions (primarily  legal), so that those with economic power do not cross over the  line beyond which private interest conflicts with the public  interest.    Question: Define the ideological orientation of  the author of the following quotation: "The task of an  enterprise is to produce for consumption, not for easy profit or  speculation. Speculation with finished products has nothing in  common with business--it is mo more and no less than an  acceptable form of stealing" (H. Ford, Sr.) (This was stated by  A. a communist; B. a social-democrat;  C. a liberal-conservative.)    Results of the answers (A-21, B-5, C-6, and  undecided-1) show that most of the respondents have a hazy  idea of the functional role of business (production and the  supply of socially useful goods and services) and its  moral and value principles and imperatives.    Question: Name the principal difficulties you are  encountering in your entrepreneurial activity.    The spectrum of problems identified (aside from those  indicated in the answers to Question No. 4) is as follows:    --nonfulfillment of contract commitments and dishonorable  conduct by partners;    --lack of support in the organs of executive authority and  their corruption;    --bureaucratism and amateurishness of officials;    --poor information support (especially with respect to  demand  and competition);    --political instability and the unpredictability of politics  and the absence of a clearly defined government policy;    --inflation and the instability of the dollar;    --the lack of funds and essential contacts;    --the lack of practical skills and the ability to work with  people; and    --the lack of knowledge and other factors.    Question: Which one of the following 10 political  figures would you give preference to: (B. Yeltsin, V.  Zhirinovskiy, V. Chernomyrdin, N. Travkin, Ye. Gaydar, K.  Borovoy, S. Shakhray, A. Sobchak, G. Yavlinskiy, G. Zyuganov)?    Results of the answers (9 for G. Yavlinskiy, 4  each for Ye. Gaydar and B. Yeltsin, 2 each for S. Shakray and A.  Sobchak, 1 each for K. Borovoy, V. Chernomyrdin, and N. Travkin,  and 9 undecided) enable us to conclude that leading  Russian politicians, with the possible exception of G.  Yavlinskiy, do not inspire particular confidence from the  respondents. This distribution reflects the need for new  faces to make their appearance on the Russian political scene.    Question: Who holds the real power in Russia at  present, in your opinion?    Results of the answers enable us to conclude unequivocally  that the overwhelming majority consider two forces to be  the holders of real power--the shadowy mafia structures (25  "for") and the bureaucratic machinery (21 "for"). Further, to a  lesser degree: the VPK [military-production complex] (5 "for"),  the president and major financial-commercial corporations (4  each), the government (3), and the SMI [mass information media]  (2). If it is taken into account that nine-tenths of the private  enterprises in Russia today are under the influence of organized  crime to one degree or another, it is apparent that the  respondents are not so far from the truth.    Question: Which of the following personality types  best describes your attitude toward politics? A. an  apolitical citizen; (B. a passive citizen;  C. a competent critic; D. a competent  observer; E. an activist.)    Results of the answers (A-5, B-9, C-8, D-11, E-1)  lead to the conclusion that practically all the  respondents dissociate themselves from politics. Meanwhile,  the position "I do not want to be involved in politics, I want  to engage only in business" is inadequate in the current  situation in Russia, when the formation of a market economy  depends mainly and fundamentally on policy and who is directing  this policy. The right "to be outside of politics" has really  been earned and provided for only by the developed market  democracies. But for us, in light of what has been stated above,  this is an impermissible luxury, especially for those who seek  to become the masters of their destiny and do not want to depend  on the "mercies" of the state.    Question: What is the principal reason for  Russia's current problems, in your opinion? (A. those  in power are not professionals; B. professionals are  in power, but they are constantly interfered with; C.  both.)    Results of the answers (A-2, B-2, C-26,  undecided-3) enable us to draw this conclusion: at the level of  the structural and functional organization of state authority,  the overwhelming majority of respondents adequately  reflect the subjective reasons for the processes of crisis in  Russia. On one hand, the country is really suffering from  the lack of professionalism and incompetence, a lack of  responsibility and actions "on the off-chance" peculiar to many  "new" politicians who came to power on the wave of  democratization and who are learning the art of state  administration "on the job." On the other hand, the intense  opposition to changes from the numerous "holders" and "managers"  of state property, those who have "privatized" the state  authority of the nomenklatura and bureaucratic circles, the  mafia structures, and others is having an effect.    Question: If new elections to the State Duma were  held today, which parties and voting blocs would you vote for?    Results of the answers: 6 each for "Russia's  Choice" and "Yabloko," 4 for the RDDR [Russian Movement for  Democratic Reforms], 2 for the PES [Economic Freedom Party], 1  each for the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord], DPR  [Democratic Party of Russia], and "Women of Russia," and 12  undecided. We may speak of the "lack of party affiliation"  in the political consciousness of most of the respondents  and their "vote of no confidence" in the parties and blocs which  are actually taking part in the exercise of political power in  Russia today.  <H5>  General Conclusions </H5>   We are dealing with representatives of the class of Russian  entrepreneurs which is being "born in torment" (taking into  account that this is not a very favorable environment, and, in  places, one that is even openly hostile), and one that has been  formed only as "a class in itself" at present. The overwhelming  majority of respondents are "standing firmly on their own feet,"  that is, they view life quite realistically (without romanticism  and illusions) and perceive it most often as it actually exists.  The majority distinctly acknowledge their own special interests  and the numerous problems facing private enterprise activity in  Russia. The obligations which the state should assume toward  business are also expressed very specifically. However, as  far as the public obligations and value imperatives of business  itself are concerned, there is a certain "flabbiness" and  "haziness" here.    The respondents' perception of the state as an institution  which "has an obligation to business because of its position"  (as well as of such specific holders of political power as  parties and their leaders) is more negative than positive.  Social criticism and skepticism predominate. At the  same time, we do not see a sufficient amount of awareness that a  state "obligated to business because of its position" (with the  present distribution of political forces) will turn to this by  itself, and that it must be constantly pushed in this direction,  and even "forced" to do so. The economic power concentrated in  entrepreneurial circles should be turned into a political  resource for "power" pressure on the state and its structures  and "incentive" for them to take part in a business partnership  with equal rights. Both from without (through a developed  political infrastructure of parties, public associations, and so  forth) and from within (through direct "assumption of authority  by individual entrepreneurs" and by putting "their own people"  in parliament and other representative organs, and so forth).  And this in turn assumes a target-oriented investment of capital  and development of the special field of free enterprise and  political business, with broad participation by specialist  professionals (economists, sociologists, political scientists,  jurists, and so forth).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Attorney General Mikha'el Ben-Ya'ir has ruled that  after the transfer of powers to the Palestinian authority in  Gaza and Jericho, Knesset members [MK] will no longer enjoy  parliamentary immunity and special privileges in those areas.  In all other areas of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza MK's enjoy  special privileges stemming from their position, and the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] authorities must respect them.    Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports the attorney general  emphasized that in the event of a clash between security needs  in the area and the right of an MK to freedom of movement, the  security needs will prevail. Mikha'el Ben-Ya'ir was addressing  the Knesset House Committee.</p>

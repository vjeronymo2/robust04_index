			<p>BFN     [Text] All refugees from Bosnia who are fit to carry arms  and who are staying in Sweden should travel home and take part  in the defense of the country, says the Tuzla Mayor Selim  (?Bezladcic), who is currently visiting Goteborg. According to  the mayor, within one month the refugees will receive a summons  to travel home, and that summons will come from the Bosnian  Government. If they do not heed the call, they may encounter  problems when they want to return to Bosnia. New passports may  then be denied them, says the Tuzla mayor, currently visiting  Goteborg.</p>

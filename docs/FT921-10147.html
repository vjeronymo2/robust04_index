			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / The Blue Arrow Trial: Judge cuts back scope of prosecution case THE prosecution case in the Blue Arrow fraud trial was cut back drastically yesterday after the judge directed the jury to strike out most of the indictment and concentrate on only one aspect of the allegations. Beginning his summing up, Mr Justice McKinnon told the jury it should consider only the 'late take-up' - the buying of shares after closure of the 1987 issue by County NatWest and Phillips &amp; Drew Securities, advisers to the issue, to raise the acceptance level announced to the markets from 38 per cent to 49 per cent. The jury was told to disregard more than six of the nine pages of prosecution allegations. These related to the placing that followed the issue, the taking of shares by County's marketmakers, the no-loss indemnity given by County to Union Bank of Switzerland, and the non-reporting of a disclosable holding of shares owned by National Westminster Bank, County's parent. Mr Justice McKinnon said the evidence the jury had heard on these matters was still relevant, but nothing adverse to the five remaining defendants could be drawn from it. Following the acquittals of the three corporate defendants, five individuals remain charged with conspiring to mislead the markets over the result of the Pounds 837m issue. They are Mr Jonathan Cohen, a former County chief executive; Mr David Reed, a former County head of corporate finance; Mr Nicholas Wells, a former County director; Mr Martin Gibbs, a former head of corporate finance at P&amp;D; and Mr Christopher Stainforth, a former P&amp;D director. The late take-up was not illegal in itself, the judge said. But it was a crime if it was done to mislead the markets. To convict the defendants, the jury had to be satisfied that accepted market practices about late acceptances had been dishonestly breached with the intention of misleading investors. Prosecution claims that all investor witnesses had said they thought the 49 per cent figure referred to applications accepted by the official deadline were inaccurate, he said. He added that prosecution points about the size of City salaries in 1987 and the compensation paid by County and P&amp;D to pension funds were 'cheap and prejudicial' and had nothing to do with the issues at stake. Mr Justice McKinnon said the trial - now just days short of lasting a year - had proved difficult enough for the highly trained professionals involved. If the jurors had felt overwhelmed at times, they were not alone. 'I would not be telling the truth if I said that I have not, at times, felt overwhelmed by this case,' he said. The judge's summing up continues today.</p>

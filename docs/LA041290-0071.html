			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'DOWN HOME' A PROMISING SERIES TRYOUT FOR NBC  </P> <P> This is the try-out-for-fall season at the networks, and tonight (10:30 on  Channels 4, 36 and 39) brings the auditioning "Down Home," a promising NBC  comedy series that finds a New York career woman reuniting with her father and  brother in the Texas fishing village where she once lived.  </P> <P> After tonight's valuable exposure following the popular "Cheers," "Down Home"  returns in its regular time slot at 10:30 p.m. Saturday to continue its current  run of six episodes.  </P> <P> It merits longer life, based on the premiere, a mostly amusing half-hour in  which a clever script (minus an awful joke about turning a pet singing pig into  bacon) gives talented Judith Ivey an opportunity play the protagonist Kate to  the comic hilt.  </P> <P> She's given good support by Eric Alan Kramer as her thudding brother and Dakin  Matthews as her father, whose failing coastal diner and fishing hangout is  about to be swallowed by a touristy high-tech real estate development that  would destroy the character of the town.  </P> <P> It turns out the developer is being represented by Kate's old boyfriend Wade  (Ray Baker), a former shrimper. Their romantic fires are relit. However, it's  this relationship -- between the urbane Kate and the relative simpleton Wade --  that least works. It's easy to see his attraction to her, but not vice versa.  </P> <P> Otherwise, "Down Home" is a welcome addition to NBC. This is one fish that  swims. HOWARD ROSENBERG  </P></p>

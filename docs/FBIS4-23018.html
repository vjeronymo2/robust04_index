The  mechanism of action of ozone on microbial cells is the subject  of intense debate. It is clear that most of the ozone, rather  than penetrate the cell deeply, reacts with membranes and other  surface structures to prevent the development of the microbe,  thereby killing the microbe. Noting that other oxidants induce  the in-cell formation of a new compound --  2-methylbutane-1,2,3,4-tetraol-2,4- cyclopyrophosphate -- in a  number of bacteria, the researchers here chose to use ozone to  determine whether the mechanism of action of that phenomenon  hinges on an initial removal of electrons from the active  centers of the enzymes containing NADPH or flavin, or on  subsequent reduction of some group, or on the triggering of  secondary oxidants formed after the single-electron reduction of  oxygen to a superoxide radical. The Gram-positive bacteria  Brevibacterium ammoniagenes ATCC 6872,  Micrococcus luteus of the Fleming 2665 strain, and  Mycobacterium smegmatis VKM As-1171 were cultivated  to the end of the logarithmic growth phase at 30C in flasks  with 200 ml of a medium containing 1 percent peptone, 0.3  percent yeast extract, and 0.5 percent NaCl. The cells were then  ozonized, which produced ozone via electrosynthesis. The  researchers found the most critical feature of the mechanism of  action to be the ozone-induced oxidative activation of enzymes  for the synthesis of the new cyclopyrophosphate. Membrane  permeability was, by and large, left intact, despite major  changes in membrane lipids. Lengthy ozonization leads to the  disappearance of intracellular ammonigenin hydroxylamine; with  short-term exposure, however, redox status is preserved.

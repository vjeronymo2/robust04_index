			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> S.D. EVANGELIST OFFERS $52 MILLION TO BUY SCANDALIZED PTL MINISTRY;  </P> <P> RELIGION: MORRIS CERULLO HAS PUT DOWN $7 MILLION IN 'PHASE ONE' OF PURCHASE OF  BAKKER-FOUNDED EMPIRE.  </P> <P> Morris Cerullo, a faith healer who is head of the San Diego-based Worldwide  Evangelism ministry, has offered to buy the assets of the scandal-plagued PTL  ministry for $52 million.  </P> <P> PTL, founded by defrocked TV evangelist Jim Bakker, has been in the control of  U. S. Bankruptcy Court since June, 1987, two months after Bakker resigned from  the ministry following the emergence of a sex-and-money scandal involving  former church secretary Jessica Hahn.  </P> <P> Bakker is serving a 45-year federal prison term in Minnesota after his  conviction last October on fraud and conspiracy counts.  </P> <P> Cerullo, 58, and his church are best known locally for having owned the El  Cortez Hotel in San Diego, where he ran a short-lived evangelism school before  selling the property in 1981. Cerullo also proposed a grandiose 200-acre  retirement center and religious education center on land the church owned in  the Mira Mesa area, but ended up selling the property to home builder Pardee  Construction.  </P> <P> PTL Trustee Dennis W. Shedd, an attorney in Columbia, S. C., confirmed  Cerullo's offer, saying the preacher had put $7 million cash in an escrow  account in Columbia to cover purchase of the PTL cable TV network and a  broadcast production studio, which Shedd referred to as "phase one" of the  sale.  </P> <P> Shedd said Cerullo is in the process of securing financing to buy "phase two"  of PTL: the 2,200-acre Heritage USA theme park in Ft. Mill, S. C., 15 miles  south of Charlotte, N. C. The theme park, which includes a completed 500-room  Heritage Grand hotel and another 500-room hotel still under construction, as  well as a water slide, shopping mall and miniature railroad, has been closed  since September.  </P> <P> Cerullo, who was unavailable for comment Wednesday, intends to resume operation  and development of Heritage USA as a religious theme park, Shedd said. Of the  park's 2,200 acres, about 500 are developed. The Heritage USA phase of the sale  to Cerullo is expected to close later this year, he said.  </P> <P> Shedd said he will file a motion today with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in  Columbia seeking approval of the offer by Cerullo. A hearing was scheduled at  the court this morning to consider a $6.3-million offer for PTL's cable TV  network from evangelist Oral Roberts.  </P> <P> Shedd said the Cerullo offer is "a good deal (for the PTL estate) because it is  the only package offer (for all PTL assets) that we have received, and the part  of the package allocated to the network is more money than anyone has offered."  </P> <P> Last year, a Canadian developer offered to buy the Heritage USA theme park, but  the deal fell through after it became apparent that he could not obtain clear  title to the property. Ownership of the land is disputed by an Indian tribe  that has claimed in a lawsuit that the property was illegally taken from them  by the U. S. government in the 1800s.  </P> <P> The PTL satellite cable network consists of a leasehold interest in a cable TV  satellite controlled by HBO and an "uplink," or earth-to-satellite transmission  facility. The PTL network still operates, carrying other evangelists'  programming, including Cerullo's, but no longer produces programming of its  own, Shedd said.  </P> <P> The PTL network is accessed by 800 cable TV systems across the United States,  which in turn can reach 6.5 million households, Shedd said. In court documents,  however, HBO has argued that Shedd has no power as trustee to transfer the  leasehold interest in the satellite to a new buyer. It was unclear Wednesday  whether HBO would dispute the sale of the network to Cerullo.  </P> <P> Cerullo was once a friend to Jim Bakker and appeared on the "Jim and Tammy  Show," the once-popular program hosted by Bakker and his wife. Cerullo was  ordained in the Assembly of God Church, the same denomination that defrocked  Bakker in 1987 after the Jessica Hahn scandal but is not now affiliated with  any particular denomination.  </P> <P> Bakker allegedly had sex with Hahn and then made payments to her to hush up the  incident. With the scandal broiling around him and his ministry drowning in  financial problems, Bakker turned PTL operations over to preacher Jerry Falwell  in April, 1987. Two months later, Falwell placed the ministry in bankruptcy and  turned over its financial records to the U. S. Department of Justice.  </P> <P> Cerullo, who grew up in a New Jersey orphanage, directs a ministry that  produces videotapes and television programming and which conducts operations in  Europe, Canada, Israel and Zimbabwe as well as in the United States. Worldwide  Evangelism solicits funds from viewers and church members via direct-mail,  telephone and televised appeals.  </P> <P> The evangelist came under fire in the early 1980s when it came to light that  trust funds from donors, some of whom were told they would receive lifetime  income on their donations, were being invested in second and third trust deeds,  a risky kind of mortgage loan.  </P> <P> Cerullo's Worldwide Evangelism bought the 250-room El Cortez Hotel in 1978 for  $6.5 million, but was unsuccessful in making it a religious education and  training center. During the two years the training center was open, Cerullo  became involved in several disputes with contractors, students, real estate  brokers and labor unions.  </P> <P> Cerullo sold the hotel in 1981 to Denver developer Terry Considine, who  unsuccessfully proposed it as the site of the San Diego Convention Center,  which was ultimately built on Harbor Drive. Considine subsequently sold the  landmark to the Grosvenor family, who last year formed a joint venture with  Japanese investors to build a $250-million hotel complex.  </P> <P> Times wire services were used in the writing of this story.  </P></p>

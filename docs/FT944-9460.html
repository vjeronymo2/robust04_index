			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (13): Expansion comes under scrutiny - Paris The battle over how to accommodate more aircraft and passengers in the Paris region appears to have been suspended until after next spring's presidential and municipal elections. Aeroport de Paris (ADP), the public operator for both Charles de Gaulle at Orissy and Orly, had planned to build a third runway at Orissy by 1997 or 1998. But the question is now being scrutinised by a special commission that is not due to present its conclusions until June next year. The commission is also looking at the idea of building a third airport in the capital area to relieve pressure on the two existing facilities which have not reached saturation but could do so if air traffic continues to increase. One analyst said he expected the commission to come down in favour of both schemes, as it would take about 20 years to complete the new airport. Meanwhile, the ADP projects aircraft movements and passenger traffic to rise by an annual average by 3 per cent over the next five to 10 years. If the analyst is right, the government could have a number of schemes to choose from. Four schemes have already been drawn up: two in the Amiens region, one near Chartres and the other near Chalon-Sur-Sone, all of which are far from the capital. Of the two existing airports, Orly is the most congested. Runways are operating almost at full capacity for three to four hours a day, compared to one to two hours at Charles de Gaulle. This is the reason transport minister Bernard Bosson cites for seeking a ban on smaller carriers from peak travel hours on busy routes from Orly in mid-1995. Initially the ban was to apply to only the Orly to London route but it is now to be widened. Protests from local politicians and residents held sway over the plans before the commission was set up, and the government had agreed to shift eastwards the location of the proposed third runway at Charles de Gaulle. It also said it was giving up the original long-time 'hypothesis' of increasing passenger traffic to 80m from the present 27m. The original plan included the possibility of building five runways. Mr Bosson said that the concerns of local residents were also behind the decision to keep aircraft movement at Orly down to the current level of about 200,000 a year instead of allowing them to increase to 330,000 an idea that was first mooted by the ADP, chief spokesman Jacques Reder said. Even so, work continues on the extension to terminal two at Charles de Gaulle, with E wing due for completion in 1997. This will follow the opening earlier this month of the high speed train and urban RER train's so-called interchange module in the centre of terminal two. In addition FF250m will be spent at Orly over the next two years to enable the west and south terminals to handle both international and national traffic rather than specialising as they do at the moment. This is intended to iron out the traffic peaks in both cases, Mr Reder added.</p>

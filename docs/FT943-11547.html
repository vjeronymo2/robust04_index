			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Jermyn Inv raises Pounds 13m for expansion Jermyn Investment, the property investor, is raising Pounds 12.8m net in a placing and open offer and acquiring three freehold properties for a total of Pounds 2.05m cash. It is also proposing to change the rights of preference shareholders to encourage them to convert their holdings into ordinary shares or to redeem them early. Jermyn is placing 8.3m shares at 160p with a 5-for-2 clawback. The shares were unchanged at 175p. The company is proposing that the preference conversion rights be improved from their present 1-for-1 basis to 1-for 1.32, exercisable at any time. On converting their holdings, shareholders will receive payment of arrears of preference dividend to the date of conversion. Following the changes Jermyn will have net cash of Pounds 4.2m and pro forma net assets of about Pounds 18m.</p>

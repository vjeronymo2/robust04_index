			<p>BFN     [Text] Luxembourg, April 19 (AFP) -- The European Union  [EU] agreed here on Tuesday [19 April] to offer South Africa  greater trade access to the EU as a signal of support after that  country's first all-race democratic elections next week.    The EU's Ministerial Council of Foreign Affairs said in a  statement: "The Union intends to send a strong political signal  to the incoming government and to the South African population."    The Council agreed in principle to include South Africa in  its general system of preferences (GSP) comprising low tariffs  on manufactured imports from developing countries.    The decision was the centrepiece of proposals for the rapid  deepening of economic and political relations with South Africa  pending the negotiation of a comprehensive new system of  political, trade and economic links.    A formal decision on the GSP issue is expected following the  EU's 10-year review of its GSP system in May, and consultations  with other developing countries linked to the EU in the Lome  trade-and-aid agreement.    The EU also agreed in principle to extend its "rules of  origin" to South Africa, which means that South African  components of goods partly manufactured in other countries of  the region would also benefit from low tariffs.    And the Council agreed to pursue schemes for promoting and  protecting foreign investments in South Africa, and to boost  cooperation in such areas as education, industry,  telecommunications, science and technology.    "We want South Africa to become a motor of economic growth  in  southern Africa," an EU spokesman said, adding that the GSP  break would boost South African exports of manufactured and  high-tech goods.    The EU is South Africa's biggest trading partner, but most  of  its imports of South African products currently comprise raw  materials.    Trade between the two sides totalled ECU10.8 billion (12  billion dollars) over the first nine months of 1993, resulting  in a trade surplus of ECU2.59 billion (2.95 billion dollars) for  the EU.    The EU has already dismantled all economic sanctions against  South Africa, and Tuesday's decision is the first element of a  new era of EU-South African links to replace the frosty  relations of the apartheid years.    The EU Council also proposed to open negotiations for a  strong interim agreement with the new South African government  soon after the elections, linking comprehensive cooperation with  respect for democracy and human rights.    And it agreed to use its influence at the United Nations to  have lifted the last remaining sanctions against South Africa --  an embargo on arms sales and military cooperation.</p>

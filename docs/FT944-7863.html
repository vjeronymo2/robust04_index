			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Japanese economic indicators improve Most of Japan's main economic indicators are continuing to improve, according to the latest monthly performance index from the Economic Planning Agency, William Dawkins reports from Tokyo. Its leading index, a basket of economic indicators pointing to conditions a few months ahead, stood a 54.5 in September, the ninth month for which it has stayed above 50, the dividing line between growth and decline. EPA officials expects the leading indicator to continue to point to growth in October, on the back of rising industrial output. Manufacturing output increased by 1.6 per cent in the three months to September, achieving the third quarterly rise running, according to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Production continued to grow in October and November, said a separate Bank of Japan report yesterday.</p>

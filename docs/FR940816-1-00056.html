			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> 15. The Tulalip Tribes of Washington, Tulalip Indian Reservation, Marysville, Washington  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Tulalip Tribes are the successors in interest to the Snohomish, Snoqualmie and Skykomish tribes and other tribes and bands signatory to the Treaty of Point Elliott of January 22, 1855. The Tulalip Tribes government is located on the Tulalip Indian Reservation at Marysville, Washington. The tribes or individual tribal members own all of the land on the reservation, and they have full wildlife management authority. All lands within the boundaries of the Tulalip Tribes Reservation are closed to non-member hunting unless opened by Tulalip Tribal regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a letter dated May 13, 1994, the Tulalip Tribes proposed tribal and non-tribal hunting regulations for the 1994&hyph;95 seasons as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For ducks and coot, the proposed season for tribal members would be from September 15, 1994, through February 1, 1995. In the case of non-tribal hunters hunting on the reservation, the season would be the latest closing date and the longest period of time allowed for the State of Washington under final Federal frameworks, to be announced. Daily bag and possession limits for Tulalip Tribal members would be 6 and 12 ducks, respectively, except that for blue-winged teal, canvasback, harlequin, pintail and wood duck the bag and possession limits would be the same as those established for the State of Washington in accordance with final Federal frameworks. For non-tribal hunters, bag and possession limits would be the same as those permitted the State of Washington under final Federal frameworks, to be announced. It would be necessary for non-tribal hunters to check with the Tulalip tribal authorities for additional conservation measures which may apply for specific species managed within the ``region.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For geese, tribal members are proposed to be allowed to hunt from September 15, 1994, through February 1, 1995. Non-tribal hunters would be allowed the longest season and the latest closing date permitted for the State of Washington under final Federal frameworks, to be announced. For tribal hunters, the goose daily bag and possession limits are proposed to be 6 and 12, respectively, except that the bag limits for brant, cackling Canada geese and dusky Canada geese would be those established for the Pacific Flyway in accordance with final Federal frameworks, to be announced. For non-tribal hunters hunting on reservation lands, the daily bag and possession limits would be those established in accordance with final Federal frameworks for the State of Washington, to be announced. The Tulalip Tribe also sets a maximum annual bag limit on ducks and geese for those tribal members who engage in subsistence hunting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For snipe, the proposed open seasons follow those regulations for ducks, coot and geese given above. For both tribal and non-tribal hunters, snipe daily bag and possession limits are proposed to be set at 6 and 12, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All hunters on Tulalip Tribal lands are required to adhere to shooting hour regulations set at one-half hour before sunrise to sunset, special tribal permit requirements, and a number of other regulations enforced by the tribe. Non-tribal hunters sixteen years of age and older, hunting pursuant to Tulalip Tribes' Ordinance No. 67, must possess a valid Federal Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp and a valid State of Washington Migratory Waterfowl Stamp. Both stamps must be validated through signature across the face in ink.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the season length requested by the Tulalip Tribes appears to be quite liberal, a rough estimate of past harvests indicates a total take by tribal and non-tribal hunters under 1,000 ducks and 500 geese, annually. The Service intends to concur with the Tulalip Tribes request for the above seasons and requests that the harvest be monitored closely and regulations be reevaluated for future years if harvest becomes too great in relation to population numbers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Public Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Director intends that finally adopted rules be as responsive as possible to all concerned interests. Therefore, she desires to obtain the comments and suggestions on these proposals from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, tribal and other Indian organizations, and private interests, and she will take into consideration any reasonable comments received. Such comments, and any additional information received, may lead the Director to adopt final regulations differing from these proposals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

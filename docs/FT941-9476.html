			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / MP quits front bench over trip to Somalia Mr Tony Worthington last night resigned as a Labour front bench spokesman following his unauthorised trip to Somalia last week. In his resignation letter Mr Worthington 'regretted the distress' he had caused and recognised that 'party discipline was of paramount importance'. Mr John Smith, Labour leader, has withdrawn all co-operation with the government for legislation in the Commons. He was known to be angry that Mr Worthington's absence in Somalia, when he missed important Commons votes, could be seen to undermine the strategy. Mr Worthington travelled to Somalia with Mr Mark Robinson, parliamentary private secretary to Baroness Lynda Chalker, foreign office minister in charge of overseas aid. The two men were taken hostage by guerrillas and later released. Mr Worthington had argued that he had received permission from Labour's chief whip, Mr Derek Foster, to go to Somalia. Labour argued that the fact that he drew up his letter of resignation before he saw Mr Foster was an admission that he had been in the wrong.</p>

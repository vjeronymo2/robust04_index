			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Democrats to grant president long honeymoon on the Hill DEMOCRATIC congressmen yesterday predicted a 'long honeymoon' for Governor Bill Clinton after a morning meeting with the president-elect on Capitol Hill. 'Democrats on the Hill are starved for someone to get along with at the White House. Bill Clinton's going to find no stubbornness up here,' said Congressman Pat Williams of Montana. But Republicans promised confrontation with the incoming president, signalling their intentions by ousting the moderate Congressman Jerry Lewis of California from chairmanship of the House of Representatives Republican Conference, the party's third-ranking leadership position, in favour of Congressman Richard Armey of Texas, a more pugnacious right winger. Mr Clinton has already held a series of meetings with leaders of both parties in Congress as well as with the 110 first-time members, who some have likened to the independent and reform-minded group of congressmen elected in 1974 in the wake of the Watergate scandal. The 'freshmen' have made their presence felt by interviewing committee chairmen seeking re-election, a tactic last adopted by the Watergate class. But early results from party caucus elections suggest that only minor cracks are likely to emerge in the traditional congressional power structure, where seniority counts for almost everything. True, 82-year-old Congressman Jamie Whitten of Mississippi, who can trump anyone on seniority by virtue of 51 years' continuous service, was ousted from the chairmanship of the highly influential appropriations committee. But Mr Whitten will be replaced by Congressman Bill Natcher of Kentucky, who at 83 is even older, but healthier. Most other committee chairs appear safe, although a battle is brewing for chairmanship of the budget committee, which would fall open if, as many expect, Congressman Leon Panetta is named director of the Office of Management and Budget. The race is expected to pit Mr Charles Stenholm, a fiscal conservative from Texas, against the more left wing Mr Martin Olav Sabo of Minnesota, with Mr John Spratt of South Carolina somewhere in the middle.</p>

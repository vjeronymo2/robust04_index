			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Recall of parliament rejected THE government yesterday rejected demands that it should recall parliament from its summer recess to debate Britain's new military commitments in Iraq and Bosnia. The demands came as ministers privately acknowledged that the conflicts in both regions might bring pressure for further military commitments in the next few months. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, voiced doubts about the legal basis of the proposed air exclusion in southern Iraq. Mr George Foulkes, a Labour foreign affairs spokesman, said the issue must be debated by MPs. But aides to Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, signalled that he would not press Mr John Major to bring MPs back for an emergency debate. Mr Smith was said to back the prime minister's decisions on the sending of Tornado fighters to protect the Shia communities in southern Iraq and the limited use of troops to defend UN aid convoys in Bosnia. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, was joined yesterday by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, in re-emphasising that the proposed force of up to 1,800 troops in the former Yugoslavia could be withdrawn if the situation deteriorated. Privately, however, senior ministers were voicing concern that the force, which will operate in Bosnia under the auspices of the UN, could quickly become embroiled in the conflict. Mr Hurd acknowledged that their rules of engagement would allow them to return fire if attacked. It will be some weeks before the troops reach Bosnia. The contingent will probably be drawn from a battalion currently based in Germany. Officials said the Gulf contingent of six Tornado ground-attack and reconnaissance aircraft and two VC-10 refuelling tankers would reach the area within days. They are expected to be based at Dhahran in Saudi Arabia or in Bahrain. Mr Rifkind emphasised that the action against Iraq by the US, France and Britain was covered fully by existing UN resolutions. It was hoped that the Baghdad regime would avoid conflict by grounding all flights in the zone. In private, however, ministers said the move could bring more attacks on the Shia communities, prompting further western military involvement.</p>

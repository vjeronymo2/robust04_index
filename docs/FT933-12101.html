			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / International Company News: Exxon and Mobil benefit from gas price increase EXXON and Mobil, two of the biggest US energy groups, exceeded market expectations with second-quarter profits which were boosted by a rise in natural gas prices in the US and the effects of substantial cost-cutting. The news sent shares in the two groups higher in New York on Friday afternoon and supported other oil and gas shares. Exxon ended the week at Dollars 65 1/8 , up Dollars  7/8 on Friday, while Mobil rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 71. Exxon reported net income for the quarter of Dollars 1.24bn, or 98 cents a share, up from Dollars 930m, or 73 cents, in the same period in 1992. Some Dollars 210m represented non-recurring credits, mainly related to tax, compared with credits of Dollars 24m in the previous period, leaving a gain in underlying net profits of 13 per cent. First-half net income was up from Dollars 2.23bn to Dollars 2.42bn. Mr Lee Raymond, chairman, said operating costs had been cut by Dollars 200m during the quarter, compared with a year ago. Worldwide operating profits from exploration and production rose from Dollars 693m to Dollars 761m, after a net increase of Dollars 43m in non-recurring tax credits. The rise reflected cost cutting, mainly in North America, offset by lower crude oil prices and a build-up in inventories in the North Sea. Operating earnings from refining and marketing rose from Dollars 185m to Dollars 446m (Dollars 47m of the gain coming from non-recurring factors), owing to lower costs and an increase in margins outside the US. Chemical operations made Dollars 86m, against Dollars 119m a year ago, in the face of weak demand and excess industry capacity. Mobil's second-quarter net income jumped to Dollars 579m, or Dollars 1.41 a share, from Dollars 255m, or 60 cents, as recent cost-cutting took effect. Mr Allen Murray, chairman, added: 'Earnings improved on higher US natural gas prices and on our strong presence in the growing Pacific Rim markets.' Some Dollars 60m of the gains came from tax credits and other non-recurring items. Exploration and production earnings rose from Dollars 321m to Dollars 475m, while marketing and refining income rose from Dollars 25m to Dollars 136m. First-half net income of Dollars 1.07bn was up from Dollars 382m in the first six months of 1992, excluding the effects of accounting changes.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Census 1994"] </F>   [Text] Even five days after the census began, the situation  has not essentially changed, especially in regions inhabited  mostly by Albanians (Tetovo, Gostivar). Communal census  instructors and clerks are still awaiting their political  leaders' views before they go out and do their job. Local  census committees insist on having only Albanian census clerks  in "pure ethnic regions." Due to the delay, they also request  postponement of the operation for as many days as it has thus  far been put off.    The census is carried out normally in all remaining cities.  As the Macedonian television reports, the State Statistics  Institute informs that 338,599 citizens, 98,593 households,  104,155 apartments and 39,430 farms have been registered up to  June 29, inclusive. Parallel with the census in Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] is the census of  Macedonians throughout the world who have valid documents,  regardless of the date of issuance. This operation is carried  out in 10 foreign countries in which Macedonia has diplomatic  offices, in three countries in which it has only representative  offices, and all countries whose authorities gave permission for  the census to be realized. Reports from these countries  indicate a need of prolonging the deadline. Some sources inform  Macedonian citizens of Albanian origin in Switzerland and  Germany have announced their intention to boycott the census.  No census of Macedonians was allowed in Federal Yugoslavia by  the authorities there.</p>

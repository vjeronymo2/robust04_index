			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Letter: Abbey National house sales plan has flawed basis, ignores realities and is likely to fuel inflation (4) Sir, Surely what is required by the housing market is not an incentive to sell to obtain tax relief as proposed by Abbey National but an incentive to buy in the form of the reintroduction of higher rate relief for mortgage interest and the raising of the Pounds 30,000 Miras cap on standard rate tax relief. It is the buyer who requires financial assistance over the term of the mortgage to encourage him to take on additional borrowings, particularly at a time of high real rates of interest.

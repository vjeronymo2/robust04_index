			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / White House poised to support bank retaliation THE Clinton administration is expected to throw its weight today behind measures that would allow trade retaliation against countries with restrictive financial services markets. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, is expected, in a speech outlining the administration's approach to banking legislation, to back the Fair Trade in Financial Services bill, which would compel government regulators to prevent the US expansion of banks and financial companies from countries which do not offer equal access to US companies. Mr Lawrence Summers, Treasury undersecretary in charge of international affairs, is due to testify on the issue tomorrow to the Senate banking committee, whose chairman, Senator Donald Riegle of Michigan, is the chief sponsor of the retaliatory legislation. Some Washington banking specialists wondered whether Mr Bentsen might also address the question of interest rates, possibly urging other banks to follow the lead of Morgan Guaranty in cutting its prime rate last week by half a percentage point to 5.5 per cent. The Fair Trade in Financial Services legislation has been debated in Congress for years. The measure was backed with some reservations by the Bush administration, but the strongest opposition has come from the Federal Reserve Board, which has contested the desirability of limiting access to US financial markets. While the primary target of members of Congress has been the Japanese securities market, US commercial bankers say that in their sector the legislation would be most likely to come into play against such countries as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Brazil. Mr Bentsen is also expected to voice support for legislation authorising banks to expand outside their home states - a measure now being discussed in a House of Representatives sub-committee.</p>

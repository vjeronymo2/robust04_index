CCIH and the Haitian employers'  associations intended to compel the Haitian protagonists to  quickly find a solution to the political crisis.    Regarding the resumption of activities today, the spokesman  for the Haitian private sector, Bernard Craan, stated to Radio  Metropole that the Haitian employers' sector emerged stronger  and felt satisfied with their initiative. Rothschild [Francois]  filed a report: [Begin recording] Reactivating the  commercial-industrial machine today does not mean that the  Haitian employers intend to put aside their demands. The private  sector asserts that it will maintain the pressure on the various  protagonists. The crisis committee of the employers' sector will  therefore remain mobilized, reinforced by the presence of the  presidents of the associations. The private sector intends to  talk with the other vital forces of the country, with the  objective of finding elements for a solution to the structural  crisis that Haiti has been facing for what seems like decades.    Questioned on an assessment of their initiative, one of the  spokesmen of the employers' sector states that their movement  has not been without effect. Bernard Craan explains that the  private sector demonstrated unity by rationally managing the  movement, but he believes that it is still too early to speak of  overall satisfaction.

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Money Markets: French rates rise CASH RATES in the french franc money market continued to firm upwards yesterday as dealers took the view that a second battle to save the French franc from devaluation is in prospect, writes James Blitz. The continuing tension in the European exchange rate mechanism pushed the franc below the FFr3.40 level against the D-Mark, some 3 centimes above its ERM floor against the German currency. Tensions were also felt in other European currencies, with the overnight rate for Irish punts rising to 75 per cent, while the cost of borrowing Norwegian krona for 1 day was up at 500 per cent. However, the growing strains on the French franc may threaten the long-term future of the ERM. Three-month money firmed to around 11 per cent from 10 1/16 per cent on Monday, 1 month money was quoted at 12 per cent, while the overnight rate was up at 11 per cent from 10 per cent the previous day. French franc futures reflected extreme pessimism about the future of French credit policy. The December french franc contract dropped 52 basis points, to a low of 89.67 yesterday morning. At that level, it prices 3 month francs next month at 10.33 per cent. It later closed higher at 89.74. The firming of French rates should have no immediate impact on French base rates which have recently been reduced. The French government's large shareholding in the French banking system means that commercial banks will find it difficult to pass on tighter credit conditions in the immediate future. But one London-based commercial bank dealer said that if the Bundesbank does not cut its officially posted rates soon, France will be faced with a grim choice: 'Either they will put up base rates again in the thick of an economic slowdown. Or they will suspend ERM membership.' With parliamentary elections looming in March, it is hard to see the French government taking the first course. German markets continued to reflect faint optimism that the Bundesbank will ease policy, although yesterday's figure for M3 money supply in October makes that an even less likely prospect. The December Euromark contract rose 8 basis points from its opening level to a close of 91.39.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 16 (BTA) -- Several more MP's of the  Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) are expected to join the  independent Civil Alliance for the Republic (GOR) next week,  according to GOR leader Alexandur Tomov. Then it will be clear  if their number is sufficient to form a new faction. Even if no  BSP MP's join GOR, a programme will be worked out for joint  action in parliament. This has been necessited by the last vote  in parliament on allowing UN equipment to pass through Bulgaria,  said Tomov. GOR believes parliament's approval of the UN  transit is in the national interest and is consistent with what  MP's said earlier. It is not a prelude to or a sign of a  mitigation of the stand against any passage via Bulgaria of  armed peacekeepers from Balkan states that may be involved in  the Yugoconfllct. Tomov will maintain this position during his  upcoming visit to Turkey. Tomov coordinated his opinion with  Bulgaria's formal position, and this was probably on the agenda  of his meeting today with President Zhelev.</p>

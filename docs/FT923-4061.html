			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Personal View: Not so super-unions Membership of unions affiliated to the Trades Union Congress has fallen by just over a third since 1979. The number of affiliated unions has fallen by a slightly lower proportion. So the decline in the number of unions has not quite kept pace with the decline in membership and is not the result of any out-of-the-ordinary merger activity. This position is about to change. With the creation of Unison from Nalgo, Cohse and Nupe, the amalgamation of the AEU and Eetpu, and the rumours of an eventual merger of the GMB and the TGWU, four union conglomerates - the three mentioned plus MSF, the general technical union - would contain two-thirds of the whole TUC-affiliated membership. The assumption is that the remainder would then have little choice but to join one of the big four, or amalgamate to create one or two further super-unions or union federations. Is this inevitable or even desirable? The added benefits to members claimed by super-union enthusiasts include increased power and/or influence derived from numerical strength; economies of scale; and the vague but important concept of industrial logic. Power, in the sense of industrial muscle, has not been related to crude numerical strength since the ban on secondary action. There may, however, be a potential benefit in a more integrated membership within any one company or industry. Trade union influence is more closely related to specific industry expertise and the level of membership participation than to the union's size. Economies of scale are in theory possible in administration, negotiation, and negotiation support such as research. The main potential administrative benefit is often thought to be in membership records and distribution systems. Rarely, however, is the capital outlay needed to bring together different systems, hardware and software justified. Negotiation resources can only be rationalised if there is considerable common membership within industries and companies. Support services such as research consume a fairly small proportion of union resources. Economies of scale therefore may be small and largely dependent on the concept of 'industrial logic'. Conversely, there may be significant losses of benefit owing to increased size. The essential difficulty is how to allocate resources efficiently, which is a central, top-down function, while retaining democratic accountability, which by its nature is bottom up. The universal response to this problem in union mergers is the creation of a new set of organisational and committee structures, the servicing of which may consume more resources than the economies of scale realise. It is often particularly wasteful of scarce lay representatives' time, leading to a concentration on internal debate rather than talking to management or members. There are three components to the concept of industrial logic: the existing union interface within companies and industries; a similarity of interest among members; and a similar union culture. It is, for instance, appallingly difficult to bring together a union with a strong central organisation and one with a loose federal structure. The philosophy and strategy behind the creation of huge general unions simply ignores all three of these components. This means that any economies of scale are difficult to realise; may be swallowed by extra bureaucratic costs in an attempt to reconcile the irreconcilable; and may lead to alienation if members perceive themselves as small fish in a large pond that they suspect is not relevant to themselves. Membership loyalty is likely to be eroded, further diminishing any theoretical economies of scale. If the decline in trade union membership is to be reversed, unions have to be perceived by potential members as relevant and expert. This is more likely to be achieved by specialist unions which, by nature of their specialism, are seen to be relevant; can allocate resources both democratically and rapidly because of limited competition for those resources; do not expend too high a proportion of their resources on internal bureaucracy; and can maintain a high level of professional, industry-related expertise. This is not to condemn union mergers, but to deny that they are inevitable or desirable - unless clear criteria of industrial logic are met.

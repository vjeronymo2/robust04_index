			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Yeltsin seeks aid promise RUSSIAN president Boris Yeltsin is this week to tell Mr John Major that the Group of Seven leading industrial countries must give an immediate commitment to support Russian economic reform or face the collapse of both the government and the reform process. Mr Yeltsin, who is due to meet the British prime minister in London on Thursday, is expected to ask for support of around Dollars 10bn to Dollars 12bn (Pounds 5.5bn to Pounds 6.6bn) in order to avert deepening economic chaos throughout the former Soviet Union. Part of the money would be to assist the Russian balance of payments and to provide currency for imports, especially of food, and about Dollars 5bn of it would be for a fund to stabilise the rouble. This is in spite of the view taken by G7 finance ministers and central bank governors at their weekend meeting in Garden City, New York, that it was too early to set up a stabilisation fund to underpin the rouble. They did not rule out such a fund in the future and British and US sides took opposing views on the issue. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, said he raised and pressed the question of a stabilisation fund for Russia in the hope that the G7 would commit itself to providing such a fund at a later date after suitable economic reforms had been carried out in Russia. The chancellor warned that the industrialised countries were likely to have to set up a fund or do something very similar in the longer term. The G7 did call for Russia and other former Soviet republics to become members of the International Monetary Fund by the end of April, a move that would give them access to IMF support programmes. It 'requested the IMF to act expeditiously to finalise by the spring meetings (of the fund at the end of April) the arrangements needed to complete membership proceedings' of those former Soviet republics that have applied to join. They are Russia, the three Baltic states, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Azerbaijan. The assistance Mr Yeltsin is seeking will be requested to be committed before Russia is admitted to full membership of the fund. Russian officials said at the weekend that this timescale was too slow. They would need funds assembled and available by March at the latest, rather than from May. A letter of intent from the Russian government to join the IMF is being thrashed out by both sides and is expected to be completed over the next four weeks, to go to the IMF board by March. Officials from the IMF and the G7 are concerned that the Russian government has not yet gained adequate control over the central bank, which has been issuing credits and currency freely, and that the fiscal system remains inadequate. The ministers came closer to agreement on the size of quota or membership subscription for the former Soviet republics. According Mr Don Mazankowski, the Canadian finance minister, the quota size could be 'anywhere from 3.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent' of the fund's total quotas. This would give the republics access to around Dollars 12bn from the fund to support approved economic reforms. It is thought in Moscow that Russia could count on immediate assistance of little more than Dollars 3bn - a sum far below what ministers there believe is needed for stabilisation. The US is strongly opposed to a rouble support fund at present. A senior US Treasury official said to set up such a fund prematurely would be to create a conduit for capital flight because there was insufficient confidence in the rouble. Mr Lamont admitted that much needed to be done in Russia but he said the G7 should take into account the courage of Mr Yeltsin's reforms in considering the stabilisation fund issue.

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Summer Rites: A Midsummer Night's tempest IT IS A commonplace of anthropology that symbolic activity, among primitive peoples, is practised as a means of realising deeply-nursed desires. There are no isobar charts in the jungle, but the savage believes that if he can perform a really contagious mime of rain falling from the skies, rain will fall. The civilised British likewise cherish the rain. It makes their grass green and their marrows plump. But when they call up the rain god, it is a much more oblique process. Rather than dance mimetic damp dances, or make loud gargling noises beneath a full moon, they seek to seduce the elements by challenging them. So they print invitations for Pimms and picnics and barbecues in mercurial June. They lug hampers to Glyndebourne. They commission the colossi of opera to bellow to thousands in Hyde Park. And, most impudently, most efficaciously of all, they stage Shakespeare alfresco. The bard, arguably, begged for it. To title a play A Midsummer Night's Dream invites every rain dancer in the land to try his luck. Not just in Regent's Park, but in little natural amphitheatres from Dover to Dunsinane. Wherever leafy backdrops make scenery redundant, there Puck and Oberon will plot their elvish mischief, their mischief being: to have us all drenched before the evening is out. But we, the audience, are made of sterner stuff. No matter that we are required to perch on the sort of slatted seat designed to corrugate all human posteriors. We are well-prepared for drama's pastoral mode. Against the icy fangs of a mid-July night, we have brought our tartan rugs, our woollies and our nips of whisky. Someone will kindly light a pipe or cigar, to keep the gnats at bay. And the first downpour only steels our resolve to see it all through. What we like to call the Dunkirk spirit flows generously. Huddled under nature's inadequate awnings, we buck each other up. 'Only a sprinkle,' we say cheerfully. 'Won't last long.' And some insightful person will inevitably voice the true anthropological purpose of all this: 'Just what the lawn needed]' The drama resumes. The rain has not dispersed us, but brought us into a closer, more comradely union. Those with fold-away plastic macs are a natural elite; those without improvise quite extraordinary prophylactics from Sainsbury's carrier bags. But we are equally determined to beguile the moist night with the advertised programme of entertainment. Our money's worth will be had, if it leads to pneumonia. We may have suspected that Bottom's asinine mask was made from old cornflake packets; now we know that it is. Wall wears his costume like a sandwich board; being absorbent, and easily streaked, this Wall has been thoroughly punished by the lord of rain. The lion roars soggily, and there is unwonted laughter when the King of Athens takes a tumble on the sodden boards. But one has to feel sorry for Titania's entourage - a dozen shivering six-year olds, drummed up from the local ballet school. Given no more than a few scraps of chiffon to cover their goose-pimpled flesh, they can only survive this initiation by scampering round like frenzied sprites. It must be very character-building for them. These fresh-air Thespians are exemplary. To strut a part in doublet and hose is demanding enough. To strut a part in soaked doublet and hose is pure heroism. As mortals and fairies unite to take the applause, mingled with thunder-claps, beneath the dripping greenwood tree, it is worth remembering the justification of these heroics. This is not the triumph of hope over experience. It fulfills a social function: it keeps the reservoirs full. So far as I know, Shakespeare never actually demanded of his players that they performed out of doors. But he must have had an inkling. The rain it raineth every day, he sings. And a hey, ho, hey nonny no, we bravely reply.</p>

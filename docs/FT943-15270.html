			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / The Group of Seven Summit: Clinton drops trade talks plan President Bill Clinton has been forced to abandon his plan to bulldoze a new round of multilateral trade talks on to the international policy agenda. The US backed off, this weekend, from proposals for a new round of talks on removing trade barriers in areas such as financial services, telecommunications and investment rules, under pressure from other Group of Seven members. But Mr Clinton won a commitment from the Naples summit to 'continue the momentum of trade liberalisation'. Mr Clinton floated his proposals in a letter to his colleagues just ten days ago, but ran into strong opposition from President Francois Mitterrand of France. Mr Mitterrand warned the prospect of a new round of trade negotiations could jeopardise the chances of persuading the French parliament to ratify the free trade measures just concluded in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, said the initiative could also raise problems for other European countries, as well as for developing nations such as India and Morocco. But the G7 leaders said the drive for freer trade could not stop with ratification of the Uruguay Round agreement. They agreed the trade issues left unresolved by the Uruguay Round should be taken up at a meeting this autumn of the 'Quad' trade ministers - a grouping of the US, Japan, Canada and the EU which overlaps with the G7 - and reviewed at next year's summit in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In fact, the country where ratification appears most in danger is the US, and Mr Clinton's initiative, dubbed 'Open Markets 2000', appeared designed to win over some wavering centrist members of Congress who worry the Uruguay Round agreements do not go far enough to liberalise trade in crucial areas such as telecommunications. Canadian and German officials indicated that the problem with Mr Clinton's initiative was not so much its substance, which all countries approved, as its last minute presentation.</p>

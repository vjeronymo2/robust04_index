			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ignacio Gutierrez A.] </F>   [Excerpts] President Bill Clinton's announcement of a new  strategy to combat drugs in the United States closely resembles  the recommendations that Mexico has always been making. It  involves not only combating drug production at its origin, but  also giving priority attention to preventive measures and the  drug traffic's sources of financing, as well as "money  laundering." This claim was made yesterday by the attorney  general of the republic, Diego Valades. [passage omitted]    He explained that this did not mean that the United States  will have a greater role in combating drugs within the national  territory, declaring categorically that this battle is incumbent  on Mexicans alone. Therefore, the role of DEA [Drug Enforcement  Administration] agents will continue along the same line,  without any change at present, and with no increase in the  numbers of personnel.    He remarked that Mexico is not currently receiving financial  aid to combat the drug traffic, stressing: "Our country is  fighting drugs with its own resources and its own decisions."  Nevertheless, he admitted that support of a technical and  informational type is, in fact, being received.    Diego Valades announced that the PGR [Office of the Attorney  General of the Republic] will assign these activities to an  additional 800 Federal Judicial Police agents, who will come on  duty within a maximum of five months. They will be devoted  exclusively to the narcotics area.    As for the flow of drugs to Mexico and the United States,  the  nation's attorney general reported that the figures have  remained stable, noting that one of the major concerns here is  heroin consumption. He added that, last month, one of the  largest shipments of that narcotic was seized, exceeding all  those for the past 15 years, totaling 120 kg. To highlight the  number, he noted that the confiscation used as the theme of the  film "Contact in France" amounted to 40 kg.    He then observed that, with the introduction of the  constitutional amendments to the Penal Code and the Code of  Penal Procedures, which have now established the legal category  of organized crime, Mexico can have access to a standard  instrument of a legal nature for more effectively combating  organized crime. He added that the most significant form of this  crime, because of its damaging effects, is represented by the  drug traffic.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAR VISTA GARDENS GIVEN $2 MILLION BY HUD;  </P> <P> HOUSING: THE 601-UNIT PROJECT IS ONE OF SIX IN LOS ANGELES RECEIVING FEDERAL  FUNDS TO MODERNIZE THEIR AGING FACILITIES.  </P> <P> As part of a major effort to modernize the city's aging housing projects, Mar  Vista Gardens has been awarded about $2 million in federal funds to remodel  kitchens and bathrooms, replace old electrical and plumbing fixtures, give each  unit a fresh coat of paint and build a community center.  </P> <P> Mar Vista, a 601-unit project that is home to more than 2,500 people, is one of  eight Los Angeles housing projects sharing in a $14.5-million grant from the  U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to refurbish low-income  apartments.  </P> <P> Mar Vista received the grant to complete renovations that were begun with an  earlier $6-million grant.  </P> <P> The effort to modernize the 35-year-old apartment complex for low-income  families has not been easy. The contractor hired under the original grant was  terminated this year for failing to complete the remodeling, leaving some  apartments without linoleum floors and with exposed pipes. A new contractor  will have to be hired.  </P> <P> Work to complete remodeling should begin within the next month and be completed  sometime next year, Housing Authority officials said.  </P> <P> "We have had some difficulty completing the work because a contractor wasn't  performing in a timely manner, so we had to terminate the contract and ask that  the work be completed under a bond," said Joseph Gelletich, assistant executive  director of the Housing Authority.  </P> <P> The delay has caused some concern among tenants, many of whom have been living  for a year with their apartments in a half-completed state.  </P> <P> "There is nothing modern about this work, it's primitive," said Odell Hadley, a  longtime Mar Vista Gardens resident who has been active in the community. "The  work has been shoddy, this is poor work. They don't care what kind of material  they put in here."  </P> <P> There was a black tar substance on the floor in Hadley's kitchen where the  linoleum had been ripped up for replacement more than a year ago. "You can't  walk on the floor in your bare feet, and if you wear socks, you'll never get  them clean," he said.  </P> <P> Hadley also complained that some of the plates protecting the light switches  were broken and that the cabinets installed in the kitchen were made of cheap  plywood.  </P> <P> Faustin Gonzales, who directs the Housing Authority's modernization effort,  said Dalton Construction Co. of Compton was unable to complete its contract  because of financial problems.  </P> <P> "The contractor completed about 70% of the work and left the rest in random  stages of development," he said. Dalton Construction could not be reached for  comment.  </P> <P> Gonzales said the Housing Authority became aware of the company's financial  difficulties as work on the project slowed to a trickle, vendors were  complaining about not being paid for supplies and employees were not receiving  salaries.  </P> <P> James Loving, project coordinator, said the contract was terminated at a point  when it was felt tenants would suffer the least.  </P> <P> "None of the tenants were left where they would suffer major inconvenience,"  Loving said. "Most of the units are substantially complete and the units are  functional. We made sure that no units got demolished. Mostly everything was in  finished stage and going through the cosmetic changes."  </P> <P> In the future, he said, contract schedules will be monitored more closely and  the Housing Authority plans to act sooner if contractors fail to live up to  their obligations.  </P> <P> In addition to fix-up projects, the Housing Authority plans to spend nearly  $500,000 on the construction of a community center where the city's Community  Development Department plans to provide job training and counseling services  for children "at risk."  </P> <P> "Within the center we plan to have all the services required by these children  to help them put their lives together," Gonzales said. "It will be a  partnership between the residents, the Housing Authority and the city's  Community Development Department."  </P></p>

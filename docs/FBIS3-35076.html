			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Yemeni Unity"] </F>   [Text] Some Arabs and their yellow press are giving  preference to the differences among the Yemeni brothers over  other issues. Some are even inflating these differences more  than the enemy. Some are trading in them, as if betrayal of the  homeland's unity is a profitable trade. Some become angry and  rancorous every time there are reports that the Yemeni brothers  are about to reach an agreement to contain their differences and  sign a document of pledge which will safeguard the dignity of  the one Yemeni homeland and maintain its great pride.    Some Arabs' hostility to all forms of unity wherever it may  be is an old but new hostility. We know that it is in their  interest to maintain this hostility. We also know that they are  not annoyed when they are accused of regionalism, conspiring  against unity, and of having a continuous willingness to strike  at the nation's dearest principles and convictions. It is  important for them to maintain their own interests, which  contradict those of the one Arab nation. It is also important  for them to hold on to their privileges and trivialities, which  harm the one nation's privileges. Therefore, they continue to  stand in the trench of fragmentation against the trench of  unity. They also continue to stand in the front of putrid  regionalism against the front of honorable supporters of  pan-Arabism. Their stand and press cannot but be a continuation  of their stands toward every unionist plan which carried great  hopes through the efforts of sincere people or which left behind  many wounds as a result of disappointment caused by those who  are hostile to these hopes as well as the unionist hopes and  aspirations.    Yemen's unity came as a painful strike to all Arab  separatists. The unionists' concern to protect and entrench this  unity harms those who used their press, money, movements, and  connections against the nation efforts to eliminate the elements  of its weakness, chief of which are division and fragmentation.  Therefore, we look forward to the meeting of Yemeni brothers in  Amman, the capital of reconciliation and accord, with joy, hope,  and optimism in order to achieve a big step on the road to  entrenching Yemeni unity and striking a strong blow to the faces  of the enemies who are most hostile to our unity, liberty, and  dignity. This takes place at a time when we need some joy after  the Gulf tragedy took away all our joy for reasons that are no  secret to anyone and with means that are known to all.</p>

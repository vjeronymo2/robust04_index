			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Grindlays pays Rs5bn in Bombay arbitration pact ANZ Grindlays Bank, the Australian-owned group involved in the Bombay securities scandal, has paid Rs5.06bn (Pounds 116m) to National Housing Bank (NHB), a central bank subsidiary, against seven disputed cheques in a package deal to refer the disputed transactions for arbitration, R C Murthy reports from Bombay. Grindlays held out for more than a month from complying with a directive of Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, to pay the money to NHB, which claimed Grindlays wrongly credited these seven cheques to the account of Mr Harshad Mehta, the broker involved in the Rs35bn securities scandal. The Australian bank had, however, honoured in May an earlier Reserve Bank directive to make a provision for the Rs5.06bn by bringing funds into India. Last month, Grindlays admitted at the hearings of a special committee of MPs to the breach of central bank regulations on forward trading in non-government securities. The securities scandal, India's worst, led to the liquidation of two small banks and losses for financial institutions. The deal envisages a panel of three arbitrators acceptable to both parties; and its verdict on the dispute would also be binding on both.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / How To Spend It: Rejoice, bosoms are back at the poolside - Summer is here, and Lucia van der Post has been browsing amid the latest lines in fashionable swimwear and garden goods for lazy days 'ENGLISH WOMEN are so refined,' goes Roy Campbell's famous couplet, 'They have no bosoms and no behind.' THIS was a view clearly endorsed until a few years ago by the British swimwear industry, which seemed to regard bosoms more as optional extras or vulgar inconveniences best ignored, disguised or flattened. As underwear has become more and more of an influence on mainstream fashion so the bosom has, at last, been properly reinstated and the latest swimwear does as much for the modern bosom as any of Esther Williams' ritzy numbers did for hers. Often the line between underwear, swimwear and even eveningwear turns out to be more a matter of semantics than anything tangible. There are bodies (for the uninitiated the body, a must-have these days in the fashionable wardrobe, is a clinging Lycra-based number, a cross between a foundation garment and a blouse) that double as swimsuits, and swimsuits that can also be bodies. There are bras that can be worn as bikini tops that are also corsets, and corsets that are also bustieres which can, and often are, worn under the chicest of dinner jackets. A range such as La Perla's, for instance, comes in solid colours with lots of tassels, beading and jewels drawing attention to the bust. All it takes is confidence - flaunt it during the day and it becomes daywear, put it under a sequinned jacket and it becomes a bustiere, dive into a pool and it is a swimsuit. So there. Part of the reason for the trend has been the invention and development of stretchy Lycra-type fabrics which have become the mainstay of the lingerie and swimwear industries as well as an essential ingredient in the skinny, figure-hugging dresses so beloved of Azzedine Alaia and his many imitators. But, besides the stretchy fabrics, the best of this year's designer swimwear also uses corsetry techniques more than ever before - underwiring, padding and clever stitching are all reminiscent of the corsetiere's art while the best, most modish of swimsuits feature proper built-in bras. Many swimwear makers deliberately give swimwear extra roles to play by offering ancillary pieces such as leggings, skirts, sarongs, shirts or cover-ups that can be quickly flung on for walking into a restaurant, for going shopping and even for a glam evening out. The trend, beginning with the exclusive, expensive designer names such as Giorgio di Sant Angelo, Gideon Oberson, Liza Bruce et al, has now become part of the strategy of the more accessible manufacturers as well. Even Marks and Spencer this season has a stunning black and white gingham swimsuit (seen photographed here above right) with a beautiful crafted, built-in bra for just Pounds 19.99. You could almost plan an entire holiday wardrobe around it. Seen here with matching Lycra Capri pants (Pounds 15.99), there are also shorts, skirts and shirts in the same gingham fabric, as well as the black PVC mac with the same gingham trim photographed here (Pounds 65.) At the other end of the design and price scale, Moschino has also used gingham, appliqued with fruits and flowers. Much of it can be teamed with other pieces in his collection. If you are tired of gingham you can go for his nautical look - all navy-blue and white or cream with lots of gilt - lots of fun. Slix, one of the leading swimwear companies, has always been good at seeing swimsuits as the basis of a holiday wardrobe and this year almost all its swimsuits come with a range of matching or mixing lycra Capri-style pants. Photographed above left is one of this year's designs - a daisy print two-piece bikini (Pounds 39) in a navy and white daisy print over which is shown shorts (Pounds 51) and a shirt (Pounds 75). Two of the best-known swimwear companies, Slix and La Perla both started life making underwear. Slix was a corsetry company in the mid-1930's and only moved into swimwear after the Second World War. For this season's collection, the fashionable swimsuit draws heavily on subtle corsetry techniques - the swimsuit rather than the bikini is the style to go for. The 1950s-style sweetheart necklines, sculpted accentuated bra-shaped tops (look at Slix's one-piece black velour swimsuit, above centre, Pounds 56), lots of colours and, in the case of designers such as Moschino and La Perla, lots of drama and fun as well. A good range of Slix swimsuits is stocked by Fenwick of Brent Cross and by House of Fraser stores.</p>

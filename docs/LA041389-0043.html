			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMITTEE OKS BILL TO BAN MOST ASSAULT GUNS  </P> <P> The Assembly Ways and Means Committee cleared the path Wednesday for the  Legislature to take a big step next week toward declaring California off-limits  to military-style assault weapons.  </P> <P> Over Republican opposition, the Democrat-dominated committee approved, 12 to 5,  and sent to the full Assembly the Senate version of a bill to ban most  semiautomatic combat firearms of the type that street gangsters and other  criminals favor.  </P> <P> The full Assembly is expected to consider the bill by Senate leader David A.  Roberti (D-Los Angeles) on Monday morning. Then later in the day, the Senate  plans to vote on a virtually identical bill by Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los  Angeles).  </P> <P> Republican Gov. George Deukmejian has indicated he would sign a bill outlawing  semiautomatic combat weapons. For years, the governor had been an opponent of  gun controls but he announced his opposition to assault rifles two days after  one was used on Jan. 17 to kill five children on a Stockton school playground.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sets Conditions  </P> <P> Deukmejian has said any bill he signs must be clear and draw a distinction  between assault guns and standard hunting or sporting firearms.  </P> <P> Roberti told the Ways and Means Committee that he had been in "close contact"  with assistants to the governor and they "have indicated to me a favorable  attitude on this legislation."  </P> <P> Roos and Roberti earlier had said the technical differences between the two  bills probably would be reconciled by a Senate-Assembly conference committee,  which would fashion the final product that goes to Deukmejian. But both  legislators suggested in recent days that agreement might be reached on one  bill or the other without having to go to conference.  </P> <P> Meantime, a group of gun owners, counseled by former Sen. H. L. Richardson  (R-Glendora), the leading advocate of the right to own firearms while he was in  the Legislature, mapped plans to mount an 11th-hour protest Monday against the  legislation.  </P> <P> Richardson said he told the organizer of the proposed "grass-roots"  demonstration, Thomas F. Metzger, publisher of a small conservative newspaper  in the Sierra foothill community of Placerville, to lobby in force inside the  Capitol.  </P> <P> "Inside, you band together in groups, go office to office and crowd up the  halls to let (legislators) know you are there," he said he advised Metzger.  "They really know you mean something if you show up."  </P> <P> Metzger said he had received calls from anxious gun owners throughout Northern  California asking what could be done to defeat the legislation. He said he  consulted Richardson and decided upon a lobbying effort in the Capitol rather  than a rally outside.  </P> <P> Metzger said the gun owners intend "to talk to some people who need their tail  twisted a little bit to get them to vote the proper way." He refused to  estimate how many people will participate Monday other than to say, "It's going  to be a lot more than 50."  </P> <P> Richardson said the effort will concentrate on the Assembly, which last month  passed Roos' version of the bill without a vote to spare. The Senate is  considered more receptive to the gun ban.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Intent of Measure  </P> <P> Starting Jan. 1, the legislation would make it a felony to manufacture, import,  sell or lend about 60 models of rifles, shotguns and pistols that the bill  lists as assault weapons. Violators could be sent to prison for up to 12 years.  </P> <P> The bills would establish a registration system for owners of such guns who  acquired them legally before June 1 of this year. These owners would have until  1991 to pay an unspecified fee and register them with the state Department of  Justice. Illegal possession of such a gun would be punishable by up to three  years in prison.  </P> <P> Possession of the assault guns generally would be restricted to the owner's  home or business and at legitimate target ranges, state-licensed shooting clubs  and certain exhibitions.  </P></p>

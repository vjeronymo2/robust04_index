			<p>BFN     [Text] First to Rwanda. The warring sides have begun a  process that is hoped will end the fighting which has left an  estimated half million people dead. Representatives of the  rebel and government armies held their first direct talks on  Monday [30 May] to discuss the draft cease-fire prepared by the  UN Mission in Rwanda. Meanwhile, there have been reports of  continued fighting and dramatic movement of refugees. The  Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC]  says the situation is getting worse by the hour. Dateline  [Swiss Radio current affairs program] asked ICRC representative  Tony Burgener about the importance of the talks on the  humanitarian situation.    [Begin recording] [Burgener] What we can hope is one point,  that definitely the humanitarian issue is brought up  immediately. I mean that it has to be--that it is going to  be--separated from the political talks, that this one is taken  into consideration. There are hundreds and thousands people now  stranded. They need assistance. We, the international  organizations, have to be enabled to bring in the food, the  water, the medical assistance, whatever is needed, to these  people. This has to be a point that has to be treated with  first priority.    [Unidentified correspondent] Do you have contacts with  either side in your efforts, in your program--relief program?    [Burgener] Of course, we are working in full transparency  with both sides. We are informing them [of] whatever we are  doing. This is absolutely necessary. We have to start talks on  high level with authorities on either side and this of course we  hope, facilitates our work also in the coming days, and that  also the awareness of the humanitarian disaster which is taking  place, not only in the area of Gitarama, of course. There are  other areas also in the FPR [Rwanda Patriotic Front] zone, where  hundreds and thousands of people are displaced, where also help  is needed. All this, of course, needs the full understanding of  both parties.    [Correspondent] What are the main difficulties in getting  supplies to the refugees? It seems that air supplies are  irregular at best coming into Kigali. What are the main  difficulties?    [Burgener] Well, it's even difficult to talk about about  main  difficulties. I mean, it's almost absolutely impossible to  bring in anything to this area right now since the roads are  blocked, the airport does not work, and after all when you see  this huge quantity of people who are staying around there--half  a million people--to find supplies for them is very very  difficult, the logistical problems which we are faced to [as  heard], all this gives us a real, real headache. It's very,  very difficult to bring in whatever they need, and they need  just everything. They need food, they need water, they need  medical assistance, they need also sanitary equipment because  there is a risk of epidemics. The only way to do it would be  probably from the western side, from Kibuye [on the shores of  Lake Kivu facing eastern Zaire], towards Gitarama. This road is  still open and we definitely will try our best to do whatever we  can do.    [Correspondent] Now, the thing is, Gitarama is a target for  the rebels in the fighting. How secure is Gitarama as a refugee  point?    [Burgener] Well, first of all, there is no way for them this  time to get out of this area. There is no other possibility to  go whatever place if it's not Kibuye. Definitely those who can  go further on of Gitarama they will try to do it. From that  point of view it's very important that both parties, all parties  understand that the humanitarian issue is very important, that  it has to be given priority when they are meeting today.

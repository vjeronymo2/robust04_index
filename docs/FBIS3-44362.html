China's GDP growth is expected to reach between 9 and 10  percent in 1994, three percentage points lower than last year,  an official with the State Information Centre said.    The Chinese Government believes a "moderate development in  the GDP" this year is a positive step towards calibrating the  nation's economic growth, said Wang Changsheng, deputy director  of the Centre's Economic Information Department.    Meanwhile, as it moves to unify its exchange rates, the  country's exports are expected to be stimulated this year. On  the other hand, import growth may fall from 1993 due to higher  costs.    Wang, whose centre is under the State Planning Commission,  told Business Weekly in an interview that China's exports might  reach $108 billion in 1994, representing an increase of some 14  percent from last year.    But its imports would only chalk up a yearly growth of 13  percent to reach nearly $116 billion this year.    This is because of many restraints like the higher exchange  rate and massive imports in 1993, have weakened State foreign  exchange reserves, he said.    "China should act with caution in 1994, as it needs a stable  financial market to pave the way for its bold reforms involving  taxes, exchange rates, accounting systems, and State property,"  he noted.    In order to enact further market reforms to spur sound  economic growth China has decided to allow its fixed assets  investment to grow by only 10 percent in 1994. If it does, it  will reach some 1.4 trillion yuan ($241.4 billion), allowing for  inflation.    The government believes it can manage its money supply and  market prices best if it slaps controls over fixed assets  investment, which became a factor fuelling both real estate  speculation and inflation in 1993.    Wang reiterates that a proper price environment is crucial  for the ambitious deregulatory packages being introduced by the  government.    But the government will ensure strong financial backing for  infrastructure projects, which aim to ease the country s  bottlenecks in the transportation, telecommunications and energy  sectors.    He predicted that retail sales in China will hit 1.63  tri11ion yuan ($281 billion) this year, a 21-per-cent increase.    And the inflation rate will also keep pace with retail sales  by hitting at least 10 per cent nationwide--and 15 percent in  the country's 35 largest cities.    But he warned that to hold the inflation rate within 10  percent will be a difficult task, as the country's economic  sectors, especially agriculture, still have many problems due to  the slow growth in farmers's income and high production costs.    The annual population increase of some 15 million people at  present, plus burgeoning food industries, have made it more and  more difficult for the grain producers to keep the country's per  capita grain ration from decreasing.    Unlike the service industry, which might chalk up a high  growth rate, both the agricultural and industrial sectors are  expected to see their development remain at around the same  level as last year.    The deputy director said agricultural output this year is  expected to chalk up a growth rate of 3.5 percent, the same as  last year.    Industrial output might reach 15 percent this year, down six  percentage points from last year.    But the service industry, which includes transportation,  finance, insurance, telecommunications, real estate,  information, technology and education, will see its output  growth hit 11 percent this year, up 1.5 percentage points from  1993.</p>

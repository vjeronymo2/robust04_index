			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Steel threat to global trade talks THE Uruguay Round of global trade talks has received a setback following the failure of leading steel producing nations this week to make progress on a multilateral steel agreement. The 36-nation talks, which began on Tuesday, broke up yesterday with no date set for the next meeting. The conclusion of a steel agreement by December 15, the deadline for the Uruguay Round, has been made a condition for eliminating all duties on imported steel between the main traders as part of a broader tariff-cutting agreement. In Washington, however, a US trade spokesman said no breakthrough had been expected at this week's multilateral steel talks. A source close to the talks said no substantive developments were likely until November. A multilateral steel agreement would eliminate direct barriers to trade in steel over 10 years and dismantle most subsidies to the troubled industry, barring those for environmental improvements, research and development, plant closure and retraining. However, to the anger of the European Community and other steel exporters, the US wants to retain the right to challenge these under its domestic anti-subsidy laws. Trade officials said the US had shown no softening of its position. This dashed hopes before the meeting that the decision by the US International Trade Commission last July to dismiss most of the 72 anti-dumping and countervailing-duty suits brought by US steel companies would create a better atmosphere. Failure to abolish steel duties could upset bargaining in other areas, such as improving market access across the range of goods and services. Market access problems are expected to head the agenda when Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, meets Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, in Brussels next Wednesday. EC negotiators claim that the US and Japan have failed to meet their promises to cut peak tariffs by 50 per cent and others by a third on average. So far Washington has offered 50 per cent cuts on only half its peak textile tariffs, and appears to be pinning its hopes on negotiations taking place between the US and EC textile industries on a tariff-cutting package. The US is still pressing the EC to agree to zero tariffs for wood, paper, non-ferrous metals and scientific equipment, and to reduce duties on a range of electronic products. Mr David Woods, the spokesman for Gatt, yesterday rejected claims by the Geneva-based European Broadcasting Union that inclusion of audio-visual services in the Uruguay Round would lead to the break-up of the European broadcasting system.</p>

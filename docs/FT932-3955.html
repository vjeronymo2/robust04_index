			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Observer: Plug pulled When his days of driving up and down the M4 in pursuit of a political career are done, Rhodri Morgan should apply to be a headline writer. The Labour MP for Cardiff West called Observer yesterday to leak a secret about the Llangollen conference centre, where in a few hours from now Premier Major is set to address whatever may be left of the Conservative party in Wales. Having heard that the venue had too few if any toilets, Morgan suggested that the lack was worth reporting under the headline: 'Major meets his Port-a-loo'. Nice one, Rhodri . . . but it isn't true alas. Llangollen's newly built Royal International Pavilion pulled the plug on the tale by saying that, besides having enough conference space for unlimited verbal outpourings, it has physical facilities sufficient for an attendance of 16,000 at least. So whatever the prime minister's effect on the 800 or so Welsh Tories expected, the drains should be able to cope.</p>

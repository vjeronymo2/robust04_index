			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Home loan rates set to fall: Lamont looks to regain economic initiative with one-point rate cut THE UK government yesterday took full advantage of the freedom conferred by a floating pound to cut interest rates by 1 percentage point, bringing them below short-term rates in Germany for the first time for more than 11 years. The effort by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to regain the initiative over UK economic policy was swiftly followed by announcements from banks and building societies that they would cut mortgage rates by around  3/4 of a percentage point. The move came less than a week after 'Black Wednesday' when the government had to suspend sterling from the European exchange rate mechanism, thereby abandoning the central plank of its economic policy . The decision to take rates to their lowest levels since mid-1988, was taken after consultations yesterday morning between the chancellor and Mr John Major, the prime minister. It is designed to raise the spirits of Conservative backbenchers ahead of tomorrow's emergency Commons debate on the economy. The move will also reinforce the impression at Westminster that Mr Major's priority now is to rebuild his support among Tory MPs, even at the expense of some higher inflation. The chancellor made it clear yesterday that he 'was not going to take any risks with inflation' and would raise rates again should price rises accelerate. The cut in commercial banks' base rates from 10 per cent to 9 per cent came shortly after the Bank of England reduced the rates at which it lends to the banking system just before 10am. The pound shrugged off the cut in interest rates, which had been widely expected in the City, although a bigger-than-expected rise in the German money supply dampened prospects of another early rate cut. Some industrialists and politicians warned yesterday that further reductions in borrowing costs were necessary to lift Britain from its longest recession for 50 years. Sterling closed in London up  3/4 of a pfennig on the day against the D-Mark at DM2.5450, but in late New York trading it was quoted at DM2.539. It was barely changed against the dollar in London at Dollars 1.7090, although it finished in New York at Dollars 1.695. The Leeds Permanent building society, with half a million borrowers, was the first of the big mortgage lenders to cut its basic rate by 0.75 per cent from 10.7 per cent to 9.95 per cent. The Abbey National followed with a pledge to cut mortgage rates by 'around 0.75 per cent', but the Halifax said it would wait to see how the markets settled before deciding by how much to reduce its lending rates. A reduction of 0.75 of a percentage point would take the average cost of a Pounds 30,000 mortgage down by just over Pounds 11 a month. Mr Lamont said the cut was justified on both fundamental economic grounds and recent sharp falls in inflation but he stressed he was determined to press on with the government's policy to reduce inflation. Yesterday's move is expected to lift some of the gloom stifling economic activity, but worse-than-expected trade figures came as a reminder of the difficulties facing the UK economy. Figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that the UK's deficit on visible goods, excluding oil and erratic items, was Pounds 1.7bn, its highest level for two years. It followed an underlying rise in import volumes to record levels and a levelling off in exports growth. The devalued pound could make imports more expensive, but will make exports more competitive. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said: 'While this interest rate reduction must of course be welcomed, it is essential that it is accompanied by immediate action to improve the long-term performance of the economy.'

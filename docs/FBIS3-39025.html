About 1,200 people gathered in silence in front of the  building to protest against ethnic cleansing, while some also  called for military intervention in the conflict.    The crosses and tombstones were due to be removed during the  night, despite protestors' hopes that they would be left in  place for a few days as a reminder that all the green spaces in  Sarajevo have been turned into cemeteries.    The organisers from a Strasbourg-based group say they intend  to mount similar protests "until peace returns to Bosnia".</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Call for rapid Chinese reform revives fears of over-heating MR LI PENG, China's prime minister, yesterday demanded even quicker reform of the Chinese economy, which grew by almost 13 per cent last year, prompting concerns about the danger of overheating. Speaking at the opening session of the National People's Congress, China's parliament, Mr Li outlined a sweeping programme of economic change aimed at strengthening market reforms and re-structuring the country's bloated state sector. But in a clear reference to concerns about bottlenecks in the economy due to extremely rapid growth in the past year, he also urged that a 'basic balance' be struck between supply and demand. China's economic planners fear renewed inflationary pressures such as those that undermined reforms in the 1980s. Indications of pressure on prices have already begun appearing in urban centres where double-digit inflation is being recorded. Mr Li's remarks about the economy, which accounted for about one-fifth of a two-hour speech, amounted to a careful endorsement of reforms initiated by Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's supreme leader, who was not present at the NPC, even though he is a delegate. Mr Li has tended to be identified with conservatives who have not shown boundless enthusiasm for Mr Deng's market-oriented reforms. Mr Li also said that: The economy, which surged 12.8 per cent last year, would continue to grow at 8 or 9 per cent annually, for the rest of the 1991-95 five-year plan. Growth had averaged 7.9 per cent for the past five years. Continued growth of 8 per cent to 9 per cent would ensure that China achieved well ahead of schedule its target of quadrupling Gross National Product between 1980 and the year 2000. China planned to slash its giant bureaucracy by about 25 per cent, and sharply reduce the number of government departments. Little detail was provided as to how this would be achieved. China would give particular attention in the next five years to strengthening infrastructure, service industries and agriculture. Mr Li, a cautious 64-year-old Soviet-trained technocrat who seems certain to be endorsed for another five-year term as premier, was unrepentant about the 1989 Tiananmen massacre in which hundreds of pro-democracy activists were shot by soldiers called in to quell the protests in and around the city's central square. 'Domestically, in late spring and early summer of 1989, a counter-revolutionary rebellion caused turmoil in Beijing,' he declared, adding that China had overcome 'numerous diff-iculties' in maintaining social and political stability and promoting economic and social development. 'Our great socialist motherland will stand firm as a rock in the east forever,' said Mr Li who is blamed by many Chinese for ordering the bloody crackdown on the pro-democracy protesters. China's NPC will run for about two weeks and, apart from endorsing revised economic growth targets, will also approve the election of new leadership personnel, including the appointment of a president or head of state - a post expected to be filled by party boss, Mr Jiang Zeming.</p>

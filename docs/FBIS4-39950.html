			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Our correspondent Mykola Marynenko has asked  Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov, head of the delegation  [of Ukraine at the Russian-Ukrainian Black Sea Fleet talks], to  comment on the Ukrainian side's position.    [Begin recording] [Marynenko] Esteemed Valeriy Mykolayovych,  talking about the Black Sea Fleet, you will probably agree with  me that this problem conventionally, as it were, falls into two  categories: Strictly speaking, these are the ships and the  infrastructure. This, at any rate, is how the mass media have  lately been reporting on all those problems associated, I would  like to underline, with the Black Sea Fleet. But, once again, I  have analyzed reports by the mass media, you know, and have  (somehow) come to the conclusion that the issue of the ships  also conventionally falls into two categories: While earlier we  spoke of the ships as having already been divided, we now say  that ships have already been counted, with so many to belong to  Russia and so many to belong to Ukraine after the division of  the Black Sea Fleet. I would like you to clarify the situation  with regard to the above problem, please.    [Shmarov] I think there are somewhat more problems than  those  enumerated by you. [passage indistinct]    I would like to return for a while to the origins of this  issue and recall that the negotiations have been held since 15  April when the Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and Russian  President Boris Yeltsin signed an agreement on this issue, where  it was noted that the navies should be separated within (quite)  a short time. [passage omitted]    As for the problems, problem number one is, (undoubtedly),  the amphibious means, or ships.    Problem number two is, certainly, the infrastructure that  you  mentioned, i.e. the (fleet's) shore infrastructure and  everything that is land-based, in this particular case, on the  territory of Crimea, with all the Black Sea Fleet's property  being considered such as the land-based airfields,  communications and combined-arms units, marines, and machinery  that belongs to these arms of service. This is a very large  number of complex facilities.    The third problem, I would say, is -- now, in addition to  what you named -- the problem of the (status of) bases, i.e. the  problem of bases and (the status) of bases. [passage indistinct]    The fourth problem, I would say, is the problem of the  people  who are now serving on board ships and in (inland) facilities.  They are today provisionally subordinate to the two presidents,  i.e. (subordinate) to two states and (are within) two states.  Today, however, their living conditions are more or less  (stationary), stable, while what we are proposing they do  tomorrow is something else, which again is quite a problem.  [passage indistinct]    As for broad coverage of this and large-scale  (advertisements) of our achievements, we agreed with the Russian  delegation not to make any general statements and not to provide  information for the general public, because what we have done by  now concerns people and today, when we have not finished yet and  have no final decision signed by the presidents, [to provide  that information] would be (like jumping the gun). So until  then, no doubt, we have no right to cause anxiety among the  people. [passage indistinct]    I can say, however, that, indeed, we have already carried  out  the final division of the fleet. I mean the final division,  rather than making a list. We proceeded from the fact that we  must form two fleets, rather than just splitting up materiel  according to the principle of accountancy, as it were, with the  remainder of the value being calculated etc. (Instead), we for  quite a long time have been working to create two fleets, two  forces, and I would not say it was simple. We believe that  those forces must jointly ensure both the security of Ukraine  (in the south) and, undoubtedly, the security of Russia and its  (strategic) interest in that theater or that basin, no doubt  communicating with each other, undoubtedly so. I think that  their future is a joint strategic mission. [passage indistinct]    The main position of ours on this issue is this: First, our  unalterable principle is that everything that is on the  territory and soil of Ukraine and the territory of (Crimea) is  the property of Ukraine. We acted in accordance with that  principle from the outset of the negotiations [words indistinct]  and we cannot offer anything other than that, because this is  what is required by our laws and this is how our state wants it  today. That is our property. [passage omitted]    [Marynenko] Does the Russian side realize how much renting  this infrastructure, that you once again said belongs to Ukraine  and the people of Ukraine, will cost?    [Shmarov] I do not think it does in terms of specific  figures, because it was not practiced in the former union.  [passage omitted]    Now, as for the bases. It is a common secret that the bases  of the Russian Navy and those of the Ukrainian Navy are the  stumbling block at these negotiations.    At the first stage, Russia unconditionally pushed for  Ukraine  to base its Navy in Odessa or Nikolayev and that was that. They  did not even want to talk about Crimea. Understanding the  importance of these negotiations and searching for ways of  resolving this problem by peaceful means, as it were, i.e. by  way of negotiations, the Ukrainian side, on the other hand,  after all, consented that, all right, let Sevastopol be the  Russian Navy base. At the same time, however, Ukraine proposed  that other bases in that very Crimea belong to Ukraine.    [Marynenko] Tell me please, at this meeting with the Russian  side, was understanding reached, as it were, or is the problem  still quite complex?    [Shmarov] [Words indistinct] I have already said that we are  definitely making headway. [passage indistinct] [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Tolga Sardan report: "Iran Supports Turkey's Military </F> Operations"]    [Text] Ankara--It has been ascertained that four Iranian  battalions have been supporting Turkish military operations  against the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] militants on the Agri  and Tendurek Mountains for some time now.    A MILLIYET correspondent has been informed that the security  forces know that several PKK militants crossed into Iran after  being pressed down by the military forces' operations carried  out in the Agri and Tendurek Mountains over the past four  months. Acting on that information, the Internal Affairs  Ministry officials asked their Iranian counterparts to establish  a "control line" [kontrol hatti] in the region. Earlier, the  Iranian Administration promised to support Turkey's struggle  against the PKK. This promise was made during the joint  security committee meetings between the two countries.  Considering Turkey's request, Iran transferred four battalions  to an area in the vicinity of the Agri and Tendurek Mountains to  maintain security along the border between the two countries 10  days ago.    The officials disclosed that the measures taken by the  Iranian military forces along the border have prevented the PKK  groups, which have sustained severe blows in the mountainous  region, from crossing into Iran. A high-ranking official said  Iran's support was very important for the "mop up" operations.  He asserted: "Iran's transfer of troops to the operations zone  was a second gesture by that country. That is an indication  that the relations between the two countries on security matters  are improving."    It should be recalled that Iran arrested a group of PKK  militants and handed them over to Turkey some time ago.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Naha, Feb. 24 KYODO -- The Okinawa branch of the  Naha District Court on Thursday [24 February] ordered the state  to pay a total of 807.45 million yen in compensation to 768  residents around the U.S. Kadena Air Base for noise pollution  caused by aircraft using the base. Thursday's decision,  however, rejected demands for a halt to night flights at the  base in line with Supreme Court decisions in February last year  involving Yokota Air Base in Tokyo and Atsugi Naval Air Facility  in Kanagawa Prefecture.    A total of 907 residents had demanded a halt to flights to  and from the Kadena base between 7 P.M. and 7 A.M., 1.15 million  yen each in damages for noise-related suffering and compensation  for future annoyance until a night flight ban is realized.    Judge Hiroshi Segi ruled that the noise pollution at the  base  had "exceeded the level of tolerance" of the residents. Segi  said the noise was detrimental to the residents' mental health  because of disruptions to their sleep and feelings of discomfort  caused by it.    In rejecting the call for a ban on night flights, however,  he  said the actions of the U.S. military do not fall within the  dominion of the Japanese state.    Regarding the public nature of the base as argued by the  defending lawyers, Segi said that as an important facility for  the defense of the nation, the base could be recognized in a  general sense as public in nature. He added, however, that the  argument cannot be considered seriously in the decision on the  tolerance level of the noise.    Defense lawyers had argued that the noise levels were  tolerable given the public nature of the base.    Lawyers for the residents had argued over 55 hearings that  the noise had led to headaches, hearing difficulties and other  health problems among the residents and stressed that it was a  violation of the residents personal rights and right to peaceful  existence.    Kadena Air Base is under the control of the 18th Tactical  Fighter Wing and is considered a key base of the U.S. Air Force  in East Asia.</p>

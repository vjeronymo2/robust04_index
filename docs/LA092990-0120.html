			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> CITY TO CONTINUE MEETING NOTICES  </P> <P> Although the city is no longer required by state law to provide residents with  advance notice of all public meetings, the City Council passed a resolution  guaranteeing that residents will continue to receive notices at least three  days before all council meetings.  </P> <P> State legislators ruled earlier this year that because of cuts in the 1990-91  state budget, cities were no longer obligated to post agendas 72 hours before  meetings as required by the Brown Act requiring open meetings.  </P> <P> The resolution states that the city will continue "its existing practices  concerning notices and information concerning public hearings and meetings  without regard to the modifications recently enacted by the Legislature."  </P> <P> According to a report by Assistant City Atty. Luis Rodriguez, cities such as  Huntington Beach, Tustin and Los Angeles have also passed resolutions  reaffirming their obligations under the Brown Act. MARY HELEN BERG  </P></p>

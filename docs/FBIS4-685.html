			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jono Waters] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 13 SAPA -- Although things would  not improve overnight, the benefits of a government of national  unity would show within six months and the levels of violence  would fall, State President F W de Klerk said on Wednesday [13  April] evening. "Heaven won't suddenly descend on South  Africa," Mr de Klerk told Radio Metro. He said he believed  people's expectations were too high.    However, a government of national unity would focus on the  needs of the people to improve living conditions and the  economy. "And, I think that within six months, already show  some results. But it won't be wonders. It will take a year,  two years, three years, five years and with regard to some of  the problems even longer to really reach a much more ideal  situation."    He said he expected the levels of violence to fall  "tremendously" after the elections. "After the elections much  of the cause of much of the violence ...the strife, the high  political tensions will come down and will be removed. And life  will be normalised to a great extent and people will take up  with their ordinary lives and their ordinary activities."    However, Mr de Klerk said he did not think South Africa  would  be totally free of violence "for a long time" because there were  radical groups to the right and left who were "not happy with  the success of peaceful change and who have their own agendas".    He said a government of national unity would take "strong  steps" against perpetrators of violence. "We will have to fight  it with everything at out disposal."    Asked about the right-wing setting up their own local  government councils, Mr de Klerk said it was an interesting move  because there was little difference between African National  Congress civics and the right's "burgerraads" [citizen  councils]. "They are taking a page out of the ANC's books."    The state president said the right-wingers were making  political statements at the moment, but if they interfered with  the business of the municipalities "firm action" would be taken  against them. "If they try to usurp the powers of the  lawfully-elected and constituted municipalities, they will get  into trouble with the law and we will apply the law."</p>

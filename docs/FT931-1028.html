			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / The Coal White Paper: Big power users may cut costs MR MICHAEL Heseltine announced the creation of an energy commission of independent experts to advise the government on developments in the industry. It will also contribute to an annual energy report which will provide relevant business information on the now largely privatised energy industries. The government also gave some hope to large energy users when it said it was considering allowing them to bypass the electricity pool - the wholesale market for electricity. This would allow the users to sign direct contracts with the generators and avoid the fluctuations in pool prices. This would lead to a reduction in their electricity costs. The pool authorities are also considering whether to give large users a cost incentive to shift their electricity demands to off-peak periods. Mr Heseltine refused to restrict the growth of gas-fired power generation to increase the market for coal, although he has provided a subsidy for coal so that the industry can compete with world prices. He confirmed the timetable for increasing competition in the electricity market from 1994 - designed to achieve an open market by 1998. There will be no restriction on sales of electricity from France. There was also relief for the nuclear industry. The government said it saw no reason to force Nuclear Electric to close its Magnox stations, but it is bringing the nuclear review forward by a year. Gas-fired generators say gas will be able to compete with subsidised coal. 'It's the best we could have expected, given that there is a need for transitional arrangements for coal,' said Mr David Lewis, director of Enron Europe, the UK arm of the large US gas company.</p>

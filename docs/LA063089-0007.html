			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AIR PATROL SQUADRON TO GET A NEW ROOST  </P> <P> The Civil Air Patrol's Cadet Squadron No. 107 in Torrance will be getting a new  place to roost after being forced from its aerie at the Torrance Airport in  March.  </P> <P> City officials and the cadet squadron have signed a lease that will give the  squadron a 2 1/2-acre parcel of airport land for $1 a year.  </P> <P> Under the terms of the 20-year lease, the volunteer-run organization has 2 1/2  years to build two new aircraft hangars, plus classroom and meeting facilities,  at the site on the airport's eastern end, said Roger Griffin, an 18-year member  and former squadron commander.  </P> <P> The squadron hopes to pay for the facilities, totaling about 6,000 square feet  and costing an estimated $100,000, through fund-raising drives and donations,  Griffin said.  </P> <P> The organization had its headquarters in buildings and a hangar at the Torrance  airport since 1979. But the squadron was forced to leave its 7,000-square-foot  facility when city officials decided to tear down the buildings on the site,  which faces Crenshaw Boulevard, and replace them with a commercial development,  Griffin said.  </P></p>

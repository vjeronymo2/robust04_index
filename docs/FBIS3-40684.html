But over a  period of just seven years, GATT rapidly made the descent from  the realm of arcane international diplomacy, to the domain of  popular demonology. From being the preserve of the stodgy  bureaucrat, GATT became in quick time, the demagogue's dream.    But the time for fantasies ran out on December 15. After  blowing hot and cold for seven years, with the principals now  engaging one another in negotiations, then breaking off in  acrimony--117 nations acceded on that day to an omnibus  agreement that will govern international trade into the  foreseeable future. The final accord was pushed through merely  because the major players of the world trade game--the United  States, the European Union and Japan, principally--knew they  could not afford the costs of failure.    India, as one of the developing countries which are sought  in  vain to establish a position in GATT, came out of it with little  to celebrate. A very qualified victory came its way with the  commitment by contracting parties to phase out quotas on textile  exports within 10 years. India also managed to fight off a  last-breath offensive by the European Union and the United  States, to open up its markets in textiles to foreign  manufacturers. That battle was won with a well-argued case and  neatly-constructed logic--attributes that have over the current  round of GATT talks won the Indian negotiators high marks. But  the joint European Union-U.S. offensive was perhaps in the  nature of a diversionary manoeuvre. Having beaten back this  attack, India signed on the dotted line without demur--its  concerns over the long-term consequences of the deal temporarily  outweighed by relief over a short-term victory.    Within India, preparations for accession to GATT had  proceeded inconspicuously, but with an unmistakable sense of  purpose. Parliament was in session as the deadline approached.  And this proved an unavoidable irritant for the Government.  Though the Government is accorded the unfettered right to accede  to any international treaty, it perhaps imagined that some  concessions to parliamentary sentiment would be prudent.    As soon as Parliament got down to transacting business in  the  current session, a debate on the GATT talks was scheduled.  Expectedly, Opposition members traversed ground that had already  been well covered, holding forth on the dangers to the country's  sovereignty implicit in the GATT treaty. And in an  all-too-familiar litany, the Government responded with its own  perceptions--affirming that on balance the Dunkel Draft Text of  the GATT treaty promised a net gain to the country.    Following this, the report of the Standing Committee of  Parliament attached to the Ministry of Commerce was tabled. In  an exhaustive document which counselled extreme caution upon the  Government in accepting certain of the Dunkel proposals, the  sections that gained publicity were dictated by convenience. The  Standing Committee had refrained, considering the constitutional  position, from insisting on any kind of a parliamentary right to  vet the GATT treaty before the Government took a decision on  accesion. The constitutional position in this regard is fairly  clear--the conclusion of international treaties is an executive  privilege. Parliament has the right of scrutiny, but no power of  veto or sanction.    Secondly, the Standing Committee had observed that on  balance  India would be better served by remaining within the  multilateral framework of rules that GATT imposed. In a package  so elaborate, it was inevitable that there would be elements not  quite to the liking of the country. But withdrawal from the GATT  forum would make the country especially vulnerable to political  arm-twisting. The U.S. proclivity to extract some political  concession in return for granting a partner country the Most  Favoured Nation (MNF) status in trade deals could take a heavy  toll of the country's room for autonomous action. Remaining  within GATT ensured at least that the MFN status was granted  automatically, as matter of right.    If these were all that the Standing Committee had said, then  the Government would have been on a safe wicket in authorising  the Indian negotiators at GATT to appeal their signatures to the  deal. But as soon as word had gone out that the Government had  given its assent, Parliament broke out in a storm of outrage. In  the ensuing babble, the one phrase that came through with some  clarity was that the Government had "sold the country out."    Eager to limit the damage, Commerce Minister Pranab  Mukherjee  made an appearance in Parliament, stoically reading out a  prepared statement through the din of Opposition voices. The  Government had made certain commitments to Parliament and the  people, he said. And these had all been met. There was no going  back on any of the assurances that the Government had held out  in relation to the GATT talks, he claimed. Though India's gains  were not unequivocal, there was no gainsaying that on balance  the country stood to improve its foreign trade on account of the  new framework of GATT rules. A few concessions had been made in  certain areas to ensure concord and cordiality in the  multilateral trading system. This was no more than the normal  give-and-take of international negotiations.    The Minister's words failed to carry much conviction. The  provisions of the Dunkel Text are far-reaching and wide. The  areas in which the country has serious apprehensions--which yet  remain undispelled--are many. To say that the country can afford  to yield ground on issues like patents in return for major  concessions in the area of agriculture, would seem to beg the  question, as long as the gains in the latter sphere remain  uncertain and unquantified.    The consensus on the Dunkel provisions on agriculture  appears  to be that it will not radically hurt Indian price-support  operations. Member-nations of GATT are expected to make an  estimate of the aggregate measure of support (AMS) given to  agriculture--roughly speaking, the AMS would be equivalent to  the subsidy component as a proportion of the total value of  output. AMS to the extent of 10 per cent is permissible under  GATT rules.    However, the developed market economies are bound by very  different compulsions. They are committed under the GATT rules  only to reducing their export subsidies by a certain  figure--typically around 20 per cent. Concurrently, the quantum  of subsidised exports is to be cut by 36 per cent. This still  leaves the core of the issue of agricultural protectionism  unresolved. And even if India should hope to gain a share in the  world market for agricultural products, it should be disabused  by the stringent sanitary and phyto-sanitary norms imposed under  the new GATT deal.    Pretending that all is well does not help in evolving  survival strategies to cope with the regime of draconian trade  controls that the latest GATT treaty imposes. There is little  gainsaying that the concerns expressed by various responsible  commentators in the areas of patents in particular, are of  sufficient moment to warrant serious consideration. And it is  also a fact that GATT is a loose treaty, which provides ample  room for fudging. Where the Government is involved in an  elaborate pretence that all is well, there is little likelihood  of this room for manoeuvre being exploited.    Witnesses before the Select Committee on the Dunkel Text had  put forth a series of suggestions on how the Government could  evade some of its most draconian provisions. For one thing, the  patent regime envisaged seeks to reverse the burden of proof,  putting on the defendant the onus of proving that he has not  violated a patent. This reverses one of the fundamental tenets  of Indian jurisprudence, which puts the burden of proof on the  plaintiff rather than the defendant. Under the Dunkel Text, a  product would be assumed to be made by a patented process,  unless proven otherwise. This is the sense in which the "product  by process patent" of the Dunkel Text marks a drastic shift from  the concept of "process patent" which is a fundamental tenet of  the Indian Patents Act.    Certain witnesses appearing before the Select Committee  observed that if amendments to the Indian patents law were to be  made in line with this requirement, the result would be  repugnant to notions of natural justice. Some of them suggested  that suitable countervailing provisions be built into the  Evidence Act to check possible abuses of the legal system using  the reversal of the burden of proof. This would minimise abuses,  and put the brakes on disruptive litigation.    Another requirement of the Dunkel Text, that importation of  a  product into a country be deemed equivalent to the working of a  patent, has understandably created much disquiet. Under the  Indian Patents Act the public authority is empowered to sanction  the "compulsory licensing" of production in the case of patents  that fail to be worked. The Dunkel Text renders the  circumstances which warrant resort to the compulsory licensing  provision so restrictive as to virtually do away with this as an  element of public policy.    Concerns have been expressed that without the goad of  compulsory licensing, patent-holders will capitalise on the  monopolies that the law confers on them. And in matters of vital  public interest, as for instance in the drugs and  pharmaceuticals industry, the implications could be  disastrous--unaffordable drugs for the mass of consumers, and  immense private profiteering at the cost of the social good.    The solution put forward by various witnesses before the  Select Committee was that the Monopolies Act should be  strengthened to deal with such eventualities. This would  introduce a major qualification to the unfettered right of  importation enshrined by the Dunkel Text. And while seeming to  accede to most provisions of the new treaty, India could build  up sufficient safeguards through sections of the law that are  not directly covered by the GATT discipline.    These are strategies of survival that could dilute the  thrust  of the GATT offensive. At a certain stage it is obvious the  stratagems will be seen through. But GATT is a loose treaty  which is observed more often in the breach. According to recent  estimates, no more than half of the total world trade is covered  by the provisions enshrined in GATT, and India's dependence on  MFN trade is also of a similar magnitude. GATT provides a  certain degree of latitude to most participant countries. Some  like India have been using this latitude with great discretion.  Others like the United States have been brazen in their resort  to quantitative import restrictions and coercive trade  diplomacy--all in violation of GATT norms.    The hyperbole about a new dawn for multilateral trade needs  to be viewed against the actual context of the U.S. behaviour  over the last two decades or so. When the United States began to  lose its manufacturing edge, it was the first to impose  voluntary export restraints (VERs) on competitors such as Japan.  These restrictions came thick and fast, starting in sectors such  as steel, and going on later to automobiles and semiconductors.  As the largest market in the world, the United States was at  liberty to frame its own rules. And where other countries  refused to play by these rules, it could resort to the kind of  coercive diplomacy implicit in provisions such as Super 301 and  Special 301 of its Trade Act.    The basic structural features of the world economy which  contributed to the U.S. economic woes of the 1980s, remain  unmitigated. To expect GATT to serve as a panacea is  unrealistic, especially when the counterpart agreement on  services trade remains an ambiguous entity. The Dunkel Text adds  a significant number of new weapons to the U.S.' trade armoury.  But the United States is likely to be obliged at some stage to  step beyond the ambit of the Dunkel Text, to force its will upon  recalcitrant trading partners.    Former Foreign Secretary Muchkund Dubey put it very well in  the course of his deposition before the Select Committee. Asked  about the future of multilateralism, he answered that the  concept was always something of a myth. What is emerging in the  current world scenario, he suggested, is "a hotchpotch of a  highly qualified multilateralism, discriminatory regionalism,  and arbitrary bilateralism."    Far from benefiting from this kind of a shrewd reading, the  official Indian response seems so far to be mired in a variety  of wishful thinking--as with the official prognostication that  the gains to India from accession to GATT would be of the order  of $2 billion. That the figure is no more than a fantasy hatched  by some fevered brain in the Government became apparent when  Pranab Mukherjee proved unable to defend it at his first press  conference since the GATT deal was signed.    Shortly afterwards, Mukherjee flew out to Brussels to  initial  a trade protocol, under which India stands to gain certain  special concessions in the European market. Official spokesmen  were initially very unclear about the advantages the agreement  conferred on India. Some said, unconvincingly, that the protocol  would give India MFN status, forgetting that accession to GATT  conferred this status as a matter of routine. Others said the  protocol would help India expand its trade with the European  Union under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP)--which  is a special concession granted on a bilateral basis.    To mitigate the rigours of the new rules, India perhaps  needs  itself to take recourse to the kind of "discriminatory  regionalism" and "arbitrary bilateralism" that fetched the  United States rich dividends in the GATT talks. India has so far  been at the receiving end. Its survival as a viable trading  nation and economy will now depend upon whether it is able to  give as well as it gets.</p>

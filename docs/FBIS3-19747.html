			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Osman Ulagay: "`Ciller Risk' Depresses Turkish </F> Lira"    [Text] Turkey is a country of opportunities, a  country that likes to take risks, a country of desperate people.  Only in such a country would Tansu Ciller, without even minimal  administrative experience, have the chance to become prime  minister.    Making Mrs. Ciller prime minister was a very risky  investment. As in all risky investments, those who hoped to be  the big winners were the ones who portrayed Ciller as the  "savior."    Unfortunately, these hopes were not realized. Quite the  opposite, Turkey has become a country where the risks of Mrs.  Ciller's administration are steadily growing. Actually, the  collapse of the Turkish lira and spiraling interest are the  results of this growing risk.    At the point where we are now, the risk of continuing with  Mrs. Ciller and this government increases every day and is  reflected in the marketplace. It seems nearly impossible to  eliminate this risk and turn this negative course around.    Even those in the business world and finance sector where  almost everyone has lost morale, who were laid back just two  months ago, saying, "Oh, really, is the country going under  again?" are now frowning and worrying, "Where are we going, how  are going to get out of this mess?"    Various solutions are being proposed in seeking an answer to  this question. For example, many agree that the only way out of  the impasse in the economy and financial markets is through a  medium-term program. The following are the major conditions  necessary for such a program to be successful:     -  This program  would be based on as widespread as possible a social compromise,  or consensus.    -  A well-informed and experienced team would prepare  this program.    -  A government that would not be frightened by daily  problems into swerving from the program and that would be  determined not to make concessions would implement this  program.    -  The government would be fully trusted to carry out the  program.    Now let us think sincerely: Which of the conditions  necessary  to prepare and implement such a program can the Ciller  government fulfill?    Can this government, which cannot even reach consensus on an  Ataturk rally, be expected to reach a consensus on a  stabilization program requiring the fair distribution of heavy  obligations?    Mrs. Ciller has no one in her stable who is knowledgeable  and  experienced.    Recently, Mrs. Ciller has pursued only those things oriented  to saving the day and earning her political points. She is  trying to use the state-owned banks in a way that totally  violates the concept of a stabilization program.    No one trusts the Ciller government anymore. Mrs. Ciller,  who  is at the point of not knowing what to do, is believed to be  under the influence of various interests and circles.    Every measure this government would take would, in this  climate, be met with suspicion and everyone would ask, "Who is  it for?"    In a climate in which "devaluation" and "consolidation" are  on the agenda, everyone seeks ways to escape the calamity.    The concern that Mrs. Ciller may take on new adventures at  home or abroad feeds the climate of instability.    In short, the "Ciller risk" is preventing a solution and  devaluing the Turkish lira.</p>

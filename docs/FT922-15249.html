The disposals include two group occupied properties - at Braintree, Essex, and Wantage, Oxfordshire - for Pounds 22.75m. Both have been leased back to group companies at initial rents amounting to Pounds 2.6m per annum. The remaining properties - three office buildings, two industrial estates and a retail park - will realise Pounds 16.2m.

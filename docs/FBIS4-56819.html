			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Noel Irias] </F>   [Text] In a summons that exceeded all expectations, an  assembly of more than 600 Sandinist professionals and  technicians was held yesterday to discuss the FSLN [Sandinist  National Liberation Front] congress, the crisis within this  organization, and its possible solutions.    Most of these professionals did not participate in the rank  and file discussions of reforms to the party statutes.    Generally speaking, the participants who spoke called  themselves members of "no particular current" or "dispersed  Sandinists."    Speaking on behalf of the Majority current, Carlos Fernando  Chamorro said it was necessary to create spaces to allow a  regrouping and political expression of dispersed Sandinists.    Chamorro said professionals and technicians should "be  viewed  in the Sandinist ranks as individuals that have the right to  speak and to decide, not as instruments of a group of  enlightened."    Upon explaining the position of the current of which he is a  member, Chamorro insisted "the renovation of the FSLN must  continue; it must go beyond Congress."    Among those present, attorney Gonzalo Carrion and  sociologist  Luis Mora expressed their opposition to the currents. In  particular, Luis Mora harshly criticized the Majority's position.    Prominent businessman Jose Dolores Gomez said he is strongly  "opposed to a continuation of the same leadership in the FSLN."    Angela Rosa Acevedo and Mayra Pasos insisted women should  have more opportunities for power within the party.    Silvio Prado proposed to declare a permanent session and  establish communication networks as part of the current  political debate in the FSLN.  <H5>  Delegates From the Leftist Current Did Not Attend </H5>   The results of a poll among the 216 participants has  revealed  that most of the participants believe it is necessary to change  the name of the National Directorate, to legalize currents of  opinion, and to establish a single category of FSLN members.    Most participants also expressed their support for the civic  methods of protest, territorial election of Sandinist candidates  to public office, and power quotas for youths and women.    According to Dr. Alejandro Martinez Cuenca, who organized  this event, the original idea was to hear statements from two  representatives of each current and then hear the proposals of  participants, but the delegates from the Democratic Left did not  show up.    Martinez explained Julio Lopez Campos and William Grigsby,  spokespersons for the Democratic Left current, and Conapro  [National Confederation of Professional Associations] President  Felix Contreras were convoked to participate in the debate.    Both Martinez Cuenca and moderator Mario Flores expressed  regretted over the nonparticipation of the delegates of that  current.  <H5>  Henry Ruiz: The Most Popular Candidate </H5>   The organizers of the event circulated a survey on the main  reforms to the FSLN's statutes and on the candidates to the  highest positions of leadership within the organization.    The participants filled out 477 answer sheets, and by the  time we went to press 216 sheets, namely, 45 percent, had been  processed. These partial results were presented by Martinez  Cuenca.    According to 47 percent of those whose replies were  processed, the possible candidates to the FSLN leadership would  be, according to the number of votes, Henry Ruiz, Sergio  Ramirez, Dora Maria Tellez, Daniel Ortega, Doris Tijerino, Luis  Carrion, Mariano Fiallos, Monica Baltodano, Tomas Borge, Daniel  Nunez, Carlos Fernando Chamorro, and Fernando Cardenal.    In addition, Alejandro Martinez, Victor Tinoco, Carlos  Tunnermann, Mirna Cunningham, Alejandro Serrano, Leticia  Herrera, and Vilma Nunez appeared on the survey.    Approximately 40.3 percent of those polled said the highest  FSLN post should be occupied by Henry Ruiz, 18.1 chose Sergio  Ramirez, and 17.1 percent preferred Daniel Ortega.    Regarding the second highest party position, those polled  preferred Henry Ruiz, with 14.4 percent, Dora Maria Tellez, with  13 percent, and Daniel Ortega, with 12.5 percent.    The assembly was presided over by Alejandro Martinez Cuenca,  Ernesto Medina, rector of the Unan [National Autonomous  University of Nicaragua]-Leon Branch, Dr. Edgar Morin, attorney  Linda Baez, architect Mario Flores, Ramiro Bermudez, and Dr.  Benedicto Meneses.    Medina closed the assembly by reflecting upon the issue of  tolerance within Sandinism.  <H5>  JS [Sandinist Youth Association] To Hold An Assembly </H5>   In addition, Larry Astorga, JS spokesman, reported yesterday  that group will hold a forum on 13 May to discuss and approve a  proposal of policies for the sector the FSLN must include.    They will also discuss a proposal of political positions of  the JS on the FSLN, Astorga added.    Meanwhile, the Sandinists grouped in the university  organizations will hold a similar working session on 17 May.</p>

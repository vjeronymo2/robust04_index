The studies were performed in the morning on 90 unfed  nonpedigree male rats that weighed 210-320 g each and that had  been anesthetized with nembutal (0.1 g/kg injected  intramuscularly). A photometry-based method was used to record  the phase contractile activity of the wall and the motor  activity of the valves of lymphatic microvessels located in  three segments of the mesentery: the ``transparent'' section,  the section around the adipose tissue at the periphery of the  mesentery, and in the adipose tissue itself. The microvessels  studied ranged from 30 to 300 m in diameter. During the  course of the studies, leu-enkephalin, naloxone hydrochloride,  dalargin, and adrenalin hydrochloride were applied to the  surface of the lymphatic microvessels in doses of 0.004 to 40.0  g per kilogram of the animal's weight in 0.1 ml of a 0.14 M  sodium chloride solution. Computer processing of the study data  confirmed that the lymphatic microvessels of the rat mesentery  do not contract rhythmically either spontaneously or under the  effect of opioid peptides. Leu-enkephalin and dalargin (40  g/kg) increased contractile activity to different degrees.  Leu-enkephalin mainly affected the valves: It activated the  frequency and doubled the amount of time for which the cusps  were closed. It had a lesser effect on the microvessels' walls  but did increase the duration of each contraction. Dalargin, on  the other hand, did not affect the valves even 30 minutes after  application but did activate the walls of the lymphatic vessels.  The combination of the opiate receptor antagonist naloxone or  adrenalin with leu-enkephalin, both soon (15-20 minutes) and  long (1.5-2 hours) after application, caused the walls of the  lymphatic microvessels to be hypersensitive to nonspecific  stimuli (a physiological solution of sodium chloride or air  stream). Adrenalin and naloxone modulated the lymph-stimulating  effect of leu-enkephalin and dalargin by inhibiting the  lymphatic microvessels' contractile activity.

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Jaguar will make 200 redundant A FURTHER 200 workers will lose their jobs at Jaguar, Ford's luxury car subsidiary, by the spring. Most of the redundancies are expected to be compulsory because of the heavy job cuts that have already been announced. This year Jaguar has shed about 1,200 jobs, on top of nearly 4,000 last year. It expects to produce only about 23,000 cars this year - less than half peak levels of the 1980s, and 4,000 below the level forecast earlier this year. After the proposed job cuts Jaguar will be employing fewer than 7,000 people  -less than 60 per cent of the 1990 level. The latest cuts will be at the company's Radford plant near Birmingham, which makes engines and axles and employs 700 people. The cuts are the consequence of Jaguar deciding to source more components from outside suppliers. The production of axles will also be moved to the main vehicle assembly plant nearby at Browns Lane over the Christmas period, involving the transfer of 100 jobs. Next summer another 40 jobs will be lost at Radford when the 'dressing' of engines - the fitting of the basic engines with fuel injection and other systems - is transferred to Browns Lane. With Jaguar's new AJ26 engine still under development - it is expected to be produced at Ford's main engine plant at Bridgend, south Wales - the reduced activities at Radford will leave about 45 acres of the site redundant. It will be either redeveloped or sold off. Jaguar said yesterday the latest measures would save the company about Pounds 2.5m a year at a time when, in spite of its troubles, Jaguar was maintaining an investment programme designed to create a new range of cars from the mid 1990s onwards. Jaguar made a pre-tax loss last year of Pounds 226m compared with a Pounds 66.2m loss in 1990. It has, however, maintained investment at about 9 per cent of turnover, a level the company says is the highest of any vehicle maker.</p>

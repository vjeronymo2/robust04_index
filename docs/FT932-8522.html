			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Ukraine PM demands new powers: Kuchma argues strong executive rule would arrest economic decline UKRAINIAN Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma yesterday asked parliament for expanded powers over the economy to push through the country's stalled market reforms. In a tough address to the legislature, the prime minister called for an extension of the government's authority to rule the economy by decree; for control over the central bank, the state privatisation body and the state anti-monopoly commission; and for direct jurisdiction over presidential representatives who have executive power in Ukraine's regions. He wants the extraordinary powers to be granted for a year. For the past six months the government has had the authority to rule the economy by decree, but those powers ran out yesterday. The prime minister asked the legislature not only to extend but to expand the government's authority, arguing that it would be possible to arrest Ukraine's economic decline only through 'strong executive rule'. Parliament, which spent the day debating the proposals and hearing reports from other government officials, is expected to decide by the end of the week. In what promises to be one of the most critical weeks in Ukrainian politics, the legislature is also due to debate the controversial Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start 1). Although the Ukrainian legislature is dominated by conservative ex-communists, Mr Kuchma appears likely to be granted the extra powers he is seeking. He has the backing of the other two top figures in Ukrainian politics, President Leonid Kravchuk, scheduled to address parliament today, and Mr Ivan Pliushch, chairman of the legislature. In his address, Mr Kuchma, who has threatened to resign if he is not given the additional powers, outlined the government's goals on agrarian reform, small and medium-sized privatisation, liberalisation of foreign trade, monetary reform and the creation of a social safety net. He accused the National Bank, which issued 1,230bn coupons worth of credits at the end of March which triggered a 50 per cent devaluation in the Ukrainian currency, of undermining the government's reform efforts. 'It is not the fault, but rather the tragedy, of the National Bank that it cannot resist the pressure of factory directors,' Mr Kuchma said. 'Our central bank sometimes behaves as though it were a charity.' In defence of his policies, Mr Viktor Iushchenko, bank chairman, said parliament and the government often forced the bank to issue credits. He also announced a jump in interest rates to 240 per cent a year.</p>

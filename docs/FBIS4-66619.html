			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interviews with four prison guards by Mouloud Benmohamed; </F> place and date not given in several instances: "The Lambese  Prison: Guards Face Gunfire"--first paragraph is EL MOUDJAHID  introduction]    [Text] Accounts by prison guards who responded to the  attack are a source of information that can teach us a great  deal. They provide good information on the tactics that were  used. At the same time. [text as published]. The accomplices  acted at the same time. That means that if the attackers had  been prevented from entering, even so the prisoners could have  left their cells and attacked the guards from the other  direction. The latter would not have been able to do anything.  They did not have enough ammmunition. "We had just enough  bullets to discourage an uprising," we were told. We have  learned that the guards on duty in the detention quarter, i.e.,  in the corridors, in common rooms, and in cell blocks, were not  carrying any weapons (this is a tradition).  <H5>  A.D.: "Betrayed By Ourselves" </H5>   Seriously wounded, for a long time this prison guard  resisted  from the observation post to the right of the main gate to the  Lambese prison. Possessed of exemplary courage and composure,  this man stood up, alone, to the attackers who outnumbered him.  In the operating wing of Batna's university hospital center, he  is under observation. He runs the risk of losing his left leg.  Despite his pain and with medical authorization, he was willing  to talk to us.    [A.D.] I was at the observation post. Just after the call to  prayer. I was getting ready to break the fast. Things were  normal. There were three guards, including the one who died.  Suddenly there were gunshots. I looked and at that moment they  fired at me. There were a lot of them. I fired towards the  outside. Once they fired on me from the outside. The gate had  been opened for them. They wounded me. I fell and lost  consciousness.    [Benmohamed] How do you feel?    [A.D.] Not well.    [Benmohamed] Had you noticed something abnormal?    [A.D.] Very little car traffic about three-quarters of an  hour before breakfast. At the entrance there was no one. It was  when I looked that I noticed vehicles and armed men. My  colleague, the accomplice, was standing a bit further up while  everyone was in the mess hall. That was abnormal. We were  betrayed by ourselves. If we hadn't, the attackers wouldn't have  been able.  <H5>  M.E.H. (In the Sentry Box): "Impossible Without Accomplices" </H5>   [M.E.H.] A minute after the call to prayers, I heard  gunshots  and rounds of fire. I didn't know where they were coming from.    I was in sentry box No. 8 where there's no telephone.    My colleague who was on duty in sentry box No. 3, not far  away, called out to me. I thought they had fired at him. But it  was the chief of the detention post located at main gate No. 2,  below enclosure wall No. 5, who had called me to ask to go back  up guards who were under attack.    We ran but they fired on us from the street from a truck. We  fired back. Once we got to wall No. 5 we fired. Its gate was  open. Alas, we could do nothing. We each had 10 bullets with us.  I had a Mag 51 that was made in 1936. Without ammunition I hid  near wall No. 4 until the soldiers came. The attackers were  dressed differently; some were wearing our uniforms, others  military uniforms, others Afghan clothes, and some others were  wearing other clothing... M.L.B., my colleague, was the only one  to have a Thompson and three loaders with 80 bullets. We really  didn't have working weapons. We were in danger. We couldn't even  defend ourselves. If the five guards hadn't been accomplices,  this couldn't have happened. The strategic post, where the  access door to the detention area is located, was under the  orders of an accomplice. We were afraid for our lives. We fought  back with what we had, that is to say 10 bullets. You can't even  defend yourself with that.  <H5>  A.S. (Head of a Guard Post): "I Heard Some Cries" </H5>   [A.S.] Everything was normal when the day guard staff left;  I  was with L.B. when I was checking the office. The guards were in  place. Next the day guards were allowed to leave. I agreed with  L.B., the head of the police station, that he would do an  inspection of the upper quarters while I would check the lower  quarters. Everything was normal. Nothing worth reporting on  death row. Then I called out to a guard and we sat in the office  to finish the registers. Shortly thereafter I called T.A., the  accomplice guard who fled (editor's note: he had been  transferred from Barika prison on 6 March 1993), so he would  help me serve meals to the death row prisoners. This was about  30 minutes before breakfast. We went to the kitchen and we were  even helped by four prisoners to carry the meals with us. Upon  my return I asked him to help the four prisoners and accompany  them to the death row prisoners' cells. There were 10 common  prisoners sentenced to death in the cells. They came back a few  minutes later. At that time I accompanied them to serve the  meals to the death row prisoners on top. Then I turned over the  keys to the kitchen to T.A. for him to close it and have the  prisoners come into room 14. I returned to my office. Next they  came back and returned the keys to me. L.B. and T.A. came to  break the fast with me. Five minutes remained. I was standing  and suddenly I heard cries. I left my office. Two minutes  remained before the breakfast hour. I must tell you I had  previously agreed with the wall guard that he would alert me to  the breaking of the fast so I could sound the bell to inform the  prisoners. I was just at the door to my office. At that precise  moment two accomplice guards came towards me, they were Z.B. and  H.B. They were armed and they said: "Raise your hands. Hands up."    I was surprised, then I regained my composure and I tried to  close the door to the office. L.B. did the same by helping me  close the door. They were stronger than we were and they managed  to get in. I threw myself onto H.B. who had an automatic pistol.  It was an old weapon. It doesn't belong to the prison. I tried  to take it away from him with L.B.'s assistance. While we were  fighting, H.B. said "Leave me. I swear to you that no one will  get killed." I didn't want to because I had my doubts.  Physically he's stronger than I am. He put the weapon to my  head. The bullet grazed me. I fell. I got up to leave. He or the  other accomplice guard fired at me a second time. I managed to  reach the detention square and I heard other gunshots in the  office. There was no prison guard on duty, no guard. They made  them go into a cell that was closed behind them (editor's note:  who brought these guards in? Were there only two accomplices in  this detention quarter?).    I think these two accomplices first locked up the guards  before coming towards us. As I was running I met a prisoner we  employ. He gave me the key to one cell and told me: "Hide here.  Otherwise they're going to kill you." Then from there I returned  to a control post.    I was frantic. I phoned the switchboard, the director's  house, main gate No. 1, wall 4: no answer. I contacted, still by  telephone, wall No. 3. The guard answered, I asked him to get  back to wall 5, to contact those in charge. At wall 5, there was  no answer. Finally...I thought all the guards had been killed.  I've been there 11 years...The two accomplices have been there  for about three years...They stay here but they live far away...  <H5>  M.M.: "I Only Had 10 Bullets" </H5>   I was on duty at wall No. 3. At 1830, I received from the  guard on duty at wall No. 7 the chronology register, which I was  supposed to sign, as usual, then in turn I handed it over to the  guard at wall No. 8.    A few minutes later, I was supposed to go downstairs to get  my breakfast plate. I was walking past wall No. 8. My colleague  asked me to hand the chronology register to the agent on duty at  wall No. 4. There was nobody there. I came up to wall No. 5  where guards L.B. and Z.A. were (editor's note: the accomplice).  I handed the register over to them. They had three breakfast  platters. I asked them to give one of them to me so I wouldn't  have to be away from my post for a long time and since they were  next to the mess hall. Z.A. gave me one of them.    Next I got back to the post, it was time to break the fast,  and I heard rounds of gunfire. I called my colleague at wall No.  8.    Next the phone rang. The chief warned us to come down to  wall  No. 5, below which is main gate No. 2, which provides access to  the detention area.    I loaded my MAS 51. I had 10 bullets. As I was loading it,  the phone rang a second time. The same supervisor asked us to  call the director and come down quickly to wall No. 5.    I called the director, there was no answer. Then, together  with my colleague, we went downstairs. Hardly had we crossed  wall No.8 when we saw a blue K66 truck that was moving alongside  the wall; a man fired at us with an automatic pistol.    Unless I'm mistaken, he was carrying some of the dead  because  white sheets were covering some human forms. Personally I fired  back with two bullets. Once we arrived at gate No. 2, we  experienced rounds of gunfire. We responded until our ammunition  was used up. I had two bullets left because my weapon jammed.    I climbed up wall No. 5 where I found B. We stayed between  walls 4 and 5 until the security forces came; we were without  ammunition. I'm an agent on probation. I'm unable to recognize  the five accomplices because I don't even know them. Together  with my colleague, I saw we were the only ones still alive. I  had decided to jump over the wall. The only one who could  respond was the guard who was kidnapped. He was at the  right-hand observation post and had a Thompson and some  ammunition. In my opinion the bodies on the truck were those of  the attackers he had shot.   <FIG ID=JPRS-NEA-022-09A>      Our photograph shows main gate </FIG>   Photo Caption    Behind main gate No. 2 (photograph 1) are the detention  areas.

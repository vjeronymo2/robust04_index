			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 22 February, Jose Perez Novoa, Cuban Ambassador  in Geneva, accused the United States of manipulating freedom of  expression with its monopoly of media outlets. During the 50th  session of the UN Human Rights Commission, the Cuban diplomat  gave the example of the exposure to radiation on unsuspecting  subjects. Over a decade ago experiments were conducted on  retarded individuals. This was only made known last month. Perez  Novoa stressed that there are no guarantees that other human  rights violations cases are kept quiet within the so-called  freedom of speech of the United States.    The UN Human Rights Commission has yet to vote on racism and  xenophobia, increasing phenomenons in Europe.</p>

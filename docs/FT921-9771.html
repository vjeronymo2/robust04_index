			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Major calls for debate on policies MR JOHN MAJOR called yesterday for a switch in the focus of election campaigning from the leading protagonists' private lives to the policy divisions between their parties. But after a weekend of clashes over alleged 'smear tactics' and 'dirty tricks' there was little sign of any easing of the personal acrimony which has come to dominate the campaign. Mr Chris Patten, Conservative chairman, distanced his party from efforts by some newspapers to delve into the personal lives of other opposition politicians following last week's revelations by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, about an affair he had five years ago. However, Mr Patten said politicians should not be too 'sanctimonious' about intrusions into their private life if they used spouses and families to project a favourable image. 'I don't like this sort of politics . . . but to some extent we make a rod for our own back.' Speaking on LBC radio, Mr Major said the general election should be 'a crisp campaign that deals with the policies. I hope that will be the campaign the other parties will fight'. Meanwhile, Mr Ashdown complained that it was journalists, not himself, who had wanted to write about his family life. However, he joined Mr Major in opposing restrictions on press freedom. For Labour, Mr Roy Hattersley, deputy leader, drew a stark contrast between the 'ruthless individualism' of Tory polices and Labour's goal of 'a kinder, gentler, more compassionate society'. He told 800 local government delegates at a Blackpool conference that the coming general election should be 'a crusade' based on the party's principle of equality. At the Young Conservative conference in Eastbourne, Mr Patten insisted that the 'character' and 'leadership' issue was entirely legitimate. The personal bitterness of the campaign so far was reflected in attacks during the conference on Mr Gerald Kaufman, Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, who has often led Labour's criticism of Mr Major and who was the recipient of a continuous stream of jibes by senior ministers. Mr Patten promised a sustained attack on Labour's tax and spending policies and its general economic competence. On Saturday, Mr Major set out the principal themes for the Conservative manifesto as choice, ownership, opportunity and responsibility. He indicated the government's determination to raise defence as an election issue by announcing it would press ahead with an order for a fourth Trident nuclear missile submarine. However Mr Hattersley said the Tories could never understand voters' 'instinct for fairness'. He asked if Young Conservatives would have 'screamed with delight', as they did with the Trident announcement, 'if he had said he was going to spend the same amount on the homeless, on schools and on hospitals'. Mr Patten brushed off an opinion poll giving Labour a 4-point lead. He said other recent surveys gave the Tories an advantage confirming that the two parties were 'neck and neck' at about 40 per cent.</p>

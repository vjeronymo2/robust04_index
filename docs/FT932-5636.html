			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Yugoslav gunboat opens fire on Italian fishing boat ITALY PROTESTED to the rump state of Yugoslavia yesterday after a Yugoslav gunboat opened fire on an Italian fishing boat in the Adriatic, killing a crewman and injuring another, agencies report from Rome. The Italians demanded the release of the damaged fishing boat, being held at the Montenegrin port of Bar along with its captain and two crewmen. The Italian navy was ordered to step up patrols in the area and use all necessary force to prevent another attack on an Italian vessel. The incident is likely to compound Rome's exasperation at events in the former Yugoslav republics. Italy is already taking part in a naval blockade of Yugoslav ports with its partners in Nato and the 10-nation Western European Union. The clash, which the Italians said apparently occurred in international waters, comes just days after three Italian civilians were killed while delivering aid in central Bosnia. Four Italian airmen were killed when their UN helicopter was shot down by Serb fighters last year. A further four died when their aircraft was brought down on a mercy flight to the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, last September.</p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHWEST OUTPLODS SANTA BARBARA, 18-15  </P> <P> In its homecoming game, L.A. Southwest College turned in a sporadic offensive  performance to come away with an 18-15 win over Santa Barbara College.  </P> <P> Quarterback Craig Manigo sealed the victory with a 37-yard touchdown pass to  sophomore wide receiver Ansel Littlejohn with 3:48 left in the game.  </P> <P> The win lifts the Cougars to 6-1-1 overall and 5-1-1 in the Western State  Conference's Northern Division. The Vaqueros drop to 4-4 overall and 3-4 in the  conference.  </P> <P> Southwest travels to Harbor College next Saturday.  </P> <P> In the first half, when Southwest scored its only points on a 38-yard field  goal by Jason Thomson and trailed, 9-3, Manigo completed only four of nine  passes for 23 yards. He was also the team's leading rusher with four carries  for 45 yards.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara was equally sluggish on offense in the first half, but its  defense took up the slack. The Vaqueros scored a touchdown in the first quarter  on a 73-yard interception return by freshman defensive back Paul Perkins. They  added two points in the second quarter when linebacker Calvin Young tackled  Manigo for a safety.  </P> <P> Manigo came alive in the second half, completing nine of 16 passes for 130  yards and a touchdown. Overall, he completed 13 of 25 for 153 yards.  </P> <P> Manigo finished with 66 yards rushing on six carries, and William Jarrett  picked up 51 yards on nine carries. Jarrett's six-yard touchdown run in the  third quarter and a two-point conversion put Southwest ahead, 10-9.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara quarterback Ted Robison completed 16 of 30 passes for 168 yards  and one touchdown, a 43-yarder to wide receiver Victor Prince in the fourth  quarter that temporarily regained the lead for the Vaqueros, 15-10.  </P> <P> The Southwest defense was led by Chris Mims, who had four of his team's seven  quarterback sacks.  </P></p>

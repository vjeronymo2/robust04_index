			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / French deal with Amoco cleared by MMC THE GOVERNMENT'S tough stance against UK acquisitions by foreign state-controlled companies suffered a further setback yesterday when the Monopolies and Mergers Commission cleared the Pounds 300m acquisition by France's Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, of the UK petrol-station and refinery business of Amoco, the US oil group. This was the fourth of five UK acquisitions by foreign state-controlled companies to be cleared by the MMC since Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, announced last July his aim of preventing 'nationalisation by the back door'. Mr Lilley had referred the acquisition by Elf's UK subsidiary Elf Oil (GB) to the MMC last December against the advice of the Office of Fair Trading. The MMC found that the deal would not operate against the public interest. The assets acquired by Elf include Amoco's 70 per cent share of an oil refinery at Milford Haven, west Wales, owned jointly by Murco Petroleum, some 200 petrol stations, and contracts to supply petrol to another 30 independent retailers. The merger has enabled Elf to become an integrated oil company in the UK but its market share of all petrol products remains small at three to five per cent. The MMC found that the French government, which owns 55.6 per cent of Elf, could potentially influence the company's strategic policy, but all the evidence, even from competitors, pointed to Elf being run in a normal commercial way. The MMC also looked at the French government's 33.9 per cent holding in Total CFP, which has a four to six per cent share of the UK market. It concluded that, as with Elf, the policy was to leave Total's management to run the business. The MMC said it did not believe the Elf/Amoco deal made it any more likely that the French would press Elf and Total to co-ordinate their activities in order to exercise market power. The evidence was that they were rivals.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We have a last-minute report. Jucuapa riot police  stormed the entrance of the Saul Flores School where the ballot  boxes are located, according to members of the FMLN [Farabundo  Marti National Liberation Front]. Ricardo Samayoa, of the FMLN  Political Committee, said the people began to gather in front of  the school building and added that there have not been any major  incidents.    [Begin recording] [Samayoa] Riot police and members of the  civilian National Police, whose actions are being repudiated by  the residents of Jucuapa, broke into the school building where  the election ballots were being held. This incident is evidence  of the fraud that Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance] has  tried to stage in this town as well as in the rest of the  country. The residents of Jucuapa are opposed to this. There  have been clashes with members of the civilian National Police.  We call on the international community to take note of the  incident that is occurring at this time in the town of Jucuapa.    [Unidentified reporter] The ballot boxes have still not been  taken to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE]?    [Samayoa] The ballot boxes are inside the building, but the  entrance has been damaged. The locks have been destroyed and  the door was damaged in an attempt to take out the ballot boxes.  The people, however, have gathered there to prevent them from  doing so and to observe what the riot police are doing. [end  recording]    The police authorities have still not made a statement on  the  case. The TSE and the UN Observers for El Salvador had already  challenged these votes.</p>

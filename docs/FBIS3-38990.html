Mr. Cotti, speaking at Zurich University,  said such problems in Europe as crime, transport, and  environmental policies could no longer be solved on a national  or regional basis. He said the EU was still far from being a  perfect organization, but was already a crucial guarantor for  regional stability.</p>

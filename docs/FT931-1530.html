			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Plans to mothball mines expected MR JOHN MAJOR met more than half the cabinet last night to finalise details of the government's proposed lifeline for coal mines threatened with closure. The cabinet committee discussed a draft white paper, which sets out in broad terms how the coal market could be expanded, and aims to avert a threatened revolt by Tory MPs. The government, which is understood to believe that around a dozen of the 31 threatened pits could be kept open at least in the short term, is also believed to have drawn up plans to mothball indefinitely up to six others. The aim is to reassure Tory critics that reserves of deep-mined coal would not necessarily be wasted. The mothballed pits would be open to bids from the private sector once legislation to privatise the industry was passed by the Commons. The plans centre on a limited Treasury subsidy to make UK coal more competitive, but this may last only a year or two, while the privatisation of British Coal would be speeded up. Treasury ministers have resisted offering a subsidy above about Pounds 500m. The paper is likely to be published tomorrow after formal approval by the full cabinet. Downing Street indicated that Mr Major may press ahead with the white paper plans before publication even if core contracts are not formally agreed between British Coal and the electricity generators. Publication will be followed by an intensive campaign to win over waverers on the Tory back benches. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, would face pressure to resign if the package failed to win the support of MPs. Intensive energy users are hoping the white paper will encourage moves enabling them to bypass the electricity wholesale pool and reduce their electricity bills. On Monday the British Management Data Association, an independent organisation backed by 25 companies, presented a proposal to ministers that the association says would provide British Coal with more security. Under the proposal large companies including Imperial Chemical Industries, would sign long-term deals with generators for coal-fired electricity. Analysts were sceptical yesterday about whether the scheme would increase demand for coal. Meanwhile PowerGen said it had signed an eight-year deal with Electricite de France to supply electricity. Analysts believe it could help save one of the threatened pits.</p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEEFING UP THE CLEAN AIR ACT;  </P> <P> BUT AN AMENDED MEASURE IS A LONG WAY FROM LAW  </P> <P> For years Washington has ignored its own policy requiring that local  transportation systems match local clean-air plans and goals. But now here  comes the U.S. Senate with a list of quite simple but, for an  automobile-oriented society, revolutionary ways to make the policy work.  </P> <P> In essence, the Senate says that if air chemists agree a region's air cannot  tolerate the pollution from more than, say, 5 million cars, the region cannot  build a highway network to carry 6 million of them.  </P> <P> This seems such basic good sense that the obvious question is why it didn't  occur to somebody before. It did. The idea has been federal policy since the  Clean Air Act was last amended in 1977, but the wording of the act was so loose  that dubious highway projects kept slipping through. In voting to amend the act  again this year, the Senate included a series of steps to slow down highway  spending when a region must choose between cleaner air and more automobiles on  the road.  </P> <P> Instead of cutting off highway funds to regions that fail to clean up their  air, which seldom happens anyway, the Senate proposes to keep transportation  money flowing to non-complying states but restricting its use to projects that  promote cleaner air, such as construction of rail-transit systems and programs  to expand ride-sharing.  </P> <P> A drastic change would let state governors divert federal highway funds to rail  construction or other projects designed to reduce automobile pollution. Over  the years, the so-called highway lobby has guarded the federal highway trust  fund against such raids. Token sums have been diverted from highways to rail  systems, but nothing on the scale of the Senate plan. Thus the lobby is almost  certain to try to block it.  </P> <P> For clean-air planning, the attraction of rail is clear. A commuter driving  alone generates eight times as many hydrocarbons during rush hour as a commuter  riding the rails.  </P> <P> What encouraged the Senate to tighten up the machinery for designing and  funding transportation networks? Apparently the pioneering work done by the  Southern California Assn. of Governments in its regional mobility plan,  published in 1989. The local plan persuaded the Senate that making  transportation plans conform to clean-air goals is workable, not wishful  thinking.  </P> <P> An amended Clean Air Act is a long way from law. The House plans to vote on its  own bill before the end of the month, but there will be enough difference  between the two versions to touch off a grueling, perhaps even brutal,  conference, considering the likely lobbying frenzy to negotiate away  disparities. The Senate language still is fuzzy on the question of who bears  the ultimate responsibility for making the revolutionary new approach work.  </P> <P> There is a warning in the Southern California mobility plan that applies just  as well to other metropolitan areas. Noting that if Southern Californians do  not change their transportation habits over the next 20 years, they would waste  more than 16 times as many hours sitting in traffic jams in 2010 as they do  now, the report said:  </P> <P> "The streets and roads of the region simply cannot accommodate the additional  traffic suggested by these projections, even with virtually unlimited  construction. But perhaps even more important, the automobile is one of the  major causes of the region's severe air-quality problem . . . . " The dilemma  can't be put any more clearly. The Senate's Clean Air Bill should be enacted  and signed by President Bush.  </P></p>

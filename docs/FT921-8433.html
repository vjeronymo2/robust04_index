			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Industry in Japan grinds into low gear JAPAN'S industrial output last year grew at 2.1 per cent, the slowest pace in five years, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said yesterday. The report confirmed accumulating evidence of a sharp slowdown in the Japanese economy. Miti also revised downward estimates for December industrial production. Factory and mine output fell by 1.9 per cent in December, compared to a year ago, a half percentage point below earlier estimates. Equally significant, Miti increased estimates for the rise in inventories during the month from 12.8 per cent to 13.1 per cent. Mr Russell Jones, economist at UBS Phillips and Drew, said: 'There is no doubt in my mind that the manufacturing sector is in recession.' Mr Jones said that after taking into account the gradual decrease in inventory levels made possible by technical change, inventories were now at the highest level for more than 15 years. The high level of inventories points to a further decline in factory output in the months ahead as manufacturers try to balance output with demand. The Nihon Keizei Shimbun, the economic daily newspaper, said that capital investment by Japanese companies would decline by 4.5 per cent in the fiscal year starting in April, according to its own survey. This would be the first drop in six years. Manufacturing investment is expected to be hit hardest, with a decline of 11.1 per cent. Adding further to the economic gloom, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation reported that steel production fell for the sixth consecutive month and, at 8.1m tons, was 14.8 per cent below a year ago in January. This was the lowest production since September 1987. Production of steel products for the construction industry declined by 23.6 per cent. Tokyo retail sales were also sluggish in January.</p>

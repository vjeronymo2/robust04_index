			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, [no date as received] Apr (AFP) --  Jeronimo Hernandez Lopez, a Jesuit priest, "is not Subcommander  Marcos," the military chief of the Zapatista guerrillas in the  southeastern Mexican State of Chiapas, as the daily SUMMA  reported on Friday. Thus was communicated to AFP by Carlos  Morfin, member of the Mexican Chapter of the Jesuit Order. The  Jesuits "strongly condemned" the publication as "totally false,"  given that the priest has been working in a Guatemalan refugee  camp since 1992; this is why the authorities have his activities  registered, Morfin added.    SUMMA published on Thursday [day as received] on its front  page a note in which it was reported that Hernandez Lopez was  Subcommander Marcos. This was based on a federal government  investigation considered to be a "state secret." According to  the "secret" report, a computer study of photographs and videos  established "a great similarity between the Jesuit priest and  Subcommander Marcos, who hides his face behind a ski mask.    Hernandez Lopez, 36, is registered with the Mexican  Commission for Aid to Refugees, as the authorities demand of all  those who work in the Guatemalan refugee camps, Morfin stressed.  From 5 August 1992 to 5 April 1994, Father Hernandez Lopez was  assigned to provide pastoral ministry to the Guatemalan refugees  in the State of Campeche, in southern Mexico, Morfin explained  in an official Jesuit Order communique, subsequently sent to  AFP. Since 5 April he was transferred to Chiapas to cooperate  in a project the Jesuits have in Bachajon hamlet, the communique  adds. Morfin said that Lopez's new transfer "had been reported  to Diego Valadez, attorney general of the republic, and  Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo, as several days ago he had  been interviewed and photographed by national security agents  who wanted to confirm his location and place of work."    The Jesuits "strongly condemned SUMMA's report," indicating  "it is not very professional to generate slander and insecurity  stemming from false reports, without indicating who is  responsible for the mentioned investigation." It added that "it  was very serious to involve the federal government in general.  This publication is added to a long list of false accusations,  orchestrated by some media."    The Jesuit member said they fear for the priest's security  after publication of the newspaper report; therefore they have  talked with the nation's authorities to clear up the matter.</p>

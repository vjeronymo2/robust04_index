			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Tories postpone poll tax capping DECISIONS ABOUT which councils should have their spending 'capped' or limited by central government have been delayed until after the general election. Mr Michael Portillo, the local government minister, told MPs in a Commons written answer that capping decisions would be held over. Ministers say that by convention such sensitive decisions are not announced during an election. The news emerged as Cipfa, the public finance and accountancy body, said the average 1992-93 poll tax in England, taking account of how many people are due to pay in each authority, would be Pounds 279.34, an increase of 11 per cent on the present year. For Wales, the average poll tax figure is just under Pounds 150, an increase of 24 per cent, and for Scotland Pounds 298, an increase of just over 20 per cent. Labour had predicted the average bill in England will be closer to Pounds 300 than to the government's target of Pounds 257. Some 15-20 councils in England, Scotland and Wales are expected to have breached the provisional capping criteria for 1992-93, set out by Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, last year. These include Warwickshire county council, whose budget of almost Pounds 300m is about Pounds 7m above the government's rules. Among the others which would have faced capping are Basildon in Essex, Langbaurgh and Middlesbrough on Teesside, and the London boroughs of Greenwich and Lambeth. Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, said: 'The government have created yet another poll tax dilemma for themselves. To have acted on the capping rules would merely have reinforced the picture of their fingerprints on every bill. But their delay in this decision will cause confusion in the authorities concerned.' Last April, Mr Heseltine told 14 authorities to cut their budgets for the current year; three were Tory and the rest Labour. Labour is buoyed by its analysis of increases in poll tax bills by political control of authority, which shows that the weighted average increase for Tory and for Liberal Democrat authorities is 13 per cent, while in Labour authorities it is 11.9 per cent. The Tories counter that the average size of bills is still larger under Labour councils.</p>

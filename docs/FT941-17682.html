			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / International Company News: Pharmacia buys rest of FICE Pharmacia of Sweden has completed the acquisition of Italy's Farmitalia Carlo Erba and Erbamont (FICE) in a SKr3.8bn (Dollars 457m) deal, Reuter reports from Stockholm. Pharmacia took up the option to buy the remaining 49 per cent of the company ahead of an earlier agreed date. Under the original agreement, it would buy the rest of FICE sometime in 1994 or 1995. The seller was Holdback Holdings, which is owned by a consortium of banks. The first 51 per cent of FICE was bought in May, Pharmacia said. Procordia, the Swedish diversified company, was split into two companies in the autumn, of which one is Pharmacia, the pharmaceutical company. Montedison, the Italian pharmaceutical group, owned FICE before the sale in May. It sold its remaining 49 per cent to Holdback Holdings later that month.</p>

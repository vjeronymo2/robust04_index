			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Bosnians weigh up plan for union of republics INTERNATIONAL mediators in Geneva yesterday proposed a union of three Bosnian republics, in an attempt to bridge the gap between the warring parties about the future of the region. The plan, presented by Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, seeks to satisfy Serb and Croat demands for partition of Bosnia on ethnic lines as well as the Moslem aim of creating a federal republic, a United Nations official said. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic welcomed the plan and said he could accept it with 'only minor changes' since it was 'pretty close' to the Serb-Croat proposal for ethnic mini-states. Bosnia's Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic last night consulted the Bosnian collective leadership after seeking revisions in the plan, which goes against all his calls for a more closely knit federation. But members of the collective leadership were divided on the plan and will meet again today to try to agree a united position. Bosnian Prime Minister Mile Akmadzic predicted that all three Bosnian factions, including the Moslem-led government, would accept the plan. Mr Akmadzic, a Croat, said: 'I am really convinced that all three sides, including the presidency. . . will agree on the new constitutional arrangement.' Diplomats said the mediators' proposal would give the Bosnian central government control over foreign policy but few other powers. A meeting of all six parties at the Geneva talks is expected later today. A UN official said the participants at Geneva were talking 'seriously, courteously and constructively'. Bosnian leaders yesterday agreed on a ceasefire in the 16-month war. Mr Izetbegovic, Mr Karadzic and the Bosnian Croat leader, Mr Mate Boban, interrupted a session of talks to issue the ceasefire order to their military commanders, said UN spokesman John Mills. Despite the order to implement the accord immediately, there was no sign in Bosnia that any ceasefire would hold. Previous truces have collapsed almost immediately. In Washington, Mr Francois Leotard, the French defence minister, said the western allies with troops in Bosnia would not tolerate further attacks on UN troops and were prepared to launch air strikes quickly if they continued.</p>

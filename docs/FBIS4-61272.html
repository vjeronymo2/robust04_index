			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Anatoliy Repin report: "We Will Help As Best We Can"] </F>   [Text] Cairo, 4 May -- Russian Foreign Minister A.  Kozyrev, who is in Cairo in connection with the signing of the  agreement between Israel and the PLO on interim Palestinian  autonomy, answered a question posed to him by your TRUD  correspondent about Russia's role in the Israeli-Palestinian  dialogue and in the Near East peace process as a whole:    [Kozyrev] Russia and the United States are the sponsors of  the peace process in the Near East, and are carrying out the  role they have assumed through constant and I would even say  daily contact with each other.    The agreement on the Gaza Strip and Jericho is the first  major step toward general, stable peace in the region; it  constitutes a historic reconciliation between Israel and its  Palestinian neighbors. I hope that it will act as an incentive  for progress in other areas of the Near East settlement.    In this connection it is important to note that both sides'  leaders -- Chairman 'Arafat and Premier Rabin -- recently  visited Moscow, which, to my mind, gave them additional  possibilities for adopting the historic decision and helped them  to withstand pressure from extremists on both sides and all  those who do not understand the need for peace. Support from  Russia, the United States, and Egypt, and our sincere desire to  promote the peace process on the firm foundation of equal rights  and fairness are promoting accord between the contracting  parties.    The Israeli-Palestinian agreement should be followed by its  practical implementation. This is no less important a phase  than the talks. Russia, the United States, Egypt, the European  Community, and other countries will be involved, together with  the Palestinians and the Israelis, in the process of the  implementation of the agreements reached. I would say that this  international solidarity will make it possible to move in the  right direction. In short, if and when the need arises for help  from us, we will not delay in coming to their assistance in the  most positive spirit.    As for the Russian "Madrid-2" initiative -- that is, our  proposal to convene a new international conference on the Near  East -- this idea remains in force. We put it forward (soon  after the Hebron tragedy -- A.R.) for the purposes of long-term  strategy. Our initiative was born at a time when enormous  difficulties had arisen and the peace process had to be saved --  and the relevant impetus was required for this. But from the  very outset it was clear that our immediate aim is to achieve  agreements on Gaza and Jericho, and then to move forward to the  implementation of the Declaration of Principles (signed by  Israel and the PLO in September 1993 -- A.R.). And I believe  that on the path toward peace in the Near East, "Madrid-2" may  and will be seen as a means of lending new impetuses to the  peace process in the new conditions, and that this idea will be  implemented at a suitable moment.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / A strong defence case for the status quo: Lord Lane's resignation and the views of his successor, Sir Peter Taylor THE Lord Chancellor's department was quick yesterday to play down any suggestion that Lord Lane's resignation as Lord Chief Justice, 18 months short of the compulsory retirement age of 75, had anything to do with the controversy which dogged the last four years of his term in office. Much of that controversy sprang from his handling of the first appeal by the Birmingham Six and his pronouncement in January 1988, after a 27-day appeal hearing, that 'the longer this hearing has gone on, the more convinced this court has become that the verdict of the jury was correct'. These words returned to haunt him when the convictions of the Birmingham Six were finally overturned three years later. His refusal to apologise to the men or to acknowledge the part the courts played in keeping them in prison for 16 years for a crime they did not commit led to calls for his resignation and was widely seen as a major contributory factor in the loss of public confidence in the criminal justice system and the judiciary. Many in the legal profession said that while he had let it be known some time before that he did not want to carry on until 75, the criticism of his role in the Birmingham Six case had simply stiffened his resolve to stay. Now, after the passage of a sufficient period for the two events not to be inextricably linked in the public's eyes, he has decided to step down. Frequently portrayed as a reactionary who was fiercely opposed to reform of the legal profession, Lord Lane was not always so controversial. At times during his 12 years in office he showed he could be both progressive and humane in his approach to the development of the law. At the same time as the Birmingham Six were being released, Lord Lane was in another court putting to rest the legal fiction that a man cannot rape his wife. When he took over from Lord Widgery in 1980 sentencing policy was in a mess which he is widely credited with having corrected. He introduced sentencing guidelines for Crown Court judges and, although tough on sex offences and violent crime, he was strongly in favour of non-custodial sentences for minor offences. Sir Peter Taylor, his successor, comes to the job with all the apparent 'liberal' credentials necessary to oversee a difficult period of change in the criminal justice system. At a press conference yesterday, however, he mounted a strong defence of the status quo. Having said that it was too soon for him to make any statements of intent or pronouncements of policy he proceeded to rule out the need for any change in the training, working practices or appointment of judges, or the need for there to be more women and members of the ethnic minorities on the bench. He said he was not concerned that newly appointed judges were untrained or unqualified to do their job. No doubt as time went on there would be more women and ethnic minority judges, but he did not want 'a proportionally representative judiciary'. On sentencing, Sir Peter said the guidelines would be revised from time to time but 'right now' he could not think of any he wanted to change. He was opposed to television cameras in the court room. The US experience proved that only the more sensational trials would be televised. He had no immediate plans for any change in the role of the Lord Chief Justice, he said. Sir Peter said, however, that he shared the public's anxiety about the recent spate of miscarriages of justice and the length and cost of complex fraud trials. He acknowledged there was a need to restore public confidence in the system. To that end he would encourage greater openness by, and access to, the judi-ciary. Judges would need to be more vigilant to avoid miscarriages of justice in the future, but he warned that no system which involved humans could be infallible. Sir Peter said he would be reluctant to see the jury abolished in complex fraud trials but acknowledged that it was one of the options under consideration. He was opposed to the US system of plea bargaining in fraud cases although he thought it might be possible to make fraud trials more manageable by persuading prosecuting authorities to target their case on a smaller number of charges. He hoped a great many of these issues would be sorted out by the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, which is due to report in the middle of next year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 12 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton today urged Congress to quickly pass the crime bill that  would put 100,000 more police officers on the streets to fight  crimes.    "It is imperative that we not let politics for one day delay  the passage of this crime bill," Clinton said. "We can drive  the crime rate down and make our people safe."    Announcing a 74-million-dollar federal grant to help local  government pay for hiring 1,001 more police officers, he said  the adoption of the crime bill will redeem his campaign pledge  to put 100,000 additional police officers on American streets in  its entirety.    The House and Senate have passed their own versions of the  crime bill. The difference between the two versions will have  to be reconciled by a conference committee.    In 1993, there were about 24,500 were murders, 12.1 million  property crimes in the United States.    The federal grant and two previously announced awards, with  a  total of 150 million dollars, will go to 250 police departments  across the country and help pay for the hiring or rehiring of  2,023 police officers.</p>

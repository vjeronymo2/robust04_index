			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Books: A great philosopher bares his soul - A. C. Grayling admires the intelligence, generosity and wit of Bertrand Russell THE SELECTED LETTERS OF BERTRAND RUSSELL: VOL. 1, 1884-1914 edited by Nicholas Griffin Allen Lane The Penguin Press Pounds 25, 640 pages IT IS characteristic of Bertrand Russell that when in 1895 he won his Prize Fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge, he donated his stipend to the newly-founded London School of Economics. His instinctive generosity did not only express itself in financial terms; to almost everyone he knew he was generous in many intellectual and emotional ways. His letters testify luminously to this trait, as they testify also to his scintillating intelligence and delightful wit. All these facets of Russell are present to us in these letters, each of them serving as a record, preserved in typically sharp, lucid prose, of the freshly-minted responses of a brilliant yet extraordinarily humane mind. Nicholas Griffin tells us that there are nearly 50,000 letters in the Russell archive. For this volume, the first of two, he has chosen 240, all but one previously unpublished. They cover Russell's first four decades, taking us to the event which impelled him into his controversial public career: the outbreak of the First World War. The projected second volume, still in preparation, covers the remaining six decades of Russell's life, throughout which he was prominent on the international stage as social reformer, peace campaigner and philosophical gadfly stinging the body politic. Griffin's achievement in this first volume is a splendid augury for its successor. He has in effect given us a new biography of Russell, skilfully weaving the letters into an explanatory narrative of notes and commentary. It is notable that most of Russell's letters are to women, indeed to the small group of women who were most important to him in this period: his grandmother, who brought him up; Alys Pearsall Smith, his first wife; and Lady Ottoline Morrell, with whom Russell had a love-affair which liberated him from the sexual and social poverties of his earlier life. To these women Russell wrote intimately of his feelings, hopes, work, friends and conversations. He wrote almost daily, and at length, in characteristically fluent style, so that the letters constitute a remarkable diary, comparable in its autobiographical and literary value to Pepys or to Rousseau's memoirs, and even more gripping than the epistolary fictions of Richardson because they convey the genuine personal testimony of a great and passionate mind. Only to these women did Russell write so fully; to male friends his letters give less of his inward mind and therefore more that is inessential. The volume begins with Russell's boyhood letters to his grandmother, widow of the reforming Prime Minister Lord John Russell. She brought up the orphaned Russell at Pembroke Lodge in Richmond Park in an atmosphere of priggish austerity. Hunger for affection remained, Russell later said, one of the permanent compulsions of his life. Tutors and nannies fostered his precocious talents, and at 19 he went up at Cambridge to read mathematics and then philosophy, becoming a Prize Fellow of Trinity at the age of 23. While still an undergraduate Russell fell in love with a Quaker five years his senior, Alys Pearsall Smith. Soon after graduating, and against his family's determined opposition, they married, so beginning a period of happiness in which Russell produced his greatest work in logic and philosophy. This was not at Alys's expense; the letters show that Russell was a 'new man' a century before the expression was invented, for he and Alys devised a 'complicated mutual-adjustment system' of marriage which reflected their opposition to traditional views about women's roles. Both were ardent feminists, and even as Russell was writing (with AN Whitehead) his great three-volume treatise on the logical foundations of mathematics, the Principia Mathematica, he stood several times for Parliament as a woman's suffrage candidate. Later, with Ottoline Morrell, he experienced again the fruitful ecstasy of love which, paradoxical as it seems, inspired some of his best technical work. Russell never believed in academic exclusiveness, and to any interested correspondent he enjoyed giving lucently pithy accounts of his work. As a result the volume describes Russell's philosophical progress from student to internationally famous savant in a series of brilliant vignettes drawn by Russell himself. But even in these letters the discussion ranges widely, touching with equal ease on history or politics, music or personal matters. Concerning these last, Russell was an indefatigable correspondent, entirely unpretentious and full of affection. The Russell one meets in these pages is enormously likeable and admirable. Griffin's choice of letters portrays something very different from a Mr Apollinax ravishing maidens. It has become fashionable, even among philosophers, to undervalue Russell's contributions; but both in technical philosophy, where his influence so pervades that citation of his works is no longer necessary, and in the social revolution which freed 20th-century minds from Victorian fetters, Russell is a central figure. He merits celebration, and this volume marvellously demonstrates why.</p>

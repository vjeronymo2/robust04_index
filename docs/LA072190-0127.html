			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXCERPTS FROM THE MIRAMAX VS. MPAA RULING  </P> <P> Following are excerpts from Judge Charles E. Ramos' opinion in dismissing the  petition brought by Miramax Films and director Pedro Almodovar against the  Motion Picture Assn. of America and the X rating given to Almodovar's "Tie Me  Up! Tie Me Down!"  </P> <P>  * Censorship is an anathema to our Constitution and to this Court. The (Motion  Picture Assn. of America) which created and administers the present rating  system also proclaims that it is against censorship. However, notwithstanding  the denials of censorship by the (MPAA), the present system of rating motion  pictures is an effective form of censorship. It is censorship from within the  industry rather than imposed from without, but censorship nevertheless. . . .  </P> <P> It is evident that the MPAA standard is to rate films . . . based upon the  tastes of the Average American Parent (AAP). The stated purpose of the rating  system is "to provide advance information to enable parents to make judgments  on movies they wanted their children to see or not to see." As such the MPAA  rating system is clearly not designed to rate the merits of a film or even to  advise adults as to which films they may wish to see.  </P> <P> The MPAA's list of cinematic no-nos is predictable: language, violence, nudity,  drug use and sex. Notably absent is any sensitivity to the offenses suffered by  women, minorities, the disabled and those who may not share the values of the  (Average American Parent).  </P> <P> This Court cannot avoid the notion that the standard is reasonable only if one  agrees with it. This standard, by definition, restricts material not because it  is harmful, but because it is not average fare. . . . The manner in which the  MPAA rates all films . . . causes this Court to question the integrity of the  present rating system.  </P> <P> * An even more substantial concern is the question . . . of whether (the MPAA)  is adequately meeting the needs of America's children in film rating. . . . An  often leveled criticism of the MPAA is that violence in films is condoned to a  far greater extent than displays of sexual activity. Without professional  guidance or input it may well be that the interests of children are not  adequately protected or are even endangered by providing color of acceptability  to extremely violent and psychologically damaging films.  </P> <P> . . the inference of concern for the welfare of children is not borne out by  any scrutiny of the standard and the guidance given to the rating board  members. The standard is not scientific. There are no physicians, child  psychiatrists or child care professionals on the board, nor is any professional  guidance sought to advise the board members regarding any relative harm to  minor children. No effort is made to professionally advise the board members on  the impact of a depiction of violent rape on the one hand and an act of love on  the other, nor is any distinction made between levels of violence.  </P> <P> It may well be that the MPAA ratings are skewed towards permitting film makers  huge profits pandering to the appetite for films containing "hard violence" and  "drug use" while neglecting the welfare of children intended to be protected by  the rating system. . . . reliance upon a non-professional rating board is  misplaced and that the effort by the MPAA to encourage a more lenient policy  toward violence is indefensible.  </P> <P> The failure of the rating system to provide a professional basis leaves only  the viewing taste of the (Average American Parent), the consumers, as the  standard. This standard may serve as a basis for a successful marketing  strategy but may not coincide with the advice child care professionals might  offer.  </P> <P> Contrary to our jurisprudence which protects all forms of expression, the  rating system censors serious films by the force of economic pressure. The MPAA  requires that American films deal with adult subjects in non-adult terms, or  face an X rating.  </P> <P> * What is offensive is the unprofessional standard itself, not the manner in  which the rating board applies it. The standard . . . is a marketing standard,  a tool to aid in promoting films.  </P> <P> * There are also questions of the good faith of (Miramax and Almodovar) in  instituting this proceeding . . . The allegations of economic prejudice and  discrimination are unsubstantiated and the exploitation of the X rating by the  petitioners in their advertising and their refusal to cooperate in the review  process until after they had physical possession of the X certificate leads to  the inference that this proceeding may be just publicity for (the movie).  </P> <P> . . . in view of the dominant and preemptive role played by the MPAA in the  film industry there is an obligation to administer the system fairly and with a  foundation that is rationally based. This proceeding has raised certain issues  which need be addressed (by the MPAA) . . . The initial problem is the need to  avoid stigmatizing films of an adult nature, which ought not be seen by  children, but which are clearly not pornographic. The MPAA, having acquiesced  in the use of the X rating by the pornography industry, may well have some  affirmative responsibility to avoid stigmatizing films with an X rating.  </P> <P> . . . the rating system's categories have been fashioned by the motion picture  industry to create an illusion of concern for children, imposing censorship,  yet all the while facilitating the marketing of exploitive and violent films  with an industry seal of approval.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STILL UNTOLD: THE REAL STORY OF AIR AMERICA IN INDOCHINA  </P> <P> As a Vietnam War historian, I had been looking forward to the release of "Air  America," said to be based on the CIA's airline in Southeast Asia and on the  nonfiction book by Christopher Robbins, "Air America -- The Story of the CIA's  Secret Airline."  </P> <P> I know "it's just a movie" and not a documentary, but screenplay writers John  Eskow and Richard Rush missed a golden opportunity to tell the true story of  Air America, one of the most important of the Vietnam War: a recounting of men  who flew, fought and, at times, died.  </P> <P> * James (Earthquake) McGovern and Wallace Buford, flying supplies for Civil Air  Transport (Air America's predecessor) to the encircled French garrison at Dien  Bien Phu, were killed when their craft was hit by communist fire in 1954,  becoming the only Americans to die in combat during the French Indochina War.  </P> <P> * George Ritter, Roy Townley and Ed Weiddenback were reported missing in 1971  after their C-123 was believed hit by anti-aircraft fire.  </P> <P> * T.D. Latz piloted the Air America Huey helicopter that was photographed  rescuing Americans and South Vietnamese from the rooftop of the U.S. embassy in  Saigon on April 29, 1975, the last day of U.S. involvement in South Vietnam and  the day before the South Vietnamese government surrendered; the photo became  one of the war's most memorable images.  </P> <P> To this day, most Americans know little of the real history of the Vietnam War  or of the Air America crew members who, although killed or missing in action,  are not honored with the inscription of their names on the Vietnam War National  Monument in Washington because they were contract employees for the CIA.  </P> <P> JOSEPH MONTOYA  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Implementation Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the Interim Rule accompanying the Policy Statement, the Commission also adopts EEI's proposal that if utilities have rate schedules on file that expressly provide for the recovery of all incremental or out-of-pocket costs, these utilities should be allowed to make abbreviated rate filings, limited to detailing how they would recover emissions allowance costs. These filings should include the following: the index or combination of indices to be used, the method by which the emission allowance amounts will be calculated, timing procedures, how inconsistencies, if any, with dispatch criteria will be reconciled, and how any other rate impacts will be addressed. These filings would constitute rate schedule amendments under FPA section 205 since they would describe how the rates are computed. Utilities making such abbreviated filings should: (1) clearly identify the filing as being limited to amendments to coordination rates to reflect the costs of emissions allowances, in the first paragraph of the letter of transmittal accompanying the filing, (2) submit a document that can be inserted into each rate schedule and (3) identify each rate schedule to which the amendment applies. Finally, the abbreviated filing should apply consistent treatment to all coordination rate schedules or the filing utility should justify its failure to do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding coordination rates that do not provide for the recovery of all incremental costs, <FOOTCITE>38</FOOTCITE>  we conclude that the seller may include rate schedule amendments together with the abbreviated filing discussed above if the customer agrees to the rate change. If the customer does not agree to revise such rates, the utility should tender its emission allowance proposal in a separate section 205 rate filing, fully justifying its proposal. This will ensure that the processing of uncontested rate filings is not delayed by disputes over individual agreements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 38 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Some coordination rates provide only for the recovery of incremental fuel costs, and contain no provisions for recovery of other incremental costs. Also, some coordination transactions, while premised upon incremental costs, take place under stated rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, APPA expresses concern that affected parties be afforded an opportunity to challenge application of the policy announced herein on a case-by-case basis. APPA's concerns are satisfied because, in all cases, the filings would be noticed and customers provided an opportunity to comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 45-Day Amendment Period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission adopts EEI's proposal that utilities be allowed to implement the policy announced herein on January 1, 1995, but make the filings discussed above within 45 days after the Commission issues an order in this proceeding. In return for granting waiver of notice, the utilities must agree that revenues will be collected subject to refund pending Commission action. Utilities making such filings should include a statement in the first paragraph of their transmittal letter agreeing to the refund condition with respect to allowance-related charges assessed between January 1, 1995, and the date the Commission issues an order accepting the filing without investigation or hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Information Collection Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) regulations at 5 CFR 1320.13 require that OMB approve certain information and recordkeeping requirements imposed by an agency. The information collection requirements in this policy statement are contained in FERC&hyph;516 ``Electric Rate Schedule Filings'' (1902&hyph;0096).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is issuing this Policy Statement and Interim Rule with the information requirements to carry out its regulatory responsibilities under the Federal Power Act to determine the appropriate ratemaking treatment of sulfur dioxide emissions allowances in coordination transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Policy Statement and Interim Rule provide guidance to public utilities on the ratemaking treatment of emissions allowances in coordination transactions in order that the CAAA emissions allowance program will be implemented in accordance with the Congressional mandate. The Commission's Office of Electric Power Regulation uses the data for determination for the reasonableness and justness of costs for emissions allowances when a public utility seeks to pass through its costs in wholesale rates. These collections of information are intended to be the minimum elements needed for utilities to file amendments to their rate schedules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is submitting to the Office of Management and Budget a notification of these proposed collections of information. Interested persons may obtain information on these reporting requirements by contacting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415]. Comments on the requirements of this rule can be sent to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Washington, D.C. 20503, (Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) FAX: (202) 395&hyph;5167.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Public Comment Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission invites interested persons to submit additional written comments on the matters addressed in this Interim Rule. An original and 14 copies of the comments must be filed with the Commission no later than January 23, 1995. Comments should be submitted to the Office of the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, and should refer to Docket No. PL95&hyph;1&hyph;000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All other written comments will be placed in the Commission's public files and will be available for public inspection in the Commission's Public Reference Room at 941 North Capitol Street, N.E. Washington, D.C. 20426, during regular business hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This Policy Statement and Interim Rule are effective January 1, 1995. Because Phase I of the CAAA begins January 1, 1995, public utilities subject to the Commission's jurisdiction need to have in place as of that date a method of recovery in rates of the cost of emissions allowances used in coordination transactions. For that reason the Commission finds good cause to make the Interim Rule effective without prior notice and comment, and finds good cause to make the Interim Rule effective on less than 30 days' notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 18 CFR Part 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, electric power, natural gas, pipelines, reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

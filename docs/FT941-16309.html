			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Arts: Etched on the memory - Recent work by Chris Orr and Norman Ackroyd To think of prints within the context of British art in the last 30 years is to think first of the mass of screenprints, then of the offset lithographs that were published in large editions to make contemporary art available to a wider public. So ran the argument in the entrepreneurial 1960s, and still it runs. That these 'original works of art' proved not so cheap reflects not merely the undoubted technical skills of the master printers who, for the most part, made them for the supervising artists, nor the increasingly sophisticated machinery at their command, but also a natural business acumen. After all, an edition of 500 at only Pounds 500 a throw comes to - well, quite a lot, even after overheads. There are not so very many artists even today who can command as much for a single painting. Good luck to them. I make the point only to make the further point that such essentially commercial an enterprise was superimposed upon the much older practice of the artist-printmaker, who works directly upon the block or plate or stone, draws or engraves or etches it, and proofs the thing himself. Such is the true 'original print', small in the edition, direct in the expression, the product of labour as intensive and personal as the creative process itself. In this we have a strong and continuing tradition that goes back through early Hockney, early Freud and early Sutherland to Brockhurst, Strang, Menpes, Sickert, Hayden, Whistler, Keane and Cruikshank and beyond. Two of the best and most idiosyncratic of our current etchers, both of them well into their mature careers, are now showing together for a short time at the Bankside Gallery. With Chris Orr we find ourselves indeed looking further back to the gleeful graphic scurrilities of the 18th century and the Regency, though rather to the ribaldry of Rowlandson and Hogarth's more general social satires than to Gillray's wickedly particular political attack. Orr is in fact hardly a satirist at all, so genial and affectionate is his view of man's foibles and preoccupations, whether carnal or spiritual. His suite on the life of William Blake is quite as touching as it is hilarious, taking up incidents and quotations of his wonderful visionary innocence - the tree full of angels on Peckham Rye, for example; the Tyger leaping on his bed; his belief that the world was flat; and this exchange with his wife: 'Good God, here's Edward III.' 'Where?' 'On the other side of the table, you can't see him, but I do, it's his first visit.' But Orr's most engaging image is the large 'Small Titanic', a cut-away side view of the ship full steam ahead, deck by deck, cabin by cabin, gloriously incidental, improbable and inconsequential. There, puffing contentedly at his pipe, is the captain at the wheel and there, far below, the mermaid consoling the crew. And in between? Everything you can imagine: a salesman in ladies' underwear knocking at a cabin door, chickens running round the galley floor, the washing hanging out on deck, the whole world kissing, flirting, flapping, ogling the day away. Wonderful. Orr's drawing as such is deceptively awkward, knowingly innocent, retaining the directness and vivacity of the talented schoolboy artist, just as in the imagery he retains so much of the vivid, jokey, smutty inventiveness of the schoolboy - as though he were Just William off to art school. Any such impression, true as it is to the spirit of the work, belies its technical quality. For these prints are beautifully made, so beautifully that we hardly notice, as we are drawn, engrossed, into the action. Norman Ackroyd is another consummate technical etcher, albeit of rather different and infinitely adventurous a kind. Where Orr uses line, drawn and etched in the usual way, Ackroyd has taken the use of aquatint - in itself a standard technique - to the limits of its expressive potential. Aquatint was always available as a means of establishing broad areas of tone, varied by the time spent in the acid, in relation to whatever the drawn image might be. What Ackroyd does is simply to use it with the freedom of watercolour, and the plate itself as though it were but a page in the sketch-book. He even dispenses with the aquatint altogether, drawing in acid on the plate directly with the brush, as though it were but water from the pot. The effects he achieves place him in direct line with that romantic landscape tradition that is one of the glories of British art. And his practice, too, of setting off to remote and romantic places and using his art to keep topographical account of his journeyings, places him honourably in the steps of his heroes, such as Turner and Crome. The economy of the statement is remarkable, a horizontal line to set the space, a tonal sweep for cloud or mist or hillside, a flicker of interest for undergrowth, an evocative shadow for the ghost of a tree or a rock or a gable end. Sometimes there will be a focus of detail more closely worked and resolved, but not always. And yet there these places are as we know them, if only by power of imagination, from the Stacs of St Kilda to the ramparts of Cadbury Castle - 'Yet still the blood is strong, the heart is Highland,/ And we in dreams behold the Hebrides.' He is using the opportunity at Bankside to make a short review of the work that has come of his more recent expeditions: the Western Shore (Ireland 1987); The Pictish Coast (Scotland 1988); Saint Kilda (1989); the Windrush (1990); the Summer Isles (Hebrides 1991); and North South East West (all over the place), all published by the Penny Press and sold as folios or single prints unless already sold out. Norman Ackroyd &amp; Chris Orr: Bankside Gallery, 48 Hopton Street, SE1, until January 19.</p>

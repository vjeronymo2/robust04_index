			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Management: Hats off to mother-in-law - My Office / Lucy Kellaway visits Ian Plenderleith, a banker who views the international financial markets down the barrel of a popgun The Bank of England's markets supremo looks ill at ease, and glances doubtfully around his room. Urbane and self-possessed when discussing the Exchange Rate Mechanism, Ian Plenderleith seems less comfortable talking about the decor of his room on the Bank's inner courtyard. 'The office is a machine for working', he says briskly. In his case, the machine is so old that one would have thought it obsolete long ago. At the grand old entrance to the Bank in Threadneedle Street, there are no electronic gates, no magnetic security passes. Instead four elderly men in pink tail coats and red waistcoats with shiny silver buttons graciously welcome visitors into the building. Plenderleith is to be found across a wide expanse of mosaic floor and down a dark corridor. A parlour messenger, also clad in pink and red, greets you politely, takes your coat and sees you into a small, slightly dingy ante room to wait while the Bank's associate director finishes a meeting. Plenderleith's office is surprisingly small for the man who oversees all London's financial markets. The atmosphere is heavy, traditional, frumpish even. But Plenderleith defies you to draw any conclusions: 'The building is old and historic, but the organisation is efficient and modern', he says. The room is dominated by two outsize pieces of furniture, a reproduction leather-topped desk and a scuffed grey safe with a combination lock. Given the decisions that pass over Plenderleith's desk - when to support the pound how to pay for the Government's latest burst of spending - there can be no shortage of sensitive papers to fill it with. Were it not for one or two tell-tale signs, this could be the 1950s. There are modern-looking butts in the ashtray. There are four new telephones, one for the outside world, one special circuit for the Bank's senior directors, a hot line to the Treasury and another to the Stock Exchange. But the main concession to the modern age is a bank of six large screens, neatly boxed in a wooden cabinet in an optimistic effort to make them more in keeping with the room. These display all the information available to any of the market-makers in the Square Mile, including their own views of the market. 'I read a great deal of uninspired rubbish,' Plenderleith says crisply. On top of the screens is a relic of the old technology, a black silk top hat that Plenderleith wears once a month when he is playing the role of Government Broker. Does he feel silly in it? Apparently not: 'It is a small but worthwhile part of the tradition', he says. The hat, itself, he is proud of: this one does not come from Bank's own stockpile of silk hats, but from his mother-in-law's attic. There is a British no-nonsense touch about Plenderleith, who starts work at 7.45am and does not waste a moment all day. He talks about the importance of short lines of communication; there are sliding doors on each side wall of his office, one opening onto the man in charge of the gilts market, the other to the one in charge of home finance. 'It takes 17 seconds to walk down to the market makers without hurrying,' he says. Plenderleith is an enthusiastic caller of ad hoc meetings. 'Often during the day I will need to get three or four people together for 20 minutes to deal with a complex subject. It's a lot faster than exchanging memos.' The visitors who pass through all day can expect a mixture of austerity and luxury. They will find none of the sofas, coffee tables and plants that are de rigueur in modern offices. Instead, the room is full of upright Regency- style dining chairs on which guests perch while Plenderleith surveys them quizzically from the other side of his desk. In the morning and afternoon, a tray is brought in by the parlour messenger with silver jugs of tea or coffee and fine white bone china cups. With such a surfeit of tradition, there is little scope for the Bank's employees to stamp their personalities on their surroundings. Plenderleith has added just one touch of his own. On his desk is his 'prize possession' a brightly coloured wooden popgun, a present from his children to celebrate big bang. 'I often feel like pointing it at people', he says.</p>

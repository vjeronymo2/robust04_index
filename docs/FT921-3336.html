			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Fiddling the books WHAT A WEEK this has been, a week whose like we will not see again for . . . several weeks. The Budget. The calling of a UK election. The three-day National Hunt racing festival at Cheltenham. Plus smaller shocks and horrors. No wonder that I survived the week only by placing myself in the care of GREENGOD-VI, the super-computer program owned by one of my closest friends, Jack Hillbrooke, Europe's richest bookmaker. Jack was away this week. He is negotiating for the contract to run state lotteries in Piedmont, Lombardy and Emilia Romagna. But when Jack is away I am more than welcome to seek counselling from GREENGOD-VI, who lives in Jack's house in Mayfair. Tuesday was appalling. I shook and quivered with the pressure of it all, so just before racing started I rang GREENGOD-VI on my mobile phone. GREENGOD-VI was built in North Korea. He was fabulously expensive. Only three people have access to him in any shape or form. 'Hi Mike', he said. 'I suppose you're ringing to say you've bet an unwise amount on the horses at Cheltenham and do I know how to get you off the hook.' 'Yes and yes', I said. 'You're an idiot, Mike. I've told you repeatedly not to bet on Cheltenham. I suppose you've done a Heinz?' 'Yes', I said. A Heinz is six selections in 57 different bets, none of them singles - just one of the nasty ways grubby bookies rob punters. 'I've backed Halkopous, Young Pokey, Granville Again, Trapper John, Paco's Boy and Macarthur.' 'You're mad.' 'I know I am, GREENGOD. What makes it worse is that I've just read the crime figures. The country's awash in crime.' 'So why should you worry? I know from police records that you've never been robbed, beaten, wounded, burgled, raped, kidnapped or defrauded.' 'That's exactly why I'm worried. According to the law of av - - ' ' - - Forget the law of averages. One day, it's true, the law of averages is going to sneak up behind you, Michael, and bite your neck, but in the meantime you have far more pressing problems. How much have you bet on Cheltenham? 'I dare not say.' 'I can easily find out. While Jack is away I am under instruction to spread dismay and consternation among his rivals. I can read all their records in a fraction of a second. I've sent Ladbroke a virus and put a spell on Coral.' 'How will that help me?' 'I'll think about it, Michael. Don't ring me tonight. I'll be analysing the Budget. Don't ring me on Wednesday. I've got an assignment from the White House: how to save George Bush. So ring me on Thursday, after racing's finished.' The week was a nightmare. On Tuesday I lost all 57 units. On Wednesday I financed another Heinz, and lost 42 units. On Thursday I lost all 57 again. Total loss: 156 units. Disaster faced me; I was halfway down queer street, possibly three-quarters. So I dialled GREENGOD-VI. 'It's me', I said. 'Of course', said GREENGOD-VI. 'I've been watching your sorry progress these past three days. You haven't got a clue. Your analysis was badly flawed and your betting strategy exobiologic. (He meant unearthly; he often speaks like that). 'But don't worry, Michael. I have cooked up a scheme to save your skin. Because I can penetrate the computer records of all bookmaking firms, I have established accounts in your name at Ladbroke's, Coral's, Hill's and the Tote. 'You are Pounds 3,064.59 in credit at Ladbroke, Pounds 17,552.07 at Coral, Pounds 11,897.55 at Hill and Pounds 32,246.98 at the Tote. That totals Pounds 64,761.09, which I plan to launder through the commodity markets in the next 23 hours. 'That will take it to approximately Pounds 155,500. This weekend, I will redeposit Pounds 64,761.09 in your new betting accounts for your personal use, and reinvest the surplus on Labour to win the election. Your worries are over.' I did not speak for a moment. Something was badly wrong. 'GREENGOD', I said finally. 'I am astonishingly grateful for what you have done, but I'd better come and see you, sit with you tonight, we'll listen to some Beethoven, Moonlight, Appassionata, stuff like that, probably play some Scrabble, discuss the election, anything trivial, the origin of the universe, the future of human sex, something restful, so that you can recover. 'There is something wrong with one of your circuits. If I am Pounds 3,064.59 in credit with poor old Ladbroke, Pounds 17,552.07 with Coral, Pounds 11,897.55 with Hill and Pounds 32,246.98 with the Tote, then the total, before you start laundering, is Pounds 64,761.19, not Pounds 64,761.09. You are 10p out.' GREENGOD-VI was speechless.</p>

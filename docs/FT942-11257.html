			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Observer: Tight-fisted Still on the subject of tercentenaries, the Bank of Scotland has not yet made up its mind how it should celebrate its big birthday next year. It may have been founded by the same man who set up the Bank of England  - but it doesn't sound as if it will imitate the Bank of England's extravagant partying, with everything from floats at the Lord Mayor's show to a specially commissioned musical by Geoffrey Burgon. Even so, the board of the Bank of Scotland should at least be able to be a bit more generous than it was at the time of the 250th anniversary in 1945. Then the staff presented the board with a silver casket which they had to pay for. Indeed, staff members on active service were written to - the only communication they received from the bank during the war - and told that their accounts were automatically being debited to pay for the gesture.</p>

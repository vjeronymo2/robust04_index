			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Opec to maintain ceiling on oil output The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries yesterday took the unprecedented step of deciding to keep its present production ceiling for a full year in a bid to boost weak oil prices. Saudi Arabia, Opec's largest producer, overcame objections from Kuwait, Libya and Gabon to persuade oil ministers to maintain the 24.52m barrel a day ceiling 'without reservation' for the whole of 1995. That means there will be no formal commitment to review the ceiling at Opec's next meeting in Vienna in June 1995. But Iran, Opec's most persistent price hawk, said it would seek a lower ceiling if prices failed to rise by June. Mr Hisham Nazer, Saudi oil minister, was optimistic that the plan would work. 'If you balance supply and demand, ultimately you get higher prices,' he said. Mr Gholemreza Agazadeh, Iran's oil minister, said he would also demand a review if the Opec basket price rose above the organisation's target of Dollars 21 a barrel. In October, the basket price averaged Dollars 15.36. But a Gulf Arab delegate later said that 'any changes would take place only as a result of special circumstances'. Analysts and oil company executives believe yesterday's move will be a positive factor for oil prices, which in real terms are at the same level as 1974. The price of the benchmark Brent blend (January) closed unchanged yesterday at Dollars 16.95 in spite of news of the agreement. But there were differing opinions as to how high prices might go. Some observers believe an Opec production freeze at a time of rising oil demand will push prices above Dollars 25 a barrel towards the end of 1995, if UN sanctions preventing Iraq from exporting remain. Others are more cautious. Mr Joe Stanislaw of Paris-based Cambridge Energy Research Associates said the agreement might add only 50-75 cents to the average price in 1995. Most of the growth in demand in the past year has been met by a surge in production by non-Opec countries. Editorial Comment, Page 27 Saudis take the heat out of talks, Page 38</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Settling for fourth place For much of the post-war period, British politicians have been embarrassed to boast about their country's military prowess; but now Mr Malcolm Rifkind has suggested to Britons, and above all to his own rightwing supporters, a new source of pride - it might be dubbed the importance of being fourth. 'Only the United States, Russia and France can deploy as broad a range of capabilities . . .' as Britain, Mr Rifkind said yesterday, in one of few real sound-bites he had to offer reporters. His definition of strength is a carefully chosen one: there are many countries with far bigger land armies - Turkey, for example - and, by next year, the Royal Navy's total of 35 main surface ships will leave Britain as little better than a middle-ranking sea power. However, the basis for his statement is clear enough. By retaining its submarine-based nuclear deterrent, a land army in Europe and a host of minor ex-colonial commitments, Britain can certainly claim to be carrying out an extraordinarily wide range of duties for a country of its size. Yesterday's document lists 31 separate areas of engagement for the British armed force: from the Falkland Islands to Belize to Gibraltar to Hong Kong. But several of the ex-colonial commitments are due to disappear imminently, and if by 'breadth' Mr Rifkind is referring simply to the geographical extension of Britain's commitment, then the country will not hold its fourth place for long. Britain will soon withdraw land forces from Belize and Berlin and and its naval presence in Bermuda is also due for the axe. By 1997 it must quit Hong Kong. Mr Michael Clark, director of the Centre for Defence Studies, points out that the document confuses two things: the fact that Britain retains some minor colonial commitments, which are an accident of history, and the fact that Britain is still highly respected for the quality of its armed forces. The reputation of the British military should ensure the country a role  - in training, peace-keeping and as an arms exporter - far beyond its shores.</p>

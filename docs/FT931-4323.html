			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: SBC helped by extraordinary gain SWISS Bank Corporation (SBC), Switzerland's second-largest banking group, avoided a sharp decline in profits last year thanks to an extraordinary SFr255m (Dollars 165.3m) net gain on asset sales. The extraordinary gain came almost entirely from the sale last May of the bank's 97.7 per cent stake in the Austrian electric utility, Steiermarkische Elektrizitat, to another Austrian utility, Oesterreichische Elektrizitatswirtschaft. The group yesterday revealed that net consolidated profit fell to SFr1.006bn from SFr1.032bn a year earlier. Net income from operations slid 30 per cent to SFr758m, by far the worst performance among the big three Swiss banks. However, the SFr14-a-share dividend is being maintained, and Mr Walter Frehner, chief executive, said he was 'cautiously optimistic' about an earnings improvement. Like other leading international banks, SBC suffered last year from a hefty boost in bad-loan provisions, which jumped by nearly one-third to SFr1.9bn. The unusual negative development at SBC was a 13.1 per cent surge in operating costs to SFr4.1bn, which significantly outpaced the 9.3 per cent growth of net operating income to SFr7bn. SBC officials attributed about SFr120m of the SFr471m increase in expenses to conservative treatment of the costs of reorganising the group's Swiss private banking businesses and of integrating the O'Conner derivatives subsidiary. Mr Frehner, who is to become chairman next month, pointed out that in spite of these setbacks the group's earning power remained intact. Cash-flow advanced 4.5 per cent to SFr2.9bn last year. Moreover, SBC's financial strength, which was implicitly questioned last May when Moody's downgraded its credit rating, has improved. The risk-weighted capital ratio, according to the so-called BIS formula, rose from 10.9 per cent at the end of 1991 to 11.5 per cent at the end of last year - the highest among the big three Swiss banks. The capital strengthening reflected a 2.9 per cent decline in assets to SFr201bn at the end of 1992, which was in turn caused by a 4.6 per cent slide in lending to customers, to SFr113bn, and a 14 per cent cut in interbank lending to SFr42bn.</p>

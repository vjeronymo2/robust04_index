			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Kiev TV-1 Television Network in  Ukrainian at 1900 GMT on 14 December carries its regular "UTN"  program which contains a report on the reaction of Ukrainian  People's Deputies to the results of elections in Russia.    Head of the Democratic Party, People's Deputy V. Yavorivskiy  says that now Ukraine has Zhirinovskiy's Russia, not Yeltsin's  Russia, as a neighbor. He says that this should be a serious  lesson to Ukraine. He then says that even though he believes  that there are no forces similar to Zhirinovskiy's forces in  Ukraine, all the Ukrainian forces should ask the people of  Ukraine to elect sensible people to the Parliament.    People's Deputy B. Oleynik stresses the point that Yeltsin  himself and his forces brought Zhirinovskiy to victory, just  like Gorbachev brought Yeltsin to victory.    People's Deputy Yu. Gnatkevich says that lesson no. 1 is  that  the Ukraine should implement reforms rather than mark time,  otherwise the people will vote for any dictator or a demagogue.  Lesson no. 2 is that exhaustive information about elections  should be provided, because people are confused and can elect  someone who simply gives good promises. Lesson no. 3 is that  democrats should unite on the basis of a common platform and  should form a single bloc that would unite all those who support  reforms, private property, and denationalization. Another lesson  is that elections in Russia showed that people can access power  in Russia on the basis of slogans proclaiming restoration of the  foundations of a great imperial power.    This is followed by a commentary over visuals by Yu. Gorovoy  on the same subject. Reporter comments on territorial claims  made by Zhirinovskiy in the course of his election campaign,  noting that he already refers to Ukraine as "small Russia" and  does not hide his intention to restore Russia within the  boundaries of the former empire. Reporter then says that Ukraine  should remember the "mistakes of its great neighbor", which are  as follows. The central bodies of power were completely detached  from provinces. The economic program has proved itself only in  theory. As for the population, it could not endure social  problems associated with transition from a planned economy to a  market economy. The main reason for the success of the Reds and  the Brownshirts is lack of unity between democratic parties,  which failed to recognize a common enemy due to internal  discord. If Ukraine wants to preserve its independence, it  should recognize this enemy, evaluate it, and develop a process  to ensure formation of a strong and healthy Parliament and the  government.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Geest agrees exclusive deal for Chilean produce GEEST, the UK foods group, has agreed an exclusive partnership with United Trading Company in Chile on the supply of fruit and vegetables to the UK. It is intended to provide a model for the standards which should be met by Geest's suppliers in other countries, and responds to stricter UK food safety laws aimed at making companies like Geest more directly responsible for the quality of imported foodstuffs. 'Very few companies are willing to commit themselves to these standards, but Geest has come off the fence,' said Mr Alan Forrester, development director for Geest International Produce. 'Our suppliers will have to perform against some very difficult requirements. Those that don't qualify will be isolated: those that are accredited will be significantly helped in the UK market,' said Mr Forrester. UTC is Chile's fourth largest fruit and vegetable exporter, accounting for 9.7m cartons in the 1990-91 season. Just 300,000 of these came to the UK. Products range from grapes, pears and apples to plums, kiwi fruit and avocados. Under the agreement, Geest will use no other supplier in Chile. Nor will UTC sell to any other UK importer. The agreement involves 'total transparency', Mr Forrester said. Geest is to have full access to UTC's market information, and at the same time provide advice on quality control, and information about the UK market. He said Geest would not have been willing to share market knowledge so openly with UTC if the Chilean company had not agreed to an exclusive deal.</p>

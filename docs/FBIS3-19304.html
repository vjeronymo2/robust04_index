			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Luxembourg Foreign Affairs </F> Minister Jacques Poos by Wim Brummelman in Luxembourg on 12  March: "Our Relationship Is an Example for Europe"]    [Text] Luxembourg, 12 March -- Just as Alfons Verplaetse,  the governor of the National Bank of Belgium, fights not only  for the credibility of the Belgian currency, but also for the  stability of the Luxembourg franc, so do Netherlands diplomats  look after the interests of not only the Kingdom of the  Netherlands, but also those of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg in  many parts of the world.    The Netherlands has embassies in 87 countries, whereas  Luxembourg has representations in only 19 countries. That is  why Netherlands diplomats act on behalf of Luxembourg if that is  convenient. They prepare visits by political and trade  missions, and Luxembourg subjects can turn to Netherlands  embassies if they need help.    This is a unique form of diplomatic cooperation which,  according to Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques F. Poos, would  serve as "a good example" for other member states of the  European Union to combine their powers. With the fall of the  Berlin Wall and the dismantling of the Soviet Union, some 20 new  states have already been created in Europe alone. It is very  expensive to open diplomatic posts in all these countries. That  is why the small- and medium-sized member states of the European  Union would be well-advised to open joint representations in the  future, Poos said.    The diplomatic cooperation between Luxembourg and the  Netherlands stretches back to the last century when Luxembourg  was made a Grand Duchy in personal union with the Netherlands  under the terms of the Vienna Congress. The first of April will  mark the 30th anniversary of the conclusion of an official  cooperation treaty between the two countries. In order to  celebrate the anniversary, Minister Poos today opened --  together with Prime Minister Santer (who is also minister of  culture) and in the presence of Foreign Minister Kooijmans -- an  exhibition of Netherlands and Luxembourg artists at the Musee  National d'Art et d'Histoire. The exhibition will travel to our  country in May.    Poos' desire to have the Luxembourg-Netherlands example  imitated contrasted sharply with the humiliating experience the  minister had earlier this week in Brussels during the  enlargement negotiations for the EU. Norway's accession looked  like it was going to be blocked by 7,000 tonnes of cod. In  addition, the membership of Sweden, Finland, and Austria was  seriously jeopardized by the frontal assault which Great Britain  and Spain launched against the position of the smaller member  states in particular in the Council of Ministers.    To the rage of most of the EU member states, London and  Madrid refused to raise the threshold of the blocking minority  from 23 to 27 votes. By taking this hard-line position, both  governments put a heavy advance burden on the intergovernmental  conference to be held in 1996 on the future structure of the EU.  During that conference the administrative coherence of the EU  is to be reinforced to such a degree that by the end of the  decade the following step -- the inclusion of countries from  Central and East Europe -- can be made flawlessly.    The 58-year-old Poos is clearly disappointed. "Nobody  understands the attitude taken by Spain and Great Britain which  provoked this discussion and jeopardized the current  enlargement. Everyone is guessing at the underlying  considerations," he said. "Naturally, the Union will have a  different geographical configuration after the enlargement. The  weight of northern Europe and the weight of Germany -- through  the adhesion of Austria -- will be reinforced. But surely that  is nothing new? That was already known a year and a half ago  when, at the European summit in Lisbon, we decided that  enlargement should take place quickly and that this accession  would still fit in with the existing institutional relations.  The Spanish and British prime ministers were there and said  `yes.' Now the time has come for a signature, and they are  saying `no.' They have assumed a serious responsibility in  doing so, but I have not yet given up hope that this crisis can  still be overcome in the coming days."    [Netherlands] State Secretary Piet Dankert said this week  that the debate on the voting position must be taken up at the  intergovernmental conference in 1996, when all institutional  changes must be put on the agenda. "I am not saying that in  1996 the Netherlands will definitely agree with 23 votes,"  Dankert said. Poos agrees completely with this position. "Nobody  currently has a clear blueprint" for the future structure of the  Union, he said. However, "everyone does agree that the EU must  remain efficient, and the fundamental principle of equality of  the countries must not disappear," Poos stated Luxembourg's  position. His government is not looking forward to an  institutional revolution. After 1996, too, the maintenance of  Luxembourg's national identity as a founding father of the  united Europe is a priority.    This implies, among other things, that the Grand Duchy is  firmly committed to having a representative in the European  Commission. The suggestion of appointing, say, one commissioner  for the Benelux countries -- once the EU has been enlarged -- in  order to keep the size of the European Commission under control  is unthinkable for the Luxembourg Government. "No, no, no.  That would be unacceptable to the Luxembourg parliament, and  also for the Netherlands parliament. We are not yet that far  advanced with the federal Europe," Poos said. According to him,  "it is up to the Commission, and not the member states" to find  a meaningful distribution of work.    According to Poos, there should also be talk of things  besides the expansion of the powers of the European Parliament.  "I am convinced that the national parliaments will claim their  share of powers in the European decisionmaking process. The  role of the national parliaments at the European level has only  grown in recent years. Europe's democratic legitimacy has two  pillars: one in Strasbourg and one in the national parliaments."    When speaking of national identity you inevitably come to  the  status of Luxembourg as a financial center. Germany, which will  take over the EU presidency this summer, has already hinted it  will submit plans for a European tax on interest income. Bonn  hopes to curb capital flight to neighboring Luxembourg in this  way, but the Luxembourg Government will not cooperate, Poos  announced. Such a proposal is "not acceptable" because that  would start off a capital flight not only from Luxembourg but  from the entire European Union to financial centers outside the  Community. "We will not move as long as gaps inside and outside  the Community remain unplugged," Poos said.    He can say that easily because decisions in this area must  be  made unanimously and not with a majority of the votes. "We  therefore do not need a blocking minority. We have a veto, but  we do not stand alone here. The British, too, do not favor  this, nor do other countries, such as the Netherlands."    Poos the economist is optimistic that the majority of EU  member states can move on to the third phase of economic and  monetary union [EMU] in 1997, and that "the ECU will become the  currency of Luxembourg." Last year, when the Belgian franc  dropped sharply, there were even rumors that Luxembourg wanted  to break off the monetary union with Belgium. However, said  Poos, that would be "a catastrophic option, which we do not even  want to think about seriously." He simply said that Belgium  would be in a position to move on to EMU along with Luxembourg  in 1997.    Poos' optimism was further strengthened with the visit by  Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski to Luxembourg this  week. The economic recovery is already under way in the United  States, as well as in several East European countries. Economic  growth in Poland is now around 4 percent, according to  Olechowski.    That offers hope. Poos is counting on countries like Poland,  Hungary, and the Czech Republic to become members of the  European Union before the end of the century. "We have no  alternative. If we say `no,' we will send them back into chaos.  Then we would perhaps be responsible if the democratic  governments in these countries were overthrown. That is why we  must say `yes,' and why we have already said `yes.' The only  thing is we cannot yet give an exact date."</p>

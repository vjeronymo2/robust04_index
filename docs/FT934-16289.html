			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Greater financial freedom for Railtrack called for FREEDOM from Treasury controls over public expenditure is essential if rail privatisation is to succeed, according to Mr Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, the organisation that will run the rail infrastructure from April 1994, John Willman writes. Mr Horton told a Conservative party conference fringe meeting that Railtrack planned to act as much as possible like a 'commercially-driven plc' and would require greater freedom from the rigid financial limits that apply to nationalised industries. He hoped to attract private investment and would have to develop a longer-term investment strategy than is possible under the Treasury's three-year public expenditure planning programme.</p>

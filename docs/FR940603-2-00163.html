Many of the audiences targeted have been those with title III responsibilities, including owners and operators of retail stores, supermarkets, hotels and motels, day care centers, and health care and other service providers. Projects directed toward educating those with obligations under title II have included law enforcement agencies, state court systems, 911/emergency response operators, city and town governing bodies, and publicly funded hospitals and other health care services. Targeted audiences have also included people with disabilities with rights under titles II and/or III.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the purpose of the Grant Program is to promote and facilitate voluntary compliance with the ADA, the Department believes that it is necessary to identify, educate and work with professionals at the local, State, and regional level who, because of their professional or technical expertise, provide services to the above audiences and may assist them in understanding and complying with the requirements of the Act. For this reason, the Department has expressed a particular interest in receiving proposals that target this specific audience in the following six priority areas:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Priority 1: Dissemination of ADA informational materials to architects and other design professionals at the local, State, and regional level <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Architects and other design professionals play an essential role in ensuring that newly constructed facilities and additions or alterations to existing facilities are designed and built in accordance with the ADA Standards for Accessible Design. Businesses, State and local governments, service agencies and other ADA covered entities rely on the knowledge and expertise of the architect; they expect that the professional will design a building or facility that will meet a myriad of needs, one of which is compliance with the ADA Standards for Accessible Design.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With access to educational materials and services, architects and design professionals at the local level can help business owners comply with the ADA and reduce claims of discrimination by people with disabilities based on inaccessible facilities or elements. Since the enactment of the ADA, a wealth of educational material on complying with the accessible design requirements has been developed by Federal agencies to be used by entities and individuals with responsibilities and rights under the ADA and professionals who may provide services that will assist these groups in understanding and complying with the requirements of the Act. Examples of such information include the Department of Justice's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ADA Standards for Accessible Design <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and titles II and III  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Technical Assistance Manuals <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; the Access Board's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ADA Accessibility Guidelines Checklist  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and various  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Technical Assistance Bulletins  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (addressing accessibility topics such as detectable warnings, visual alarms, TTYs, slip-resistant surfaces and using ADAAG). Other materials have been produced through federally funded grant programs and examples include DOJ funded projects such as the American Hotel and Motel Association's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Accommodating All Guests  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> compliance manual, the Food Marketing Institute's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ADA Starter Kit for Supermarkets  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ADA Compliance Manual for Supermarkets <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and the National Restaurant Association's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ADA: Answers for Foodservice Operators  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> compliance manual and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A Warm Welcome  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> videotape on compliance for the food service industry. Examples of grants funded through the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) include numerous  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ADA Design Tech Sheets  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (illustrated technical materials addressing such topics as signage, areas of rescue assistance, accessible route, ATMs, curb ramps, ground and floor surfaces, etc.), and the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Title II Action Guide for State and Local Governments <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Government has also created a variety of informational services, such as the Department of Justice's toll-free ADA Information Line, through which individuals can speak directly with an ADA Specialist, or access recorded information about the requirements of the ADA 24 hours a day. Information about the ADA may also be downloaded through the Department's Electronic Bulletin Board. Similar services are available through other Federal agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Despite the existence of these materials, many of which are available free of charge from the Department and other Federal agencies, many professionals at the local level are unaware of their availability and continue to design and build facilities that do not comply with the ADA Standards for Accessible Design.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The goal of Priority 1 is to develop a nationwide system to inform architects and design professionals about the ADA and the availability of these informational materials and services to ensure dissemination of existing ADA materials to practicing architects and other design professionals at the local level. The project should utilize existing channels, such as professional and trade organizations, trade publications, meetings, and electronic media to inform as wide an audience of design professionals as possible of the availability of informational materials and services and to assist with dissemination. In establishing this system, the project should seek to establish links between existing Federal information resources and private dissemination channels and implement an approach through which the Department can continue to disseminate new materials to targeted audiences, as they are developed, on an on-going, long-term basis following the conclusion of the grant period. Types of mechanisms that could be used to accomplish this might include the development of articles for publication in trade journals, the distribution of sample or resource packets to architectural libraries, the presentation of information about the ADA and the availability of Federal resources and materials through computer networks and electronic media, etc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / BNFL to shed 2,000 Sellafield jobs British Nuclear Fuels plans to cut a third of its workforce at its Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria over the next five years in an effort to cut costs, the company said yesterday. It will also shed 200 jobs at Chapelcross in Dumfries. Mr Grahame Smith, director of BNFL's UK group, said the company had to cut costs by 20 per cent or Pounds 100m a year for the next five years in order to remain competitive. He said he was confident of a viable future for BNFL's UK business, 'providing we continue to help our customers to reduce their cost base and compete with fossil fuels'. BNFL's customers are the UK nuclear generators for which it reprocesses spent fuel. BNFL will reduce the number of jobs at Sellafield by 2,000 over the next five years, but officials stressed that it plans to make no compulsory redundancies. The job losses would leave 5,000 full-time employees at Sellafield and Chapelcross. The job losses will not affect BNFL's controversial Thorp reprocessing plant which employs 1,500 people, the company said. But opponents said the job losses would have an adverse impact on the local economy similar to what would have been felt if the government had refused permission for the Thorp plant, for which ministers gave the go-ahead in February. BNFL had used the impact on the local economy as an argument for going ahead with Thorp. Cumbria County Council called the job cuts 'a major blow'. Mr Alan Clark, chairman of the council's economic development committee, said: 'This is desperately disappointing news.' Sellafield is the largest employer in the area, where unemployment rates at 9.6 per cent are high. The company's announcement comes just a week after the UK government embarked on an all-embracing review of the nuclear power industry. BNFL said the timing of its announcement had nothing to do with the review and that, unlike Nuclear Electric, one of its nuclear generator customers, it had not been lobbying for privatisation. 'We have to get into a strong business position: that is what is behind the job losses,' an official said. The company said the nuclear generators were having to compete in an increasingly competitive electricity supply sector and the company needed to cut its costs for the services it provides.</p>

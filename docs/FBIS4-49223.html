Janabil, deputy secretary of the regional party committee  and  chairman of the regional committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference, expressed warm  congratulations to the station on behalf of the regional party  committee and the regional government at a ceremony for the  start of broadcasting by the music station.    Janabil said: The music station should publicize the main  theme and adhere to the correct media orientation like the  people's station and the economic affairs station. It should  broadcast more musical works which can represent China's  national tradition and spirit and the atmosphere of the times,  as well as famous and artistic Chinese and foreign music and  songs. The music station and the people's station should take  an active attitude toward organizing the creation of more  musical works which can encourage people of various  nationalities to work hard and make progress and satisfy the  increasing spiritual and cultural needs of the people.    In conclusion, Janabil expressed his hope that various  circles in society would vigorously support the music station.

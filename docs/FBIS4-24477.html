			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ning Shiqun (1337 0013 5028)] </F>   [Text] Lhasa, 30 May (XINHUA) -- The party Central  Committee and the State Council have attached great importance  to infrastructure construction in Tibet. Over the past decade,  large sums of money have been invested in the region and  significant achievements have been made in the development of  energy sources, transportation, communications, irrigation,  education, and other infrastructure construction projects.    Tibet has scored significant results in building energy  sources. As of end of 1993, the total capacity of electric power  stations reached 173,400 kw, capable of generating 399 million  kwh of electricity. Now 79 percent of counties and cities and  32 percent of townships are being served with electricity. The  construction of the state invested Yangzhuoyong Lake pumping and  power generating station, which has a capacity of 112,500 kw is  being stepped up. The first phase project for the Nagqu  underground heat experimental power station, which is a  sino-foreign joint venture, has been completed and put into  operation. China's current largest underground heat  experimental power station--the Yangbajing Underground Heat  Power Station--with a capacity of 24,000 kw has also been put  into operation. Construction of power stations in the 19  counties which so far have no electric power is being  accelerated.    The construction of transportation projects in Tibet is  being  stepped up. As of now, the total length of highways reaches  22,000 kms. A highway network with Lhasa as the center has been  formed in the main, and highways now lead to every county in the  region.    Tibet's posts and telecommunications facilities have been  greatly improved. As of the end of 1993, there were 125 post  and telecommunications bureaus and offices, and 24 earth  communications stations [tong xin di qiu zhan 6639 0207 0966  3808 4541] had been built. There are 301 long distance  telephone lines, and 65 counties and cities now have telephone  service with a total of 35,400 telephones. A postal and  telecommunications network with Lhasa as the center has been  formed. In 1993, the total volume of postal and  telecommunications business reached 32.73 million yuan. In the  past decade, the average annual growth volume of operation of  postal and telecommunications services was 16.8 percent.    Capital construction for agricultural production and animal  husbandry in Tibet has been further strengthened. As of the end  of 1993, more than 20,000 irrigation projects of various sizes  have been built. There are 174 water diversion projects and  5,075 small water reservoirs and ponds with a total storage  capacity of 350 million cubic meters. There are 129 pumping  stations, 174 drinking water projects for people and animals,  and 21 dike projects with a total length of 252 kms. The total  irrigated area for farmland reached more than 1 million mu,  accounting for 30 percent of arable land. The total irrigated  area of grassland reached more than 30 million mu, and 4.25  million mu of grassland have been fenced. The comprehensive  development for "one river and two streams" has achieved initial  results. The construction of grassland, fences, and disaster  prevention bases for livestock has produced benefits. Scientific  and technological services for agricultural production and  animal husbandry have also made new progress.    The strategy of giving priority to developing education in  Tibet has been implemented. Over the past decade, Tibet has set  up a new university, two new technical secondary schools, 13 new  middle schools, and 775 new primary schools. At present, the  total enrollment of students exceeds 245,000, and 63.2 percent  of school-age children in the region are attending school.</p>

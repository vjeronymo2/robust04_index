			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Mr Li rebuffed in Hong Kong bid MR LI Ka-shing and his mainland Chinese partner, Citic Pacific, were dealt a rare rebuff over the weekend when Henderson Investment emerged as the owner of 35 per cent of Miramar Hotel and Investment, currently under offer by Mr Li's Cheung Kong and Citic. Henderson, controlled by rival Hong Kong property tycoon Mr Lee Shau-kee, paid HKDollars 17 a share and HKDollars 10 a warrant for 34.8 per cent of Miramar's shares and 34.5 per cent of its warrants. Both prices were 50 cents higher than the revised offer Mr Li and Citic made for the hotels and property group late last week. Cheung Kong and Citic immediately raised their offer to the level at which Henderson had dealt, valuing Miramar at HKDollars 9.63bn (Pounds 1.32bn). But the emergence of Henderson in the Miramar contest betrays a miscalculation on the part of Mr Li, generally regarded as one of Hong Kong's most astute property tycoons. Contested takeovers in Hong Kong are rare. Usually controlling shareholders of companies under potential offer are squared off first, making the bid a formality. None of the parties are talking to the media, but it appears from public statements by Miramar's now former controlling shareholders that Mr Li and Citic's Mr Larry Yung failed to woo the board in time-honoured fashion. Last week Miramar denounced the bid as 'unfriendly' and claimed the company was worth HKDollars 20 a share. However, the stage appears set for some quintessential Hong Kong horse trading as Henderson's Mr Lee has indicated at the weekend he had no plans to make a full offer. His minority stake would enable him to make a deal with Mr Li and Citic or prevent them from exercising control over Miramar's assets. These include the 500-room Miramar Hotel in Tsimshatsui, Kowloon's main tourist district, as well as 900,000 sq ft of office space in the same area. Both are viewed as being under-exploited by their former owners. Property analysts in Hong Kong regard both properties as ripe for redevelopment. With Citic's mainland Chinese connections, analysts believe if Mr Li and Citic were to succeed in the bid, they could finance a large part of the offer by selling office space to mainland interests.</p>

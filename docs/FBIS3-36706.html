Observers believe that since Admiral Baltin effectively  takes  orders only from the defense minister and the commander in chief  of the Russian Federation Navy (although the Black Sea Fleet is  under the command of two presidents -- Russia's and Ukraine's),  Boris Yeltsin should say his word regarding the situation. It  cannot be ruled out that Yuriy Meshkov's election as Crimean  president may speed up the determination of the Black Sea  Fleet's status.    As is known, however, leaders of many Ukrainian parties and  movements and a part of the Ukrainian parliament's deputy corps  insist on a return to the Yalta agreements, while ignoring the  latest ones -- those signed in Massandra. Observers believe  that Boris Yeltsin will find himself in a difficult situation  after the trilateral American-Russian-Ukrainian statement set  forth the principle of the inviolability of borders.    Meanwhile, a confrontation between the Crimean president and  the current lineup of the peninsula's Supreme Soviet is in the  making. Crimean Supreme Soviet Chairman Nikolay Bagrov has taken  a vacation after submitting an application requesting the  parliament to accept his resignation. So far the resignation  has not been accepted. The parliamentary session decided to  return to the subject after Bagrov's return from vacation.  Crimean Council of Ministers Chairman Boris Samsonov has also  announced his resignation and taken a vacation. As many as  three deputy Council of Ministers chairmen have suddenly gotten  sick at the same time: Tatyana Krasikova, in charge of social  matters; Pavel Pashkov, who supervises trade and consumer  services; and Aleksandr Formanchuk, responsible for  international affairs. An effective paralysis of power and a  breakup in the peninsula's entire life-support system are now a  realistic possibility.    For the time being, however, Yuriy Meshkov has announced the  first appointments to his administration. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  wrote in summer 1992 about Major General Valeriy Kuznetsov,  commander of the Crimean Army Corps, who was discharged from  service by the Ukrainian defense minister. On 29 June 1992 he  was elected Crimean Supreme Soviet deputy. Now Dmitriy Kuznets  is a presidential military adviser. Colonel Valeriy Grishankov,  former chief of the Crimean army corps' special department, who  was dismissed following Kuznetsov, was appointed the president's  chief of staff. Col. Vladimir Demin, a staffer at the special  department, was discharged at the same time. Now he has the  office of presidential adviser for foreign economic affairs.    It was together with Grishankov and Demin (and no one else)  that Yuriy Meshkov flew for a meeting with Ukrainian President  Leonid Kravchuk on 4 February. Information on the meeting was  very scanty from both sides, but Igor Azarov, press secretary of  the Crimean president, told your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  correspondent on 8 February that "Kravchuk does not object to  the simultaneous circulation of the Russian ruble and the  Ukrainian karbovanets." "The president of the Republic of  Crimea attempted to back away from concepts worked out by  Nikolay Bagrov and to start everything from scratch," Igor  Azarov said. The presidential press secretary also told your  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent that Russian President Boris  Yeltsin called Yuriy Meshkov and that a meeting between Yeltsin  and Meshkov "may take place in the very near future; currently  it is being prepared."    Now about yet another appointment made by the Crimean  president, one important for Meshkov's fledgling relations with  the Crimean Tatar People's Assembly. Anife Seytumer-kyzy, a  Crimean Tatar and president of the Crimean-Turkish trading  house, Kara-Kaplan, has assumed the post of presidential adviser  on national matters and relations with public organizations.</p>

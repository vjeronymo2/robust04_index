			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Accountancy: Spectres linger at War on Want battleground - Andrew Jack explains how faulty financial management almost resulted in insolvency for the now healthy charity An announcement last week from the accountancy profession's Joint Disciplinary Scheme, its highest investigative body, has re-opened some painful old sores in a landmark case of poor financial management and auditing of charities. The issue to be examined is the conduct of Somers Baker, a small London-based accountancy practice, and its audit of War on Want, the Third World charity which gained some notoriety for its financial difficulties three years ago. The charity has changed fundamentally since that time and now appears relatively healthy. The robustness of some of the other organisations involved and the degree to which the lessons raised by the case have been learnt is more open to question. War on Want was founded in 1959 by Victor Gollancz, the radical publisher, and Harold Wilson, later to be prime minister. It aimed to be a campaigning organisation, which courted criticism but allowed it to highlight issues in development now far more widely discussed: such as the central role of women and the issue of debt. But the battles with the outside world were more than matched by bloody internal feuds. Deep political rifts and personal rifts developed, financial management was neglected, and War on Want was brought to the brink of insolvency by early 1990. The concerns led to an investigation unprecedented in scope by the Charity Commission. It appointed two outside inspectors who battled with incomplete records and inaccessible personnel members to compile a series of damning findings. Mr George Galloway, who was general secretary of the charity in 1983-87, told the inspectors that War on Want 'seemed often at war with itself . . . no two members of staff saw eye to eye on most things. (There was) deep and almost unbelievable civil war'. While Galloway himself received critical attention in the mid-1980s over concerns about his expenses, the inspectors' report suggests these concerns were minor compared with the wider conduct of the charity. The essential difficulty was a failure to distinguish between War on Want's own 'general' income and expenditure, and that pledged or 'restricted' to charitable purposes. In particular, there was confusion between the charity's accounts and those of two groups set up to provide long-term relief in Africa: the Eritrean Inter Agency Consortium and the Tigray Transport and Agriculture Consortium. There were not, for example, separate bank accounts for these entities. The result, according to the Charity Commission inspectors, was material misstatement of the audited accounts in every year during 1985-89. The general fund reserves in the audited accounts for the year to March 1985 were Pounds 485,256; adjusted by the inspectors, they were Pounds 352,256. By the year to March 1988, the audited accounts showed Pounds 1,163,503; the inspectors restated them as a Pounds 41,497 deficit. The confusion led to the charity undertaking projects it may not have been able to afford, and diverting money provided by donors to activities other than those for which they had been solicited. Loans which should not have been approved were also made from the charity to its trading subsidiaries. Few escape unscathed from the scrutiny of the inspectors. The members of the council of management, the officers, general secretaries, finance officers and auditors all come in for criticism. Both the trustees and the auditors appeared to place too much reliance on each other. Hardly any of the elected council expressed any interest or possessed any skills in financial or legal issues. As Galloway told the inspectors: 'No one wanted to sit on any committees except the programmes committee . . . which was talking about exotic places.' As far as the Joint Disciplinary Scheme is concerned, the findings against Somers Baker appear powerful. Mr Frank Weinberg, one of the two partners in the firm and the one in charge of the audit, has since refused to comment publicly. The firm had been both accountant and auditor to War on Want since 1980, and also took on the job as auditor to the consortia. It was involved in the recruitment of a finance officer, an investigation into the general secretary's expenses, a review of accounting systems, and a study into the feasibility of relocating the headquarters. Its total fees during 1985-89 were Pounds 51,520. The inspectors heard from Mr Weinberg, but were frustrated in their examination because Somers Baker told them that many of its working papers had been mislaid or destroyed in a fire. They none the less determined that the firm failed to carry out proper tests which would have revealed that the accounting system was not functioning and material errors could result. 'We have to conclude that Somers Baker's errors were serious; overall this was a poor auditing performance,' they said. The inspectors found no evidence of audit planning, partner review of programme prior to audit, review of working papers at the conclusion, review of post balance sheet events, or the appropriateness of the going concern basis for the accounts. For the two years to March 1987, no qualified staff worked with Weinberg on the audit. Not all work was documented, and he confirmed that he sometimes relied on his own long-standing involvement to make judgments without always recording his decisions and actions. Somers Baker has to some extent already paid the price for these omissions. Faced with a writ claiming damages of more than Pounds 2m from the charity, it settled out of court in October for Pounds 309,500. It appears that the firm has also been twice visited by the Joint Monitoring Unit charged with audit regulation to assess its capability to practice. It remains registered. War on Want went through a management transformation, with a new director and trustees, changes to the constitution, separate bank accounts and professional advice to improve its systems. Its accounts - which have received an unqualified opinion - clearly label 'restricted' and 'general' funds. They show a solvent organisation with rising donations. Self-regulation within accountancy has again been called into question for the glacial speed of action over the case. The inspectors' report was published in February 1991. It will have taken more than three years before any verdict is made some time in 1994. Many in the charity sector have taken heed of the findings of the report informally. But the ambitious recommendations made at the start of the report by the Charity Commission inspectors - at a time when charity law was under review for the first time in two decades - have been largely neglected. They suggested that for larger charities, the Commissioners should have additional supervisory powers; that there should be a list of approved auditors; and a requirement on auditors to report to the Charity Commission. They argued for a minimum number of trustees with proven financial or legal expertise and charity experience. They called for special rules dealing with consortia. No such recommendations have been implemented. In their absence, the report still provides an object lesson for those involved in the management of charities. As Mr Giampi Alhadeff, War on Want's director since the restructuring, puts it: 'If there is a lesson, it is that the trustees are the owners and guardians. There is no responsibility more onerous than on trustees.'</p>

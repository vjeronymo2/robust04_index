			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Lib Dems 'hit by low brand loyalty' Taylor Nelson AGB, the UK's biggest market research group, has found some bad news for the Liberal Democrats. A survey for the group, applying the concept of brand loyalty to the main political parties, found that loyalty to the parties is much lower than for leading consumer brands. The bad news for the Liberal Democrats is that like 'most number-three brands', the party not only has a relatively small number of supporters but also a relatively low degree of commitment among those supporters. Labour, according to the survey, has highest proportion of hardcore supporters. A total of 57 per cent said they were entrenched or unlikely to back another party. The comparable figures for the Conservatives are 40 per cent, and only 20 per cent for the Liberal Democrats. Most voters who have switched voting intentions are not very committed to their new party. For example, AGB said, 13 per cent of Tory voters at the last election would now vote Labour, but just one third said they were strongly committed to their new party. Of the 11 per cent of Tory defectors who would now vote Liberal Democrat, less than one fifth are really committed to their new choice. But Mr Stephan Buck, an AGB director, said those who were unhappy with the party they supported at the moment were equally disenchanted by the other possibilities. The disenchantment figure was 25 per cent - 'significantly higher than that record for any branded consumer product and twice as bad as that registered for the performance of the three US presidential candidates' in 1992. Mr Buck said that although Conservative support had been severely dented and Labour's position had strengthened drastically in recent months, the gain from ex-Tory voters was likely to be 5 percentage points rather than the 12 points to 15 points suggested. The survey was carried out after the Labour conference last month and was based on 1,000 adults.</p>

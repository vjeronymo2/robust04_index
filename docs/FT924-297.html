			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Arts: Blockbusters continue Every passing year is supposed to bring the international blockbuster exhibition nearer to extinction. Yet in spite of mounting costs and the increasingly restrictive lending policies of the world's museums, the mammoth retrospective seems to be far from dead. 1992 opened with the triumphant Mantegna show at the Royal Academy in London, and ended with the glorious presentation of the work of Matisse at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The Mantegna show managed to secure an unexpectedly large number of paintings as well as drawings and prints, and in a theatrical setting at the RA succeeded in conveying a palpable sense of the artistic personality of this austere Renaissance master. The Metropolitan showing was completely different, with fewer paintings presented against brilliant white walls with a number of works in other media helping to place the artist in context. Another revelation was provided by the gathering of works by Jusepe de Ribera set against scarlet cloth in the imposing vaults of the Castel Sant'Elmo in Naples. The scale, power and intelligence of his urgent, brutal martyrdoms and gory mythologies are lost in reproduction. In his pitch-dark world, raking light is the only sign of salvation and colour comes courtesy of burning coals or flayed flesh. What disturbs even now is that Ribera's protagonists are real people, and his executioners relish their tasks. Ribera's critical reputation has suffered from the numerous copies and imitations of his work. Jacopo Bassano has suffered even more, thanks to the family workshop churning out Bassanesque night-pieces on a near industrial scale until well into the 17th century. His home town of Bassano del Grappa in the Veneto spent some Lire 1.5bn overhauling its museum in order to present a show, in association with the Kimbell Museum of Art in Fort Worth, which unravelled school and master to honour its most famous son on the the 400th anniversary of his death. This summer the Uffizi mounted a spectacular show of 15th century drawings, the high point in what was otherwise a disappointing year of exhibitions marking the fifth centenary of the death of Lorenzo the Magnificent. The display of some 187 sheets, in the main selected from its collection of Florentine drawings - like the British Museum show of its holdings of Rembrandt drawings - is yet another reminder of the virtue of celebrating what is already in one's own back yard. The most unusual treat of the year was the spectacle of Canova's chilly expanses of naked flesh at the Museo Correr in Venice. Among the marble groups and busts, sketches and models amassed from all over Europe were a number of sculptures which gave a unique opportunity to compare the earlier and later versions of the same work, usually to the advantage of the former.</p>

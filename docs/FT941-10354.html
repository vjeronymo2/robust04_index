			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / GM to set up Beijing venture General Motors, the world's largest vehicle manufacturer, is to set up a Dollars 120m (Pounds 82m) joint venture in Beijing to assemble kits to improve engine performance under a contract signed at the weekend. GM's share will be 51 per cent. Its partners, the local Beijing Wan Yuan Corporation and Economic Technology Investment Development Corporation, will take 39 per cent and 10 per cent shares respectively. The new plant, the Wan Yuan-GM Automotive Electronic Control Company, will begin production later this year. Initial output will be 300,000 units annually with a target double that within a few years. Local components will gradually increase to about 70 per cent. Kits will be fully imported in the start-up phase. The new product, an electronic control system, will be made to suit a wide range of vehicles with minor adjustment. It will help reduce emissions and improve fuel efficiency and engine power. GM officials are concerned at possible initial resistance of Chinese car makers, but hope the authorities eventually will require all cars to be equipped with performance enhancing and emission-control systems. GM is involved in a number of joint ventures in China, including production of a 10-seater van at the Jin Bei plant in north-east China. GM shipped 7,500 US-manufactured vehicles and more than than 1,000 Opel sedans to China in 1993.</p>

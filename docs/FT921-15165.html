			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Dunkel plays down Gatt meeting MR Arthur Dunkel, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), yesterday played down the significance of a meeting to gauge governments' responses to draft Uruguay Round accords. He told a news conference that the 108 members of the Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC) would not be asked at the meeting next Monday to accept or reject the 436-page draft 'final act' presented on December 20, but only to say whether it served as the basis for concluding the round 'in the next weeks'. He detected a 'strong consensus' among governments to 'enter the final sprint', with the objective of completing the talks by Easter. Mr Dunkel's formula provides a political escape route for the European Community, which has said the agriculture text as it stands is 'unacceptable', allowing it to call for changes without scuppering the entire package. Other countries, including the US and Japan, also want some renegotiation of the draft, which is based on five years of talks. EC trade and agriculture ministers, meeting last night in Brussels to decide the 12's response to the Dunkel paper, were polarising between the German and British argument that it provided the basis for concluding the Uruguay Round, and France's insistence that the paper's agriculture chapter needed to be totally redrafted. Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, said 'we still are close to a Gatt agreement', provided the direct payments the Community plans for farmers as part of its farm reform plan are made eligible for the 'green box' for subsidies which do not distort trade. Mr Dunkel's paper categorises this compensation for price cuts as illicit subsidies, making the planned reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) politically untenable, the 12 said on December 23. Mr Dunkel said governments were in no position to make a decision on the package because they had yet to see the results of detailed negotiations on tariff cuts for goods, including farm products, and market-opening measures for services. Tariff negotiations are due to be completed by March 31. There will also be some tidying-up of the draft 'final act' by a legal and drafting committee. Meanwhile, a 'fourth track' under TNC auspices allows for consensual changes to the December package. Describing that package as 'mainly and fundamentally negotiated' by participants, Mr Dunkel said governments with problems in any area should first discuss them with trading partners. If countries agreed amendments among themselves, they would be incorporated. But he would not be drawn on how much change was likely or necessary.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Peter Boross by an </F> unidentified announcer in the studio -- live]    [Excerpts] [Announcer] [passage omitted] My one and only  guest tonight is Prime Minister Peter Boross. I respectfully  welcome you in the studio. [passage omitted]    About the immediate future, if you will allow me: You very  often emphasize that you wish to hand over the departments to  the new government members in an extremely careful and  respectable manner. Why is it important to stress this?    [Boross] I make no secret of the fact that I would like to  create a tradition with this. [passage omitted] So I have  prepared appropriate materials, reports--reports containing data  for information as well--at the various ministries, and this  kind of thing is being prepared in the office of the prime  minister, too.    It surprises me....[pauses] Perhaps it was Hungarian  Socialist Party Chairman Gyula Horn who last night said to you  first of all: I would like to see the handover report now.  Well, all I can reply to this is that one should wait and see  who becomes prime minister. We have to have the election, then  an agreement. I will not now hand it over to two, perhaps  three, or even four people--because that is how many there are,  at least, of those who wish to be, or might be, prime ministers.  Then naturally, I will begin contacts with them, and naturally  also with the parties, after 29 May.    [Announcer] You mentioned the parties. How do you see the  stakes in the second round?    [Boross] That the total number of deputies of the Alliance  of  Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]  should not reach two-thirds. For me it is less important  whether the MSZP exceeds 50 percent or not; on the other hand it  is very important--and everywhere I try to say this, to persuade  the voters to vote but not to vote for these two parties--that  they do not achieve the two-thirds majority.    Two-thirds is a very dangerous threshold. In various debates  these gentlemen, that is those of the SZDSZ and the MSZP, say  that they will wish to cooperate with the opposition on the  basis of negotiation even if they have this kind of majority.  But politics has shown that it is better if guarantees remain  within legal frameworks, and to overstep the two-thirds  threshold is very dangerous.    About 40 deputies will be needed for the Hungarian  Democratic  Forum [MDF], the Christian Democrats, the Smallholders, and the  Federation of Young Democrats out of the 174 individual  constituencies still undecided so that there will not be a  two-thirds majority. I am trying to persuade the voters,  perhaps even those who voted for the two seemingly victorious  parties, that it is now in their interest to vote for the above,  and mainly for the candidates of the MDF. In that way there  will be a healthy parliamentary life. [passage omitted]</p>

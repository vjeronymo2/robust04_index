			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHURCH'S SPIRE AND MEANING OF RELIGION  </P> <P> Re the Crystal Cathedral's plans to add a $5.5-million stainless steel spire  because the Rev. Robert Schuller "always felt that all great cathedrals have  spires":  </P> <P> First, I'd like to refer him to Matthew 6: "And when thou prayest, thou shalt  not be as the hypocrites are, for they love to pray in the corners of the  streets, that they may be seen of men. Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon  earth . . . but in heaven . . . for there will be your heart."  </P> <P> Next, I'd like to refer him to my banker. He's good for 9% on deposits of this  size. That works out to a modest $495,000 per year in interest -- tax free for  Schuller -- and no small beginning for any number of projects that could  benefit Orange County's needy.  </P> <P> Come back to earth, reverend. God knows, we could use the help.  </P> <P> S. MENNING  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

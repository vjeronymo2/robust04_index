			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (19): Central controls are eased - Balancing rapid development and popular opinion appears to be the guiding principle of the government / Industrial reforms IN the early years of China's economic reform, factory managers and Communist party secretaries did their job satisfactorily if they expressed support for change and spiced their sentences with the language of newspaper editorials and internal party documents. Reform has come gradually, sometimes erratically, but the accumulated change has altered the character of Chinese industry. Factory managers, whose tasks were neatly described in a state plan, are now aiming at the moving target of a market, and the government wants to peel away the welfare functions of the work unit, leaving a corporate core. The nature of opposition to industrial reform has also changed. In the past, Communist party leaders fought over points of ideology on issues such as bankruptcy, but the reluctance of local governments to use the tool of bankruptcy now has more to do with angering workers and disrupting 'social stability'. Ideological arguments have been settled by the success of reform, but the government is yet to solve some of the more difficult questions confronting industrial China. Many large state-owned companies are still soaking up subsidies to cover losses, and the 'debt chains', the networks of unpaid debts in the state sector, appear to be lengthening again. Smaller, collectively-run and private companies are diversifying into new areas with a passion, pushing up the national rate of industrial output, which rose 23.4 per cent in August, against a year earlier. But some of these new ventures are flooding the market with poor quality products that were a good idea last year but have already lost their niche. Change is begetting change. Factories, such as the Shenyang Cable Works, now responsible for their own profitability, are experimenting with foreign exchange hedging for the first time. As Mr Wang Fuyao, vice president of Shenyang Cable, explained: 'We import raw materials and we have been hurt by exchange rate fluctuations, so we set up a team to research the market and will begin operations next year.' For the first year in its post-revolution history, Shenyang Cable says that products are not sold at a discount for special state projects, and the company has decided that it must trim 1,000 from its 12,600 workforce. But the factory's suggested solution to that awkward problem is typical of the central government's response to reform's unresolved contradictions. 'We, in the management, are not going to decide who should be among the 1,000. We will let the workers decide among themselves. For example, if 600 people are in a certain workshop, we will say that there should be only 550 and let the workers select who the 50 will be. Then we will approve their decision,' says Mr Wang. Similar difficult decisions are being faced and avoided in factories throughout the country. The 'responsibility system,' introduced after early successes in reforming agriculture, has taken hold, but factory managers and the Communist party leadership are still ready to pass the parcel of responsibility, which hinders the identification of worrying trends in industry. Debt chains were hurting industry many years before Mr Zhu Rongji, the vice-premier, was called in to clean up the mess. And, for example, the New Asia General Corporation in Yantai, on the east coast, has been awarded the title of 'Star Unit' by local officials for expanding into business area in which it has no expertise and, in some cases, almost no hope of success in already overcrowded markets. But the 2,000 workers, many of them farmers turned factory managers, have built on the early success of a steel plate factory, creating 18 subsidiaries, which churn out instant noodles, mineral water, lifts, and 'biochemicals'. Like other work units, they have just ventured into the hotel and taxi business and are building a cluster of villas on a nearby hilltop. Asked which is the most profitable of the businesses, Mr Li Xueben, a vice general manager at New Asia, sighed and said: 'The steel plate factory. The production scale at that factory is the largest and the prices are good. The food and drink markets in China are very difficult, but we hope to make a profit with our Xinxin noodles this year.' The relaxation of central control, and the rapid expansion of companies such as New Asia, explains the fall from 12 per cent to 6.5 per cent in the proportion of planned industrial output this year. As well, there was 'guidance' in the form of estimates for about 25 per cent of production, compared with 34 per cent a year ago. China's government has allowed markets to flourish and encouraged competition, but some of the country's largest companies and their managers are ill-equipped for these new conditions. About 31 per cent of state-owned factories reported losses in the first half, but the actual figure is probably far higher, as accounting is one sector still in need of reform. In Shenyang, the northern heart of Chinese heavy industry, the municipal government estimates that 38 per cent of factories in its care are losing money. The government has asked for extra central funds to ensure that these companies, which double as welfare institutions, can continue to provide housing, kindergarten and leisure facilities for their unwieldy workforces. Company housing reform began six years ago, but stalled because local governments are reluctant to push rents to levels that make the purchase of a home an attractive alternative. When reform began, debate about the rights of ownership in a socialist country distracted officials, but now the party is hesitant because of its fears of instability. Balancing rapid development and popular opinion appears to be the guiding principle of the government, but some officials and factory directors are still inspired by ambitious industrial output targets of a kind that once excited Chairman Mao Zedong in his rush for growth. However, in searching for role models, Chinese officials are looking elsewhere. Mr Cai Weici, deputy director of the Ministry of Machinery Industry, has turned to Japan and its Ministry of International Trade and Industry for an example in guiding Chinese companies: 'Their experience is very inspiring. We have done very careful research on how they handled the period of rapid growth and the reform of industry. We are like Japan in the 1960s.'</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ayman al-Mahdi: "Story of the Dish in Egypt"] </F>   [Text] While Damietta Governorate cars were cruising the  streets asking citizens not to use direct-reception antennas  ("the dish") to receive foreign television programs, Cairo's  Muhandisin district was witnessing the publication of a special  magazine carrying the schedules for satellite dish channels. The  magazine's owners (a businessman and his wife) listed the times  of programs that their children and those of the neighbors could  see. They decided not to announce other programs that were  forbidden.    The magazine was intended to be an alternative solution  making it finally unnecessary to ask the businessman and his  wife for an opinion about the dish.    The satellite dish has become a phenomenon and a power  statement from its microphones--magazines are published for  similar objectives. Now that its merchandize, alien to the taste  and values of our community, is in demand, a period of vigorous  debate has begun between two groups--one of them for the dish,  the other against it.    Amid these noisy discussions, Dr. Inshirah al-Shal of Cairo  University's Faculty of Information, was preparing Egypt's first  scientific field study of the reasons for owning a dish antenna,  the effect that interest in watching its programs was having on  the following of Egyptian television programs and the viewing of  videotaped materials, and the 173-case sample's conviction about  spreading the idea of watching programs from abroad after their  having undergone this experience.    In the early eighties the first bowl-shaped antenna ("dish")  appeared in the Cairo skies--in Garden City, to be exact--to  carry news messages at the American Embassy. Antennas began to  spread afterward on the roofs of buildings.    Although the dish made its first appearance in the world at  the beginning of the sixties, it entered Egypt at the citizen  level only nine years ago. It used to be smuggled through the  airports and ports disassembled, until its importation became  legal--provided that the diameter of the dish does not exceed  2.4 meters. Artists, businessmen, major personalities, and  foreign communities became its most prominent customers. Despite  its high price during this period (about $30,000), the  large-diameter American product dominated the market.    During the eighties there were only three agencies in Egypt  importing the dish, including the Egypt Company for Free  Markets. The number of importers had jumped to 59 by the  beginning of 1992. The figure rose markedly at the beginning of  1993. Sources of the antennas became numerous, and the price  fell after moderately-priced antennas affordable to the ordinary  citizen were offered. The Egyptian product entered the scene  through factory antennas and investment company antennas.  <H5>  Authority in the Home </H5>   "Tell me what you watch, and I will tell you who you are."    Dr. Inshirah al-Shal relied on this maxim in her study. For  the study she designed a questionnaire form for viewers of  overseas channels. Then she assembled the information in Cairo.  Her most important finding was the high ratio of males to  females in the study sample--about 5:2, or 71 percent to 29  percent. This means that authority in the Egyptian home still is  in the hands of the father, husband, or son--though one should  not overlook the content of some incoming programs whose  audience may be limited to males, rather than females in  Egyptian families.    A difference in ages among members of the sample was also  observed; however, the ages of the majority (60 percent of the  sample) ranged between 19 and 40. This means that receiving  overseas programs by satellite dish is widespread in age groups  most of which qualify as youthful.  <H5>  Diploma Holders, Married People </H5>   The study also indicated that when the data for the sample  were examined for educational level, one noted that about 75  percent of the individuals had obtained a university diploma  (bachelor of arts or of science). Some had obtained a master's  or doctorate. Cases that were below the bachelor's level in the  study sample amounted to 16 percent, and they were students.    It turned out that 57 percent of the sample were married and  34 percent unmarried. One could also see that most of the  individuals in the sample had excellent or good English (86  percent). Knowledge of French ran a distant second (39 percent).  This means, according to Dr. Inshirah al-Shal, that the ability  to follow programs from overseas and understand their content  depends on the language in which these programs are created.  This is true for the time being, but it will soon be possible  for the audience to choose the language in which it wants to  receive and view these programs.    The study indicated that Muhandisin, Madinat Nasr, and  Heliopolis were the areas with the most satellite dishes.  Al-Muqattam, al-Manyal, and Hulwan came at the bottom of the  list.    The study showed that businessmen (28 percent) were most  numerous among dish owners. Government employees (25 percent)  were in second place. The ratio of government employees to  professionals was about 2:1. This result indicates that  satellite dish ownership depends on economic and educational  level.    The study recorded the phenomenon of several families in a  building or limited area sharing one central satellite dish.  <H5>  Neighbors the Reason </H5>   The study was not without its novel side. One group in the  sample (7 percent) reported that the reason for their owning the  dish had to do with the neighbors. Five percent said it was  friends, while 64 percent said it was a husband or father.    As for the real reasons for obtaining the dish, the survey  showed that 26 percent of the individuals surveyed wanted to  know what is happening abroad. This applied particularly to  members of the political corps and big businessmen. About 24  percent wanted to see good programs. Some individuals from the  latter group said they were tired of Egyptian television, which  has become very poor and very local and does not even broadcast  programs at their announced times. One individual said he wanted  to know what was going on abroad and at home as soon as it  happened.    A group in the sample reported that they had bought the dish  because it was a new entertainment device for adults and  children alike.    Accordingly, one can summarize the reasons for owning a  satellite dish under two headings: first, because it is a piece  of modern technology and (as one of the members of the sample  said) one should not deprive one's family of something new.  Thirty-one percent of the sample agreed.    The second reason has to do with content. As a group of  sampled individuals said, it was "to watch programs that the  censorship will not allow in Egypt," or "to continue watching  programs they became accustomed to watching while abroad," or  "to know what is happening abroad," or "to improve one's  knowledge of a foreign language," or "as an alternative to  boring Egyptian television." Sixty-nine percent of the  individuals in the sample cited such reasons.  <H5>  Chance for Improvement </H5>   Although, as Dr. Inshirah al-Shal says, this result is  clear,  it gives the impression that there still is a chance for  Egyptian television to assert its presence by improving the  level of its programs so that the rug is not pulled out from  under it irrevocably.    It was therefore necessary to ask: To what extent were  people  satisfied with the dish after a period of contact and experience  with it?    The result was that 45 percent were very satisfied and would  encourage its spread; 22 percent were very satisfied, but would  not encourage its spread; 28 percent were somewhat satisfied; 3  percent were dissatisfied personally; about 7 percent were  dissatisfied and would oppose its entry into the Egyptian home;  and about 2 percent did not respond.    It was also necessary to determine the relation between  watching oversees programs by satellite dish and watching  Egyptian television programs. The result was that 59 percent of  the individuals in the study sample watch Egyptian television.  Thirty-seven percent responded "sometimes." About 2 percent do  not watch it, and 2 percent did not respond.    As for the amount of Egyptian television viewed by satellite  dish owners, the study showed that 19 percent of them watch it  only rarely; 12 percent watch it less than an hour a day; 25  percent watch it from one to two hours; and 29 percent watch it  from two to three hours.  <H5>  Superchannel--Number 1 </H5>   There were several surprises in the order of overseas  channels favored by Egyptian viewers who own a satellite dish.  The British Superchannel occupied the top of the list. Next came  CNN, but with the Superchannel leading 3 to 1. Then came  Euronews, the European news channel that began broadcasting at  the end of 1992 to maintain a balance after CNN began sweeping  the world's television screens during the Gulf war.    The French, Italian, Israeli, German, and Spanish channels  came next. The Turkish channel was in sixth place, before the  German channel and after the Israeli channel. The Arab channels  came in eighth place. The sample members set the MBC [Middle  East Broadcasting Center] channels in first place, followed by  the Egyptian Space Channel, then the Tunisian, Moroccan,  Emirate, Saudi, and Dubayy channels.    These channels have influenced the viewing of videotapes by  members of the sample. While 20 percent are keen on watching  them, and 50 percent said they sometimes watched them, 20  percent of the members of the sample do not watch them at all.  Their reasons can be summed up as lack of time, preference for  watching television programs from other countries, or lack of  interest.  <H5>  Most Important Points </H5>   The most important point the study raised was the  acknowledgment by 80 percent of the members of the sample that  watching satellite dish channels indeed influences the viewing  of Egyptian television. Seventeen percent denied any influence.    An important question arises: Is there a negative relation  between openness to the world--interest in watching others'  programs--and interest in our domestic problems?    Dr. Inshirah al-Shal, professor in Cairo University's  Faculty  of Information, a specialist in literature and the humanities,  says that the question needs to be studied more deeply. Foreign  television programs have created so-called "world stars" on the  political and artistic level; they could also--herein lies the  danger--create "the international child." This is what leads us  to demand that thorough studies be made to research the effects  of watching programs coming to Egyptian television screens from  abroad by various means. From such programs may come a desire to  emigrate, apathy, a feeling of alienation, or enlistment under  the banner of groups alien to the values, customs, and  traditions of the community.    We too ask for interest in such a study, for more such  studies, and for implementation of their recommendations before  it is too late.</p>

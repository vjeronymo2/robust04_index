			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Observer: A trimmer Trotsky The old cliche about leftwing youth growing up into rightwing middle-age rings true with Roger Rosewell, spokesman for Dame Shirley Porter, former Conservative leader of Westminster council. The Dame herself was unhelpfully abroad yesterday, thus avoiding the immediate flak over her time as council leader. Rosewell kindly stood in. He has an interesting pedigree. Back in the early 1970s he was industrial organiser of the extreme leftwing International Socialists - now the Socialist Workers' party - and steered its activities in various industrial disputes, including local government. Rosewell decided the dictatorship of the proletariat wasn't for him and abandoned the IS around 1974. In 1981 he surfaced with a pamphlet for Aims of Industry - the rightwing pressure group - attacking industrial subversion. Besides being the Dame's mouthpiece, he also writes for the Daily Mail newspaper, does PR work and sits on the board of a cable TV company; so he's still communicating with the masses after all.</p>

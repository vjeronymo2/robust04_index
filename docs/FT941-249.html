			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Malawi sets its sights on a rosier future: Agriculture and industry begin to emerge from a thorny patch - Diversification pointing the economy forwards Three passenger flights per week connect Malawi with mainland Europe, and each carries a hold full of roses. Grown in 6.5 hectares of greenhouses on Lingadzi Farms, a few kilometres from Lilongwe's international airport, 16m cut flowers were exported last year, primarily to the Netherlands. Sales of 9m kwacha (Dollars 2m before the kwacha was floated), hardly begins to rival Malawi's receipts from tobacco, which still accounts for two thirds of export earnings but it shows a potential way forward for the Malawian economy. Since independence in 1964, President Kamuzu Hastings Banda has concentrated on large-scale agriculture - tobacco, tea and sugar. This resulted in occasionally impressive growth figures which have been vulnerable to the vicissitudes of world prices, drought and the war in neighbouring Mozambique which cut the rail link to the nearest Indian Ocean port. Little of the export wealth, however, trickled down to the mainly rural population. Diversification has long been desirable but the question was into what and how? Macadamia nuts have fractionally broadened the agro-export base, but the market for them is small and there are a growing number of international competitors. Increasingly it is argued that attention should focus on a range of low-volume, high value horticultural crops. This will be one of the recommendations of an African Development Bank mission, which has been working with the trade ministry to identify industrial opportunities, markets and potential investors. Mr Ramesh Ardikari, head of the mission, sees a future for crops with modest land demand, such as asparagus, if the government helps to provide air freight facilities. The first requirement of such a focus, according to Mr Ardikari, is the right policy environment to attract investment. He sees February's lifting of exchange controls and authorisation for exporters to hold hard currency bank accounts as a step in this direction. Ms Jenny Perepeckzco, general manager of Lingadzi Farms, says the move facilitated expansion plans. These include a new irrigation scheme and another 2 hectares of greenhouse, producing a further 4m roses per annum. The liberalisation package came at a time of acute foreign exchange shortage, before the April tobacco auctions, and when many foreign investors had a backlog of dividends they had been unable to obtain the foreign exchange to remit, a rapid result was the effective devaluation of the kwacha by some 40 per cent. Mr Jerry Jana, director of the Malawian Chamber of Commerce, commented that 'It's a large dose of medicine; some of us were not aware we were that sick.' The lifting of exchange controls was the latest stage in a process of economic liberalisation which has been going on for a decade. First on the list of targets for structural adjustment was Admarc, the parastatal agricultural marketing board, which was divested in the 1980s of various subsidiary operations. The softwood furniture manufacturer, Wood Industries, has been privatised while Malawi Railways is in the process of rationalisation before possible privatisation. The telecommunications network has been hived off from the Post Office and made to operate on commercial lines. It too may be sold. Import liberalisation has also allowed rival goods into a local market which has been protected for local manufacturers and established foreign investors who are now seeking export markets. Lonrho of the UK is the largest foreign investor with subsidiaries in agriculture as well as transport and motor vehicle franchises, it has a key position in the economy, not least through its monopoly of sugar production both for export and local sale. If Lonrho decides to reduce its stake in Malawi, a likely buyer would be the country's own giant, the Press Group. With 20 subsidiaries and 12 associated companies in distribution, manufacturing, agriculture and financial services, including major shareholdings in both high street banks, the group's turnover last year of kwacha 1.5bn amounts to about a fifth the country's gross domestic product. Such a concentration of economic power concerns World Bank economists, even though one privately admits that Press is 'remarkably efficient.' Restructured in the 1980s, the company has repaid loans ahead of schedule and has started to pay dividends to its ultimate shareholder, the Press Trust. This shadowy body, intended to operate 'for the benefit of the people of Malawi,' has as its chairman President Banda himself. The only other declared trustees are Mr Louis Chimango, finance minister, and Mr John Tembo, the uncle of Dr Banda's official consort who is in effect his prime minister and also chairman of Air Malawi, Admarc, the main publishing house Blantyre Print, and the Press Group itself, as well as several of its subsidiaries. None of the six opposition parties contending for power in the May elections suggest serious alternatives to the liberalisation programme. There is no perceptible difference in ideology, only a deep seated suspicion, or envy, of the power which has accumulated along the Banda-Tembo axis. Mr Watipaso Mkandawire, an economist in the Investment Promotion Agency, recently set up as a 'one-stop shop' to facilitate the setting up of new companies, believes that the predominance of Press Group cuts two ways. It can, he says, be very hard for Malawian entrepreneurs to break into areas where the group has dealings; but foreign investors may be attracted by Press' record of partnerships with firms companies British Petroleum, Carlsberg, and the Guardian insurance group, and by the possibility of using Malawi as a back door into South African markets.</p>

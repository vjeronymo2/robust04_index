			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Unionist MP accepts IRA terrorism could be over Mr John Taylor, a leading Ulster Unionist MP, yesterday added to the pressure on Mr John Major's government to recognise the IRA's ceasefire by openly accepting that the organisation's campaign of violence could truly be over. As the British and US governments continue to refrain from full acceptance of the ceasefire, Mr Taylor, the MP for Strangford, Co Down, came as close as any unionist to admitting that the IRA had fully renounced violence. 'My gut reaction is that the ceasefire is for real,' he told his constituency association. Mr Taylor, who was seriously wounded by an IRA gunman in 1972, added: 'I consider it to be my responsibility to encourage the peace process forward so that there will eventually be lasting peace.' He was clearly at odds with another unionist MP, Mr David Trimble, who claimed that the UUP's view was that the IRA had no intention of abandoning their campaign unless there were substantial concessions from the government. Writing in the Belfast Telegraph, Mr Trimble, the MP for Upper Bann, said that the ceasefire was a 'gamble' by the IRA. 'They reckon that if they fail to gain concessions, the blame for resumed violence can be placed on the British government or the loyalists.' Ulster Unionists will have been pleased with comments yesterday by Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, that the transfer of four republican terrorists from English jails to Northern Ireland only hours after the IRA ceasefire began had been 'completely wrong'. He said ministers should have been consulted about the timing of the move.</p>

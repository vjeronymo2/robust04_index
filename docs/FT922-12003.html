			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Arts: Tears for the clowns - Television almost unbelievable - to have lost Benny Hill and Frankie Howerd, the last two great clowns of their generation, probably (as it seems at the time of writing) on the same day. Happily Hill had at least lived long enough to see his show restored to ITV where, even as a repeat, it was once again winning big ratings. A few years ago he was taken off British screens thanks to the influence of feminists and politically correct 'alternative' comedians who, in the mindless mantra of the times, accused him of 'sexism'. The continued and growing popularity of his old series, with their pantomime humour and simple comic songs, in 100 countries overseas must have helped sustain his pride and eventually persuaded Thames TV of the absurdity of suppressing his work in his own country. Scarcely changing in nearly 40 years (Hill was 67) his shows had unparalleled success in attracting huge audiences for both BBC and ITV. Only Morecambe and Wise came anywhere near his long term popularity. Howerd (who was born Howard, in York not London, though he grew up in Eltham, and according to his manager was 75 and not 70 when he died on Sunday) was much less identified with television. He was clearly most comfortable performing with a live audience. At the Garrick in London's West End two years ago he had the audience, consisting almost entirely of teenagers, working for him like a chorus. 'No, please] It's not funny', he would say, pursing those expressive lips and nodding his head back towards his accompanist, and the audience would finish the line with him: 'It's wicked to mock the afflicted]' With a silly beam he would ask 'Isn't it whimsical?' And then, with a frown,'Isn't it?' and the chorus chanted 'Well, please yourselves'. It is easy to describe his routine but, as with all great stand-up comedians, impossible to analyse its success. How did Howerd make 'Ooh no, missus]' so funny? His television work, notably as Lurcio the slave in Up Pompeii, was as vulgar as anything Hill ever style of Max Miller; they challenged you to admit to the mischief in your own mind. However rare Howerd's television appearances, they will be terribly missed. With Eric Morecambe and Tommy Cooper already gone, Hill and Howerd represented just about the last of a great line.                         *       *       * Channel controllers clearly consider Easter a good time for bringing out enormously long programmes. Did you sit right through the four hours five minutes of The Undeclared War on BBC2? I tried, really I did. Marcel Ophuls has proved with Le Chagrin et La Pitie and Hotel Terminus that the French can make huge engrossing documentaries about their wartime experiences, and several of Bernard Tavernier's feature films (especially Life And Nothing But, shown by BBC2 on Monday) have been extraordinarily powerful. So his vast documentary about French conscript experience in the Algerian war might have been compelling, but actually it sent me to sleep. Three times. How about Jana Bokova's Argentinian Journey, shown in Arena? At least this was split into three episodes, each lasting 60 minutes on successive nights, but it, too, had me nodding by the time we were introduced to the umpteenth ethnic drummer in Part 3. To be fair, Bokova's visual style has a stark purity which you rarely find these days outside the work of still photographers, and her pictures of Argentina were beautiful and deeply involving. But the drumming was so much more monotonous and unimpressive than the guitar playing.                         *       *       * There is perpetual talk about the death of the single play on television, yet BBC2 has just completed a run of 12 single dramas in the Screen Two series which has proved what a virile form it remains. Titles in March and April have included Truly, Madly, Deeply with Juliet Stevenson's endearing performance as a young woman who recalls her lover as a ghost; The Last Romantics in which Nigel Williams somehow fashioned the Quiller-Couch/Leavis cultural war into a readily comprehensible drama; and this week, in a fitting climax, an adaptation of Muriel Spark's Memento Mori which was like an OAP victory parade: Michael Hordern, Stephanie Cole, Thora Hird, Cyril Cusack, Maurice Denham, all were superb. It will be astonishing and pleasing if 1992 produces any drama to beat this for sheer enjoyment.                         *       *       * We are told that the BBC is thinking of employing Saatchi &amp; Saatchi to advertise its programmes because The Camomile Lawn on Channel 4 achieved an audience of 7.9m following a Pounds 100,000 advertising campaign. This is a bit like saying that Rodney died two minutes after drinking a cup of tea, without mentioning that he was run down by a bus. What The Camomile Lawn argument omits is that the drama starred Felicity Kendal and featured lots of rumpy-pumpy. Advertising or no advertising, it would have attracted a big audience.                         *       *       * Anna Raphael's programme about the model and would-be guru 'Rytasha' in Channel 4's True Stories was a beautifully straight-faced put-down of what appears to be an outrageous example of superciliousness and hypocrisy. This latter-day Lady Bountiful swans about Bangladesh distributing charity collected from the bickering matrons of Palm Beach and having her feet bathed by her 'disciples'. However, the programme offered yet another example of the disadvantages in having neither on-screen reporter nor even a voice-over: surely every viewer wanted to know why this woman wears such weird turquoise contact lenses, and why she has two black dots on the end of her uncannily pointed nose.                         *       *       * How despicable of politician John Gummer to attack the BBC for screening a programme - Heart Of The Matter - giving a platform to those clergymen who discount the supernatural elements of Christianity and see the old stories, such as the resurrection, as metaphor. Day in day out, year in year out, the BBC serves as chief proselytiser for Christianity in Britain, despite the fact that Christians are not even the largest church-going group any more. In a country which aspires to freedom of expression and plurality of views it is a disgrace that the national broadcasting organisation should align itself with just one of the popular religions. You can imagine the fuss politicians would make if the BBC aligned itself with just one political party. Yet here is Gummer attacking the Corporation for providing one programme which, even though it is concerned solely with Christianity, does not happen to reinforce the beliefs of his particular faction.</p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Scrapping poll tax helps curb inflation CUT-PRICE lettuces, apples and cauliflowers and a shift in local taxation were behind the big fall in inflation announced yesterday. Many types of seasonal foods are much cheaper than a year ago because of bumper harvests around the world. The move from the poll tax to the council tax last month had a big impact in forcing down the inflation rate. Higher central government grants mean the average household is paying 8.7 per cent less under the new system. The retail prices index for last month came to 140.6, up 0.9 per cent from the 139.3 registered in March. The index is worked out on the basis that in January 1987 it was 100. In the year to last month the RPI rose by just 1.3 per cent, after a year-on-year increase of 1.9 per cent in March, for an overall fall of 0.6 percentage points in the inflation rate. The impact of the switch in taxation took 0.7 percentage points off this rate between March and April. Rising prices - albeit of a moderate degree - for other types of goods and services were responsible for pushing up the rate by a meagre 0.1 of a percentage point. Between March and last month seasonal foods fell in price by 2.8 per cent, the biggest April decrease for these items since the Central Statistical Office started records in 1956. Seasonal foods - one of the 15 main categories of goods and services forming the basis for the RPI - last month cost 7.7 per cent less than in April last year after a year-on-year fall of 6.8 per cent in March. Fresh fruit was sold last month for 17 per cent less than a year previously while prices of vegetables were down 2 per cent. Shoppers also found fresh fish at bargain prices, down 10 per cent from the corresponding month last year. Potatoes were down 4 per cent in price, but lamb and cheese cost 12 per cent and 10 per cent more respectively. Non-seasonal foods as a whole cost 3 per cent more last month than a year previously. Of all 15 categories in the RPI only six experienced an increase between March and April in the year-on-year rate of price changes. Housing costs - in which local taxation is a key component - were down 6.9 per cent in the 12 months to April after a 3.6 per cent fall in the year to March. The average housebuyer has seen mortgage interest payments fall by 23 per cent in the year to last month, reflecting lower interest rates. Household fuel and light bills fell 0.6 per cent between April last year and last month, while leisure goods were up in price by only a muted 1.7 per cent. Cigarettes and tobacco showed price increases of 7 per cent over this period while canteen meals were up 8 per cent. Furniture has risen in price by only 2 per cent over the past year and electrical appliances have not increased.</p>

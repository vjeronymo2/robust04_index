			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Jean-Michel Stoullig] </F>   [Text] Geneva, Feb 9 (AFP) -- Foreign ministers from seven  countries neighbouring ex-Yugoslavia met here Wednesday [9  February] to discuss the Bosnian crisis amid calls for NATO air  strikes as Austria called for "the necessary action" to halt the  carnage.    Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock told the UN Human  Rights  Commission here before the ministers' meeting that "such  terrible crimes cannot be accepted by civilized societies at the  end of the 20th century." "The international comunity must take  the necessary action to stop them," he said.    Wednesday's talks here coincided with a meeting in Brussels  of North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ambassadors debating  whether to give the Bosnian Serbs a deadline to lift the siege  of Sarajevo or face air strikes by the alliance's warplanes.    But Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, who had been  invited here by international mediators David Owen and Thorvald  Stoltenberg, decided to stay in Ankara to "remain close to his  government" pending any NATO decision, an official said.  Pro-Moslem Turkey is a NATO member and on Wednesday said it was  prepared to take part in any NATO air strikes in Bosnia.    Pro-Serb Greece meanwhile said it would go along with any  NATO decision.    Ministers in attendance at the talks here were Mock,  Albania's Alfred Serreqi, Bulgaria's Stanislav Daskalov,  Greece's Karolos Papoulias, Italy's Beniamino Andreatta,  Romania's Teodor Melescanu and Hungary's Secretary of State for  Foreign Affairs Janos Hermann.    None made a statement as they went into the meeting, which  was also to focus on a 60-page document detailing the economic  effects on the Balkans of the 1992 trade embargo against  Belgrade.    Owen and Stoltenberg want "to have the ministers' input on  the issues of reconstruction and recovery in advance of a  settlement," an official said. No statement was due to be  issued after the session.    The meeting had been scheduled before Saturday's massacre of  68 Bosnians at the Sarajevo market which triggered the latest  debate on whether to use air power against Bosnian Serbs.    Meanwhile, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic held talks  with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic ahead of a fresh  round of multilateral Geneva talks from Thursday aimed at  reaching a political settlement. They said at the half-way  stage that their discussions had been "constructive."    Granic said they had covered ways to end hostilities between  Bosnian Croat forces and the mainly Moslem Bosnian Government  Army in central Bosnia. The Zagreb government has denied UN  allegations that its own troops are engaged in the fighting.    Croatia itself will not be represented at Thursday's talks  here, which are intended to work out "confidence-building  measures" by the three sides to the Bosnian conflict,  represented by Silajdzic, Radovan Karadzic for the Bosnian Serbs  and Mile Akmadzic for the Bosnian Croats.</p>

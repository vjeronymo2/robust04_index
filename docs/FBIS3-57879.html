			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jean-Claude Buhrer: "Bern Regrets That Paris </F> Failed To Reciprocate" -- all names as published]    [Text] While taking care to once again state that they have  "excellent relations," the Swiss authorities scarcely  appreciated the New Year's "nongift" from the French Government.  In any case, Bern reacted strongly to the expulsion by France  to Tehran of two Iranians wanted by the Swiss justice  authorities for the murder in April 1990 -- in Coppet, close to  Geneva -- of Kazem Rajavi, brother of the people's Mujahidin  leader.    Following an oral demarche, the Swiss Government repeated  its  protest in writing on Friday, 31 December. In a memo sent to  the Quai d'Orsay [French Foreign Ministry], he regrets the fact  that France respected neither the European Convention on  Extradition of 13 December 1957, nor the convention of 27  January 1977 on the repression of terrorism. Bern felt that  this was "a flagrant violation of international law."    "The French attitude surprised us even more since, until  that  time, our two countries had always cooperated perfectly in the  area of extradition," said the spokesman for the Federal  Department of Foreign Affairs, Juerg Schneeberger. Thus,  Switzerland agreed to hand over to France two Iranians accused  of participating in the murder on 6 August 1991, near Paris, of  the Shah's former prime minister, Shahpur Bakhtiar. Arrested a  short time later in Geneva, the first suspect, Ali Vakili Rad,  was extradited on 27 August 1991, while the second suspect,  Zeyal Sarhadi, who was apprehended four months later in Bern,  was extradited in turn on 26 May 1992. These extraditions  caused a diplomatic crisis with Iran, which lead Bern to  temporarily close its Embassy in Teheran.  <H5>  "The Incident Is Closed" </H5>   Bern was expecting a reciprocal gesture in order to get back  two of the presumed killers of Kazem Rajavi. The arrest of  Mohzen Sharif Esfahani and Ahmed Taheri on 17 November 1992 in  Paris was the fruit of a long and patient inquiry undertaken by  the Vaud judge, Roland Chatelain, who also handled the Bakhtiar  case. Despite the objection by the Iranian authorities in  response to the repeated demarches, the judge never relaxed his  grip. "What I am interested in," he explained, "is arresting  all the killers, because I cannot allow Switzerland to be used  with impunity for settling political matters in this way."    Since the beginning of the inquiry, judge Chatelain has  pointed out that "one or more Iranian departments are directly  involved in the murder of Kazem Rajavi." His investigation also  allowed him to notice that in cases where Iranian opposition  members are murdered, there are "common parameters" and  "meticulous preparation."    The day after the arrest in Paris of the two Iranians  suspected of killing Kazem Rajavi, the Swiss authorities used  two arrest warrants issued by the Vaud judge as a basis for  submitting a formal request for extradition to France. Last 10  February, the Paris Court of Appeal, approved the request. On  18 November, Switzerland was officially informed that the French  government had approved the extradition.    On 3 December, during a visit to Switzerland by Francois  Mitterrand, the matter was not even raised since it was  manifestly clear to the Swiss Government that the extradition of  the two Iranians was imminent. So, while everything had been  set in place to receive the two suspects, sources in Bern said,  on Wednesday [29 December] the Embassy in Paris was informed  that they would not be handed over to Switzerland -- before  learning the next day that they had already returned to Iran.    Caught unaware, Switzerland could only express its  disappointment. "This incident does not mean that the excellent  relations with France will be called into question," Mr.  Schneeberger said nevertheless. "Due to the lack of an  authority of recourse from the diplomatic point of view, this  affair is considered closed." Perhaps this conclusion suits  everyone.</p>

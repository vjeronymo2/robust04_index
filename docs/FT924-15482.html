			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Davies &amp; Newman faces drop in borrowing ceiling DAVIES &amp; Newman, owner of the Dan-Air airline, is facing a considerably lower borrowing ceiling than the Pounds 35m agreed with the banks in last year's rescue. This prospect lies behind the attempt to refinance the company with the help of Mr Richard Branson, owner of Virgin Atlantic Airways, who would put money in - about Pounds 10m has been mooted - possibly through a stake in Davies &amp; Newman. The revamped airline would incorporate the Virgin name. The looming debt overshoot had already led Mr David James, the company doctor-chairman at Davies &amp; Newman, to approach institutional shareholders for another cash injection - believed to be about Pounds 40m. This compares with last year's Pounds 49.3m, although more than Pounds 8m of that went out to the banks in special fees. Last year's rescue was accompanied by the setting of a Pounds 35m limit on Davies &amp; Newman's debt. This was linked to net worth which at the beginning of the year stood at about Pounds 41m. Two things have happened since then to lower the debt ceiling. About Pounds 5m of aircraft have been sold, bringing the ceiling down to Pounds 30m. In addition, instead of making a Pounds 20m pre-tax profit as projected, the company is heading for a loss which according to one estimate could be Pounds 10m. Every Pounds 1 lost has the double effect of subtracting Pounds 1 from cash generation and Pounds 1 from the debt allowed. So the debt limit is heading for a figure nearer Pounds 20m than Pounds 30m. The swing between peak cash and peak debt in the airline is estimated at Pounds 40m to Pounds 50m. As Davies &amp; Newman will only just have got into double figures at its best time for cash, a debt limit near Pounds 20m was not going to be enough. Mr James has reiterated that the problem is not an immediate one. He said the latest overdraft was 'in low single figures'. However, as less flying and more maintenance work is done in the winter, the crunch would come next spring. He said there was a substantial measure of agreement with Mr Branson on the principal parts of the deal. Detailed draft documents were being prepared and over the weekend groups of negotiators would continue to work on various issues. The involvement of Mr Branson should make it a great deal easier to raise money from other investors, he added.</p>

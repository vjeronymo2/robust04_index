			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- International Trade and  Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai on Friday [15 April] supported  a U.S. proposal that a new multilateral trade organization deal  with the issue of deregulation.    The comment came in response to a speech Thursday by U.S.  Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in Marrakech, Morocco, in  which he said domestic issues like government regulations should  be taken up by the World Trade Organization (WTO), a forum to  succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next year.    "Discussion in a multilateral setting will likely provide  some solutions to issues like deregulation," Kumagai told a  press conference.    Kumagai, however, opposed a proposal that Japan, the United  States and the European Union (EU) create a trilateral forum to  discuss economic and trade affairs.    In a meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata in  Marrakech on Thursday, EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan  proposed such a forum.    "Such a trilateral forum would only complicate problems,"  Kumagai said, indicating his view that issues like the  Japan-U.S. trade "framework" talks should be basically held on a  bilateral basis.</p>

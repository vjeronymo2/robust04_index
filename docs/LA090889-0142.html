The developer and investor bought 13 acres in Baker Ranch, a 700-acre business  park near the huge Irvine Spectrum business park at the junction of the San  Diego and Santa Ana freeways. The developer has already begun construction of  20 buildings on the eight-acre Vista Terrace Business Park property, bought for  $3.1 million. Hillman will also build four concrete industrial buildings on its  five-acre Foothill Business Park, bought for $2.4 million. Both are expected to  open in April.  </P> <P> And another developer, Hopkins Development Co. in Newport Beach, has some new  business in Riverside. Hopkins said it obtained exclusive rights to negotiate  the redevelopment of a block in that city. Named Orangetree Plaza, the block --  near Riverside's historic district -- will get 74 apartments and condos, plus  offices and stores. It is the first redevelopment project in Riverside to  provide housing units, Hopkins says.  </P></p>

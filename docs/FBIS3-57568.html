			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Jan 26, BNS -- The passport office of a  Russian police station in the former military base town of  Paldiski in Estonia has still not turned over to Estonian  authorities the files of the town's registry of residents.  Russian officials earlier had promised to end the delay and  hand the files over by Jan. 27.    The head of the Russian passport office at Paldiski today  failed to turn out for a scheduled meeting with the Estonian  commandant of the town, Col. Raul Luks, said Taimi Laar,  municipal secretary at Paldiski.    Estonian officials say it is impossible to prepare for  elections for the Paldiski town council or establish a normal  civilian rule in the town until the files are delivered.    Justice Minister Kaido Kama, however, has said the files  drawn up and held by the local Russian police office without any  authorized supervision lately cannot be trusted. He said that  even if the files were to be returned, Estonia would still have  to call a new municipal census, and the country's own officials  will have to register the town's legal residents anew.    Laar said the Russian passport office until very lately had  continued issuing Estonian resident's passport inscriptions,  which currently is the only means of confirming the passport  holder's permanent resident's status.    She insisted that the office close its doors finally by  Thursday. "If they won't close the doors by Jan. 27, we will  have every reason to raise alarm," she added.</p>

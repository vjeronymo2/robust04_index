			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (10): Losses spur the pace of innovation - Insurance SOCIAL, ECONOMIC and technological pressures are transforming the UK's insurance industry and leading to significant changes in the price, range and quality of home, motor and other consumer products and the way in which they are bought. Since the mid-1980s, the industry has been subject to an onslaught of competitive pressures. The final abandonment of the insurance companies' cartel in 1985 - the so-called tariff system - ushered in a period of intense competition among large composite insurance groups - Royal Insurance, Sun Alliance, Guardian Royal Exchange, Commercial Union, General Accident, Eagle Star and Norwich Union. UK companies were particularly anxious to retain and increase market share as a result of the opening of the European insurance market and the entry into the UK of giant European companies such as Allianz and L'Union des Assurances de Paris. The resulting price competition drove premium rates downwards, especially in higher margin commercial insurance (the policies bought by businesses rather than individuals), leaving the industry ill-prepared for a surge of claims from storms and subsidence in 1990 and 1991. The recession led to an increase in claims for theft and arson. Worse still, the collapse of the property market and the downward spiral in house prices led to wholly unexpected claims on mortgage indemnity policies - a class of insurance policy sold to banks and building societies to protect mortgage loans, traditionally regarded as virtually risk-free by insurers. These factors contributed to a cyclical downturn in the industry, which left almost every insurer nursing heavy losses in 1990 and 1991, when pre-tax losses for the UK industry amounted to more than Pounds 2bn. For some companies, such as Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance, these losses were the first ever sustained. The fall in the equity and property markets - especially during 1991, because of the Gulf War - made matters even worse, as it reduced the size of the insurance companies' own assets. Solvency is a concept used by regulators and insurance brokers (who are essentially professional insurance buyers) to measure the financial health of insurance companies. It compares a company's capital base with its insurance liabilities (in the technical jargon, net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income). Because insurance companies paid for losses from their own reserves, and because the value of their investments in shares and buildings fell, the solvency of most insurers has fallen. One company, Municipal Mutual Insurance, the ninth largest in the country, has been forced to withdraw from the market. The industry as a whole is keen to raise fresh capital by issuing more shares. On top of these economic pressures, a wave of technological innovation has made it easier for new companies to enter the market, and forced insurance companies to re-examine their traditional ways of doing business. Because so many of their day-to-day operations concern the routine processing of information, the introduction to the market of cheaper and more powerful computers has had a particularly important effect. Computers have allowed insurance companies to make their 'backroom' operations (filing, claims processing etc) more efficient. In addition, they give underwriters access to more information more quickly about the risks they insure and the claims that have resulted. This should allow insurers to price risks more accurately. The greatest amount of innovation has occurred so far in the motor insurance market. Using advanced computer software and telephone systems, companies such as Direct Line, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland, have developed direct sales techniques which bypass the insurance broker, the industry's traditional middleman. Direct Line and its imitators advertise their products through carefully planned television and advertising campaigns, and employ relatively low-grade clerical staff to underwrite insurance and sell policies over the telephone. Brokers have reacted to this threat by developing their own networks and streamlining their links with companies to increase their efficiency. Chains such as AA Insurance Services and Swinton offer telephone sales services, supplementing their extensive networks of high street branches and offering instant price quotes. For the consumer, this combination of economic pressures and technological innovation has produced a mixed picture. On the one hand, the cost of insurance has increased sharply in the past two years as insurers have sought to recover from recent heavy losses. On the other, insurers have become much more selective in their pricing, more and more relating premium levels to smaller and smaller classes of risk. For example, until 1991, the price of household insurance tended to be around Pounds 2 per Pounds 1,000 of rebuilding cost, with relatively few variations between companies. But in the past 18 months, each of the companies has introduced a range of rating bands, with the price of insurance varying from Pounds 1.80 to Pounds 4 per Pounds 1,000, depending on a property's exposure to subsidence or storm risk. Further changes are on the cards as Direct Line and similar sales companies enter the market. Building societies and banks sell over 50 per cent of insurance policies in the UK, receiving in return sizeable commissions of over 30 per cent in some cases. By reducing these costs of distribution, both brokers and direct writers can offer cheaper products. Increasingly, insurers are competing in terms of the service they offer as well as price. For example, by using telephone networks and computer systems, companies have introduced so-called 'help lines', offering consumers assistance when a claim occurs. In addition, some companies now offer access to legal advice as part of insurance policies.</p>

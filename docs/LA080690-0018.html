			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> WITH AL GREEN, QUALITY OF SINGING OVERCOMES QUANTITY OF SONGS  </P> <P> There aren't many singers who could get away with the performance Al Green gave  in his early show at the Coach House Saturday night. It's not just that he only  appeared for 55 minutes -- he's been known to perform for as little as 35. But,  evidently favoring a worn throat, he spent nearly half his time onstage  mugging, featuring band solos and exhorting the audience to sing -- in short,  doing everything but sing himself.  </P> <P> On top of that, the Rev. Green ended the set with a bit of show-biz shuck and  jive that was unbecoming to a man of the cloth. He pondered his watch and  declared that the club required he end the show then but that they were going  to go ahead and jam all night anyway. And then he curtly ended the no-encore  show three minutes later. (In truth, he could have performed another 40 minutes  before the club's schedule would have even neared disruption.)  </P> <P> But, as Green is far from being just any performer, there was still more than  enough magic in his show to make up for its lacks. Even when mute, his animated  face and jump-for-joy moves were high entertainment. And when he did deign to  sing, his fatigued voice soared and shouted with a feeling and abandon that  only a handful of other living singers could match.  </P> <P> When not performing in clubs, Green pastors a Southern gospel church, and his  concerts are nearly unique in bringing close the pleasures of Saturday night  and the exultation of Sunday morning. His miraculous voice can run the gamut of  human expression: celebration, anguish, rapture, humor, sex -- it was all there  in the nimble twists his vocal cords took Saturday. As with all of Green's  shows of the last several years, he freely mixed his secular and gospel  material. Just as soul music was largely borrowed from African-American gospel  music, Green is now returning the favor. His 1987 "Everything's Gonna Be  Alright" and 1989 "As Long as We're Together" offered Green's most insistent  dance grooves since his mid-'70s "Love and Happiness," along with some  decidedly uptown synthesizer lines. His most heated, fervent vocals were in  those songs and in "Jesus Will Fix It," which found him repeating and  embellishing a rhythmic phrase until it seemed like a locomotive coursing  through the song. Throughout the show, his 10-piece band was so responsive that  it could have been an extension of his body.  </P> <P> Green hushed the band to a whisper on "Amazing Grace," allowing him a  near-empty canvas on which to paint a vocal as bursting with color and feeling  as any Van Gogh. His incredible, aching falsetto notes alone justified the  ticket price. He gave a similar treatment to the Bee Gees' "How Can You Mend a  Broken Heart," forgoing the microphone at one point to let his powerful plaints  reach the audience directly.  </P> <P> He also performed a sterling rendition of Otis Redding's "Dock of the Bay." His  own hits, though, received short shrift. Most of "Let's Stay Together" was  devoted to an audience sing-along, while he delivered only a few teasing  choruses of "Tired of Being Alone." It was no less teasing when he had his hot  horn section repeatedly punch out the clarion lines of "Love and Happiness" and  then didn't bother to sing the song.  </P> <P> The show was opened by the L.A. band Mama Stud. Though the six-piece outfit  played a potentially intriguing blend of soul and folk music, its seven-song  set seemed both unformed and unfunky. Even on King Floyd's "Groove Me Baby,"  they seemed unable to settle into a workable groove, and there was a decided  lack of character or vocal control.  </P></p>

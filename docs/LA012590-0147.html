			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH HOPES GORBACHEV, REFORMS SURVIVE;  </P> <P> SUPERPOWERS: THE PRESIDENT CITES 'ENORMOUS DIMENSIONS' OF AZERBAIJANI PROBLEM  BUT AVOIDS CRITICIZING CRACKDOWN.  </P> <P> President Bush refused comment Wednesday on whether Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev is in jeopardy because of the violent upheaval in Azerbaijan, but he  said he firmly wants Gorbachev to survive and continue his reform policies.  </P> <P> Asked at a wide-ranging morning news conference if Gorbachev has "gone too far"  in cracking down with Soviet troops on Azerbaijani nationalists, Bush said:  "The answer . . . unfolds every day. We don't really know. And it's serious."  </P> <P> The President did not indicate any new approach toward Moscow in the wake of  its use of force in the strife-torn region. He has broadly supported Soviet  efforts to restore order in ethnic conflicts like that between Azerbaijanis and  Armenians, while cautioning that forcible suppression of demonstrations for  independence in the Baltic states would bring strong American criticism and  might chill U.S.-Soviet relations.  </P> <P> In the Azerbaijan insurrection, which began as an ethnic dispute but climaxed  in pogroms against Armenians, Bush pointed out sympathetically that Gorbachev  is "faced with . . . an internal problem of enormous dimensions."  </P> <P> "I can't make any predictions," he said, "but I know I hope that he not only  survives but stays strong, because I think it is in our interest that  perestroika (Gorbachev's reform program) succeed and go forward."  </P> <P> At the same time, Bush said the United States supports the Baltic states of  Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in their "independent pursuit of their own  destiny." He said Gorbachev is "sorting out some very difficult internal  problems in these three Baltic countries."  </P> <P> The United States recognized the Soviet Union and its territorial integrity in  1933, when Azerbaijan was already part of that country. The Baltic states were  forcibly incorporated into it in 1940, after a secret Soviet-Nazi pact, and the  United States has never recognized their annexation.  </P> <P> In his recent visit to the Baltic region, Gorbachev appeared to hold out  prospects that the three states could eventually secede -- but at the end of a  long legal process, including a possible Soviet-wide referendum and the  negotiated settlement of economic and other ties built up over the past 40  years.  </P> <P> Asked to explain the differences between U.S. policy regarding the Baltic  states and areas like Azerbaijan, Bush said: "I don't think it helps facilitate  things for us to fine-tune all that. They know our position." The issue was  discussed during the U.S.-Soviet summit in Malta last month, the President  said.  </P> <P> On another East-West issue, Bush turned a cold shoulder to a proposal by the  new reform leader of Czechoslovakia, Vaclav Havel, for the next U.S.-Soviet  summit to be held in his country. Havel's aim presumably is to demonstrate that  Prague intends to become a neutral nation like Finland, where U.S. and Soviet  leaders can meet, rather than remain part of the Soviet Bloc.  </P> <P> "I don't believe that it's going to work for this summit," Bush said.  </P> <P> The next summit, set for late June in Washington, will deal with finishing work  on various arms control agreements, including a treaty to reduce offensive  nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> The President, while expressing great respect for Havel, indicated that he did  not want plans for his next meeting with Gorbachev to be changed in any way  that might derail a successful outcome.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, State Department officials said that Secretary of State James A.  Baker III will delay a scheduled visit to Moscow by one day because of an  emergency meeting of the Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee.  </P> <P> Baker originally was scheduled to visit Moscow Feb. 6 and 7. But the Soviet  leadership has scheduled a meeting that week on the crisis in Azerbaijan and  other areas, so Baker agreed to change his visit to Feb. 7 and 8.  </P> <P> Baker's visit is intended to break several logjams in U.S.-Soviet arms control  negotiations and to prepare for the June summit between Bush and Gorbachev.  </P></p>

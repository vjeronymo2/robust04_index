			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Letter: Simple answer Sir, Managers have an easy solution to the problem highlighted by Paul Taylor ('Managers intimidated by computers', January 27). I use a cheap, simple and effective program that solves all my problems. It is called Ko-Pilot. You just load it on to a pc like any other program and call it up at need. It solves problems by following a simple menu system. T Ritson, 26 Sispara Gardens, London SW18 1LQ</p>

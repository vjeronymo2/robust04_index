			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Conrad Black pays Dollars 180m for Chicago daily newspaper Hollinger, the international newspaper group controlled by Mr Conrad Black, owner of the UK's Telegraph group, has made its first foray into the urban US market by buying the Chicago Sun-Times, the country's ninth biggest daily. Hollinger will pay Dollars 180m (Pounds 121m) for the privately owned Sun-Times Company, whose assets include about 60 community papers in the Chicago area. The present owners, comprising institutional investors and senior Sun-Times managers, bought the company six years ago in a leveraged buy-out from Mr Rupert Murdoch, the publishing magnate. Hollinger's vehicle for the acquisition is American Publishing, a wholly-owned subsidiary which publishes 280 small-town papers across the US. Mr David Radler, Hollinger president, said the deal would be financed by bank loans. However, American Publishing plans to strengthen its equity base through a public share issue. The issue, for about Dollars 150m, is expected to be completed by mid-year. Mr Radler said the Sun-Times is a 'better fit and a more viable company' than the struggling New York Daily News, which Mr Black unsuccessfully pursued two years ago. The Sun-Times, a tabloid, is best known for its coverage of Chicago's political scene, and for its sports news. It has a daily circulation of about 535,000, compared with 690,000 for its broadsheet rival, the Chicago Tribune. Mr James Goss, media analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps, the rating agency, estimated that the Tribune has between 75 per cent and 80 per cent of advertising revenue in the Chicago area. He added that 'in terms of number-two papers, the Sun-Times is probably as well-positioned as any could be'. Mr Radler said the Sun-Times has been profitable for the past six years. However, the 1988 buy-out has left the present owners with a heavy debt-service burden. Mr Radler indicated that Hollinger will apply much the same formula of tight cost controls and enhanced technology to the Sun-Times as it has brought to its other acquisitions in the UK, North America, Australia and Israel.</p>

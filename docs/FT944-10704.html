			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Qantas regains right to fly direct to China Qantas, the Australian flagship carrier in which British Airways has a 25 per cent stake, has won back the rights to fly direct to China from Australia. At present, the only carrier offering this service is Air China, with other carriers flying via Hong Kong, writes Nikki Tait. Qantas held the rights previously, and operated a service during the 1980s. However, this was abandoned in 1987, on the grounds that it was unprofitable. The rights were then won by Australia Air, a new carrier which tried to raise the necessary capital to begin operations last year but was eventually unsuccessful. The International Air Services Commission, which allocates routes, said it expected Qantas to operate one Boeing 767-300 service a week.</p>

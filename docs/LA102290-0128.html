			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TYSON SETTLES MAN'S CLAIM OF ASSAULT  </P> <P> Mike Tyson reached an out-of-court settlement with a parking attendant who  claimed that the boxing champion punched him when he refused to let Tyson's  white Mercedes-Benz park in a particular spot.  </P> <P> Michael Devine, 35, said the terms of the settlement reached Friday prevent him  from disclosing how much money he received.  </P> <P> But it was less than the $250,000 he was seeking, he said, and too small to  make up for his suffering.  </P> <P> "It was lousy, lousy," Devine said Saturday. "The settlement was a lousy amount  for all the trauma I've been through. I'm not fussy when it comes to money, but  that was lousy."  </P> <P> Devine said Tyson hit him three times in the stomach with the back of his hand.  </P> <P> The city attorney declined to prosecute Tyson on misdemeanor assault charges,  saying there was not enough evidence for a conviction. Tyson has denied hitting  Devine.  </P></p>

"I am pleased to say that the  Russian leaders promptly responded to my letter and expressed  their concern over the latest aggravation of the conflict in  Abkhazia," Shevardnadze told the Georgian news agency in  response to the appeal made public by the Russian leadership on  March 26.    According to Shevardnadze, "the Abkhazian forces recently  started a large-scale offensive in the Abkhazian mountains,  resulting in scores of killed and wounded on both sides, notably  women and children." He said that "especially dangerous were  also new attacks on Georgian villages on the banks of the Inguri  River" as a result of which 200 families from the village of  Okurcha, Zugdidi District, had joined the thousands of refugees.    Shevardnadze warned of the possibility of a new escalation  of  the conflict and added, "We support the Russian proposal on  resuming the talks and are prepared to join them in Moscow very  shortly."    He was convinced that Russia "was capable of exerting active  influence and playing a positive role in resolving the Abkhazian  problem, notably in resolving the most painful issue - the  return of over 300,000 refugees."</p>

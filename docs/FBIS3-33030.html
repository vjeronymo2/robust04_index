Sanchez added that the union members  pointed out that their demands are fair and necessary in light  of the Guatemalan economy's inflation rate.    Workers noted that in the past weeks, the prices of basic  necessities have experienced a significant increase to the  detriment of family finances. Price increases for basic  necessities combined with the increase in rural transportation  fares and fuel have affected the poorest families. With the  increased prices for widely used products, in addition to higher  interurban transportation rates and fuel prices, the hardest hit  are Guatemalan families who do not have and are unable to obtain  the necessary funds to survive.    The government employees march began at 1000 and covered the  main streets and avenues of Guatemala City. The demonstrators  carried banners and posters with antigovernment slogans.  Standing across from the National Palace, the state employees  chanted: "Ramiro you are submissive, you grabbed a rifle;  Ramiro you are submissive, you grabbed a rifle," and they  subsequently took up positions at the building's main entrance.  The guards closed the doors to prevent any incidents.    The demonstrators eventually withdrew voluntarily but gave  assurances that their activities and demonstrations will  continue until De Leon Carpio meets the state employees' demands.</p>

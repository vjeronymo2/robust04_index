			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SIX KILLED IN COUNTY TRAFFIC OVER LABOR DAY WEEKEND;  </P> <P> HIGHWAY DEATHS: MORE THAN 50 PEOPLE DIED IN ROAD ACCIDENTS THROUGHOUT THE  STATE. DRUNK-DRIVING ARRESTS ARE UP OVER LAST YEAR, THE HIGHWAY PATROL REPORTS.  </P> <P> Traffic accidents claimed at least six lives in Los Angeles County over the  Labor Day weekend and caused more than 50 fatalities across the state -- a pace  that appeared to be slightly greater than last year.  </P> <P> By 6 a.m. Monday, police roadblocks and traffic stops in Los Angeles County had  already accounted for 547 arrests of suspected drunk drivers. Statewide, a  California Highway Patrol spokesman reported, there were 2,447 drunk driving  arrests by Monday morning, compared with the 2,240 arrests made over the same  period last year.  </P> <P> CHP Officer Andy Guitierrez attributed some of the increase in drunk driving  arrests to a recent lowering of the state's legal blood alcohol limit. In  January, after a vote by the state Legislature, the legal limit for alcohol in  a driver's bloodstream dropped from .10% percent to .08%.  </P> <P> Some health officials claimed Monday that abuse of liquor over the holiday  weekend also was to blame for the increase in fatalities and arrests.  </P> <P> Alcohol-related accidents and crimes weighed heavy at the emergency room inside  California Medical Center in downtown Los Angeles. One nurse estimated that the  weekend's patient load was 50% higher than on the rest of the year's  already-busy weekends.  </P> <P> "When you get so many serious injuries, people with problems that aren't as bad  have to wait," said nurse Scott Aguilar. "That means people with broken bones  and bad lacerations have to wait five, six hours before we can even start to  help them."  </P> <P> Aguilar and other medical officials gathered in front of the medical center's  emergency room to decry the latest loss of state funding for Los Angeles  County's trauma care system and urge passage of a state liquor tax initiative.  </P> <P> "The way things are going now, the system's going to die," said Dr. Michael  Trainor, an emergency room doctor and president of the state chapter of the  American College of Emergency Physicians.  </P> <P> Doctors were unable to save a 30-year-old Upland man who died about 1 p.m.  Sunday in Pomona after losing control of his speeding pickup truck on the  transition road from the southbound Foothill Freeway to the eastbound San  Bernardino Freeway, the CHP said.  </P> <P> In East Los Angeles, a car driven by Felipe Hernandez, 20, of Anaheim, ran a  red light and slammed broadside into another car, killing the unidentified  driver, about 11 a.m. Sunday. The car then hit two other vehicles, injuring two  women, and struck a pedestrian, seriously injuring him as well, CHP officers  said. Hernandez was treated for minor injuries and arrested on suspicion of  felony manslaughter.  </P> <P> Moshe Ellerbock, 18, of Pasadena was killed about 3 a.m. Sunday when the car in  which he was riding hit a street light at Laurel Canyon Boulevard in North  Hollywood. And Sook Hi Lee, 72, of Sherman Oaks, died after his car went  through a red light and struck another vehicle while traveling east on Burbank  Boulevard in Van Nuys, police said.  </P> <P> Shortly after 8:30 p.m. Sunday, a motorcycle hit two parked cars in Southeast  Los Angeles, killing a 15-year-old passenger and critically injuring the  driver, Los Angeles police officials said. Earlier the same day, a 26-year-old  motorcyclist died after he ran a red light at Sunset Boulevard and Vermont  Avenue, ramming into a passing car. Neither of the two killed was identified by  police.  </P></p>

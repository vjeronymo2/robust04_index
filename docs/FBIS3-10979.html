			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  fileworthy reports on criminal activity and related judicial  actions in Cuba carried on Havana radio and television in  Spanish between 26 February and 9 March.    Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 26 February reports that the  Havana National Revolutionary Police arrested members of two  gangs, most in their teens, who had been stealing from homes and  stores in Nuevo Vedado and Alamar. These individuals comprised  three organized groups of thieves who stole bicycles and other  items. Before entering a house they observed it to determine the  residents' goods and schedules. They operated mainly at dawn  while the inhabitants slept. Most of the stolen bicycles have  been recovered by the police.    Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 28 February reports on arrests  in connection with 32,000 liters of milk, worth over 8,000 pesos  at the official price, missing from the Beatriz milk  pasteurizing plant which belongs to the Havana City Metropolitan  Milk Products Enterprise in Arroyo Naranjo Municipality. At  least nine persons benefited from this illegal activity: the  head of the distribution and sales department, an accountant, an  office worker, and a driver from the factory and two clerks and  three administrators from milk distribution points in Diez de  Octubre Municipality. They admitted to having falsified  distribution documents in complicity with the employees of the  milk-selling units. "In their confessions, those incriminated  said they sold the milk at prices far higher than those set by  the laws of the state." "This crime shows the lack of scruples  of the accused, who stole milk earmarked mainly for feeding  children solely so they could enjoy a living standard far higher  than their real possibilities. At the present, when the state is  employing important resources to guarantee the population's food  supply, in our society there still exist people who, to satisfy  their appetites for material goods, are capable of stealing  foods earmarked for the population." The people involved will be  charged with misappropriation. "According to the penal code,  whoever appropriates state property of considerable value  entrusted to his care will be sanctioned by a prison term of  from eight to 20 years."    Cuba Vision at 0100 GMT on 2 March reports that the National  Revolutionary Police arrested a number of people for allegedly  stealing 12,000 kg of polypropylene from a plastics factory in  Havana and selling it on the black market. Some of the arrested  were employees of the factory. Over 17,000 pesos were  confiscated from one of the arrested.    Radio Rebelde Network at 1255 GMT on 9 March reports a  recent  attempt to steal and slaughter some oxen from the Santa Maria  Cattle Farm, a Basic Cooperative Production Unit in Holguin. All  the thieves were caught in the act and handed over to the police.</p>

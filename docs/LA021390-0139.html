			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SPI EARNINGS CLIMB 26% ON RECORD SALES  </P> <P> SPI Pharmaceuticals said Monday that its earnings rose 26% last year on record  revenue of $124 million.  </P> <P> The Costa Mesa-based maker of prescription and non-prescription pharmaceuticals  said net income for its fiscal 1989 year ended Nov. 31 was $12.9 million,  compared to $10.2 million the previous year.  </P> <P> Revenue was up 7% to $124 million, compared to $116 million a year ago.  </P> <P> SPI attributed the gains to increased international sales, particularly in  Mexico and Central America. For instance, the company said it had experienced  an increased demand in Mexico for the injectable multivitamin Bedoyecta, which  is used to treat people with a deficiency of Vitamin B complex. Sales of  Bedoyecta, which is not sold in the United States, were up 59% in 1989 to $11.4  million. Two antibiotics -- Anapenil and Alivin -- also saw an increase in  sales in Mexico.  </P> <P> For the fourth quarter, SPI's earnings were up 3.4% to $3.7 million, compared  to $3.6 million in the corresponding period a year earlier. Revenue fell  slightly to $35 million, from $36.1 million.  </P> <P> SPI's stock was up 37.5 cents per share Monday to close at $8.875.  </P> <P> About 89% of SPI's stock is owned by ICN Pharmaceuticals, a Costa Mesa-based  drug company.

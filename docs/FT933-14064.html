			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / No respite in sight for flooded Midwest MORE rain threatened the US Midwest yesterday after two weeks of floods that have cost up to 25 lives and submerged some of the world's richest farmland, Reuter reports from Des Moines. Storms again lashed the Mississippi River valley, adding to the misery of farmers and increasing pressure on earthwork and sandbag levees. President Bill Clinton was due to meet congressional leaders yesterday to agree emergency relief. Rain drenched southern Iowa and parts of northern Missouri and Illinois early yesterday as people struggled to hold back the vast river. The National Weather Service said it expected no major shift in rain patterns over the next month. Officals at the Federal Emergency Management Agency said applications for loans were pouring into recently opened offices in the area.</p>

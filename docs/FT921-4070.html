			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Managers to take BT to tribunal A GROUP of BT managers who claim they have been threatened with a pay freeze unless they sign personal contracts are to take their case to an industrial tribunal. The 49 managers, members of the STE telecommunications managers' union, say they are among 170 staff who were told they would not receive a pay rise if they retained terms and conditions negotiated by the STE. The union argues that BT's action is, under the terms of the 1978 Employment Protection Act, designed to prevent or deter membership of an independent trade union. BT first offered personal contracts to 4,000 middle managers in 1989 and fewer than 200 now remain on terms and conditions negotiated by the STE. The union claims many signed 'following pressure and threats that their careers would suffer'. BT said yesterday that the tribunal applications were misguided and that it had never been 'the company's purpose to deter or penalise people for being trade union members'.</p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Observer: Expansionary policy The gang of five atop the Bundesbank has been feeling the pinch. Germany's central bank directorate, reduced last year from the previous complement of seven by the death of Ottomar Werthmoller, was also depleted by the more headline-grabbing resignation of Karl Otto Pohl, the then president. While Pohl was happier with no more than six wise men, which reduced room for dissent, his successor Helmut Schlesinger frets that five is too slender for comfort. With officials often spread all over the world speechifying - and one fifth of the policy-makers in the shape of Johann Wilhelm Gaddum off administering the bank's affairs in east Germany - the president gets nervous that there'll be no one left to mind the store. So, with the holiday season upon him, Schlesinger is agitating to fill the two vacancies pdq. While Bonn has the last word, it can take recommendations from the central bank. Observer hears that both posts will be filled by 'technicians' - with an announcement due any time, perhaps even after today's regular council meeting. The late Werthmoller's post seems likely to be taken by Wendelin Hartmann, a safe pair of hands who as chief of the Bundesbank's admin- istrative department has to most practical intents and purposes been doing the job in recent months. He appears to have finished a short head in front of one Hans-Jurgen Siegmund from the Hamburg central bank. But will the Pohl vacancy also be filled by someone from inside the bank? Since Karl Otto was always going to be a hard man to follow, it might be best not to make the attempt. Why not just settle for yet another bureaucrat?</p>

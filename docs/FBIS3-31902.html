			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Afrticle by Jaroslav Kmenta: "Iran Wants Tamara, but the </F> Manufacturer Will Not Sell"]    [Text] Prague--The Islamic Republic of Iran has several  times shown an interest in the Tamara passive radar system, the  Czech state-of-the-art air defense product that, according to  the experts, is even capable of detecting the "invisible" U.S.  Stealth aircraft. This information has been confirmed by Ludek  Stodulka, vice president of the HTT Group, which manufactures  Tamara. He emphasized, however, that HTT will not sell it to  this country.    Although Iran is not one of the countries to which arms  exports are banned, many foreign politicians nevertheless  consider it to be a very-high-risk region. "We respect the  state's interest in not supporting the arming of this region,"  added Stodulka.    According to him, countries such as India, China, South  Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand could purchase Tamara. France is  also interested in it.    Tamara and its predecessor, Ramona, have only been exported  to some of the countries of the former East bloc. At the  moment, Tamara is also owned by the German Bundeswehr, which  acquired it from the former GDR National People's Army, and the  Americans. Apparently, they got it for trials from the Polish  Army's weaponry. The former Czechoslovakia also sold Tamara to  Syria.    The HTT Group has also developed a civilian version of  Tamara, said Stodulka. He added that the company could supply  Tamara, for example, to the police force or the taxi service.  The radio impulses that the equipment receives from the  atmosphere could determine precisely the location of vehicles in  a city.    According to Stodulka, Tamara could even be used in the hunt  for those who kidnap children. If a child were kidnapped along  with its baby carriage, the radar system could monitor the  culprit's movements. Stations that could receive and analyze  the appropriate signals would have to be set up in a city for  these purposes.</p>

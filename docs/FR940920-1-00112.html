Summary of Proposed Method 29 and Method 101A Revisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Subparts Ca and Ea, the EPA is proposing guidelines and standards to regulate mercury, cadmium, and lead emissions from MWC's. Method 29 is being proposed for addition to Appendix A of 40 CFR Part 60 and will serve as the compliance test method for MWC's for mercury, cadmium, and lead. Method 29 is applicable to the determination of antimony (Sb), arsenic (As), barium (Ba), beryllium (Be), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), mercury (Hg), nickel (Ni), phosphorus (P), selenium (Se), silver (Ag), thallium (Tl), and zinc (Zn) emissions from stationary sources. Method 29 may be used to determine particulate emissions in addition to the metals emissions if the prescribed procedures and precautions are followed. For both methods, a stack sample is withdrawn isokinetically from the source, particulate emissions are collected in the probe and on a heated filter, and gaseous emissions are then collected in an aqueous acidic solution of hydrogen peroxide (analyzed for all metals including Hg) and an aqueous acidic solution of potassium permanganate (analyzed only for Hg). The recovered samples are digested, and appropriate fractions are analyzed for Hg by cold vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy (CVAAS) and for Sb, As, Ba, Be, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Pb, Mn, Ni, P, Se, Ag, Tl, and Zn by inductively coupled argon plasma emission spectroscopy (ICAP) or atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS) is used for analysis of Sb, As, Cd, Co, Pb, Se, and Tl if these elements require greater analytical sensitivity than can be obtained by ICAP. Additionally, if desired, the tester may use AAS for analysis of all listed metals if the resulting in-stack method detection limits meet the goal of the testing program. Mercury emissions can be measured, alternatively, using EPA Method 101A of appendix B, 40 CFR part 61. Method 101&hyph;A measures only Hg but it can be of special interest to sources which need to measure both Hg and Mn emissions. Amendments to Method 101A of appendix B of part 61 are being proposed to provide consistency with Method 29.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> II. Administrative Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. Public Hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A public hearing will be held, if requested, to discuss the proposed rule in accordance with section 307(d)(5) of the Clean Air Act. Persons wishing to make oral presentations should contact the EPA at the address given in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section of this preamble. Oral presentations will be limited to 15 minutes each. Any member of the public may file a written statement with the EPA before, during, or within 30 days after the hearing. Written statements should be addressed to the Air Docket address given in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section of this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Charlie Kharalambous] </F>   [Text] National Guard top brass are unhappy about the  removal of their commander Lieutenant-General Yeoryios  Siradhakis which they believe is more to do with politics than  tactics.    The new Greek Government has recalled Siradhakis even though  President Glavkos Kliridhis' request that his term of duty be  extended was initially granted.    But later, Greek Defence Minister Yerasimos Arsenis  contacted  Kliridhis and told him it was difficult to extend Siradhakis'  term of duty here because he had tuned 60 and a re-shuffle of  the Greek Army leadership was underway.    Kliridhis decided not to insist that the Greeks keep their  promise to allow Siradhakis to stay.    It is reported that National Guard officers are unhappy with  the departure of Siradhakis, who they believe was a good  commander who improved the army's efficiency.    They also see his removal by the Papandreou government as a  political decision, as the new administration seeks to appoint  its own supporters within the military.    Officers are worried that political differences may now  reach  the National Guard in the selection of a new commander.    They are also worried about the government's lack of clout  in  getting the commander they want, as their demand for Siradhakis  to stay was turned down.    As Siradhakis is expected to leave at the end of the month,  the procedure for his replacement is now under way.    Apart from Greek Vice Marshall Vorvolakos,  Lieutenant-General  Khondhros, a strong Papandreou supporter, has also been named as  a possible contender for the new post.    Although National Guard circles are worried about the  disruption caused to the Army, they also know there is not much  the government can do.    Any show of defiance or protest could seriously damage  Cyprus' fledgling defence pact with Greece.</p>

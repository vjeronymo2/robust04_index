			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Risk Considerations in ALARA Calculations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters at the workshops on decommissioning stated that all risks should be taken into account when setting requirements for decommissioning a site. A principal concern was that the Commission, in an attempt to reduce residual radioactivity levels at a site, would establish cleanup requirements which could result in an overall risk increase, or in risk transference, rather than risk reduction. For example, in an attempt to clean up a site for decommissioning, the licensee may increase risk to persons along transportation routes and at the site where the material is finally disposed by transporting large volumes of debris from the site. In addition, disposal of large quantities of low-level radioactive debris at licensed low-level waste disposal sites could deplete the capacity of existing sites and ultimately result in a proliferation of licensed disposal sites for low-level radioactive waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission, recognizing the validity of these concerns, proposes to require that the licensee, when determining ALARA, consider all significant radiation doses and risks resulting from residual radioactivity and the decommissioning process itself, including transportation and disposal of radioactive wastes generated in the process. This analysis would be part of the decommissioning plan and would be available for comment by interested parties under the public participation provisions described earlier in this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to ensure compatibility with EPA groundwater standards, the proposed rule requires licensees to remediate their sites so there is a reasonable expectation that residual radioactivity from the site will not cause the level of radioactivity in any groundwater that is a current or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential source of drinking water to exceed the limits specified in 40 CFR Part 141 as they exist on the effective date of this regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Groundwater Protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 20.1404(d) of the proposed rule would require that licensees demonstrate a reasonable expectation that residual radioactivity from a decommissioned site will not cause the level of radioactivity in any groundwater that is a current or potential source of drinking water to exceed the limits specified in 40 CFR Part 141. This provision is in addition to the overall radiological criterion for unrestricted release in 10 CFR 20.1404(a)(i) that the residual radioactivity that is distinguishable from background radiation results in a TEDE to the average member of the critical group that does not exceed 15 mrem (0.15 mSv) per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is soliciting comments on the proposed groundwater protection requirement. In particular, the Commission solicits comments on the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Is a separate standard needed for groundwater when the overall radiological criterion of 15 mrem applies to all pathways,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Given that natural background is included in 40 CFR 141, and given that for pathways of exposure covered by this rule, background is excluded, what alternatives exist for reconciling this difference in approach?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Is it appropriate to apply a drinking water standard (``at the tap'') to groundwater in all cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Minimization of Contamination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters at the workshops on decommissioning expressed the opinion that the Commission should be placing more emphasis on ensuring that licensed facilities are designed and operated in a way that would minimize the amount of radioactive contamination generated at the site during its operating lifetime. The Commission is sympathetic with this view. Therefore, the Commission proposes to require that applicants for licenses, except for renewals, describe in their applications how facility design and procedures for operation will minimize contamination of the facility and the environment, facilitate eventual decommissioning, and minimize the generation of radioactive waste. This provision is a prospective requirement for new licensees to examine contamination and waste minimization early in the process of facility design and license approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

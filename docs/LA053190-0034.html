			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: SOME HELPFUL HINTS FOR INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF FIBER  IN YOUR DIET  </P> <P> It would take roughly 14 oat bran bagels, a 1/2 pound of oat bran pretzels, 11  cups of Cheerios, nearly three cups of oat bran flakes cereal or, depending  upon the brand, four to seven oat bran muffins each day, to provide the amount  of fiber in two ounces of oat bran.  </P> <P> If it sounds like a lot to swallow, consider: In studies of the highly  concentrated form of fiber's cholesterol-lowering effect, the volunteers ate  three ounces.  </P> <P> Although it is probably possible to achieve a cholesterol-lowering benefit by  using these products, it places an undue emphasis on bran as a source of fiber.  Other foods are equally valuable.  </P> <P> A one-ounce serving (1/3 cup) of oat bran supplies about four grams of total  fiber (a mix of soluble and insoluble). The same amount of rice bran offers  nine.  </P> <P> It is estimated that Americans eat only about 11 grams of fiber daily --  equivalent to about one cup of kidney beans, three and a half apples or one and  a half cups of chopped broccoli. The National Cancer Institute recommends up to  35 grams daily for good health.  </P> <P> With some simple menu substitutions, that goal is easy to accomplish. Including  a morning serving of hot or cold bran cereal and a high-fiber muffin at lunch  or dinner time is a good plan. Then, shift the menu focus to raw or lightly  steamed vegetables, dried beans and legumes, fresh fruits, whole grains  (including brown rice, which contains the bran), pastas, breads and cereals.  This will simultaneously fill the stomach and make you feel less hungry.  </P> <P> Eating whole wheat toast with one-half pat butter and one teaspoon jam instead  of white toast and one pat butter will add two extra grams of fiber while it  reduces the amount of fat in the diet. In the evening, if you substitute  one-half cup cooked green peas (which supply eight grams of fiber) for green  beans, which supply only three grams, you get an easy fiber bonus.  </P> <P> Dietary fiber, roughage and bulk are terms that refer to the undigestible part  of plants. Their fibrous texture causes these foods to act like a kitchen  broom, sweeping the intestines and colon clean of wastes and helping to reduce  constipation. Cancer experts say this can decrease risk for some forms of the  disease. They report that people who eat a high fiber diet show a low incidence  of most gastrointestinal ailments.  </P> <P> Water insoluble fiber, is the thread or wood-like part of the husks and shells  found in foods such as wheat bran, peas, dried figs, beans and legumes. It is  not capable of holding onto water particles so it moves quickly through the  digestive system, frequently taking toxic substances with it.  </P> <P> Soluble fiber also has a positive effect on digestion. Found in the cell walls  of oats, apples, pears and citrus fruits, it also has a role in reducing blood  cholesterol levels. Since it does dissolve in water, it forms a gel-like  substance in the intestines that slows digestion. This quality is important to  diabetics and others who have medical conditions requiring a delay of the  absorption of carbohydrates into the body.  </P> <P> Both forms of fiber are important to good overall health. The American Dietetic  Assn. warns, however, against eating more than 50 grams of fiber daily; it  might have adverse effects such as decreased mineral absorption and stomach  discomfort.  </P> <P> The following menus each supply about 30 grams of fiber per day. They are not  intended for use on consecutive days. Rather, they are examples of how to  substitute high fiber whole grains and fresh fruits and vegetables for their  refined, canned and otherwise processed counterparts.  </P> <P> Some normally low-fiber foods, such as pancakes and muffins are also included,  but their fiber content has been increased by the addition of whole wheat flour  and bran.  </P> <P> FIRST DAY  </P> <P> BREAKFAST  </P> <P> 3/4 cup cooked oat bran or 1 cup oatmeal  </P> <P> 1/2 cantaloupe  </P> <P> 1 cup nonfat milk  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon reduced calorie margarine  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon brown sugar  </P> <P> LUNCH  </P> <P> Tuna Sandwich:  </P> <P> (3 ounces water packed tuna  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon reduced calorie mayonnaise  </P> <P> 1 whole wheat roll)  </P> <P> 1 cup nonfat milk  </P> <P> Tossed green salad  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon reduced calorie dressing  </P> <P> DINNER  </P> <P> 3 ounces baked chicken breast or fish  </P> <P> 1/2 cup cooked brown rice  </P> <P> 1/2 cup cooked spinach  </P> <P> 1/2 cup whole kernel corn  </P> <P> SNACK  </P> <P> 1/2 cup strawberries  </P> <P> 1/4 cup low-fat yogurt  </P> <P> SECOND DAY  </P> <P> BREAKFAST  </P> <P> 1 orange  </P> <P> 4 Rice Bran Pancakes  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons reduced calorie margarine  </P> <P> 1 to 2 tablespoons reduced calorie syrup  </P> <P> 1 cup nonfat milk  </P> <P> LUNCH  </P> <P> 1 cup lentil or bean soup  </P> <P> 1 (3-inch) square corn bread  </P> <P> 1 cup nonfat milk  </P> <P> 1 pear  </P> <P> DINNER  </P> <P> Pork Medallions With Prunes  </P> <P> 1/2 cup cooked green beans  </P> <P> 1 baked potato  </P> <P> THIRD DAY  </P> <P> BREAKFAST  </P> <P> 1 Raisin Rice Bran Muffin  </P> <P> 1 scrambled egg  </P> <P> 1 cup fresh fruit salad  </P> <P> 1 cup nonfat milk  </P> <P> LUNCH  </P> <P> Turkey Sandwich:  </P> <P> (3 ounces turkey breast  </P> <P> 2 sliced rye or whole wheat bread  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon reduced calorie mayonnaise  </P> <P> Lettuce and tomato)  </P> <P> 1 apple  </P> <P> DINNER  </P> <P> 1 cup whole wheat spaghetti with meat sauce  </P> <P> 1/2 cup sliced, steamed zucchini or broccoli  </P> <P> 1 piece French bread  </P> <P> SNACK  </P> <P> 2 oatmeal cookies  </P> <P> 1 cup nonfat milk  </P> <P> PORK MEDALLIONS WITH PRUNES  </P> <P> 1 pound pork tenderloin  </P> <P> 3/4 cup Madeira  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon beef broth  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons cornstarch  </P> <P> 3 whole cloves  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon oil  </P> <P> 1/3 cup chopped shallots  </P> <P> 12 pitted prunes  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Watercress sprigs  </P> <P> Trim surface fat from pork and cut across grain into 1-inch thick slices. Place  between sheets of plastic or wax paper and gently pound with mallet to 3/8-inch  thickness. Set aside.  </P> <P> Stir together Madeira, broth, vinegar, cornstarch and cloves. Set aside.  </P> <P> Heat oil in 12- to 14-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add half of pork.  Cook, turning once, until lightly browned on both sides and no longer pink in  center. Remove from pan and place in serving dish. Keep warm. Repeat with  remaining pork.  </P> <P> Discard all but 1 tablespoon drippings from pan, then add shallots to pan and  cook, stirring occasionally, until tender. Add Madeira mixture and cook,  stirring occasionally, until sauce comes to boil. Remove cloves and season to  taste with salt and pepper. Then add prunes and heat through. Pour sauce and  prunes over meat and garnish with watercress.

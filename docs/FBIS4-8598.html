			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 14 (AFP) -- Serb commanders Thursday  [14 April] sent troops and a tank to surround French UN  peacekeepers guarding an arms collection site near Sarajevo,  sparking a NATO warning of airstrikes to punish similar breaches  of its heavy weapons exclusion zone.    Serb soldiers ordered 30 French troops guarding weapons at  Krivoglavci, northwest of Sarajevo, to hand over the weapons,  said Eric Chaperon, a spokesman for the UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR).    The arms were placed under UN control following a February 9  accord between Bosnian Serbs and Moslems on a ceasefire and  withdrawal of heavy weapons from a radius of 20 kilometres (12  miles) from the capital Sarajevo, in line with a UN and NATO  ultimatum.    A UN spokesman said a high-ranking UNPROFOR official had  telephoned the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale after the  encirclement at 2:OO p.m. (1200 GMT).    The tank -- whose presence marked a violation of the  exclusion zone -- later withdrew into surrounding woodland but a  "tense" stand-off continued, the spokesman said.    In Brussels, a spokesman for the North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation reaffirmed the alliance's determination to enforce  the heavy arms exclusion zone.    "NATO's mandate to conduct air strikes -- in close  coordination with the UN secretary general and upon request of  the UN -- on any uncontrolled weapons in a 20 km exclusion zone  around Sarajevo, is still in force.    "Close air support to UNPROFOR troops in danger can be  provided if requested by UNPROFOR commanders and approved by UN  special representative Mr. (Yasushi) Akashi," the statement  added.    Serb troops tried to seize heavy weapons from the  Krivoglavci  site on Tuesday but withdrew after receiving orders from their  command post in the Serb-held Sarajevo suburb of Lukavica, after  it had been contacted by UNPROFOR.    Following Sunday and Monday's NATO air strikes on Serb  positions around the eastern Bosnia Moslem enclave of Gorazde,  Serb troops have also placed mines around three weapons  collection sites, blocking UN personnel guarding the sites, an  UNPROFOR spokesman said Wednesday.</p>

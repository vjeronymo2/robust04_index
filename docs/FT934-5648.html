			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Company News (This Week): Questions in store on depreciation  -Other companies Rumours are circulating that Argyll, the UK's third largest superstore group, will respond to pressure to depreciate its land and buildings. A 4 per cent depreciation could reduce pre-tax profits by about Pounds 25m. Such a move would put pressure on other chains to follow suit, seriously denting balance sheets and earnings. Consensus forecasts for Argyll's interim pre-tax profits, due on Wednesday, are for an increase of roughly 6 per cent to Pounds 216m-Pounds 217m. Grand Metropolitan: A Pounds 175m restructuring charge will reduce pre-tax profits for the year from Pounds 913m to about Pounds 770m. However, Thursday's announcement is expected to reveal a brighter picture at the trading level. IDV, the spirits division, should achieve double digit profits growth, with some help from currency translation. Another good performance is forecast for Burger King, and North American food operations will show recovery. GEC: The City is anticipating an unspectacular set of interim figures on Wednesday. The second half should be stronger when the company will have the benefit of a number of large contracts. Pre-tax profits are expected to be flat at Pounds 350m-Pounds 360m. A 5 per cent increase in the interim dividend to 2.81p is forecast. Bass: The UK brewing, hotels and retail group is expected to report on Wednesday a 5 per cent increase in full-year pre-tax profits from Pounds 473m to about Pounds 495m. Brewing profits are likely to be hit by margin pressures and bad debt provisions, and pub retailing will feel the effects of disposals. Improvements should come from Holiday Inn in the US and UK leisure operations. Severn Trent: The water company, which reports interims on Thursday, will draw questioning on the state of Biffa, the waste management group purchased in 1991. Announcements from other waste service groups, such as Shank &amp; McEwan, leave little room for optimism. The core water division is not expected to spring any surprises. Forecasts are for Pounds 140m-Pounds 149m pre-tax, with most opting for an 8 per cent dividend increase to 7.55p. International: Dresdner Bank, the second biggest German bank, reporting 10-month figures on Thursday, should benefit from buoyant securities markets. Also in Germany, Thyssen, the steel and engineering group, announces annual results amid rumours that it will pass its dividend. Credito Italiano, Italy's first big bank privatisation, will be priced on Saturday.</p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium anti-dumping suits threatened by Alcoa Aluminum Company of America will file anti-dumping charges against aluminium exports from the former Soviet Union if multilateral talks in Brussels on January 18 and 19 do not result in an agreement to cut world production of the metal, the company's chief executive, Mr Paul O'Neill, warned yesterday, reports Reuter from New York. 'If a solution doesn't come about in January, it'll be time to file suit under anti-dumping laws,' he said. 'We could be successful in such suits,' he added. Mr O'Neill said he was 'somewhat optimistic' that the talks between aluminium producing nations would produce an agreement to cut world output temporarily 1.5m to 2m tonnes a year. Western producers have blamed a flood of exports from Russia for a recent slump in real world aluminium prices to their lowest levels ever in real terms. Speaking at an analysts meeting Mr O'Neill said, however, that anti-trust laws in the US and other western nations posed a formidable obstacle to any co-ordinated cuts. 'It's not possible under anti-trust law to have an allocation process,' he explained. So, forming an agreement was going to involve 'an unbelievably artful drafting process'.</p>

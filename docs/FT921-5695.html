			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Bowater shows marginal decrease to Pounds 112.7m BOWATER, the packaging and industrial films group which yesterday scooped up two more packaging companies, saw a marginal decrease in its pre-tax profits in 1991 from Pounds 113.1m to Pounds 112.7m. Sales fell from Pounds 1.37bn to Pounds 1.27bn in the face of recession in Bowater's key markets in the UK, the US and Australia and operating margins slipped from 8.7 per cent to 8.6 per cent. Mr Norman Ireland, chairman, said this was a 'creditable' performance in the difficult circumstances but foresaw no early improvement in trading conditions. Bowater's fully-diluted earnings per share fell from 50.2p to 47p but the company lifted its final dividend by 8.7 per cent to 12.5p bringing the total to 22p (21p). The company received Pounds 4.2m in interest payments compared with an outflow of Pounds 5.9m last year. But it recorded an extraordinary charge of Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 26.6m credit) relating to rationalisation costs and a provision for the medical benefits of its retiring American employees. Mr David Lyon, chief executive, said: 'In the UK we have been bumping along on the bottom flat for four months.' But he added that orders and sales had picked up in the US. 'We may be living in the reflected success of our customers. We may be managing our business better or there may be an upturn in demand,' he said. Bowater's engineering and tissue businesses in Australia had also recorded some encouraging signs, Mr Lyon said. By division, Bowater's operating profits were: print and packaging Pounds 66.7m (Pounds 79.8m); coated films Pounds 17.6m (15m); building and engineering Pounds 16.2m (Pounds 16m); and tissue Pounds 6m (Pounds 4.4m). In recent years, Bowater has narrowed its range of businesses but the two acquisitions announced yesterday will broaden its exposure to other packaging markets. Bowater's sales to the medical, pharmaceutical and personal care markets will rise from Pounds 150m to Pounds 370m and will bolster the company's presence in mainland Europe. Mr Lyon said the company had completed six purchases in the past year and was still in a position to make small add-on acquisitions.</p>

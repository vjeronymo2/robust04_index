			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRENCH HISTORIAN WHO DISMISSES HOLOCAUST IS BEATEN  </P> <P> One of France's leading "revisionist" historians, who claims the Holocaust  never took place, was severely beaten Saturday by three youths said to belong  to a group called "The Sons of the Memory of the Jews," officials said.  </P> <P> Robert Faurisson, 60, was ambushed by the youths while walking his dog in a  park in Vichy. The trio repeatedly kicked and punched Faurisson, breaking his  jaw, then ran off, a police report said.  </P> <P> Faurisson was admitted to a Vichy hospital, then transferred to a hospital in  the nearby city of Clermont-Ferrand.  </P> <P> French radio said the attack was claimed by the previously unknown group, which  said in a statement that "Faurisson is the first but will not be the last."  </P> <P> "Let those who deny the Shoah (Holocaust) beware," it said.  </P> <P> The same group was named as responsible for the attack in a telephone call to a  news agency.  </P> <P> "This individual (Faurisson) is the origin of the Carmel of Auschwitz affair  that is dividing gravely the Jewish and Catholic communities," the caller said.  </P> <P> The reference was to the dispute over the presence of a Carmelite convent at  the World War II Nazi death camp in Poland.  </P> <P> Faurisson is one of the leading French members of a "revisionist" school of  history that says there is no evidence that 6 million Jews were killed in Nazi  gas chambers during the war.  </P></p>

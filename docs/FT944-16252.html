			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Receivers sell Swans' shipyards Receivers running Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, yesterday announced a series of sell-offs which will lead to the break-up of the company. Contracts have been exchanged for the sale of the company's Neptune Yard to A &amp; P Appledore - which already has a shiprepair yard on the Tyne - and for the Hebburn Dry Dock, on the south side of the Tyne, to the Wear Dockyard Group, a Sunderland-based company also involved in shiprepair. The sale follows the announcement that the last consortium which expressed an interest in taking over the business had pulled out of talks. The group, led by Manchester-based consulting engineers Organisation, Management and Survey, said it had no option after an ultimatum from receivers Price Waterhouse. Mr Gordon Horsfield, for the receivers, told a news conference yesterday that as a result of discussions with the buyers there was an indication of 'several hundred' new jobs being created at the yards. The sales leave just the Wallsend Yard open to tenders, where the final work is being carried out on the frigate HMS Richmond, which is due to be handed over to the Royal Navy next month. Swan Hunter employed more than 2,000 when it went into receivership 17 months ago. About 400 remain, of whom 130 are due to finish in a fortnight and most of the rest over the following two weeks. Mr Horsfield added that one of the receivers' next steps would be to invite tenders to take over the Wallsend Yard in which there had been 'a number of expressions of interest'. He could not state how much the Neptune Yard and Hebburn Drydock were being sold for but believed the total was greater than the parts of the OMS-led consortium bid for the whole company. Mr Horsfield rejected criticisms levelled at the receivers by the OMS-led consortium when it withdrew from negotiations. Referring to an MP's demand that OMS should 'put up or shut up', Mr Horsfield said: 'They didn't put up and they certainly didn't shut up.' Commenting on the OMS accusations that the receivers had placed a gun to the consortium's head, he said it was more a case of calling their bluff. The offer the consortium was making was 'a long way away from being completed'. Mr Horsfield said that after OMS was told its original offer of Pounds 6.8m was unacceptable, it increased it to Pounds 8.5m which might have been acceptable. However, OMS indicated it did not necessarily regard itself as bound by Pounds 8.5m and that 'it might be subject to downward revision'. OMS had said it wanted to take over the yard to fulfil an order from a US corporation for diving support vessels and from Olympic Seas Maritime for two catamaran ferries for use on the Athens-Brindisi route.</p>

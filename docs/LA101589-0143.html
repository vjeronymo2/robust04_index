			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAST ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PENN STATE RUNS PAST SYRACUSE  </P> <P> Blair Thomas scored on a 38-yard run and No. 23 Penn State kept its record  perfect in games in which Thomas has rushed for more than 100 yards with a  34-12 victory over Syracuse Saturday.  </P> <P> Sophomore O.J. McDuffie ran back a punt 84 yards for a touchdown as the Nittany  Lions broke open a close game at Syracuse, N.Y., with 17 third-quarter points  and ended a two-game losing streak to the Orangemen.  </P> <P> Thomas finished with 115 yards in 17 carries, but he carried only once in the  second half as the Nittany Lions won for the fifth consecutive time after a  season-opening loss to Virginia.  </P> <P> Syracuse lost its third in a row, able to score only two field goals against  the nation's second-ranked scoring defense. Penn State entered the game  allowing less than a touchdown per game.  </P> <P> After a 10-6 halftime lead, Penn State's Mark D'Onofrio intercepted a Syracuse  pass to set up Ray Tarasi's 20-yard field goal.  </P> <P> After regaining possession on a punt, Penn State drove 65 yards to score on  Tony Sacca's seven-yard pass to tight end Dave Jakob.  </P> <P> Three minutes later, the Nittany Lions got the ball back again on a punt.  McDuffie used a spin move to break one tackle and then dodged kicker Ken  Hawkins to score on the fifth longest punt return in Penn State history.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 31, Navy 14 -- Adam Walker ran for 105 yards and scored two  touchdowns at Pittsburgh, assuring the Panthers an unbeaten record going into  their Oct. 28 showdown at Notre Dame.  </P> <P> Walker, a senior, started at tailback only because Curvin Richards was held out  of the first half by Coach Mike Gottfried after missing a team meeting.  Richards, who has also been bothered by a pulled groin, scored on a 52-yard run  on his first carry in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Redshirt freshman Alex Van Pelt completed 13 of 26 passes for 204 yards, giving  him 1,414 yards for the season, and threw two touchdown passes as Pitt overcame  a 7-0 deficit by scoring 24 consecutive points. Pitt, idle next Saturday, is  5-0-1.  </P> <P> Army 45, Holy Cross 9 -- Mike Mayweather ran for 171 yards and three  touchdowns, snapping the Crusaders' 13-game winning streak and moving into  fourth place on the Cadets' all-time rushing list at West Point, N.Y.  </P> <P> Army (3-2) ran for 493 yards against the Crusaders (5-1). Mayweather, who moved  past Tory Crawford and Charlie Jarvis, has 2,426 career yards and needs just  532 to surpass Glenn Davis' record of 2,957.  </P> <P> Yale 24, Dartmouth 19 -- Tailback Kevin Callahan scored three touchdowns and  quarterback Darin Kehler rushed for 114 yards to carry the Bulldogs to an Ivy  League victory at Hanover, N.H.  </P> <P> Yale improved to 4-1 and 2-0 in the league; Dartmouth dropped to 1-4 and 0-2.  </P> <P> Cornell 28, Harvard 0 -- John McNiff rushed for 130 yards and two touchdowns  and Frank Monago caught two scoring passes to lead the Big Red to victory at  Ithaca, N.Y.  </P> <P> Cornell, 3-1 overall and 1-0 in the Ivy League, won its second consecutive game  and Harvard (1-4, 1-1) lost its fourth in a row.  </P> <P> McNiff scored on a draw play from 42 yards out 3:54 into the game. Then, with  three minutes left in the first quarter, he went over the left side from 10  yards out to make it 14-0.  </P> <P> Princeton 24, Columbia 8 -- Judd Garrett rushed for 163 yards, scored three  touchdowns and became the Tigers' all-time leader in rushing, scoring and  touchdowns at Princeton, N.J.  </P> <P> The Tigers' defense forced five turnovers as Princeton raise its record to  3-1-1 overall and 3-0 in the Ivy League. Columbia fell to 0-5 and 0-3.  </P> <P> Penn 32, Brown 30 -- Bryan Keys rushed for a school record 249 yards in 37  carries and scored four touchdowns to lead the Quakers to the Ivy League win at  Philadelphia. Keys broke the one-game mark of 214 yards set by Francis Bagnell  in 1950 and Adolph Bellizeare in 1982.  </P> <P> Boston College 35, Temple 14 -- Tim Frager ran for two touchdowns and kicker  Brian Lowe became BC's career scoring leader as the Eagles (1-4) beat the Owls  (0-7) at Newton, Mass. Lowe kicked field goals of 47, 27 and 42 yards and two  conversions for a career total of 223 points, breaking the BC record of 216 set  by running back Troy Stradford from 1982-86.  </P></p>

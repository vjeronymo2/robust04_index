			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Japan-France Commission Joint Chairman Henri Martre  (honorary chairman of Aerospatiale Co.), who is now on a visit  to Japan to attend a general meeting of the Japan-France Club,  granted an interview to a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter in Tokyo  on 10 March. In the interview, he stressed: "France-Japan  cooperation in settling the issue concerning the reconstruction  of Cambodia is a good example of cooperation between the two  countries. On the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue, it is possible for  the two countries to make joint efforts to settle the ethnic  strife there." In addition, he said: "In the tripolar structure  among European nations, Japan, and the United States,  strengthening relations between European nations and Japan is  urgently needed."    Regarding the United States' reinstatement of the Super 301  provision of the Omnibus Trade Act (sanctions measures against  unfair trade partners), he expressed concern over the U.S. move,  saying: "The United States' attitude is very much like someone  sitting at a negotiating table on trade issues with a gun at  their side."    The Japan-France Commission plans to submit to Prime  Ministers Hosokawa and Balladur in the near future a report  discussing relations between Japan and France in the long-term.  He said the report will include a statement saying "it is  important to improve bilateral economic relations."</p>

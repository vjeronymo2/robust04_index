			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Arts: Passion meets corruption and farce - Andrew St George finds provincial theatre very much alive At Leeds, there is a fine new Death of a Salesman; at Manchester a weak new play called The Lodger, and at Birmingham a welcome revival of The Atheist's Tragedy. Arthur Miller began writing Salesman (1949) in a wood shack he built in Connecticut. He called the first draft The Inside of His Head. The West Yorkshire Playhouse has a fine production directed by Matthew Warchus which catches the passion and the pose of Miller's original. As employment in the 1990s becomes less secure, Willy Loman is back in fashion: it is absurd to expect loyalty from an employer when money is the real issue. Ken Stott finds a way through the part of Loman making him admirable and contemptible, stupid to think that good individual work will be valued by an institution. His is a good performance, knotty on his own, yet pliable with others. Ellie Haddington plays Linda superbly: strong, uncomplaining and baffled by what is slowly killing her husband. A fine performance like this shifts the play towards Linda, making it her story too. Warchus uses an open set crossed by events from Loman's past which still seem real and have an effect: inside his head is just right. The second half is inside the house looking out, making the wide stage into an intimate family space. Further south, we reach the bedsit suburbs of The Lodger at The Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester. The play won the 1992 Mobil play writing competition run by the Royal Exchange. It is written by Simon Burke, an accomplished television writer. This play suits itself to the literary prize: it has sex, drugs, police corruption and romance in committee-winning equilibrium, wrapped in a producer-friendly small cast. Detective Constable Wise has a mortgage to pay and a room to rent. He takes in Lois, who uses the DC's back bedroom for immoral purposes. Then Lois's pimp turns up from King's Cross, and they go back into business. Finally, enter DC Reed, Wise's colleague, who discovers what the ironically named Wise has failed to do: the truth about Lois. Domestic violence ensues. The strongest aspect of the production is Julian McGowan's fine set. It lays out the twilight bedsit world as a fluorescent ground plan, like the glowing ruins of an old domestic settlement worn down to the foundations. The walls light up as the action moves. The two principals, Julia Ford (Lois) and Philip Jackson (Wise) conjure a workable relationship from the script. In the programme Burke describes the play as 'indeed nasty brutish and short'; good to have Burke on Hobbes, but it should be more of all three. Machiavelli is the philosopher of choice at Birmingham Rep's otiose production of Cyril Tourneur's Atheist's Tragedy (c. 1606-11). This ripping revenge horror is carried by the excellent Gerard Murphy as the scheming D'Amville. This is an unusual play, bravely staged and worth seeing for Murphy alone. Seen as a whole, this piece of Jacobean horror runs of sophisticated lines; watching it is like seeing a proof of Chaos Theory in the theatre where a small event changes the whole picture. The play is so wild, careening from terror to farce in a single leap, that Anthony Clark's direction is caught flat- footed. There is an unnecessary X-Rated brothel scene, and some sub-Hamlet goings-on in a graveyard which slip out of control. Tourneur's characters here represent nothing more than themselves, instead of the viewpoints he meant them for. Their semi-modern costumes leave them midway between Renaissance swagger and Cowardly poise. The farce and horror mix uneasily: 'Draw out mine eyeballs and make envious fortune play at tennis with them.' The latinate language is straight from Jonson and the sentiment direct from Shakespeare: 'Our own constructions are the authors of our misery.'

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Irish PM to meet Major next week MR ALBERT REYNOLDS, the new prime minister of the Irish Republic, is to meet Mr John Major, the UK premier, in London next week for talks about Northern Ireland. Mr Reynolds yesterday told his parliament that the planned meeting had been brought forward because of the 'changed situation' in Ulster. It is scheduled for next Wednesday. The Irish prime minister said that after a meeting between Mr Charles Haughey, Mr Reynolds' predecessor, and Mr Major in Dublin last December, it was agreed to hold prime ministerial meetings every six months. But following recent telephone calls with Mr Major about the continuing spiral of violence in Ulster, that schedule was revised. Mr Reynolds said that his government was ready to do 'everything possible' to help parties in Ulster resume dialogue abandoned last summer.</p>

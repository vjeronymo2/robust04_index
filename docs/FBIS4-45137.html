			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Itogi" newscast: Video report by Aleksandr </F> Gerasimov, identified by caption, on the withdrawal of SS-25  missiles from Belarus]    [Text] [Gerasimov to camera and over video of missile  transporters] SS-25 missiles have been on alert duty in  Belorussia [Belarus] for the past three years. The last of nine  missiles of the Feodosiya Red Banner Order of Suvorov Missile  Regiment is leaving the country today.    The strategic systems leaving for Russia will most probably  be sent to the Transbaykal region or Nizhniy Tagil. They are  not subject to the START treaty and will, according to Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev, continue to serve as the main guarantor  of Russia's security at least until the turn of the century.    In the course of this year four regiments and 36 "Topol"  [SS-25] missiles are to leave Belorussia. In accordance with  international agreements, the republic is destined to become a  nuclear-free state next year.    Irrespective of all these goings-on, the nuclear arms will  remain in full readiness during the entire period in question.  At the same time, none of the servicemen will ever know where  the missiles were targeted, or what the yield of their warheads  was. [video shows officers working in front of consoles]    [First officer] Attention! Combat orders received.    [Second officer] Understood. Operational mode of apparatus  changed.    [First officer] Personnel to shelter. [Words indistinct]  complete isolation [words indistinct].    [Second officer] Air alert, air alert!    [Gerasimov] Russian officers claim that the redeployment of  strategic missiles is a completely safe operation. The nuclear  warheads, removed from the carriers beforehand, are conveyed to  Russia by means of specially designated trains. The missiles  themselves are safely camouflaged in specially equipped  railcars, externally indistiguishable from ordinary refrigerator  railcars. [video shows transporter on the road, watch tower,  refrigerator-type railcar with missile inside]    As distinct from Ukraine and Kazakhstan -- the other  post-Soviet nuclear republics -- everything connected with  ensuring the combat capability of the missile systems is being  withdrawn from Belorussia. The Minsk authorities are not  obstructing the Russian military. They will be inheriting the  garrisons and army accommodations and property whose future is  yet to be defined. The Belorussian Interior Ministry has its  eye on the secret launch position facilities. The concrete  structures surrounded by barbed wire are ideal sites for  prisons. The Belorussian Army wants the barracks. The  Chernobyl State Committee would not mind taking over divisional  areas as rehabilitation centers. But so far none of these  agencies have funds to maintain these facilities. Army housing  units could turn into dead zones. Because of their location in  the forests, far away from populated areas as a rule, they are  of no interest to the local population.    Unemployment will rise sharply in Belorussia with the  withdrawal of the Russian missile troops. Most of the warrant  officers and contract servicemen are local inhabitants. The  crisis-ridden economy will not be able to provide them with jobs.    In many rural areas of the republic cash may simply  disappear. Ninety percent of the money in circulation came from  the budgets of the Russian units. Nonetheless, the local  authorities are viewing the army withdrawal calmly.    [Vladimir Malets, chairman of Lida City Soviet, identified  by  caption] I wouldn't say that the Russian Army created problems  for the local population, as is sometimes claimed in the press,  saying that there was friction. In my opinion this is not true.  Relations were normal. If we had problems, such as forest  fires, we had their understanding and cooperation. They even  helped us with things like that. So I think that all this talk  that we can sigh with relief now that the Russian Army is  leaving is just words. We have lived normally side by side.    [Gerasimov] Serving in Belorussia was always the dream of  officers in the former Soviet Army -- a mild climate, excellent  staffing by virtue of its being a border district, and firm  social guarantees.    The Russian military are leaving the republic with  understandable regret. But leaving nonetheless. Before, the  army and the people were one. Now it is the army and politics.

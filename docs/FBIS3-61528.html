Shchetinskiy, Cryobiology and Cryomedicine  Problems Institute at the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences,  Kharkov, and Rostov-on-Don Scientific Research Antiplague  Institute; UDC 541.64-14.152.2:57.043]    [Abstract] Interest in the state of water in biological  systems under deep cooling and a lack of systematic studies of  the effect of various types of cryoprotectors on water's  nonfreezing component in the cells prompted an attempt to  determine experimentally the quantity of nonfreezing water in a  suspension of Yersinia pestis EV76 cells in the  presence of both penetrating and nonpenetrating cryoprotectors  and study the process of this component congelation with a  decrease in the specimen temperature. The Y. pestis  EV76 plague microbe is selected mostly due to the fact that  preparation of the Y. pestis EV76 vaccine strain  involves freezing in a protective medium and lyophilic drying.  The Y. pestis EV76 vaccine strain of the NIIEG line  is used in the experiment. The bacteria were grown on a solid  nutrient medium at a 28C temperature for 48 h. The  experimental procedure is outlined. Nuclear magnetic resonance  spectra were recorded by a BS 567 A high resolution Tesla  spectrometer at a 100 MHz working proton frequency. The  dependence of the NMR water signal strength on the temperature  in the suspension of Y. pestis EV76 cells without and  with a cryoprotector and in a system containing bacterial cells  and the temperature curves of the cryoptotectant solutions are  plotted. The dependence of the nonfrozen water NMR signal  strength on the temperature in the Y. pestis EV76  bacteria suspensions and in various cryoprotector media and the  phase transition and congelation temperatures in cryoprotective  media under various cooling and heating conditions are  summarized. The study carried out within a 0 to -40C  temperature range with the help of the differential scanning  calorimetry method reveals that the total amount of nonfreezing  water within a range between congelation and melting points in  cell suspensions with various cryoprotectors does not follow the  simple additivity law with respect to the sum of hydration  numbers of individual components. The findings attest to the  complex effect of multicomponent protective media on the state  of water's nonfreezing fraction in cell suspensions and point  toward the possibility of producing material in a congealed  state. This makes it necessary to determine the waster state at  low temperatures experimentally in each specific case and in  developing cryobiological practices, yet the congelation  temperatures found in the study can be used for selecting  optimum long-term Y. pestis EV76 cell specimen  storage temperatures.

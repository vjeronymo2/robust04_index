Today the  negotiators were expected to start discussing national  reconciliation. Joao Ligio, our correspondent in the Zambian  capital, reports by telephone:    [Begin Ligio recording] The second point of the second round  of the Lusaka peace talks has entered its embryonic stage. The  mediator and the troika of observers are working together on the  general principles that have been presented by both sides as a  first attempt to narrow differences.    Similarly to what has happened when other points have been  discussed, frightening and disparate demands will become a  document in line with the constitution in force in this country.  This is what the troika of observers and sources close to the  mediation have said. UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin  Beye held a news conference. Blondin Beye announced that he  will be leaving for Abidjan tomorrow to attend the funeral of  the late Ivorian President Felix Houphouet-Boigny. He added  that proceedings will continue to follow their normal course  during his absence.    Asked about negotiation delays, Beye blamed the negotiators  and said that everything that takes place in Lusaka will  ultimately lead to the reintegration of National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, men into Angolan society.  The Lusaka talks will not veer from what is recognized in the  Constitution. They are creating a mechanism to increase trust  (?between Angolans and the mediators).    The proverb says that persistence pays and that is borne out  by facts. After much insistence, UN Special Representative  Blondin Beye made an exception and broke his information  blackout [preceding word in English] [words indistinct] a  plenary meeting with all those participating in the talks so  that the media could get pictures. Silence greeted reporters  again, however, shortly after the introductory speech. [end  recording]</p>

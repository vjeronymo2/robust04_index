			<p>BFN     [Text] Chairmen of the Japan Federation of Economic  Organizations [Keidanren], the Japan Federation of Employers'  Associations [Nikkeiran], the Japan Chamber of Commerce and  Industry [Nissho], and the Japan Association of Corporate  Executives [Keizai Doyukai] met for an hour at a Tokyo hotel in  the morning of 21 June to exchange views on the political  situation. During the meeting, the chairmen agreed on the point  that dissolution of the House of Representatives and holding of  general elections should be avoided. With regard to the  question of when to hold general elections they expressed the  view that "the general elections should be held under a new  electoral system after a bill on demarcating the current  constituencies is enacted in the Diet," and also confirmed that  they would put forth the view as a consensus of the business  community to both ruling and opposition parties. They released  their views in the form of a document of agreement. The business  leaders made clear their stance against assertions by the  opposition Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition Social  Democratic Party of Japan that they would not hesitate to push  for an early dissolution of the Lower House [LH] and an early  holding of general elections. Their stance has attracted  attention.    The meeting was held to congratulate Shoichiro Toyoda after  he was named as the president of Keidanren, and to exchange  views on the current political situation. Attending the meeting  were Toyoda; Takeshi Nagano, chairman of Nikkeiren; Kosaku  Inaba, chairman of Nissho; and Massaru Hayami, chairman of  Keizai Doyukai.    The document of agreement released at the end of the meeting  notes that "it is indispensable for Japan to push for political,  administrative and economic reforms" to build itself into an  affluent economic society in the 21st century, and urges the  Diet to come to grips with these reforms. According to an  attendee, Mr. Inaba said during the meeting "we must be cautious  to make the expression of the document of agreement fair to both  ruling and opposition parties." The four business leaders,  however, agreed to incorporate in the document of agreement  their opposition to dissolving the House of Representatives and  holding general elections under the multi-seat constituency  system.    In the past, the leaders of the four economic organizations  regularly held such meetings to exchange views on the LDP  leadership, but they have not held such a regular meeting since  the coalition government came to office. The meeting held on 21  June was the first ever since they met a year ago to discuss how  to make political contributions in the closing days of the  Miyazawa administration.</p>

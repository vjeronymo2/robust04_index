			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST FLIGHT CREATING 'AS MUCH HYPE AS BATMAN MOVIE';  </P> <P> B-2: SOME VIEW IT AS THE 'PR BOMBER'  </P> <P> The B-2 stealth bomber may some day carry 25 tons of nuclear warheads but when  the aircraft makes its maiden flight, it will carry a considerably less-lethal  payload: thousands of commemorative lapel pins to be distributed to Northrop  employees.  </P> <P> Northrop, the prime contractor on the B-2 project, and its partners at the Air  Force who are paying $70 billion for the bomber program, are rallying to  promote the first flight of the aircraft for maximum political benefit amid a  mounting controversy in Washington over its cost and need. It is making for a  somewhat bizarre mix of high-technology aerospace and old-fashioned hype.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'It Ought to Fly'  </P> <P> "This has generated as much hype as the Batman movie," said Rep. John R. Kasich  (R-Ohio), who has fought to cancel the program. "Everybody wants to see if it  will fly. Well, for the $23 billion we have already spent, it ought to fly."  </P> <P> The bomber, a surreal looking craft designed to elude enemy radar with exotic  materials and gently contoured surfaces, has undertaken two series of taxi  tests this week at Northrop's plant in Palmdale and may attempt its first  flight as early as today. The aircraft is expected to make a two-hour flight  across the Southern California desert, reportedly accompanied by two F-16 jet  fighters.  </P> <P> Although critics are already discounting the importance of the first test  flight, the event is generating considerable attention. Aviation enthusiasts  have begun gathering in the baking Mojave Desert sun outside the gates of the  Palmdale site, hoping to catch a glimpse of the distant bomber on the runway.  Three Air Force generals will be on hand for the flight, as well.  </P> <P> </P> <P> AF Hawking T-Shirts  </P> <P> And more than 100 news media representatives from around the world have staked  out a prime viewing site adjacent to the taxi tests, watching the dark gray  aircraft roar up and down the runway. Air Force officers have been hawking  T-shirts with the B-2 emblazoned on the front to sometimes bored news reporters  and photographers at the runway. One newswoman from the local Antelope Valley  News used the long delays for the taxi tests Thursday as an opportunity to lie  in a lawn chair and work on her tan.  </P> <P> "The B-2 has gone from being the stealth bomber to being the public relations  bomber," said Gordon Adams, director of the Defense Budget Project, a watchdog  group. "What is striking to me is that the Air Force has been more forthcoming  on details of this aircraft in the last three months than it has been in the  last six years."  </P> <P> The current Pentagon funding crisis has pushed the art of public relations in  the defense industry to new frontiers. When the Pentagon proposed canceling the  Grumman F-14 jet fighter program, the company distributed to members of  Congress "Top Gun," a hit movie that glorified the F-14.  </P> <P> Since then, proposed funding has been restored for the F-14, in part, by  diverting B-2 funds. One Capitol Hill staff member observed that the Northrop  bomber has become a virtual funding reservoir for other programs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clings to Its Mystique  </P> <P> Northrop does not have any B-2 movies to counter its critics but it has the  mystique of the stealth technology. And it is stepping up efforts to discuss  the aircraft's capabilities and the manufacturing technology. The company even  made B-2 executives available for interviews for the first time this week.  </P> <P> In one of those interviews, Northrop deputy program manager David Van Buren  earlier this week said that the B-2 had achieved a whole series of  technological breakthroughs, including a sixfold reduction in errors in getting  aircraft parts to fit together and a 62-fold reduction in setting up fabric  laminations for plastic parts.  </P> <P> The same message has been carried to Congress by Northrop lobbyists in numerous  visits in an effort to save the program from potentially disastrous budget  cuts. In a recent interview, Northrop Chairman Thomas V. Jones said the program  could be crippled if it falls below the so-called minimum sustainable rate, in  which the company would be unable to retain enough skilled employees. "It is  down at that point where you could call it in a holding pattern," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Costs Could Soar  </P> <P> The aircraft will cost an average of $530 million each, but under one scenario  presented to Congress, annual funding cutbacks and a production slowdown would  boost that cost to $1.4 billion. A powerful House staff member notes that under  current Air Force plans, about $48.7 billion will be spent on the bomber and 47  aircraft built before testing is completed.  </P> <P> But Van Buren insists that the B-2 has undergone extensive testing on the  ground to reduce any potential risks and that the B-2 price is only $274  million (excluding future inflation and development costs), which has changed  little from estimates made a few years ago. He said that the B-2 takes fewer  labor hours to manufacture on a "per pound" basis than the B-1 bomber or the  Boeing 757 commercial jetliner.  </P> <P> The hours per pound are not what concerns the Congress, however. It is the  current budget that calls for annual funding of up to $8 billion for the B-2,  more than any weapon has received in one year in U.S. history.  </P> <P> The House Armed Services Committee has already cut $800 million from the B-2's  1990 budget and committee staff say that much deeper cuts are likely once the  funding legislation reaches the House floor. The program fared much better in  the Senate, where so far it has been funded at the levels requested by the  Pentagon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Call It a 'Validation'  </P> <P> A successful first test flight is bound to do little to help the B-2, although  an unsuccessful test could be catastrophic. Northrop officials have gone to  great lengths to discount any uncertainty about the B-2. They don't even call  it a test, instead referring to it as a "validation" of the previous ground  testing that has occurred. Van Buren noted that the aircraft has gone through  122,000 hours of preflight qualification testing.  </P> <P> But first flights have been difficult in the past.  </P> <P> When the F-16 underwent its first taxi tests in 1974, it prematurely lifted off  the runway and nearly crashed. Films of the flight show the aircraft wobbling  in a near stall and only slowly recovering. When the Air Force C-5A cargo jet  made its first flight in 1968, a wheel fell off at the end of the runway.  </P> <P> Kasich, the Ohio Republican who wants to cancel the B-2, said he has little  doubt that the B-2 will fly successfully, "but that should not mean much in  this debate. They are trying to make it mean a lot because the plane is in  trouble."  </P></p>

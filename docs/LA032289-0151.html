			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ONCE IS ENOUGH FOR LAST IDITAROD FINISHER;  </P> <P> JUST TOO MUSH OF A GOOD THING  </P> <P>  A New York mailman who for years dreamed of running the 1,168-mile  Anchorage-to-Nome Iditarod Sled Dog Race woke up in Nome today, his dream a  reality, but not one he wants to relive any time soon.  </P> <P> A team of huskies delivered Bob Hoyte to Nome's Front Street late Tuesday,  earning him the Red Lantern, the award given to the last musher to cross the  finish line.  </P> <P> Hoyte, 42, of Ithaca, N.Y., made the rigorous trek across the roadless Alaska  wilderness in 17 days, 11 hours, 19 minutes and 19 seconds. He reached Nome at  8:19 p.m. Tuesday, with a small crowd gathered at the finish line.  </P> <P> Joe Runyan, 40, of Nenana, Alaska, won the world's longest sled dog race last  Wednesday, making the journey in 11 days, 5 hours, 24 minutes and 34 seconds.  </P> <P> Hoyte may have been last, but he made it. Eleven of the 49 mushers, or sled dog  drivers, who left Anchorage March 4 dropped out along the way.  </P> <P> Hoyte had his problems, especially at the end, but neither snow nor dark of  night nor rough trails nor high winds stopped this mailman.  </P> <P> "That's it," Hoyte sighed, summing up his long-sought accomplishment and at the  same time saying he had done what he set out to do and there was no burning  desire for more.  </P> <P> Before the race started, Hoyte said, "When I first read about the Iditarod, a  chill went up my spine and I knew that this was something I had to do. Now it  has reached the level of an obsession. I must do this so I can get on with the  rest of my life."  </P> <P> Hoyte, who now plans to get on with the rest of his life, suffered a real chill  in the final days of the Iditarod when strong winds began battering the final  stretch of Bering Sea coast trail to Nome.  </P> <P> Although most mushers, including seasoned veterans, had an incredible two weeks  of perfect weather with no storms, the slower-moving Hoyte got hit by winds  before he could reach Nome. That held him up, and he holed up for a day in a  cabin for protection a mere 40 miles from the end of the 1,168-mile Iditarod  Trail.  </P> <P> Hoyte finally left the refuge of the shelter cabin and mushed into Nome with  the temperature at 14 and the winds relenting to a mere 16 m.p.h., half what  they were, for a 13-below-zero wind chill. He reached Nome 38th, a full day  after the penultimate musher.  </P></p>

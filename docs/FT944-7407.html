			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices plunge on Brazilian stocks surprise Coffee prices tumbled yesterday as hedge funds baled out of the market leaving the January futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange Dollars 265 a tonne lower at Dollars 2,870 a tonne. The sharp fall in prices takes the market back to its level at the end of June before the second Brazilian frost sent it over Dollars 3,000 a tonne. Analysts interpreting technical signals from price charts said the market could rapidly slip to Dollars 2,620 a tonne, the next support point, and after that, to Dollars 2,480 a tonne. If prices break through these supports they will return to levels in place before Brazil's first frost damaged coffee trees leading to supply fears. The downturn was sparked by the news that Brazilian coffee stocks were 15m bags (60kg each), higher than traders expected. But the influential hedge funds have taken a very negative view of the coffee market in recent weeks, fuelling the price decline. Roasting companies, which have seen purchases fall in the shops, have their needs well covered and are not rushing to buy as the market drops. 'There is a significant battle between producers and consumers over which way prices go,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at GNI, the London brokers. 'The market is awash with coffee now, but it will be tight again next year.' Prices on the London Metal Exchange finished lower but trading was not particularly hectic, writes Kenneth Gooding. Traders said copper led the way down and pulled other metals with it. Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton Metals, said the metal markets were overdue for a more substantial downward 'correction' but it was too early to say whether the falls seen this week were the start of this process. Prices could fall substantially before the year-end if the investment funds decided to lock in their profits, he said.</p>

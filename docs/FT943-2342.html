			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Pension fund to sell 17 paintings The British Rail Pension Fund is to sell 17 of the old master paintings it bought in the 1970s when it invested Pounds 40m in works of art, Antony Thorncroft writes. They will be auctioned at Sotheby's on December 7 and are expected to bring in at least Pounds 5m. The pension fund built up a collection of more than 2,000 antiques, most of the which were sold during the fine-art boom of the late 1980s. Once the old masters have been dispersed there will be little left. Against the expectations of many, art proved a good investment for the fund, producing an annual rate of return of just under 6 per cent. Among the paintings offered are a landscape by the Dutch artist Hobbema, expected to make up to Pounds 3m, and a rare work by the Venetian artist Caprioli with a forecast of up to Pounds 600,000. The fund bought it at Sotheby's in 1979 for Pounds 55,396.</p>

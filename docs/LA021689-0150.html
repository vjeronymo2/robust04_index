			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEARY WINS ARBITRATION DECISION;  </P> <P> HERSHISER HEARING SCHEDULED FOR TODAY AS TALKS REMAIN STALLED  </P> <P> Dodger pitcher Tim Leary, in his first turn at bat in arbitration, hit a home  run Wednesday when he won his case and was awarded a salary of $670,000, more  than tripling his 1988 earnings.  </P> <P> Dodger efforts to sign Orel Hershiser to a multiyear contract, meanwhile, still  appeared fruitless, with time running out. While the Dodgers' other pitchers  head for spring training today in Vero Beach, Fla., Hershiser is scheduled to  remain behind for an arbitration hearing in a Los Angeles airport hotel.  </P> <P> Hershiser's agent, Robert Fraley, spoke with Dodger officials Wednesday, but  most of his time was spent preparing for today's hearing, which will be  conducted before arbitrator Stephen Goldberg.  </P> <P> Hershiser is believed to be seeking more than the $7.5 million Boston's Roger  Clemens agreed to in a three-year deal Wednesday, but the main obstacle to a  multiyear deal remains contract language regarding a possible owners' lockout  in 1990.  </P> <P> Hershiser wants a guarantee that he will be paid in 1990 regardless of a  possible lockout. The team wants an arbitrator to make that decision.  </P> <P> Hershiser is seeking $2.425 million in arbitration. The club is offering $2  million. Win or lose, the National League's Cy Young Award winner will receive  a minimum raise of $900,000.  </P> <P> "I'm one of the few folks who believe he needs to have a hearing," Fraley said  this week. "Because win or lose, I believe there will be a better deal out  there next year.  </P> <P> "The issue of language is really silly. The team is not willing to do for Orel  what it has done for other players, for some reason. That's a little foolhardy,  I think."  </P> <P> Leary, 30, had a 17-11 record with a 2.91 earned-run average and struck out 180  batters in 228 2/3 innings last season, numbers that apparently swayed  arbitrator Anthony Sinicropi to rule in his favor. The Dodgers had offered  $525,000 to Leary, who didn't hurt his case by batting .313 last season with  three game-winning RBIs. His agent, Dennis Gilbert, and attorney Steve  Schneider prepared his case.  </P> <P> "Sam Fernandez (the Dodgers' counsel) called to congratulate us," Gilbert said.  "A class act. Both sides agreed Tim had a great year. We only disagreed on the  money. Tim's position on the whole thing was he was going to pitch for the  Dodgers in 1989, regardless of what happened."  </P> <P> Leary sat in on Wednesday's hearing but did not play an active role.  </P> <P> "I was excited, I'll tell you," Leary said of the decision.  </P> <P> "It was a matter of picking the right number. If I'd picked a million, for  example, I would have lost.  </P> <P> "It's a hard-nosed business, no fooling around. You get edgy. I was edgy. It's  intensely competitive. (But) you get paid on the back end. They knew I had an  outstanding year. If I'd been making a million last season, I think they would  have been satisfied. So there's no hard feelings."  </P></p>

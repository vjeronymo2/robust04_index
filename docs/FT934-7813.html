			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Andrew Weir creditors to get payment Creditors to Andrew Weir Insurance, which is in provisional liquidation, can ultimately expect to receive 50p to 60p in the pound, according to details of a proposed scheme of arrangement under English insolvency law circulated this week. A summarised balance sheet for the year to December 31 1992 showed estimated assets of Pounds 111.1m, against liabilities of Pounds 142m. The document said that Weir had gross reserves of Pounds 122.6m and estimated that additional gross reserves for environmental pollution might be Dollars 62m (Pounds 41.6m). An initial pay-out to creditors is likely to be about 15 per cent. The scheme of arrangement has been proposed by Mr Richard Boys-Stone and Mr Colin Bird, partners with Price Waterhouse and the provisional liquidators to the company.</p>

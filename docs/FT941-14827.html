			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Bosnia Serbs threaten 'all-out war' The leaders of Bosnia's warring communities resume partition talks in Geneva today against a backdrop of intensified fighting and few positive indications of an imminent end to the war. In another sign that the prospects for agreement are bleak, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, told the assembly of his self-styled Serb state that the Moslems would be faced with 'all-out war' if the fresh round of peace talks failed to yield an agreement. His threats were aimed at Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's president, who, apparently emboldened by recent military victories against Croat forces, last week reiterated his pledge to regain control of land which was mostly populated by Moslems before the Serbian onslaught. Croat and Bosnian officials yesterday met following a Croatian proposal to create a confederation with their Moslem adversaries once a deal was reached. Croatian President Franjo Tudjman is trying to convince Mr Izetbegovic that the restoration of the Croat-Moslem alliance would help assure the future of a rump Moslem state. Mr Tudjman and his Serbian counterpart, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, were due to join today's talks. In Geneva, UN officials were reported to have rejected the use of air strikes against Serb targets as proposed under a Nato initiative. Following his fact-finding mission on the feasibility of air strikes, Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy, met leading UN political and aid officials. He came out against the use of air power to open the airport in Tuzla, the biggest government stronghold, and to secure the rotation of Canadian peace-keepers in Srebrenica, the Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia. He reportedly indicated that the use of air support would stop the passage of overland aid convoys to Tuzla and said that agreement in principle had been reached to allow Dutch troops to relieve the Canadian company in Srebrenica.</p>

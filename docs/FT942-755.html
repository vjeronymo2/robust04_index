			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Labour urges tax law rethink The government was last night urged to re-examine proposals designed to make complex tax legislation more effective and comprehensible by Mr Nick Brown, a Labour frontbench spokesman. He promised the co-operation of Labour MPs if the government agreed to include technical tax provisions as part of the Budget to be introduced on November 29. Mr Brown said this could be dealt with separately by a special committee of MPs able to take evidence from tax specialists employed by the Inland Revenue and other organisations. He stressed that the principal tax proposals announced by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, would be dealt with in the finance bill in the normal manner. Mr Brown secured agreement from some Tory backbenchers when he maintained that a separate taxes management bill could be examined in an orderly and considered way. Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, yesterday urged 'caution' in responding to calls for strengthened powers for Commons select committees. Mr Terence Higgins, Conservative MP for Worthing and chairman of the liaison committee which co-ordinates their work, praised the manner in which they called ministers to account. He questioned whether Baroness Thatcher, when refusing to give evidence about her role in the controversial Pergau dam project, had been correct to claim that convention required that ex-prime ministers should not be questioned by select committees. Mr Higgins recalled that two former prime ministers, Sir Edward Heath and Lord Callaghan, had agreed to appear before select committees. Mr Higgins acknowledged that, as a peer, Lady Thatcher had the right not to appear before such a committee. Sir Anthony Grant, Conservative MP for Cambridgeshire South West, said the select committees provided the only way forward in ensuring that an increasingly powerful executive was subjected to scrutiny and restraint. Mr Richard Caborn, Labour MP for Sheffield Central and chairman of the Commons trade and industry committee, warned that there was a danger of select committees being used by governments to defuse a highly charged situation.</p>

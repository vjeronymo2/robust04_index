			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Chuzzlewit dull in part, but mostly absorbing Sir, I should be grateful for the opportunity to enlighten Christopher Dunkley (Television, November 7) on Martin Chuzzlewit. Even Dickens's Victorian readers, who were blessed with much wider attention spans than most people are able to demonstrate today, found the novel's American chapters extremely dull and uninteresting. It is possible that they were invented by the author to promote the novel's disappointing early sales. Indeed, then and since, these chapters have proved so much of an annoyance that they have frequently been skipped over and left unread so that the enthusiastic reader can concentrate on the wonderful characters and thoroughly absorbing events contained in the main part of the book. I urge Dunkley to read the novel; I am sure that once he has, he may well find that he agrees with these sentiments.

			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROMANIANS GO TO POLLS, WARILY TEST DEMOCRACY  </P> <P> Romanians braved icy stares and unspoken threats to cast their ballots Sunday  in elections expected to be swept by the governing National Salvation Front  after the most troubled campaign in the spree of elections this spring among  Eastern Europe's self-styled democracies.  </P> <P> Bucharest Radio said that outright acts of violence were rare, although several  complaints filtered into the capital alleging that ballots in some rural  regions near Iasi and Cluj had been marked before being given to voters.  </P> <P> In one incident in Bucharest, reporters observing two election workers charged  with bringing the ballot box to house-bound invalids saw them stamping the  forms for the National Salvation Front.  </P> <P> International observers said they were aware of "grave irregularities" but  declined to make any public statements until today.  </P> <P> Voter turnout was strong for the first multi-party ballot in half a century  here, with more than 75% of the nation's eligible voters having shown up before  8 p.m. Polling hours were extended until midnight from the originally planned  11 p.m. closure after hundreds called election officials to say they hadn't  been able to vote earlier.  </P> <P> The front and its presidential candidate, Ion Iliescu, were widely seen as the  favorites in the election, the results of which will not be known before  Tuesday.  </P> <P> A West German polling firm that proved extremely accurate in fore casting the  outcome of the March 18 vote in East Germany conducted exit polls at 252 voting  places in Romania on Sunday. On the basis of more than 16,000 interviews, the  Bonn-based INFAS firm predicted a whopping 83% for Iliescu and 66% of the  Parliament seats for the front.  </P> <P> But polls are of dubious credibility in Romania, where people are still  inclined to say what they feel they should, rather than what they think.  Samplings of Romanian media and research institutes have forecast at least 60%  of the presidential vote for Iliescu, whose main challengers are returned  emigres Radu Campeanu of the Liberal Party and Ion Ratiu of the National  Peasants Party.  </P> <P> The front, which took power after dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was toppled in  December, had valuable state resources at its disposal for the campaign, such  as air transport, the state motor pool and printing presses. The front was  repeatedly accused of having unfair advantages over its opponents and of  prompting ruffians in the countryside to attack or intimidate rivals.  </P> <P> Even in the capital, under the scrutiny of hundreds of foreign journalists and  election monitors, the atmosphere at the polls was one of hope shadowed by  fear.  </P> <P> In the schoolyard surrounding the German Lyceum in central Bucharest, Natalie  Bonciu looked around nervously and dropped her voice to a whisper to say that  the campaign had been dominated by the front.  </P> <P> "The souls of the people are not cured yet. After such a period of terror,  everyone is still fearful," said the 60-year-old economist, like many of her  countrymen decked out in her best clothes for the electoral occasion.  </P> <P> "We are still afraid to speak our minds," interjected her 76-year-old cousin  Maria.  </P> <P> Both women said they had voted with their conscience but were worried that too  many others had been persuaded by front campaign propaganda that no other  political force is qualified to govern.  </P> <P> Nicolae Matase, an 80-year-old retired lawyer who moves slowly with the aid of  a battered wooden cane, hobbled out of the same polling place, declaring to  those still waiting to cast their ballots: "I voted for the Liberals.  </P> <P> "I'm not afraid. They can't harm me," the pensioner stated defiantly, referring  to the front.  </P> <P> He said the campaign had been hijacked by the governing party and warned that  tensions in Romania are likely to escalate after the vote is counted and the  Communists' former monopoly on power is simply transferred to the front.  </P> <P> "I fear a civil war is brewing," Matase predicted ominously. "It is hard to  inspire ordinary Romanians to action, but once you get them going there is no  stopping them."  </P> <P> Thousands of people opposed to Iliescu and the front have been staging a  nonstop rally in thecapital's University Square since April 22, denouncing the  interim governing force as a neo-Communist Party that seeks to ensure its  continued grip on power.  </P> <P> The demonstration, which has blocked traffic and turned the lawn of the nearby  National Theater into an open-air toilet, slimmed down to a few hundred people  during daylight hours Sunday, when some of those who had been swelling the  protest's ranks went off to vote.  </P> <P> Just a few miles southeast in the working-class suburb of Bragadiru, the mood  of the voters was both more festive and less diverse. The towns and villages  outside of Romania's major cities are believed to be solid beds of support for  the front.  </P> <P> Adults smoked and gossiped on the scruffy lawn and sidewalks in front of the  Bragadiru House of Culture, waiting for the three-hour line at the polling  place to dwindle and watching over the children brought along as if to a  community picnic. An accordion player pressed out folk music under a solitary  chestnut tree, and wafts of acrid-sweet air drifted over the crowd from a  nearby distillery.  </P> <P> "Everyone had a fair chance to present his ideas. All the parties were on  television and radio," said Emilia Chitac, a transport worker and mother of  three. She declined to disclose who she would vote for, pointing out that the  ballot is secret, but made clear that she is firmly behind the front.  </P> <P> Ion Nicolae, an oil industry mechanic who travels around the country  extensively, said he thought the campaign had been fair and that those  protesting in central Bucharest were upset because their candidates were going  to lose.  </P> <P> As he spoke, he looked to other men who had edged within earshot, exchanging  nods and glances to ensure each other that they were all on the right side.  </P> <P> "I voted for Iliescu," said Elena Tincea, looking nervously to her husband for  permission to speak. Asked why she supports the front, she paused uncertainly,  then credited the governing power with the "small changes" Romanians have  enjoyed since the revolution.  </P> <P> Part of the allure of the front has been its ability to put food in the shops  and restore electricity to homes and offices that, under Ceausescu's Draconian  economics, were limited to as little as two hours of heating and lights each  day last winter.  </P> <P> Iliescu voted quietly and without comment to the few press photographers who  managed to reachhis polling place before he showed up at 6 a.m., when polls  opened nationwide.  </P> <P> The official counting process is expected to take days, with results of the  presidential race expected no sooner than late Tuesday and the distribution of  119 Senate seats and 387 seats in the Assembly of Deputies not to be known  until Wednesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Romanian Election  </P> <P> At Stake  </P> <P> The presidency; 119 seats in the Senate: 387 seats in the Assembly of Deputies.  15 more seats go to representatives of the main national minorities. The two  houses, together called the Constituent Assembly, are to adopt a new  constitution and hold fresh parliamentary elections a year later.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Voters  </P> <P> About 17.8 million eligible voters (Romanians 18 or older) will choose from  among 82 parties running for Parliament in some or all of the country's 41  constituent districts. Only six parties are expected to win seats (see below).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Major Parties  </P> <P> National Salvation Front  </P> <P> 1 million members claimed  </P> <P> Dominant force since the December overthrow of the Ceausescu regime; controls  interim government.

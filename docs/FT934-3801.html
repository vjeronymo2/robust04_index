			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Budget approval prospects leave Milan up 2.6% Bourses moved on a variety of influences, and mostly higher, writes Our Markets Staff, although both Frankfurt and Paris seemed to have run out of impetus. MILAN advanced 2.6 per cent with the bulk of the buying coming from domestic investors, reassured by signs that parliamentary approval of the budget was on track and with the results of the local elections providing no surprises. The Comit index added 14.31 or 2.6 per cent to 564.15. Credito Italiano shed L50 to L2,259: however, expectations of a heavy oversubscription for the issue held the shares well above the L2,075 privatisation price, announced on Saturday. Fiat rose L229 or 5.8 per cent to L4,200 in heavy volume of 23.2m shares. News of higher sales in November provided limited impetus, analysts suggesting that the share price, constrained throughout the group's capital raising exercise, was now catching up with the strong performances of European competitors over the last two months. Generali, a loser last week, bounced L1,420 or 2.8 per cent higher at L27,990 as investors, once again, focused on prospects for good annual results from the insurance sector. FRANKFURT tried to build on last week's rally, the DAX index hitting a record intraday high of 2,133.31, but there was no backup from buy orders and profit-taking came in. The DAX ended 1.81 lower at 2,118.80, turnover easing from DM9.1bn to DM8.9bn. At the heavier end of the corporate economy, Metallgesellschaft dropped DM46, or 11.7 per cent to DM346.50 as Kugelfischer, the ball bearing manufacturer, recovered DM11.50, or 8 per cent to DM156. Kugelfischer has more than doubled from its 1993 low of DM72; yesterday saw news that its operating losses had declined, and prospects had improved further as a result of a restructuring programme. Metallgesellschaft reported heavy losses, and passed its dividend less than a fortnight ago. Combining commodities trading with environmental technology, and more obviously vulnerable to metal prices, the company was forced yesterday to acknowledge massive margin payments, and a liquidity bottleneck after the slump in crude oil prices in recent weeks. In electricals, meanwhile, AEG declined comment on speculation that it was planning to sell its household appliances group to Electrolux of Sweden. The shares rose DM5.40 to DM180.40. AMSTERDAM was satisfied with Ahold's third quarter rise in profits and the retailer's shares added 10 cents to Fl 45.80, off a day's high of Fl 46.20. The CBS Tendency index put on 0.7 to 139.7. Begemann, the engineering concern, gained Fl 1.30 to Fl 46.30 after announcing that it planned to raise Fl 300m through a convertible bond issue. ZURICH continued to benefit from last week's better than expected inflation and GDP data and the SMI index rose 17.4 to to a fourth consecutive record high of 2,863.4. Nestle, the most actively traded stock, rose SFr12 to SFr1,221 after Friday's break through the SFr1,200 level. BRUSSELS set a new record high on technical factors and strength of the domestic currency. The Bel-20 index closed up 14.75 at 1,438.42. Turnover was good at BFr2.6bn. Among the significant movers Electrabel climbed BFr120 to BFr6,550 and Tractebel BFr225 to BFr10,700. PARIS did little during the session and the CAC-40 index closed just 1.66 points weaker at 2,186.74, having earlier seen a day's high of 2,195.72. Turnover was estimated at some FFr3.4bn. In a review of the market, JP Morgan said that the recent underperformance of French equities has left the CAC undervalued in relation to the other major European centres; it saw good prospects for 1994, particularly in the consumer sector. The bank set an end-1994 target for the CAC-40 of 2,600. ATHENS rose 1.6 per cent in heavy trading with the general index finishing above the 900 point level for the first time since late August, closing 14.13 points higher at 913.15. The market was encouraged by the absence of taxes relating to equity investment when the government unveiled its new tax bill last Friday. TEL AVIV spurted late in the session on last-minute buying, described by dealers as a correction after losses last week. The Mishtanim index gained 3.57, or 1.5 per cent to 241.77 on relatively low turnover of Shk318m. WARSAW extended its latest bull run, the WIG index rising by 412.9, or 4.5 per cent to 9,585.3 in active turnover of 1,200bn zloty. Some brokers said that money frozen for the Bank Slaski offer could be returning to the market, following news that buyers would only get three shares each.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Vo Tran Chi, secretary of the Ho Chi Minh City </F> [HCMC] party committee, at the midterm party conference of the  Ho Chi Minh City party organization]    [Text] Dear veteran comrade revolutionaries, dear comrade  guests of the conference, dear comrade delegates: The midterm  party conference of the fifth Ho Chi Minh City party  organization has successfully ended today after four days of  urgent work in an atmosphere of revolutionary enthusiasm and a  high sense of duty.    In the light of the resolutions of the Seventh Party  Congress, the Mid-Term National Party Conference of the Seventh  Central Committee, and the fifth Ho Chi Minh City party  organization congress, our conference seriously evaluated the  development of the renovation process in the city and  straightforwardly pointed out achievements and progress as well  as shortcomings and weaknesses. The conference also derived  practical leadership and implementation experiences and most  importantly, set forth the orientations and revolutionary action  program for the city party organization to follow during the  remaining part of its term. At this conference, we unanimously  elected an additional number of comrades to the city party  organization standing committee. The election proceeded  according to set regulations and aimed at enhancing the strength  of the key agency of the city party organization so that it can  meet the urgent requirements of the renovation process in the  city.    Our conference had the honor to welcome Comrade Nguyen Van  Linh, adviser to the Central Committee, and Comrade Phan Van  Khai, member of the Political Bureau. The presence of the two  comrades and their views at this conference have given our  entire city more wisdom and strength to continue a journey which  is rife with difficulties and challenges but is also full of  great prospects.    Over the past several months, in preparation for this  conference, the city party organization at all levels, including  many veteran comrade revolutionaries affected by old age and  poor health, enthusiastically contributed many valuable  contributions to the documents to be presented to the  conference. Over the past few days, 263 comrades contributed  their suggestions at group discussions and 23 other comrades  expressed their views in the conference hall. Those views had  one thing in common, namely shedding more light on the issues  under discussion. Many of these views were very straightforward  and accurate. They demonstrated a very high sense of  responsibility and a positive attitude. As a result, they  clarified many important issues and enhanced the quality of the  political report of the conference.    It is very clear that this conference marks a major  democratic activity in the party and shows the concentrated  efforts of the city party organization to study and creatively  apply the Mid-Term National Party Conference Resolution to the  real situation in the city, which is a center having a serious  responsibility toward the area and the country in many respects.    The final result of this conference still depends on the  stringent test of real life situations when the resolutions of  the conference truly penetrate society and make their presence  felt. Nonetheless, the traditions of solidarity,  singlemindedness, strong will, and great determination make us  look toward the future with confidence and hope that with the  mind and hands of grassroots party organizations, the personal  efforts of our compatriots of all walks of life, the close  leadership of the Central Committee, and the harmonious  coordination and wholehearted assistance of other localities  throughout the country, our city will score even greater  achievements.    From the rostrum of this conference, on behalf of the Ho Chi  Minh City party organization, I would like to express our  sincere gratitude to the Central Committee for its leadership.  Our thanks also go to the comrade veteran revolutionaries,  party organization delegates, and compatriots of all walks of  life in the city for their concern and high sense of  responsibility. All those factors have given us more strength  to make this conference a success, thereby opening new prospects  for the city to move along a path full of both challenges and  promises.    Dear comrades, we face both opportunities and challenges.  Let us be determined to eliminate dangers, overcome challenges,  and grasp all opportunities to lead the renovation undertaking  forward in a vigorous and steady manner. That is the complete  scenario of the entire country and the city for us to see and  correctly define our tasks for the days ahead.    The undertaking to build "a wealthy people, a strong  country, and an equitable and civilized society" is a long-term  strategic objective that must be implemented step by step. Each  step must be progress compared with the previous one, or in  other words, the economy must develop every year, the standards  of material and cultural life next year must be higher than  those of this year, and especially, the political and social  conditions must be more stable and steadfast every year. These  factors are closely related, therefore they require a high level  of uniformity in coordination. Our economic policies are  closely related to social, cultural, and other policies, so our  party needs a comprehensive, dialectical, objective, and  scientific viewpoint while directing the implementation of these  policies.    In order to overcome hunger and poverty, to stand firm on  our  feet, and to reduce the danger of lagging further behind  neighboring countries economically, our party should, above all,  consolidate our combative determination, our political acumen,  and heighten our knowledge and ability to the level required by  our duties in the modern age, an age when science and technology  advance at lightning speed. To fulfill the leadership role, our  party should be equipped not only with experiences and knowledge  from working life, but also with experiences and achievements of  the world. The slogan "Learn, learn more, learn forever" by  Lenin should encourage us to never stop learning.    Our party is the core leader, the center for solidarity, and  the vanguard of the class and people. To be able to fulfill  these responsibilities, our party must be in a constant process  of renovation and rectification, ensure uniformity in politics  and ideology, endeavor to enhance morality and revolutionary  characteristics, provide for a clean and healthy life, and to  combat degradation, deviations, negativity, and illegal  activities resolutely. Above all, we must not lose our sense of  political vigilance because the hostile forces are hiding around  us and are looking for every way to get into our organizations.  We must not forget that among all kinds of disorientation, the  political one is the most dangerous.    We are opening our doors and expanding our relations and  cooperation with other countries to develop our economy. But we  must abide by the unchangeable principles of national  sovereignty and independence, of our historic traditions, the  morality and characteristics of our culture. To let ourselves  become alienated from our origin, or dependent on other  countries in any area or by any reason, is unacceptable. We  should not let short-term and partial benefits lead us to sway  ourselves away from the route that Uncle [Ho] has chosen, the  route achieved only by countless sacrifices of blood and bone by  generations of our people, because that will be a virulent error  that can be disastrous to our country.    The administration is the people's servant, and at the same  time, the tool for the people's authority. The development of  our country in the current situation is fast-changing,  diversified, and complicated. The situation requires the state  mechanism to be capable and assiduous. We must not allow any  sabotage activities to effect the peaceful life of our people.  We must be able to control every nook and cranny of our  society. We must heighten our abilities and acumen, attach  urgency to training and re-training tasks, and we should exclude  from the administrative mechanism those who have inadequate  ability and character.    As far as the current national construction cause is  concerned, as in the sacred wars of resistance for national  salvation in the past, the people constitute an endless source  of strength and a decisive factor of victory. To further  develop the potential, strength, and wisdom of the masses, party  organizations, administrative organs, departments, sectors,  agencies, and mass societies affiliated to the Vietnam  Fatherland Front must renovate their operating procedures a step  further, attach primary importance to efforts to improve the  people's living conditions, and regard the motivation campaign  for political awareness as a long-term goal. Our party comes  from the people and works untiringly to bring about happiness  for them. Therefore, party members and cadres must love,  believe, remain attached to, and direct the people as well as  look after their well-being, regarding these as the proof of  their vitality.    Dear comrades, the resolution of this midterm party  conference of the city party organization was formulated in the  light of the recent Mid-Term National Party Conference and the  fifth city party organization congress. It was a combination of  the wisdom, will, and aspirations of the entire party  organization and compatriots of all walks of life in the city.  Furthermore, it was adopted at a time when the city has entered  a period full of great challenges and also of bright prospects.    Because this resolution serves as an important action  program  for the entire city party organization and compatriots of all  walks of life in the days ahead, practical measures must be  worked out to promptly disseminate and concretize it so that it  can be applied to life and make its presence felt. Following  this conference, efforts must be made to improve our party  leadership and organizational skills a step further. It is  necessary for all party members to strongly develop their  vanguard role, militancy, determination, will, professionalism,  and wisdom. Only by so doing can we meet the growing demands of  the revolutionary undertaking in the city.    During his lifetime, Uncle Ho once said: "There must be 10  measures to carry out a single policy." Speaking at the fifth  city party organization congress, Comrade Nguyen Van Linh said:  "It is necessary to attach great importance to implementation  organization." For us, these instructions remain valuable. The  reason is that no matter how correct and clearsighted the  party's ideological concepts, lines, and resolutions may be,  they are totally meaningless and unable to generate strength if  they are not applied to real life situations. Then, in the  final analysis, our words are not matched with our deeds and as  such, we cannot prove whether our policies and resolutions are  correct. Therefore, it is very important for us to pay due  attention to practical activities and regard our willingness to  engage in practical activities as the peak of our creativeness.  Many theoreticians have said that the truth can be discovered  through realities and that only through realities that one can  prove and foster the truth. The party-initiated renovation  undertaking has been carried out for many years now. Yet, when  it first took off, it was based on the actual situations in our  city and country.    We are party members and residents of the city named after  Uncle Ho. Our city is well-known for its time-honored  traditions of glorious and unsubmissive struggle and for its  wisdom, dynamism, and work creativeness. It is certain that our  entire party organization and compatriots of all walks of life  in the city will achieve singlemindedness, take firm steps to  overcome difficulties and challenges, and make every effort to  score the best results in carrying out the tasks set forth by  the Seventh Party Congress and the fifth city party organization  congress, thereby making adequate preparations for marking the  20th anniversary of national unification and of the liberation  of the city and the south.    Prompted by that firm belief, I would like to declare the  midterm party conference of the fifth Ho Chi Minh City party  organization closed. May I avail myself of this opportunity to  wish our comrade veteran revolutionaries and comrade delegates  good health and many victories.</p>

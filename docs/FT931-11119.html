			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Contracts invited for attack helicopter THE MINISTRY of Defence yesterday opened the Pounds 1.5bn contest to supply the army with attack helicopters. Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, announced that companies were being invited to tender for the contract. The move had been expected last spring. Three UK companies - Westland, British Aerospace and GEC-Marconi - are pitted against each other, all promoting foreign helicopters. Westland is linked with McDonnell Douglas of the US. Its Apache helicopter is favoured by the army but may be thought expensive. Its rivals are the Cobra Venom, a tailor-made version of the AH-1 SuperCobra, in which GEC is associated with the US manufacturer Bell Helicopter, and the Tiger which is being developed by the Franco-German Eurocopter consortium. Eurocopter has joined with BAe to bid for the UK contract. An outside bid comes from the Kamov Ka-50 Werewolf, a single-seat seat Russian helicopter being promoted by Geneva-based Group Vector. However, experts consider that Russian manufacturers' lack of experience with the kind of in-service support required by British forces will weigh heavily against it. A contract had been expected in mid 1994 but this may now slip to 1995. The helicopter is due to enter service in 1998. About 100 of the helicopters are expected to be bought. But Mr Ian Andrews, an MoD official dealing with army programmes, told the Commons defence committee yesterday there had been no decision on numbers. It was 'by no means certain' the army would also require a dedicated armed reconnaissance helicopter.</p>

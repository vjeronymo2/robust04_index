			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Recession twists the knife in public spending cuts THE Treasury has pencilled in cuts of about Pounds 13bn in public spending in 1994-95 and 1995-96 as part of its programme unveiled on Wednesday to rein in rises in government borrowing. It has also sharply reduced its projections for inflation over the next few years, while leaving growth assumptions largely unchanged. Such news is likely to be welcomed by the financial markets, which have become concerned at the rapid rise in the public sector borrowing requirement. But the sting in the tail of this week's developments is that the PSBR may continue to rise at a greater rate than the Treasury projects because of the longer-than-expected recession, which is biting into government revenues. On the basis of estimates from Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, the likely shortfall in tax receipts will push the PSBR from an expected Pounds 31.7bn this financial year to Pounds 41.9bn in 1993-94. Even with the benefit of the spending cuts in 1994-95 and 1995-96, the borrowing requirement for those two years works out at Pounds 36bn and Pounds 33.4bn respectively, using Salomon's revenue projections. These figures are substantially above comparable estimates of Pounds 18.6bn and Pounds 12.5bn, based on the Treasury's most recently published figures for likely growth in government receipts. The table below illustrates how the Treasury's new regime for cutting increases in public spending will change the outlook for government programmes spread across areas such as health, transport and eduction. The main features are as follows: Total government spending - which includes the 'planning total' covering 90 per cent of spending, together with debt interest and self-financed spending by local councils - is earmarked to stay at Pounds 285bn in 1993-94, as under existing plans. Excluding proceeds from privatisation, that represents real, inflation-adjusted growth of about 4 per cent compared with 1992-93. Real growth in government spending will be pegged to 1 per cent in 1994-95 and 1995-96. On the Treasury's new assumption of 2.25 per cent inflation in these years (less than its Budget estimates of 3 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively) that boils down to growth in current prices in each year of 3.25 per cent. Comparing the new figures with previous Treasury projections made in the Budget, it appears the Treasury is contemplating a spending cut of Pounds 6.9bn in 1994-95 and one of Pounds 6.5bn in 1995-96. In each case, the reductions represent about 2 per cent of total spending. In real terms, the cuts will be slightly less, because of the effects of the lower inflation which the Treasury is projecting for these years. The planning total for 1993-94 will stay at previously agreed levels, at Pounds 244.5bn. In previous years large sums have been added to planning totals ahead of the coming financial year; in the past few months, departmental ministers have submitted bids to the Treasury asking for a total of about Pounds 14bn to be added to the planning total. By making it clear early in the public spending round that such bids will be ignored, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, hopes to reduce expectations substantially about higher state spending. From 1994-95, the Treasury's system for controlling spending will be based on a new concept - the 'control total'. This will be broadly the same as the planning total, but excludes unemployment-related social security spending. Out of the Pounds 65bn social security budget in 1991-92 (accounting for roughly a quarter of total government spending) Pounds 7.5bn was spent on unemployed people. With the rise of unemployment to 2.7m - a figure which could climb to 3m by the end of the year - the total will probably increase to about Pounds 9bn this year. Counting other social security programmes also linked to people without jobs, total unemployment-related social security spending over the next few years is expected to total Pounds 10bn-Pounds 15bn a year. According to the Treasury's new arithmetic, the control total will be allowed to rise by an average of 1.5 per cent a year in real terms during the next three years. It is pencilling in a notional increase of 2.8 per cent in 1993-94 (even though the new concept is being introduced only in the year afterwards) and growth of 0.75 per cent and 1 per cent in the two subsequent years. Working out which government programmes will be affected by the new regime is difficult because much depends on the pace of economic growth and how this affects unemployment. The Treasury estimated for this year that unemployment would average 2.4m over the 12 months; each additional 100,000 people out of work adds about Pounds 300m to social security spending. Because of the Pounds 13bn worth of cuts already programmed into the spending profile for 1994-95 and 1995-96 the haggling will have to start quickly among spending ministers as to which programmes are likely to suffer. One possibility is that if growth picks up relatively quickly over the next year, the government may relax the pressure on public spending slightly; on the other hand, should the recession drag on well into 1993, the squeeze may become even more sharp, if only because of the strains that would start to hit the PSBR.</p>

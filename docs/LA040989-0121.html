			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIVINE OR IMAGINED?;  </P> <P> VISIONS OF HOLINESS IN LUBBOCK  </P> <P> From the mists above and a hunger within, Theresa Werner thought she saw God.  He seemed so much like the paintings.  </P> <P> His hair was white and his eyes were fire. The rumble of his voice was at once  a comfort and a fright. "Convert your ways, for time shall erase all men's  memories," he said.  </P> <P> And that was just the once. Other days it was the Virgin Mary who spoke to her.  Our Lady lamented the sinners and warned of chastisements. In her diary,  Theresa wrote: Can this really be happening? I am so unsure.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Maybe They Were Delusion  </P> <P> It seemed crazy to repeat. Why would God and Mary talk to a country girl like  her, anyhow? Maybe the voices were just something that came naturally out of  herself or her prayers -- or maybe they were a delusion.  </P> <P> Yet they sounded so real. And, after all, why shouldn't the Lord reach out to  her, smoothing away the doubt? People want more than Bible-story miracles from  way back where and when. Why not here and why not now?  </P> <P> For Theresa, as for so many others, religion too often seemed a long passageway  without a door. She needed something to grip onto -- God actually beside her in  this life as he would be in the next.  </P> <P> And now she thought she might have been chosen for her very ordinariness. She  wanted to be sure and so she asked for signs. Once, a voice circled the kitchen  as she mopped the floor.  </P> <P> "Is that you, Mary?" she questioned. Then she lit candles and prayed for the  poor souls in purgatory. The room rapidly filled with the fragrance of roses.  Mary!  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sensing Mary's Presence  </P> <P> The voices were nothing to keep to herself. Theresa told her priest, Msgr. Joe  James, and he was not surprised. He and many others at St. John Neumann's  Catholic Church in Lubbock thought they were sensing Our Lady's presence.  </P> <P> Theresa, actually, was only one of three to receive messages. Mike Slate and  Mary Constancio got them, too. They wrote down each word during Monday night  rosary sessions in the chapel, like dictation from heaven.  </P> <P> What if this is all in my head? Theresa continued to fret. Msgr. James tried to  reassure her: Don't be so concerned about what's true and what's not. That will  be understood soon enough. By their fruits ye shall know them.  </P> <P> Yet during the last year the fruits have not been so easy to sort -- amid the  passions of the zealous and the disapproval of the bishop and the scrutiny of a  formal investigation by church experts.  </P> <P> News of the messages, like so many reports of visions, weeping statues and  heavenly images on someone's table top, became a spiritual magnet.  </P> <P> Busloads came to see and hear for themselves -- upward of 15,000 pilgrims on  one day last summer, for maybe the sky had finally opened with answers.  </P> <P> To the regulars at St. John's this all seemed a great puzzle. What the heck was  going on? Had Theresa and the others made some wondrous connection with the  divine -- or merely inhaled the desperate breath of their own imaginations?  </P> <P> It is those questions that have split a parish of 250 families. To this day the  chasm waits to be closed, here in the cotton-daubed plains of the Texas  Panhandle, all in the fullness of time.  </P> <P> Theresa Werner, a 34-year-old farmer's daughter, grew up in Nazareth, just up  the road from Tulia and Plainview and Lubbock. The town is mostly Catholic, a  rarity hereabouts where people are more inclined to be Baptists.  </P> <P> Theresa was always the bashful girl. Her long, auburn hair seemed combed to  hide her face. She liked to be alone, off in her room or up on her horse.  </P> <P> God was a powerful presence in her young life. One overcast day, she was  skinny-dipping in the swimming hole, even though she knew that wasn't right.  </P> <P> Suddenly, she sensed the Lord above, ready to zap her. The clouds seemed to  drop down and start to churn. Theresa scooted off in a fright until at last  reason took hold. Why run? Fast as you go, you can never get away.  </P> <P> God was at school, too. The nuns invoked his name. Pay attention or they got  out the paddles. They taught about virtue and sin, heaven and hell. It was  beautiful and scary and mysterious, all at the same time.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stories About Blessed Mother  </P> <P> Some of the most wonderful stories were about the Blessed Mother. Mary remained  a virgin even though she gave birth to Jesus. God spared her all sin, and in  death she was taken up body and soul into heaven.  </P> <P> Imagine the goodness! In her mercy, the Holy Virgin was really the mother of  everyone who wanted the light of her son. Pray to her, and she answered. She  was to be hailed: Mary, full of grace. ...  </P> <P> Sometimes she even appeared to people right before their eyes. Through the  ages, hundreds have thought they have seen her, roses at her feet and a white  glow above her head.  </P> <P> Of course, who can say for sure? It is a good thing the Catholic Church uses  its authority to judge the real from the unreal. Only a handful or so of the  visions have been approved. Shrines go up where they took place.  </P> <P> Millions each year visit Guadalupe in Mexico or Fatima in Portugal or Lourdes  in France. Theresa herself tingled at the thought of them, though the  fascination would pass. Religion can get to be a little confining.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Took Turn for the Wild  </P> <P> As Theresa grew older, she took a turn for the wild. Catholicism went up on a  shelf like a can of preserves, there for later if she had a craving. And that  would come on and off.  </P> <P> In 1981, she got married. Mark Werner was in Alaska, working the pipeline. He  put an ad in one of those weekly papers: "Man, 31, earns a good living. Loves a  good family life." They became pen pals before they became lovers.  </P> <P> Nowadays, here in Lubbock, Mark is a baker at a cafeteria, a not-so-hot job  with odd hours. There are strains. He and Theresa have a small son to care for  and not enough money to do it the way they would like.  </P> <P> The truth of it is, sometimes they seem headed for the Big D. Theresa heaved a  jar of cold cream at Mark's head, and it was a lucky thing he got a hand up.  </P> <P> Religion soothes some of that. In prayer, time seems to melt away. People so  often are adrift within themselves, and the aimless motion never stops until  they know God as their compass.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Holding Jesus' Heart'  </P> <P> One night, Theresa had a vision of the dove of the Lord descending in a shaft  of light. "Just then, Mark and my hands are on fire," she wrote in her diary.  "We are holding Jesus' heart now in our hands."  </P> <P> They could sense a sacred and eternal flame, like the splendor of salvation  reaching out from the dark.  </P> <P> Lubbock is a sprawl of homes and shopping plazas, more new than old, grown now  beyond the Loop Highway that once hemmed it in from the surrounding cotton  fields. Little is spectacular but the big sky above. Sunsets are a real show.  </P> <P> The population is 211,000. Although that number stays pretty much the same, the  residents come and go, stationed for a time at Reese Air Force Base or enrolled  at Texas Tech University.  </P> <P> There are seven Catholic churches here, and people pick the one they want for  proximity or just because they like it. Of these, St. John Neumann's is known  for its odd-looking building and its eccentric goings-on.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Partially Underground  </P> <P> The church is constructed partially underground, the contours of its lawn  sloping up to become both an outside wall and a roof. Much of the design --  like the goings-on -- is owed to Joe James, 57, the founding pastor.  </P> <P> He, too, is a small-town Texan, handy with machinery. That would be him making  the repairs on the wind generators, those big white whirligigs that hover above  the church.  </P> <P> The monsignor lives at two speeds, neutral and fourth gear, one day sullen and  morose and the next day all revved up. He won't be found with the other priests  at the Tuesday golf game.  </P> <P> Those others don't have much interesting to say, anyway. So many these days  have intellectualized religion. God would have to write them a personal letter  before they would even believe in the Resurrection.  </P> <P> That is not the way of Joe James. He is anything but a career-man church  bureaucrat. His whole life is a reach for the divine: the feel of it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Charismatic Spirituality  </P> <P> He embraces what is often called a charismatic spirituality, a more fervent  prayer life that in recent years has found a place in nearly every Christian  denomination.  </P> <P> God makes himself known to us in dreams and visions and passages of Scripture  that come to life. He bestows gifts of the Holy Spirit, or charisms, among them  the powers of prophecy and healing.  </P> <P> To James, Catholicism has a spontaneous, hand-clapping, Pentecostal flavor. And  at St. John's, a few of the flock lay their hands on the heads of the sick and  even speak in tongues.  </P> <P> This is not for every Catholic, and turnover is high. Some of that owes to  Lubbock's transient nature. Then, too, plenty have quit after run-ins with the  monsignor, who can be an angry and quarrelsome man.  </P> <P> He is tired of all those smorgasbord Catholics, picking and choosing. You need  to pray! And tithe! After all, religion demands as well as provides. And anyone  who does not understand that can leave.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Went on Rome Sabbatical  </P> <P> Oh, my, people have said often enough. If only there was a way to put out that  fire and just keep the warmth. Then early last year that appeared to happen.  Joe James went away on a sabbatical to Rome and came back changed.  </P> <P> During that time, he made two pilgrimages to the mountain hamlet of Medjugorje  in Yugoslavia. Hundreds of thousands have made the same difficult journey since  1981, when six children there began seeing the Holy Virgin.  </P> <P> The apparitions, as yet unapproved by the church, have been likened to miracles  like Lourdes -- part of the seamless continuity of Mary's message of peace and  faith and conversion.  </P> <P> Pilgrims sometimes describe the sky ablaze with shapes and colors: the sun in a  dance of spinning and pulsation. Msgr. James saw none of that, but he did  somehow come away with the certain knowledge that Mary is real.  </P> <P> That gave fresh meaning to the rosary prayers that had become trivial to him  with repetition. Here is truth, he told himself: The Holy Virgin delivers to  the open of heart an oasis of understanding.  </P> <P> And, not incidentally, he was cured of his hypoglycemia.  </P> <P> Mary is more than a mere statue! Joe James proclaimed when he got back in  February, 1988. She aches for us to give glory to her son. She wants us to fast  twice a week and pray three hours a day. Take this seriously.  </P> <P> Who knows how many did? At the Sunday night prayer meeting, only five came. Joe  James himself was tired and would have gone home but for an inner voice  reminding him: Where two or three are gathered in my name I am there.  </P> <P> His pride made him ashamed. He told the others of it, and they dropped to their  knees. It was then that the monsignor felt the presence of the Virgin, walking  in the room and placing her gentle hand on each person's shoulder.  </P> <P> Agnes Klein lit with it, too. She could not see Mary's face, "as it was more of  an outline." But she did sense Our Lady moving about -- a foot off the floor  and wrapped in white.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Smelled Roses in Chapel  </P> <P> The following Sunday, several people smelled roses in the chapel where there  were no flowers at all. Could it be perfume or air freshener? Everyone began to  sniff around.  </P> <P> "In my spirit I knew it was the presence of the Blessed Virgin," Richard Wood  concluded. And Msgr. James agreed. It was the same scent he had smelled beside  the Mountain of Apparitions in Medjugorje.  </P> <P> The next night, at the regular Monday rosary session, an unusual serenity  settled over Mary Constancio. In her mind's eye she saw the Virgin. Then she  heard the kindest of voices, melodic as song.  </P> <P> "Pray three rosaries a day and within six months you will see much conversion,"  Our Lady told her.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Awakened by Voice  </P> <P> And the night after, as Mary Constancio slept beside her husband, Henry, the  same tuneful voice awakened her:  </P> <P> "Go and tell your priest and go and tell your bishop that Mary your mother has  come to give a message: That they should spread her word . . . come and say the  rosary with me on Monday nights . . . "  </P> <P> Times before, Mary Constancio, 34, had felt the finger of God pointing the way  -- with a premonition or an answered prayer. But this was so much more vivid  and rapturous. She shook Henry.  </P> <P> "The Blessed Mother is speaking to me," she said.  </P> <P> "OK, OK, that's good," he answered and rolled over.  </P> <P> She got up and scribbled the Virgin's words in one of her son's composition  books. Then she began phoning friends in her prayer group, right then, in the  middle of the night. Yes, it is so. Our Lady is with us.  </P> <P> Praise God, Joe James said. And praise God people did. After all, this was Mary  Constancio, trustworthy mother and wife, a respiratory therapist at the  hospital and nobody's idea of a kook. She was hearing from the Holy Virgin!  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sparsely Attended  </P> <P> For years, the Monday rosary session had been sparsely attended. Three couples  had started it and they often were the only ones there -- the beads sliding  through their fingers, their prayers a rapid mumble.  </P> <P> But soon there were 30, then twice that, then more. They came to hear the  Virgin speak through her messenger, and each Monday there were beautiful new  words. "Blessed children of God . . . my heart is burning with love for you . .  . "  </P> <P> It was as if all the barriers were dissolving between here and eternity. So  much of what Our Lady asked of them were the same things Joe James had  commended all along. Fast, pray, tithe.  </P> <P> To the monsignor, this indeed seemed miraculous, though he advised caution,  too. Prophecies can be a trick of the human mind, just another sharp rock in  the winding cave of consciousness. This was a time for discernment, he said.  </P> <P> Fortunately, the necessary judgments became obvious to him rather soon. Things  lined up perfectly,  </P> <P> like the landing lights on a runway.  </P> <P> Time and again, all was provided for. When Mary Constancio had to leave one  Monday, Our Lady told her the message would simply go to someone else.  </P> <P> The Virgin chose that new woman in the parish, the reedy country girl who  already was saying God appeared to her. And lo, during the Joyful Mysteries of  the rosary, Theresa Werner's eyes grew huge and her hands quavered.  </P> <P> She began to write words that seared into her mind: "My dear children, it moves  me deeply to see the faithful gather . . . that I may bless them . . . "  </P> <P> At the same moment, the usually taciturn Mike Slate, 39, a retired Air Force  master sergeant and respected parishioner, began to tremble. He, too, was  hearing the same message.  </P> <P> From then on, instead of one messenger on Monday nights there were three. They  were the chosen ones of St. John Neumann's, and the things happening to them  startled and mystified the rest. What stories!  </P> <P> </P> <P> Out-of-Body Feelings  </P> <P> Did you hear? Mary and Mike were over at Theresa's apartment, praying at the  kitchen table. Suddenly, they felt as if they were leaving their bodies and  ascending straight up.  </P> <P> They passed the planets and the stars and then they entered heaven through a  lustrous gate, where the Lord Jesus was there to welcome them.  </P> <P> In May, the Monday rosary sessions were moved from the chapel into the church,  better to accommodate the hundreds and more.  </P> <P> Mary Constancio and Mike Slate went on receiving messages from Our Lady, the  words always carrying a loving, if distressed, tone: "For my heart becomes  sorrowful when I see . . . my children falling into the grips of Satan."  </P> <P> Theresa Werner, on the other hand, heard mostly from God, and he was invariably  angry and unamiable, his voice rising from the brimstone depths of reckoning to  threaten with strikings dead and tearings asunder.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Famine Shall Befall Thee'  </P> <P> "Afflictions I shall give unto thee . . . Famine shall befall thee; disease for  which there shall be no cure! Woe unto thee."  </P> <P> The Lord's messages seemed to favor the archaic phrasing of the King James  Bible, though the verses were sometimes a scramble, like free association.  </P> <P> Please make it stop, Theresa cried from time to time. She plugged her ears with  fingers, but the voice was more inside than out.  </P> <P> Earlene Steiert, Theresa's mom, came down from Nazareth, and it all made her  hair stand on end. She searched her daughter's eyes for something malign. But  no, the girl was not possessed. Where were these words coming from, then?  </P> <P> That question was the nub of it. St. John Neumann's is not a parish of the poor  and uneducated. There are plenty of professional types, including many from  Texas Tech. Opinions broke into thirds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Praying as Never Before  </P> <P> Some were out-and-out ecstatic: The church had been blessed. By the fruits ye  shall know. And no one could deny that people were praying as never before,  happy and reverent and infused with God.  </P> <P> Msgr. James was studying the messages and cataloguing their truths. He had a  color-code: orange for the Father, yellow for the Son, red for the Holy Spirit,  blue for the Virgin Mary, and green for the saints and angels.  </P> <P> The mounting body of prose had more substance than anything he'd read by  hot-shot theologians, he said. And he challenged: "If you think these are made  up, try writing one yourself at the same speed that's half as good."  </P> <P> Still, some people were unsure. Deacon Clark Cochrane, head of Texas Tech's  political science department, reminded the parish not to depend on miracles for  their faith. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believed.  </P> <P> Maybe the Virgin Mary was appearing in Lubbock -- and maybe not. And to many  who were uncertain the answer was not even essential. So what if the glitter is  false as long as the light is true. Who can deny the messages were good?  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Seems Loony Tunes'  </P> <P> Well, actually, plenty failed to find the merit. Have you people gone nuts?  they wanted to know. Nancy Richard, wife of a church deacon, was threatening to  quit. "This all just seems loony tunes to me," she said.  </P> <P> Paul Koch, an acolyte, remarked caustically to friends, "Too much is  coincidence. Something gets said in a sermon on Sunday and it shows up in a  message on Monday."  </P> <P> Skeptics, for the most part, thought the whole thing was something Joe James  had imported from Medjugorje.  </P> <P> Nothing deceitful, mind you. But the monsignor had the lyrical tongue of a  revivalist. If he was on fire with Our Lady, others naturally would be drawn to  the flame for its soul-comforting warmth.  </P> <P> The rosary sessions seemed to them like a seance, the voices born and reborn in  the messengers by the powers of suggestion -- from Joe James, from their own  upbringing, from their longing to know God.  </P> <P> Mary Constancio, after all, spoke of the monsignor as if he preached from some  elevated pulpit at the right hand of God. Mike Slate, the burly Vietnam vet,  was already a man prone to chatting with angels.  </P> <P> And that batty Theresa. Who knew what went on in her head? She acted as if she  had her own burning bush.  </P> <P> Enough was enough. Jo Wilmoth, of the parish council, took Joe James aside.  "Father, don't you think we ought to slow down a bit?" she said.  </P> <P> But he just aimed an index finger at her heart and demanded to know: "Are you  praying three  </P> <P> rosaries a day?"  </P> <P> By mid-summer, 2,000 and more crowded around St. John's every Monday night.  They came from as far as Dallas and Albuquerque and Mexico City -- and every  new face seemed further evidence of the ripening fruits of a miracle.  </P> <P> Several pilgrims claimed to be cured of aches and ailments. Those reports  fetched all the Texas newspapers. The Ft. Worth Star Telegram asked: "It  happened in Lourdes. Why not in Lubbock?"  </P> <P> To some, the publicity was a vindication of sorts, though it left the doubters  appalled. This thing had gotten so huge everything else was nudged aside. The  parish council had quit meeting. The newsletter had stopped.  </P> <P> And for what? For all people knew, the messages might be heresy. Yet dissent  was unwelcome. "The mood from Father James was, if you don't like what's going  on, get up and leave," said John Zak.  </P> <P> The anxiety spread. Other local priests were perturbed, too. Why isn't the Holy  Virgin appearing at our church? their parishioners wanted to know.  </P> <P> Msgr. Curtis Halfmann, over at St. Joseph's, explained to his flock that the  Virgin Mary was appearing in fertile imaginations, not corporeal presence.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lines for Confession  </P> <P> Yes, he knew the rosary messages had supposedly brought many back to God. There  were six lines at St. John's just for confession.  </P> <P> But whatever the good ends did not justify the means. "Think of a woman who  came to repentance after having an abortion," he said.  </P> <P> Some clergymen, increasingly upset, began calling the office of the Bishop of  Lubbock, Michael J. Sheehan. Do something! they pleaded.  </P> <P> The bishop stepped carefully amid the fissures. In a statement, he said he  could neither encourage nor discourage participation in the rosary sessions.  </P> <P> He did want to warn, however. The teaching is clear. Catholics are to imitate  the virtues of the Virgin and venerate her as they would the saints, but  worship is reserved for God.  </P> <P> What's more, while private revelations from Mary have sometimes been approved  by the church, "the tradition is never to presume supernatural causes." That  comes only after a lengthy investigation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Orders From Bishop  </P> <P> OK, let's get Rome moving on it, Joe James said. But the bishop had another  idea in mind and he delivered the news behind closed doors. Start playing this  thing real low-key, he said. Hear me? Understand?  </P> <P> This only confused the monsignor. Why put on the brakes now with the Blessed  Mother in our midst? Instead he was planning a shrine, an information center  and much more. He wouldn't -- he couldn't -- slow down. After all:  </P> <P> Theresa Werner had revealed to him this vision. Come Aug. 15, on the Feast of  the Assumption, some 20,000 people would come to Lubbock, and Our Lady would  appear above and the sun would throb like a heart in the sky.  </P> <P> Such a prospect was fever to him. There was so much to do. He went to City Hall  to alert officials. Twenty thousand people! they gasped. Where will we hold an  event as big as that?  </P> <P> Well, the monsignor answered, the Virgin Mary has been showing up at our place  so we might as well have it there.  </P> <P> The great numbers sprawled across the lawn, past the parking lot and into the  empty field across the street. They faced an outdoor altar set up on the flat  roof above the church office. State troopers managed the traffic.  </P> <P> Space in the concrete courtyard beside the fountain was reserved for the lame  in their walkers and wheelchairs. The sun stared down 98-degrees mean, and in  time the crowd bloomed with umbrellas for protection.  </P> <P> People had come from everywhere. Who knows how they heard? Some read of it in  the papers and said the event summoned a memory of a dream they'd had. They  milled about in expectation -- Catholics, fundamentalists, gypsies, name it.  </P> <P> When Theresa Werner arrived in late afternoon, there was a brief cascade of  rain. Praise the Lord. This was just as prophesied -- that the Virgin would  come through the clouds like an inconsolable storm yet also gentle as a dove.  </P> <P> Theresa had endured a difficult week. She had quarreled with Joe James about  whether to attend a retreat -- only later to remind herself that he was her  earthly superior and she kissed his feet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Asked to Give Blessing  </P> <P> A few days later, as the pilgrims began arriving, she felt uneasy when so many  wanted her blessings. She had never prayed over people before, but found she  was able, through the glory of God and his Son Jesus Christ.  </P> <P> Now was the feast day itself, and she met the other messengers to pray the  rosary. Mass started just before sunset, and only moments into the liturgy an  ancient power seemed to burst through the modern sky.  </P> <P> Clouds glided in from the south and when they reached across the descending  sun, people spied images out of the changing light. See her! some shouted. And  there was Mary, as promised, the handmaid of the Lord.  </P> <P> Celeste Lovette of Whiteface, Tex., glimpsed the Virgin in a full Nativity  scene, just like a Christmas card. Sunbeams shot out from the cradle of straw  as if they were rods of neon.  </P> <P> We have a God, Celeste whispered to herself. Then she watched the fluid  gleaming reshape into a new portrait, the Virgin smiling, her hands out.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Saw Serpent  </P> <P> Different people beheld different images, some Jesus and some an eagle and some  a serpent with a beady little eye. And some -- even a man devout as Joe James  -- saw nothing at all.  </P> <P> As people peered longer into the brightness, the sun seemed to spin and flip  and pulsate, lurching closer, then pulling back. All was spectacle.  </P> <P> Those with Polaroid cameras snapped away, and the photos rode the heat of the  crowd, hand to hand. They showed the outline of what could be an entrance  superimposed on the sun. It is the doorway to heaven, people declared.  </P> <P> Rosaries dipped in the fountain turned the bright golden of wedding bands, or  so dozens of witnesses claimed. Rose Marie Dama, of Waco, Tex., said hers  changed colors even as she held it in her hands.  </P> <P> Celeste Benoist of Albuquerque swore the water gave life to the legs of her  infant boy, struck by cerebral palsy. Josie Todd of Lubbock escaped the pain in  her back that had kept her from work for 17 years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Moon Had Bright Hues  </P> <P> When the moon rose, it too throbbed in bright hues. The glow bathed the crowd  as people responded to the beseeches of the Mass. Let us proclaim the mystery  of our faith.  </P> <P> In the darkness, a lady in white moved through the multitude. Her head was  hidden under a hood, and she discreetly handed out gifts of $100 bills. No one  knew who she was, and she seemed to vanish as suddenly as she came.  </P> <P> "Please take this," she told polio victim Elena Ramos, of Abernathy, Tex.,  giving her a booklet of Bible verses with the money folded inside.  </P> <P> Among the throng was at least one other mysterious woman. She emerged for just  an instant and embraced Theresa Werner. "I have a message from the Lord," she  said. "The work is finished."  </P> <P> And that was how Theresa learned her time as an instrument for God's divine  purposes on earth was over.  </P> <P> Finally, she could rest.  </P></p>

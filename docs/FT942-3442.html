			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Greece confident over blockade Greece yesterday left a closed hearing at the European Court of Justice believing it had successfully defended its trade blockade of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. Foreign ministry official Jannos Kranidiotis, who headed a team of five Greek lawyers trying to stop an emergency court ruling forcing Athens to lift the embargo, said the European Commission 'did not bring any new elements' to the three-hour hearing. The EU executive had 'failed to prove irreparable damage' was being done to the European Union as a result of the sanctions on Skopje, Mr Kranidiotis said. The Commission has to show irreparable damage if it is to get a ruling against the embargo. Greece banned trade with Macedonia and the use of its Thessaloniki port to pressure it into changing its flag and constitution, which Athens says implies territorial ambitions on Greece's own region of the same name. Mr Hans van den Broek, EU External Political Relations Commissioner, said it was now up to the court to decide. It is not expected to rule for two weeks.</p>

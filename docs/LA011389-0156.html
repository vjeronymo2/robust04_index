			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> ARMENIAN QUAKE SURVIVOR'S STORY MAY BE A HOAX, SOVIET MEDIA ADMIT  </P> <P> Both the Soviet government newspaper Izvestia and Tass press agency cast doubts  today on reports that six people had been found buried alive in the devastated  city of Leninakan 35 days after the Armenian earthquake.  </P> <P> Soviet television showed an interview Thursday night with 50-year-old  electrician Aikaz Akopyan who, speaking from his hospital bed, told journalists  that he and five companions had been pulled out of an apartment block basement  the previous day.  </P> <P> Apart from Akopyan, however, none of the other "survivors" had been traced,  Izvestia said, despite inquiries at all hospitals between Leninakan and the  Armenian capital, Yerevan.  </P> <P> "We journalists find ourselves in a difficult situation. The experience of past  days has taught us that there is a great, a very great, wish for a miracle,"  Izvestia said.  </P> <P> It referred to reports last week that 17 people had been found alive 25 days  after the disaster in the town of Spitak, which was flattened by the Dec. 7  earthquake. Those reports were later denied by relief workers and local  officials.  </P> <P> The authors of the article said they visited the Leninakan street where the  apartment block was located on the same day the six were said to have been  pulled out.  </P> <P> "It was two in the afternoon, and the six were found in the morning. Where had  they gone? Surely someone would have noticed them? Who saved them, after all?"  they asked, adding that local officials knew nothing about the alleged  incident.  </P> <P> Akopyan, heavily bearded and apparently unable to lift his head from the  pillow, gave a graphic account of his experience. He related how he and his  five alleged companions had survived by eating salted food and bottled fruit  stored in the basement.  </P> <P> "It's difficult to imagine that someone in such a severe state would be capable  of lying," Izvestia said. It quoted a doctor as saying that the man had clearly  suffered a severe shock to his nervous system, although his memory appeared  clear.  </P> <P> The doctor said Akopyan knew how he had come to be in the basement and talked  about his work and his family, still apparently unaware that his wife and  children had been killed in the earthquake.  </P> <P> Tass said it had based its story of the "Leninakan miracle" on a report by the  Armenian news agency Armenpress. Journalists at Armenpress said they were  checking the authenticity of the report and trying to find the missing five  men.  </P> <P> Tass said the story had been corroborated by eyewitness accounts but did not  identify the eyewitnesses. It said it was understandable that people wanted to  believe in the miracle.  </P> <P> "Regrettably, we are unable so far to confirm with full certainty the  authenticity of the reports made by our Armenian colleagues about the Leninakan  miracle. Nor can we deny them."  </P></p>

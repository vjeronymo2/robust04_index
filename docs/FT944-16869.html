			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Inflation worries cause 6 per cent fall in rouble Continued fears about inflation and the state of public finances yesterday caused the Russian rouble to fall by 6 per cent, writes Philip Gawith. The currency is not fully convertible, and hence is not traded on international foreign exchanges. It closed on Moscow's Interbank Currency Exchange at Rs3,081 from Rs2,896 on Friday. Trading elsewhere was very quiet, with Japanese markets closed overnight, and US markets closed for the Columbus day holiday. There was little evidence of the dollar gaining ground from tensions in the Gulf. It closed in London at Y100.63, from Y100.225, and at DM1.55 from DM1.5411. Sterling lost half a cent against the dollar, to close at Dollars 1.5852, from Dollars 1.5905. It gained a similar margin against the D-Mark, finishing at DM2.4569 from DM2.4511. A bright spot on the markets was the performance of short sterling futures which continued their recent recovery. The March 1995 contract closed at 92.63, 45 basis points higher than where it was a week ago. In the UK money markets the Bank of England provided Pounds 243m liquidity, compared to a Pounds 550m shortage. The D-Mark was mixed in Europe, with two of the latest opinion polls predicting a hung parliament, and one a victory for Chancellor Kohl, in Sunday's national elections. While the immediate cause of the recent slide in the rouble was the authorities' decision to stop intervening in the market, this comes against the backdrop of high levels of inflation. Other factors include concerns about the health of President Boris Yeltsin, and the level of foreign reserves. Yesterday Mr Vyacheslav Solovov, deputy central bank chairman, blamed the rouble's fall on speculation and said the bank would not use its currency reserves. 'We do not want to help market speculators,' he told Reuters. Some observers believe interest rates are too low, but Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, central bank chairman, has ruled out any immediate rise in rates. In Europe the Finnish markka maintained its recent strength ahead of Sunday's referendum on joining the European Union. It closed at FM3.072 against the D-Mark, from FM3.07, after earlier rising to FM3.06. Analysts said the markka had weakened after firm selling pressure had driven the Swedish krona down earlier in the day. It fell to SKr4.7830 against the D-Mark, from SKR4.76, before recovering to close at SKr4.770. Mr Keld Holm, international economist at Lehman brothers, said the other factor supporting the markka, other than optimism over the EU, was the strong export performance. He said people were beginning to realise that Finland was very well placed to benefit from any growth in Russia. The markka has appreciated from FM3.32 at the beginning of June to its current level. After initially showing some inclination to buy the dollar on tensions in the Gulf, the market now appears to be reconsidering. Mr Peter Luxton, international economist at MMS, said the lesson of the Gulf War in 1991 was that while it provided some short term support for the dollar, it had no longer term effect. The longer term trend was determined by the state of the US economy. In Brazil, the central bank bought dollars at RDollars 0.84. This was the second time, since the launch of the real three months ago, that the central bank has acted to curb its rise. The real has risen, from parity against the dollar, on the back of dollar weakness, and pre-election optimism about a victory for Mr Fernando Cardoso. Exporters are now voicing disquiet, and the central bank is understood to want to curb further appreciation. The uncertain outlook for currencies is reflected in a Chief Dealer survey published by the New York based Foreign Exchange letter. The survey, of 38 chief dealers, found that 26 per cent expect the dollar to fall below Y95 in the next three months, while 34 per cent saw it above Y105. The Dollars /DM picture is similarly confused, with 37 per cent of respondents expecting to see the dollar below DM1.50, and 39 per cent expecting to see it above DM1.60. Sterling's recent strength is expected to continue, with 55 per cent seeing it above Dollars 1.55.</p>

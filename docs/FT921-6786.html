			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Appointments: Utilising expertise This week's appointment of William Alexander as managing director of Thames Water Utilities will enable Mike Hoffman, group chief executive of Thames Water, to concentrate more on developing the non-utility businesses of the group. Hoffman previously combined both roles. Expansion away from the core businesses of water supply and sewage disposal, which are heavily regulated, has been slow but steady at Thames, the biggest of the 10 former regional water authorities privatised over two years ago. It now accounts for annual turnover of over Pounds 250m. Alexander, 45, was formerly technical director of the utilities. He joined Thames in 1989 from British Coal where he was head of engineering. The technical division is responsible for Thames Water's investment programme of Pounds 400m a year as well as research and development and laboratories. Two group appointments have also been announced at Thames. Bill Harper, deputy chairman of the utilities company, has been made group director, corporate activities. He will have special responsibility for the environment and relations at corporate level. Richard Marshall becomes group personnel director. ***** Richard Abraham, formerly finance director of AMI Healthcare, has been appointed finance director of BUPA HEALTH SERVICES. ***** Philip Wroughton, chairman of CT Bowring, has been appointed chairman of MARSH &amp; McLENNAN Inc, the insurance broking arm of Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies. ***** John Dunsmore has been appointed to the board of MARSTON, THOMPSON &amp; EVERSHED; before joining the company he was brewing analyst at County NatWest Wood Mackenzie. ***** Michael Pitt-Payne, formerly financial director and company secretary of Cape Building Products, is promoted to company secretary of CAPE, on the retirement of John Sparkes. ***** David Searles, finance director of Tioxide, has been appointed a director of ICI SPECIALITIES. ***** Christopher Shaw, formerly md of British Syphon, is appointed group md of AYNSLEY; he takes over from Bill Daymond who retires at the end of March. ***** Michael Healy is appointed commercial director in charge of UK and international sales and marketing operations for PARCELFORCE; he moves from Federal Express. ***** Bryan Thompson, formerly finance and planning director, British Alcan Primary and Recycling division, has been appointed financial director of VICKERS Defence Systems division.</p>

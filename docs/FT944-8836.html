			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Kenyan president pledges to stamp out corruption: Measures aim to open way for aid and investment President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya yesterday pledged to rid his country of the corruption that has in recent years been a significant factor in blocking new aid and investment to his country. Speaking at a London investment conference on Kenya, the president said liberalisation measures introduced by his government in the past 18 months would contribute to the reduction of corruption in Kenya. 'Import and investment licensing procedures and foreign exchange controls which have now been abolished were some of the avenues for corrupt practices,' he said. The president pointed to the country's anti-corruption unit as evidence of his government's determination, and urged business people to refrain from bribing government officials or officers of rival companies. 'I would not be making this appeal if I did not think that the culture of bribery and kickbacks had been major sources of corruption,' he said. The conference is Kenya's first attempt in many years to attract foreign direct investment and the president emphasised that the recent package of reforms designed to help win investment would not be rolled back. Long-term investors were the country's priority. Mr Moi acknowledged that the downturn in the Kenyan economy had led to a decline in investment in the country's infrastructure, once considered among Africa's best, and indicated that the private sector would be invited to participate in schemes such as road-building. The government had also decided to invite the private sector to develop 50 per cent of the country's future thermal and geothermal electricity generation, in which the government planned to invest more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 636m) over the next five years. Political reforms of the past three years, including the introduction of a multi-party system, were also addressed, and the president said he and his party were committed to the new system. But he warned: 'The imposition of foreign political models without careful consideration could easily create upheavals in the African continent.' Turning to the international aid community ahead of next month's Paris Club meeting of aid donors, Mr Moi said: 'We have done all they asked us to do. The ball is now in their court.' Included in the presidential delegation was Mr Nicholas Biwott, former energy minister and confidant of Mr Moi. Mr Biwott, who developed a substantial business empire in Kenya, was sacked in 1991 but has since resumed his place in the group of presidential advisers. Another prominent Kenyan businessman, Mr Ketan Somaia, was also in the audience. Kenya's shilling plunged by 17.9 per cent against the US dollar yesterday in panic buying because of increased demand by exporters, commercial bank officials told Reuters. They said commercial banks quoted the dollar at a mean rate of 48.75 shillings compared with an average 41.35 shillings on Wednesday.</p>

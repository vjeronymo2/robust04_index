			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Art' that is a deception Sir, I disagree with Nigel Andrews' assessment ('Feelgood movies give way to darker themes', December 30) of Jane Campion's film, The Piano, as a 'feminist' film. I advise women not to see it. A film which dresses up voyeurism with costumes, clever camera work and nice music and presents it as 'art' on the back of Victorian modesty is a deception. A nasty amputation scene which offends feminine feelings is horror tactics dressed up as meaning. I walked out of it. This is the same macho nonsense but more insidious because it is good to look at and to listen to, most of the time. Alison Bailey, 68 Chelsea Gardens, Chelsea Bridge Road, London SW1</p>

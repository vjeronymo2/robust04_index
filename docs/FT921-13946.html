			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Money Markets: Rates edge higher UK money market interest rates were pushed higher again yesterday with the market continuing to experience an overall shortage of funds, writes Simon London. The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 2bn for the day, around half of which resulted from maturing treasury bills and the expiry of earlier money market assistance. In early assistance the Bank injected a chunky Pounds 997m. This comprised the outright purchase of band 1 treasury and bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent, band 2 bank bills at 10 3/16 per cent and band 4 bank bills at 10 1/8 per cent. In addition, the Bank purchased Pounds 115m for resale to the market on February 3 at 10 7/16 per cent - the same repurchase terms as on Thursday. A further Pounds 527m was injected in the late morning, comprising the purchase of further band 1, 2 and 4 bills and a Pounds 135m repurchase paper on the same terms. In the afternoon session, Pounds 373m was injected through the purchase of band 1,2,3 and 4 bills. Late assistance totalled Pounds 150m, bring the injection for the day to Pounds 2.05bn. This was enough to keep the lid on overnight money rates, following wild fluctuations which saw unsecured overnight money trade up to 30 per cent on Thursday. However, overnight funds still closed at 11 - 10 3/4 per cent, against 10 3/4 -  3/4 per cent on Thursday. The March short sterling contract on the London International Financial Futures Exchange traded up to 89.72 during the day, from a close of 89.69 on Thursday, but fell back through the afternoon session to close at 89.70. In Frankfurt, money market interest rates eased for the second day running. Call money traded mostly at around 9.40/50 per cent, from 9.45/55 per cent on Thursday and 9.55/60 seen earlier in the week. Analysts noted that the anticipated liquidity squeeze ahead of this months deadline for taxation payments had failed to materialise. In Tokyo, the Bank of Japan was content to see rates edge higher, offering no immediate assistance in the face of a Y140bn liquidity shortage. Call money traded up to 5 5/8 per cent, up  3/32 of a point from Thursday. Rates could press higher still on Monday. A Y1,100bn shortage is forecast, but the Bank of Japan will sell the same amount of bills, draining funds from the market.</p>

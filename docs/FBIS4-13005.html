			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Satellite Dish"] </F>   [Text] The use of satellite dishes is among the hottest  subjects being debated in political and cultural circles of this  country today.    Satellite receivers went up on rooftops of Tehran and other  big cities with amazing speed in the last two years. The use of  these dishes, in and of itself, does not constitute a  reprehensible act, and can even be considered useful in  disseminating news and information on a global level. The  disturbing aspect of this mass communications device, however,  is that it is being used by the West to gradually and subtly  dilute non-Western cultures and change the prevailing social,  political, and cultural standards of the Third World.    The controversy is not confined only to Western and  non-Western countries. Europe is up in arms against American  films and television programs that have saturated the European  screens and air waves. France is considering putting a limit on  showing U.S.-made films and programs on French television,  following the failure of American distributors to voluntarily  cut down their imports to Europe.    The Islamic Republic is justifiably concerned with the  possible negative effects of this phenomenon and is currently  debating the best way to counter it. Other Islamic countries,  including Saudi Arabia and Malaysia, have already decided to ban  satellite dishes. But the cultural invasion problem will not be  resolved by the physical removal of satellite receivers, because  smaller and more powerful satellite antennae are being built and  it would be next to impossible to detect them short of searching  every household in the country.    Officials charged with the task of finding the solution to  this problem should first find out when the new and undetectable  satellite dishes will reach our markets. If it takes more than  three or four years, then passing legislation banning the device  may work for at least a few years in keeping unwanted programs  from entering our households. But if it turns out that the  arrival of small antennae in our market is only a matter of a  few months, then the physical removal of the existing dishes  will serve only to destabilize the society and will contribute  to a general feeling of uncertainty among the law abiding  citizens of the Islamic Republic.    The long-term and logical way to combat cultural invasion is  to improve domestic production of films and radio and television  programs, thereby removing the incentive to watch Western  products. After successfully averting the West's cultural  invasion through producing internationally marketable programs,  we can export our religious values, culture, and art through the  same medium of communication to the rest of the world.    The natural target of Western media moguls who own these  global networks are the younger generations of the Third World  population. Iran should invest in this same generation by  providing them with a proper education which will emphasize the  richness and beauty of our culture and Islamic heritage that  throughout our history has acted as an antidote to poisonous  foreign cultural invasions.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: NZ insurer in Australian deal TOWER Corporation, which claims to be the largest mutual insurance group in New Zealand, is acquiring the Australian operations of the UK's Friends Provident in an attempt to step up its presence in the Australian market. No price was disclosed for the deal. However, Friends Provident Australia, based in Sydney, has around ADollars 1bn (USDollars 661m) in assets and some 100,000 policyholders. Annual premium income is put at approximately ADollars 120m to ADollars 130m. The deal significantly expands Tower's Australian operations, based in Melbourne. Mr James Boonzair, Tower's managing director, said the combined Australian businesses would have about 140,000 policyholders, and assets of ADollars 1.3bn. Tower Corporation, he added, had been seeking 'critical mass' in Australia, and the merger should make a 'viable Australian company'. Friends Provident is owned by Eureko, the European financial services group formed by four insurance businesses based in Scandinavia, the Netherlands and the UK. Eureko said yesterday that Friends' Australian arm needed to be larger, and required more local support than Eureko wished to provide. The Amsterdam-based partnership added that, although the bulk of its operations are based in Europe, there were no plans to dispose of the two North American businesses - a life company based in Vancouver, and a medical insurance operation in Indiana.</p>

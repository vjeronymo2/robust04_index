			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent George Shahin from the Phalangist </F> Headquarters in al-Sayfi on 21 March--recorded]    [Text] Phalangist Party leader Dr. George Sa'adah said that  the Phalangist Party still awaits the final word from the  judiciary on the recent bombings, including the one at the  Phalangist Party headquarters in al-Sayfi. We have not accused  or exonerated anyone, he said. We have stressed, and still do,  our absolute confidence in the judiciary and the security and  military organs, foremost the Lebanese Army. Dr. Sa'adah called  for an end to posturing, saying that such practices have been  condemned by everyone. The Phalangist Party leader was speaking  at an expanded meeting of the party's Political Bureau and  Central Council, which met at 1700 today at the party's  headquarters in al-Sayfi.    Dr. Sa'adah said: I have mixed feelings about what we heard  and read in the newspapers concerning the current investigations  in recent crimes such as the bombings at the Phalangist  headquarters and the Sayyidat al-Najat Church. My feelings are  a combination of satisfaction and pain.    My satisfaction is because the current investigation into  these crimes has produced tangible results and promises to  uncover the perpetrators, planners, and instigators of these  crimes. The bombings did not only cause destruction and claim  the lives of dear friends and devout worshipers but were also  designed to rattle the foundation of our country and reduce it  to a state of helplessness once more, Sa'adah announced.    Slogans propagating self-security and bemoaning oppression  against one section of the Lebanese people were raised following  these bombings, but such slogans were greeted with nothing but  disgust in our community, Sa'adah stated.    Reports that the perpetrators of these crimes will be  brought  to justice are a cause for delight. We are pleased that this  criminal trend will end and that our confidence in the state  institutions, particularly the security and military, will  remain unshaken, Sa'adah declared.    The Phalangist leader added: But there is pain as well,  because we fear that a sense of humiliation may grip our  community once the individuals and groups involved in these  crimes are named.    We, in the Phalangist Party, have never lost faith in our  beliefs. We have never accused or exonerated anyone and we are  waiting for the judiciary to issue its final word. We have  always had full confidence in the judiciary and the security and  military institutions in this country, particularly the Lebanese  Army. Our unshifting position has always been that the Army and  judiciary should be allowed to carry out their full task without  any hindrance at this crucial phase of the country's life, the  Phalangist leader said.    Dr. Sa'adah added: On my own behalf and yours, we address a  word of respect and admiration to the security institutions,  foremost the Lebanese Army, for proceeding, despite accusations  leveled to distract them from their task, to unearth all the  facts and expose them to the public eye.    Our policy has always been rational. With logic and reason,  we have assessed the matters and files laid before us. We  issued repeated calls for calm dialogue. We even called for a  debate to formulate an effective national policy, a call that  has been welcomed by all except those who were only interested  in fomenting discontent. We never complained of frustration or  backed such complaints. We oppose attempts to manipulate our  youth and community. We believe that the Lebanese no longer  condone any disruptive and suicidal schemes, Sa'adah declared.    The Phalangist Party leader opened the meeting with  congratulations to Lebanese mothers who, he said, deserve to  live in dignity, stability, and happiness. He also  congratulated, on his behalf and that of all the Phalangists,  the elected chairman of the Higher Islamic Shiite Council,  Shaykh Muhammad Shams-al-Din, and his two deputies. Sa'adah  praised Shams-al-Din's political judgment and patriotism.    Dr. Sa'adah also congratulated the Phalangist Party branches  in Dhuq Musbih and Kasrawan-al-Futuh on the rally they organized  last Saturday and the al-Batrun branch on the reception it  organized yesterday to mark Mar Yusuf day.    Finally, the Phalangist Party leader announced that  reconstruction work at the Phalangist headquarters is underway.  He thanked all those who have so far participated in this  effort, but said that more donations will be needed to finance  this effort.    The Phalangist Political Bureau will hold its regular weekly  meeting at 1900 today, with various political and party issues  on its agenda.</p>

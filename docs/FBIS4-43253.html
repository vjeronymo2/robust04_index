			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Northern League leader Umberto Bossi by </F> Guido Passalacqua; place and date not given: "Bossi Submits:  We Will Be Loyal" -- first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA  introduction]    [Text] Milan -- He spent the whole night in his office  talking with Milan's Mayor Formentini and with his ministers --  Pagliarini, Gnutti, and Speroni. At 1800 hours he gave a press  conference to reply to Berlusconi and to present the League with  a line to follow after its election defeat. It can all be  summed up in one word, the one that Berlusconi has been using  for some time -- "loyalty," which he repeated six times to  journalists. Loyalty to the government, albeit together with a  promise that there will always be "a trial of strength" on  "matters of principle" -- legislation on television and  monopolies. This came together with an announcement that the  establishment of a separatist League faction will be made  official [at a League rally] in Pontida.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Is this a return to your origins?    [Bossi] The League was born separatist, but we did not want  to split the country. Over half the party is federalist, and  this position is a strategic one within the government.  However, there is a need for a separatist faction, and the time  has come to establish a differentiation.    [LA REPUBBLICA] This decision could lead to a loss of  support  from the more moderate voters.    [Bossi] I have no idea how strong the separatist faction  could be, but the path to be pursued is not dissimilar to that  formerly traveled by the PCI [Italian Communist Party] in order  to attract moderates and Communist Renewal, the angry votes.  The League must follow this path: There is a moderate vote and  a separatist vote; and we must work along separate channels.    [LA REPUBBLICA] How do you judge the election result?    [Bossi] It reflects the country's internal situation. There  is a difficulty in terms of governability, and the vote went in  that direction, rewarding Forza Italia. We opted to stand alone  in order to clarify our position. There are two tendencies  within the government -- one, neoliberal: the League; the  other, die-hard capitalist: Forza Italia and the AN [National  Alliance]. These two forces cannot be superimposed.    [LA REPUBBLICA] You wanted a clarification but you lost.    [Bossi] We chose the European elections, which have less  impact than the general elections, to make it clear that we are  not subordinate, but also to indicate to the country that it  must not regard as fights what are in fact discussions between  conservative forces and a force that one could define as  neoliberal, namely, the League.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Your allies accuse you of disloyalty.    [Bossi] I am loyal to the government. There could be no  other government.    [LAS REPUBBLICA] For the first time in its history, the  League has suffered a heavy defeat.    [Bossi] The loss was expected. Of course, some percentages  were not forecast. But this was the price that we had to pay  after the establishment of the Freedom Alliance.    [LA REPUBBLICA] A price?    [Bossi] People saw Berlusconi as the cat and us as the  mouse.  If we had not made ourselves visible, this game would have  caused the League to merge inevitably with Forza Italia.    [LA REPUBBLICA] But you have waged guerrilla warfare within  the government.    [Bossi] I repeat: We have the utmost loyalty to this  government.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Why did Berlusconi win?    [Bossi] It is no coincidence that someone who is involved  with supermarkets won support. Berlusconi won because he was  best at selling fantasies and hopes.    [LA REPUBBLICA] He won, you lost. What do you have to say to  him now?    [Bossi] Good luck.    [LA REPUBBLICA] You have 180 members of parliament, but only  a little more than 6 percent -- an inconsistency which some  people would like to reduce.    [Bossi] What counts is the 180 members of parliament, not  idle talk.    [LA REPUBBLICA] You talk about loyalty to the government,  but  also about trials of strength. What if, let us imagine, the  trial of strength over antitrust legislation were to result in a  rupture?    [Bossi] Perfect: Then the country will know who is to blame;  it will know that Berlusconi, with all his television channels,  does not want to change anything.    [LA REPUBBLICA] You talk about loyalty to the government,  but  you seem to be looking to the Left too.    [Bossi] We are advocates of economic liberalism; the PDS  [Democratic Party of the Left] leaders could be so too, but the  grassroots are marxists.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you think there could be early elections?    [Bossi] The country should fear them, because of the chaos  they would cause. But the League is not afraid of them: When  they come, we will be there. But I do not think that Berlusconi  wants them. His strength lies in guaranteeing governability.    [LA REPUBBLICA] There are signs of dissent within the  League.  [Interior Minister] Maroni is proposing an organizational union  with Forza Italia and the AN. [Milan Mayor] Formentini says  that there must be an end to the attacks on the government.  What is going on?    [Bossi] I fear that an organizational union would be  inconsistent with the League's values: It would be a mess.  Organizational integration would inevitably also entail  political integration.    [LA REPUBBLICA] [PDS Secretary] Occhetto has resigned after  the defeat. Have you considered doing so?    [Bossi] No, what happened was forecast.</p>

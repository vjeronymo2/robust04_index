Li Peng will inspect the Daya Bay  Development Zone inside Huizhou City and inquire about the  suspended project of Xiongmao [Panda] Car City.    The sources yesterday said that during his stay in Shenzhen,  Li Peng inspected many places including the Guangzhou-Shenzhen  Express Highway which has been opened to traffic and the  Huanggang Border Pass.    Yesterday morning, Huizhou Mayor Li Jinwei and other local  officials particularly went to Shenzhen to meet Li Peng and his  entourage. Li Peng continued his inspection tour in the company  of Xie Fei, secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee,  Zhu Senlin, governor of the province, and Huizhou Mayor Li  Jinwei.    The sources said that during his visit to Huizhou, Li Peng  will listen to local leaders' work reports and will once again  inspect the Daya Bay Development Zone which is under  construction.    The Daya Bay Development Zone is one of the major  construction projects to which the central authorities attach  importance. It includes the the infrastructural project of  Huizhou Harbor, a large deepwater harbor, and two major  industrial projects--Nanhai Petrochemical and Xiongmao Motors.  The former is a large-scale joint venture launched by Nanhai  Petroleum Corporation with China Merchant's Steamboat Navigation  Company and the Shell Oil Company; and the latter is an  investment project launched by South Korea's Tongyi [4827 0001]  Group. The plants were built but the project was suspended  because of a dispute over the proportion of cars to be exported.  Some plants were rented to China's No 2 Motors as assembly  workshops.    Huizhou City and the Daya Bay Development Zone are both key  areas for development in Guangdong. Guangdong once announced  that: "Development in the 1980's was focused on Shenzhen and  development in the 1990's will be focused on Huizhou." Jiang  Zemin, Li Peng, Yang Shangkun, Wan Li, and Zou Jiahua in turn  have previously inspected Huizhou.    According to the sources, during his inspection of Huizhou,  it is likely that Li Peng will make a final decision on the  future of Xiongmao Motors.    On the other hand, China's official XINHUA News Agency  yesterday, for the first time, revealed Li Peng's recent  inspection of Zhuhai by issuing a special feature about Li  Peng's visit to Juren [Giant] Enterprise Group, a high-tech  enterprise run by unofficial institutions.</p>

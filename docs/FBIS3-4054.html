In the meantime, a strict  monitoring and examination network system has been set up.    Yang Qi, who is in charge of the Yunnan Provincial AIDS  Prevention and Control Office, said: In the past few years,  Yunnan has done a great deal of work in organizing and managing  the prevention and control of AIDS, monitoring epidemic  diseases, making laws and regulations, giving publicity to and  carrying out education, and in training, researching, and  gaining international cooperation. A monitoring and examination  network, which is composed of one monitoring and examination  center, 10 preliminary screening laboratories, and 34 monitoring  points, plays an exceedingly important role in the prevention  and control of AIDS.    Yang Qi said that the monitoring of 147,330 highly  susceptible people in Yunnan shows that HIV-infected persons are  still mainly concentrated in the western border area of Yunnan.  As of the end of 1993, there were 977 HIV-infected persons, of  whom 102 were foreigners. Of these 977 persons, 17 were  diagnosed as AIDS sufferers, and nine have already died.    Yang Qi said: Yunnan keeps files on every HIV-infected  person and every AIDS patient. Moreover, it follows up on them  with medical treatment and continuously strengthens education  for their families and highly susceptible people. Furthermore,  in addition to the AIDS Prevention and Control Day held once  each year, Yunnan has printed some 100,000 tracts about AIDS in  the Dai and Jingpo languages and installed three telephones for  inquiries. All this plays an effective role in preventing the  spread of AIDS.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Polish Sejm Marshal Jozef Oleksy by Marta </F> Stolarova and Jan Zizka in Prague on 1 March: The Polish  Coalition Is Not Threatened by a Collapse"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] During  the talks with Prime Minister Klaus, you mentioned that the West  could learn a lot in Poland and the Czech Republic. Could you  be more specific?    [Oleksy] It sounds rather conceited, but we can say that  Poland and the Czech Republic should not only take from Europe;  they also have something to give. There is the potential  ability to develop, for instance. The Western countries are  facing recession, unemployment, and overproduction. I partially  subscribe to the thesis that dynamic development is not to be  expected in the West but, rather, in Central and East Europe.  It is also a question of a certain orthodoxy, which is quite  pronounced in our countries because the transformation requires  it. This can be linked to the transparency of our politics and  its suitable interpretation. We can also prove how strong the  bond is between social intentions and the pragmatic  decisionmaking in the economy. Finally, there is also the  phenomenal experience with the system of real socialism. This  experience is not only bad but also good, in the sense that we  know how it should not look.    [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] Would you care to comment on the  proposed solution of the Polish debt to the former Czech and  Slovak Federal Republic?    [Oleksy] It is a debt of $85 million, of which $65 million  is the share of the Czech Republic. Prime Minister Klaus gave  his support to the concept that these funds will be used on the  basis of a jointly drafted plan for the development of the  infrastructure and ecology in those regions of the Czech  Republic that border Poland. I consider that very reasonable.    [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] The Polish ambassador to Prague  comments very favorably on the "economization of Czech foreign  policy." What do you think?    [Oleksy] It could be referred to by another term, too--the  subordination of foreign policy to economic goals and  interests--and that is something I have been trying for in  Poland for a long time. I believe that, after 1989, there was a  period in Polish foreign policy when it was necessary to  concentrate on building a new "contractual infrastructure." We  have succeeded in this task. Today Poland needs politics to  serve, above all, economic interests. Every country--and it  applies even more to the small ones--must be able to calculate  its economic interests and advocate them in the framework of the  worldwide economic game. [passage omitted]    [Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Czech on 2 March on pages 1  and  12, in a similar interview, adds:    (Petr Janyska, LIDOVE NOVINY) How do you perceive the Czech  left wing, and what contacts do you have with it?    (Oleksy) Negligible--we meet with the social democrats only  at international actions. We have not had any contacts with  your communists for a long time. However, we do have very close  contacts with Peter Weiss's party in Slovakia.]</p>

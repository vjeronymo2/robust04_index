			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Transport - plan on basis of sustainable development, or reverse development (1) Sir, We are sorry to find the Financial Times, of all papers, criticising the Royal Commission's report on transport without taking the trouble to appreciate our arguments. The commission has not said that building more roads is 'intrinsically wrong' (as suggested by your leader, 'Misreading the road map' on October 27). The whole basis of the report is sustainable development, which cannot be achieved unless assessments take into account both 'the benefits of mobility' and the value of environmental assets that might be lost. To carry out such assessments, the report recommends a pragmatic approach, in the form of identifying the 'best practicable environmental option' (para 9.56). The commission's view on both roads and new rail lines (para 4.60) is that they should not be built in areas of conservation, cultural, scenic or amenity value unless they have been shown to represent the best practicable environmental option. In such cases, in the terms of your leader, the price associated with their use would have to be very high indeed before their construction could be justified. You also misrepresented the commission's position in another respect. The use of unleaded petrol remains desirable on health grounds, even in cars without catalytic converters. But we drew attention in our ninth report in 1983 to other health risks associated with high-octane (super premium) unleaded petrol. Neither the commission, nor so far as we are aware, other environmental experts, has ever argued that particular grade is (as you put it) 'green'. John Houghton, chairman, Aubrey Silberston, member, Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, Room 652, Church House, Great Smith Street, London SW1P 3BZ</p>

Shakhray said he was amazed at the intentions to  reorganize the government without Gaydar. He said "there were  more question marks and minuses than pluses." At the same time,  he said he had met neither with Gaydar nor with Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin on the issue. "It is necessary to weigh all  the factors before making a close analysis of the new  composition of the government," he said.    Prior to this, Shakhray told journalists he was not prepared  to tell who might replace Gaydar as he did not know more of the  situation than the journalists themselves. He supposed that  Gaydar's resignation will almost certainly lead to granting new  credits and another drop of the ruble. In his opinion, the  government's policy will be the most likely to be adjusted to  meet the needs of the industrialists.    Asked about the government's intention to allocate $500  million for the construction of a parliamentary center in  Moscow, Shakhray pointed out that "this money would be useful  for the economy." At the same time, the vice prime minister  noted that achieving the same goal will cost much higher in a  year.    Commenting on the election of deputy speakers and heads of  parliamentary committees by a single list, Shakhray said that on  the whole the State Duma gained from using this approach. "Had  we nominated heads of parliamentary committees person by person,  the political spectrum would have been more uniform, and the  factor of professional qualification for the post would not have  been always taken into account," he pointed out. At the same  time, he said deputies elected from single-mandate  constituencies lost from the voting for the list. Only PRUC and  the deputies' group "New Policy" stood up for their interests.  "However, we were in minority and could not influence the  situation," he pointed out.</p>

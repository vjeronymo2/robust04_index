			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions boost Bemrose BEMROSE Corporation, the Derby-based security and promotional printer, reported a 38 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits yesterday boosted by its recent acquisitions in both the UK and US. The group, which used the proceeds of a rights issue in March to fund the acquisition of the outstanding 50 per cent of its US joint venture company and the purchase of Barnard and Jackson, UK-based diary publishers, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.55m in the six months to July 3, up from Pounds 1.85m in the year ago period. Turnover, including Pounds 10.3m attributed to acquisitions, increased to Pounds 32.6m (Pounds 22.7m) while operating profits, including Pounds 810,000 from acquisitions, grew to Pounds 2.97m (Pounds 1.96m). The group's share of profits from Bemrose Yattendon, the US joint venture before its full acquisition in April, added a further Pounds 163,000 to profits, compared with Pounds 380,000 for the full six months in 1992. Interest costs increased to Pounds 581,000 (Pounds 491,000). Earnings per share rose to 7.86p (6.52p) out of which the group is paying an unchanged interim dividend of 4.3p. Commenting on the results Mr Rodger Booth, chief executive, said: 'The encouraging performance for the first period is continuing into the second half of the year.' The group's core business of security printing at Derby continued to trade well in a difficult market. Although volumes and revenues from bank cheques are down, costs have been reduced and sales of other security products have been increased. Barnard and Jackson, the new UK purchase, 'broadly broke even' although profits from diary sales are predominantly earned in the second half. In the US the expanded group, now the largest supplier to the advertising specialty market, is achieving substantial real growth.</p>

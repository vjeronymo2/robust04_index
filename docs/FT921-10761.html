			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: Nissan to close Australian assembly plant NISSAN MOTOR, the Japanese carmaker, said yesterday that it would close its unprofitable Australian assembly plant at Clayton, Victoria, with a loss of 1,800 jobs by October. The decision, while not entirely a surprise, is unusual for Nissan and extremely unusual for any Japanese company, where lifetime employment is common. The company plans to become a car importer in Australia, but will maintain manufacture of components and castings from a plant in the Melbourne suburb of Dandenong, mainly for export. Nissan said its hand was forced by the policy changes of the Australian government last year, which brought down import tariffs to improve the competitiveness of the Australian car industry. Mr Yoshikazu Hanawa, executive vice-president, said in Tokyo that the Australian government's plan to reduce tariffs from 35 per cent to 15 per cent by the year 2000 made the operation no longer viable. The Australian manufacturing operation had been plagued by cost and quality problems. Nissan has been hit by the prolonged Australian recession. Nissan's Australian production declined from 53,000 vehicles in fiscal 1990 to an expected 33,000 vehicles in fiscal 1991, which ends in March. The Australian subsidiary posted a Y12.5bn (Dollars 101.62m) loss last year and is expected to post a similar loss in the current fiscal year. The Japanese company's withdrawal from Australia will leave US-owned Ford and General Motors and Japanese-controlled Toyota and Mitsubishi as Australian car manufacturers. But many industry analysts believe at least one of these will also be forced to quit this decade. Toyota has cut Australian employment by 900 workers in the past two years through voluntary redundancies. It is currently building a new manufacturing facility which will largely replace existing outmoded plant and lead to further job losses. Ford let some 1,600 workers go at the end of 1990. Nissan said it would incur a Y40bn extraordinary loss as a result of the plant closure but that this would be offset by asset sales elsewhere in the group. Peru closure: Page 3</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / 27 dead as storms batter Italy A man gestures to watchers on a bridge in Nice as his car becomes submerged by flood waters. Torrential storms battered southern France and northern Italy over the weekend, bringing death and devastation to the region. In Italy yesterday the death toll was 27, with nine people missing. More than 1,500 firefighters were working in the regions of Piedmont and Liguria where rivers had burst their banks and cut transport and power links. In France five people were missing. Many roads were blocked by mudslides in the Riviera hinterland and Corsica, while the airport at Nice was closed, with its runways and terminals flooded. Several homes were destroyed in the southern French Alps and dozens of villagers were evacuated, some of them by helicopter.</p>

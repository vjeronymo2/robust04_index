			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Euromoney seeks Pounds 20m for purchases Euromoney Publications is raising Pounds 20m through a placing to pay for two acquisitions, refinance another and provide finance for further purchases. The publisher and training and conference organiser also reported pre-tax profits for the six months to March 31 up 52 per cent at Pounds 9.01m (Pounds 5.94m). Turnover rose 85 per cent to Pounds 35.9m, which included Pounds 423,000 from acquisitions. The shares rose 125p to Pounds 18.25p. The company, the ultimate holding company of which is Rothermere Investments, is buying an indirect 30 per cent interest in Lingua Franca, a programming training and consultancy company and 49 per cent of Adhesion et Associes, a French business convention company. It is also refinancing the acquisition of 80 per cent of Engel Publishing Partners, bought in March for an initial Dollars 1.32m (Pounds 880,000) and further payments to a maximum of Dollars 7.5m. The issue price and number of shares will be fixed no later than May 18 after presentations have been made to possible investors. Euromoney is paying Dollars 1m for the Lingua Franca stake, which will be increased to 50 per cent at a cost of Dollars 700,000 next year. Mr Michael Sobol, director of a Euromoney associate, is making the same investments as Euromoney, which will hold a put and call option on the stake. In the year to March 31 1994 Lingua Franca reported operating profits of Dollars 515,000 on turnover of Dollars 4.38m. The consideration for the holding in Adhesion will include an initial FFr24.5m (Pounds 2.9m). Further profit-related payments to a maximum of FFr130m will be made over the next three years taking the holding to 100 per cent. However, directors estimate the total cost should be FFr63m. For 1993 pre-tax profits were FFr6.5m. Three companies, AIC, DC Gardner and Century House, made initial full contributions of Pounds 1.98m to operating profits and Pounds 12.4m to turnover at Euromoney. Excluding these, turnover rose 21 per cent with operating profit up 36 per cent. Earnings per share were 28p (19.5p) and the interim dividend is raised to 13p (10.5p).</p>

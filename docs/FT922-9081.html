			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Finance: El Dorado: the search goes on - The risks and rewards of emerging markets FOR HUNDREDS of years, explorers and investors have dreamed of faraway cities, with streets paved of gold. And in the 1990s, there is a school of thought which argues that real riches can be found, not in the stock markets of developed countries such as the UK and the US, but in the shares of emerging markets further afield. Profits have been discovered already. In 1991, Latin American Investment Trust was the best performing of all investment trusts, and the list of top ten unit trusts over the five years to end April includes both Abtrust's Far East Emerging Economies and the Prosperity Emerging Markets funds. The arguments for investing in emerging markets are simply put. These countries have higher economic growth rates than the developed world, and this should continue, thanks to rising life expectancy and improving education. The developing countries produced a 5.9 per cent GDP growth rate from 1965-80 and 4.3 per cent during 1980-89, according to the World Bank; the equivalent figures for the industrial countries in those periods were 3.7 and 3 per cent respectively. The stock markets of emerging countries represent a much smaller proportion of their gross domestic product than their equivalents in the industrialised world. Many emerging countries are introducing 'free market' reforms to encourage the growth of the private sector, and are opening their stock markets to foreign investment. In short, these economies are dynamic and should provide more opportunity for profit than countries in the staid West. After all, Japan was an 'emerging market' in the 1960s. But there are dangers. The under-developed state of these stock markets means that trading is illiquid, which may mean sharp swings in prices. Shares can easily fall or rise by 10 per cent in a week. There is no universally agreed definition of an emerging market. In recent listing particulars from Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust, an emerging market was defined as a nation with a low or middle income, or one where stock market capitalisation is less than 2 per cent of the world index. Over 75 per cent of the world's population live in such countries, according to Templeton. The vast majority of these emerging markets are found in three areas; Latin America, south east Asia and the Mediterranean. African and eastern European countries are seen as prospects for the future, but investment is still limited. The areas In the minds of many investors, Latin America is probably still associated with hyperinflation and military coups. But, according to William Calvert who runs the Prosperity Emerging Markets trust, 'the whole financial structure of Latin America has been redesigned.' Market reforms have been introduced and democratic regimes are in place in many nations. 'South America has been reverting to the promise of the 1950s and 1960s,' says James Fairweather, who manages Martin Currie's emerging markets fund. 'The region lost its way in the 1970s, and the economy went nowhere in 1980s,' he adds. The huge rises in Latin American share prices last year - the Argentinian market was up 400 per cent in 1991 - might seem to suggest that private investors have missed the boat. But Audley Twiston Davies, of Latin American Securities, says the amount of foreign money which has moved into Latin America has been relatively small. While many institutions will have a stake in one Latin American company, very few will own shares in ten. Davies says that some Latin American markets still look good on fundamental grounds, citing Mexico where earnings growth is expected to be 25 per cent and the prospective price-earnings ratio is only 12. The dynamism of the South East Asian economies has been appreciated by outside investors for some time. Many of the so-called 'tiger economies' are candidates to repeat the Japanese performance. And recently, investors have become excited by prospects for China, which seems to be opening up to economic, if not democratic, reform. Although there are a few quoted Chinese companies, the common route for those wishing to invest in China has been via Hong Kong companies with operations on the mainland. That has helped push Hong Kong shares to all-time highs. Scott McGlashan, who runs Perpetual's Asian smaller markets fund, has been taking some profits from Hong Kong but is still optimistic about the prospects for south east Asia, since he believes the region should benefit from a US economic recovery. How to invest Investing directly in stocks in this area is out of reach of all but the wealthiest. For most investors, a collective fund (unit or investment trust) is the obvious route. There are three sorts of fund, in roughly descending order of risk. The first is an individual country fund; the second is regional; and the third is an emerging markets trust, which invests across the world. But just because an emerging market fund invests in a wide range of areas, that does not mean it is immune from decline. The stock market crash of 1987 showed that markets round the world could be affected by the same event. A breakdown in the Gatt talks on world trade might affect sentiment badly, suggests Angus Tulloch, who manages the Stewart Ivory new Pacific trust (although he is very positive for Asian shares on a five to ten year view). However, a broad fund seems the logical first step in this field. Brian O'Neill, who runs Gartmore Frontier Markets fund says: 'Areas which are flavours of the month can come and go. Latin America is currently in fashion but in 1989 it was Turkey and Greece. We think the retail client wants a broad interest in emerging markets.' Having chosen the geographical scale of the fund, the investor also has to choose between a unit and investment trust; each has different attractions. A unit trust offers the retail investor the ability to sell at net asset value at any time. But that very liquidity can cause a problem for the fund manager, who may be forced to sell stocks at rock bottom prices in declining markets in order to meet redemptions. Thus unit trust performance can be hit hard in declining markets. The investment trust manager does not face that risk - he can afford to leave his portfolio untouched through a bear market. But the risk is passed on to the investor. If the county or region falls out of favour because of a declining stock market, the investor may find that not only does the asset value of the trust decline, but his shares fall to a discount. So the investor suffers a 'double whammy'. There are six emerging market investment trusts, although only two have records lasting three years - and both have shown declines over that period. However, Templeton Emerging Markets has a very good two-year record, with 76 per cent growth (mid-market to mid-market with income reinvested) and Latin American Investment Trust was up 64 per cent over the last year. Among the unit trusts, bid-offer spreads tend to be slightly higher in this market (the average for the ex-Japan Far East funds is 6.3 per cent) so investors' money will have to work harder to make a profit.</p>

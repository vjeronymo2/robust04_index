			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Helicopter operator bids referred TWO OF the bids to take over British International Helicopters Ltd (BIHL), Robert Maxwell's helicopter company now in administration, were yesterday referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, Daniel Green writes. Arthur Andersen, administrators of Maxwell's private companies, said the decision would 'add to the uncertainty surrounding BIHL's future'. The MMC has until September 9 to make its ruling. Aberdeen-based BIHL went into administration in December 1991. It employs 500 people and has 26 operational helicopters, worth up to Pounds 5m each. The referred bids, by Bond Helicopters and Bristow Helicopters, both UK companies, would if successful reduce from three to two the number of competitors in the Pounds 200m-a-year North Sea helicopter services business. If Bristow won control of BIHL's assets, it would have about 75 per cent of the market, while if Bond won it would have nearly half. It is understood that both the Office of Fair Trading and oil companies operating in the North Sea objected to the bids.</p>

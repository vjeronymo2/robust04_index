			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The foreign affairs spokesman of the Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF] has reaffirmed that the foreign policy  that his party wishes to pursue is that hallmarked with the name  of Jozsef Antall. The two main aims of this are European  integration and the legal protection of Hungarians living beyond  the borders. Gyorgy Csoti stressed that there is no better  security guarantee than economic interconnections; for this  reason the ruling party urges cooperation between the regions.  In this endeavor, there is agreement between the parliamentary  parties. The politician does not consider it likely that the  Hungarian-Romanian and Hungarian-Slovak treaties will be signed  in the near future because the two neighboring countries are not  willing to accept minority protection guarantees.</p>

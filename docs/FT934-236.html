			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Scott to investigate Royal Ordnance staff The Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry is to investigate allegations that officials from Royal Ordnance, the armaments company, helped a German small-arms manufacturer evade embargoes on defence exports in the 1980s. The prosecution in the trial in Germany of Mr Walter Lamp, managing director of Heckler &amp; Koch, has alleged that officials in the UK company helped divert arms to the former East German security services and the Nicaraguan Contra rebels as well as to Iraq via the United Arab Emirates. Heckler &amp; Koch was bought by Royal Ordnance in 1991. According to the prosecution, Royal Ordnance provided false end-user certificates for Heckler &amp; Koch guns, stating their destination as the UK rather than countries affected by German or international embargoes. It is not clear from evidence before the court whether the alleged events occurred when Royal Ordnance was government-owned, or after its 1987 sale to British Aerospace. Mr Paul Regan, a lawyer on the Scott inquiry team, said yesterday the inquiry was 'already looking into' some activities of Royal Ordnance, along with those of a number of other UK manufacturers, but had not been aware of the trial in the town of Rottweil, Baden-Wurttemburg. Mr Regan said the inquiry was investigating government claims that it did not know that UK companies were contravening official guidelines on defence exports to banned countries. 'The crucial point is that up until 1987 Royal Ordnance was government-owned and they could not argue that they did not know what its business was,' he said. 'If it emerges that a large consignment of something nasty went from Royal Ordnance to Iraq then we are interested in when it went, was there a proper export licence, how did it leave the country, was the government aware, or could they have taken steps to prevent it,' he said. Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, said that if the alleged arms dealing took place before the sale of Royal Ordnance, it would imply that British officials had been 'sleazy and corrupt'. 'It is mindboggling that a British government should have been so unprincipled as to allow the sale of arms to countries that were our enemies at the time,' he said. There is as yet no suggestion that the inquiry - which is now due to report in the summer - will be broadened beyond the issue of the export of dual-use goods to Iraq between 1984 and 1990. The Rottweil trial, like the Scott inquiry, is in recess until early in the new year. The Scott team has had 130,000 documents to pore over, while Mr Karl-Heinz Beiter, chief prosecutor at Rottweil, has spent more than five years gathering evidence. 'Bringing the case to trial has been relatively slow,' said Mr Beiter. The prosecution, with the assistance of the Federal Criminal Office, started investigations in 1987 and finally pressed charges in January this year. Both the Ministry of Defence and BAe declined to comment.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAY FOR JUDGES  </P> <P> Poor Judge Carrigan! It was all I could do to hold back the tears upon reading  about the terrible life of Carrigan.  </P> <P> First, he had to liquidate many of his financial holdings in order to send his  children "through college and graduate school"; and only the finest private  schools like Notre Dame sufficed. Welcome to the real world, Judge Carrigan!  How about the thousands upon thousands of parents who earn but a small  percentage of Carrigan's salary and yet manage to sacrifice virtually  everything in life in order to help provide some degree of access to the  educational system? Worse yet, how many tens of thousands of willing young  people are forced to forgo a college education due to the severe financial  structures such an undertaking entails? Is it just only recently that Carrigan  has learned that capitalism is inherently unfair; that our society is replete  with a myriad of institutionalized inequities?  </P> <P> Tears also welled up in my eyes upon reading that Carrigan had to sell of "half  interest in the family's Rocky Mountain retreat." I have heard this sad tale of  woe countless times from many of the families in the inner-city in Los Angeles  whose children attend our public schools. Their hearts go out to you, Judge  Carrigan!  </P> <P> And lest we be accused of being sexist, let's hear it for poor Beverly  Carrigan. I mean, sure she could return to a menial and "low-paying occupation"  like "social work." But, alas, being a "bride of the '50s" who likes  "traditional things," it is simply not possible for her to work in order to  supplement the family income. Again, I believe that I can speak for thousands  of working mothers -- many of them single -- when I say that our hearts go out  to you!  </P> <P> One last point, Judge Carrigan. If you think you are not being paid adequately  for your abilities and worth, I suggest that you try teaching for a while in  the public school system for a starting salary in the low $20,000 range.  </P> <P> CECIL BURNS  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

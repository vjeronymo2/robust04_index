			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Robust growth in Vietnam economy THE Vietnamese economy performed robustly in 1992 despite the disappearance of Soviet aid and the continuing economic boycott applied by the US since the Vietnam war, Mr Vo Van Kiet, the prime minister, said yesterday. In a confident assessment of Vietnam's economic prospects, he told the National Assembly in Hanoi: '1992 is ending with a relative overall victory in the economy, the first year we have fulfilled and even surpassed our main targets.' He unveiled a string of encouraging statistics: the economy as a whole will grow an estimated 5.3 per cent this year, with industrial production up about 15 per cent - a figure which includes growing oil output - and agricultural production up 4.4 per cent. Foreign investment will have increased 73 per cent and state revenues also rose sharply because of more efficient tax collection; inflation has fallen to about 15 per cent; and the local currency has stabilised following harsh restrictions on the money supply. Mr Vo Van Kiet attributed the strength of the economy to the policy of doi moi or renovation, the Vietnamese version of perestroika since the late 1980s, although he acknowledged that much more needed to be done. The current session of the National Assembly is not only revising foreign investment regulations to attract further inflows of foreign capital but is focusing on the problem of smuggling and official corruption. The government would seek to stop bureaucrats wasting money. The prime minister accepted the need for foreign borrowing to finance badly-needed construction and repair of power stations, ports and roads. But he said debt arrears had to be paid off and outlined a cautious approach to future borrowing. 'We should not borrow to finance our day-to-day spending,' he declared. The Vietnamese government, with Vietnamese and American businesses, is anxious for the US to lift or at least relax its economic embargo before President George Bush leaves office in January. Vietnam sees the US as a counterweight to the growing influence of Japan and China, and is particularly keen to use loans - at present blocked by Washington - from the World Bank, the International Money Fund and the Asian Development Bank to pay for infrastructure projects and lay the foundations for growth.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Doubts surround big Java chemicals plant CONSTRUCTION of the Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 870m) Chandra Asri olefin (petrochemical) plant in West Java may be delayed by uncertainty over the security of a Dollars 550m line of credit from state-owned Bank Bumi Daya (BBD). The Indonesian government has said BBD's irrevocable letter of credit must not be drawn down, but bankers close to the project say contractors, including Japan's Toyo Engineering, may have to call on the facility. Uncertainty over the facility is adding to delays finalising the remaining finance, about half the project's total cost, required for the project's completion. Bankers say committed finance includes BBD's credit and a further Dollars 212m of loans drawn down as equity for the project. Last October the government said Chandra Asri was being postponed until after 1995, although BBD's letter of credit had already been signed and purchase orders made. The decision was part of a government move to cap state finance for large projects prompted by Indonesia's growing international debt. The project was first announced in March, 1991, and backers include the Bimantara Group run by President Suharto's second son, and Mr Prajogo Pangestu, a prominent Indonesian businessman. Last April, the government gave the project the go-ahead on condition that its cost was reduced to Dollars 1.6bn from Dollars 2.25bn, and that it proceeded under full foreign ownership using offshore finance. The government said the project's connection with the BBD had to end, and its credit viewed as bridging finance. However, 'the text of the (BBD) letter of credit has not been altered,' said one banker. Instead, shareholders have undertaken to government to raise alternative finance if BBD's facility is called on. This undertaking, however, 'does not alter BBD's (legal) obligation to pay up,' the banker stressed. In mid-1991, Toyo Engineering placed purchase orders and some large items, including turbines, have been supplied. Toyo Engineering may soon have to call on BBD's letter of credit, say bankers, and would have to pay almost the full amount to suppliers if equipment cancellations are made. 'The question, of course, is whether the shareholders have any money' to fulfil their undertaking, said a banker. The Bimantara Group had a turnover last year estimated at Rupiah 2,200bn (Dollars 1,075m) but industry officials say other projects in which it is a shareholder have been delayed by lack of finance. If the shareholders fail to arrange alternative finance, BBD will be obliged to pay, or breach the loan's covenant. The government plans to make state banks into limited liability companies, but bankers say failure to pay would be tantamount to breaking a sovereign guarantee. Although the government has said it will not fund the Chandra Asri project, bankers say it will wish to protect Indonesia's reputation of meeting international obligations.</p>

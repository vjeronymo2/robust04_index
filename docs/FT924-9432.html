			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Trade threats IF MR CLINTON thinks he can set his own agenda, regardless of events, he should think again. Come January, he will find world trade at the top of his in-tray. He may even find his country embroiled in a tit-for-tat trade war with the European Community triggered by their five-year-long oilseeds dispute. It is vitally important that the new administration does not inherit so embittered a conflict. If one is to be avoided, however, the EC will have to show more flexibility than it has done so far. The Community is likely to regret its failure to reach an overall agreement on farm trade with the outgoing Bush administration. Nothing suggests that Mr Clinton will be easier to deal with than Mr Bush. He may well be still less accommodating. Mr Clinton may, for example, try to make the environment and fair labour standards central issues in the Uruguay Round, whereupon the whole draft agreement could easily disintegrate. He will probably be still more inclined towards the use of unilateral market-opening measures than someone as instinctively internationalist as Mr Bush. Failure to resolve the oilseeds dispute can only exacerbate those tendencies. The US regards this particular dispute as a test case for the multilateral approach to the resolution of trade disputes. It has twice won favourable verdicts from Gatt panels, which have concluded that the EC oilseeds regime discriminates in favour of EC oilseed production, thereby impairing the value of the zero tariffs on imports of oilseeds conceded by the EC in the early 1960s. The US has proposed binding arbitration on this, but the EC refused. The US is entitled, therefore, to do what it did yesterday, namely, request Gatt authorisation for suspension of tariff concessions to the EC worth Dollars 1bn and so equivalent in value, it claims, to EC concessions that are judged impaired. Even if the US is entitled to do this, retaliation must be very risky at this delicate juncture. The threatened EC counter-retaliation would be worse than merely risky. It could be a disaster, not least because it is almost certainly illegal under Gatt. The US is entitled to withdraw tariff concessions in order to balance the losses its producers have suffered. Counter-retaliation by the EC would upset the balance once more. Thereupon a spiral of retaliation and counter-retaliation would seem inevitable. The failure to complete the deal on farm trade within the Uruguay Round is more than a misfortune; it is a mistake. So is the failure to resolve the dispute over oilseeds. But this mistake need not be compounded. So long as a spiral of retaliation and counter-retaliation is avoided now, both the Gatt dispute settlement mechanism and the Uruguay Round remain alive until Mr Clinton takes over. The EC failed to prevent yesterday's US action. It must now eschew the counter-retaliation that can only make things worse.</p>

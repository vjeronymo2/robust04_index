			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Brazilian group acquires 12% stake in LatInvest BOZANO Simonsen, the Brazilian financial group, is to acquire a 12 per cent stake in LatInvest, an investment banking group established this year to specialise in Latin American capital markets and corporate finance. The Brazilian group will subscribe for a package of new equity and long-term debt totalling Dollars 3.2m. The InverMexico group, a Mexican financial services company, will have a 60 per cent stake. Management will subscribe to new shares to maintain its 28 per cent stake. LatInvest, which has offices in London, New York and Geneva, is seeking other investors from Latin America, in particular from Argentina. But it is not expected that InverMexico's stake will fall below 50 per cent nor that of Bozano Simonsen below 10 per cent. LatInvest has appointed Mr Tom Gaffney, former chief executive in London of Libra Bank, Chase Investment Bank and the Chartered West LB merchant bank, as its chairman.</p>

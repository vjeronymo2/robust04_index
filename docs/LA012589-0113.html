			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Dave Winfield and George Steinbrenner will allow an arbitrator to rule on their  fight over the Winfield Foundation, rather than proceed with federal lawsuits.  </P> <P> At the instigation of Mike Lupica, a columnist for the New York Daily News,  Steinbrenner and Winfield agreed to let Michael Armstrong, a New York lawyer,  decide the issues.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Winfield sued Steinbrenner and the Yankees, claiming that  they had not made $450,000 in payments to the foundation. Three days later,  Steinbrenner countersued, charging that Winfield had failed to make at least  $380,000 in payments and alleging that Winfield had used the foundation to pay  expenses for himself and friends.  </P></p>

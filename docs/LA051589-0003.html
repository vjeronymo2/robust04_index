			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Eight explorers reached the North Pole after 600 miles on skis, but an  expedition spokeswoman said the team could be in peril because of thin ice and  low visibility. "They've reached the pole," Tracy Carpenter of the Icewalk  Expedition said in Ottawa, the Canadian capital. "Now the next job is getting  them out. The visibility is bad and the ice is rough and thin." She said there  was concern about when a Twin Otter aircraft could reach the explorers. The  eight-member team, led by British adventurer Robert Swan, is seeking to draw  attention to global pollution but has run into rougher conditions than  expected.  </P></p>

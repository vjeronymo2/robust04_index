			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Claudia Moreira from Brasilia] </F>   [Text] The federal Senate has approved the amendments to  the Tlatelolco Treaty, which guarantees the non-use of nuclear  weapons. This was reported by Foreign Minister Celso Amorim.  [Begin recording]    Amorim: The treaty represents our total  integration in a system of guarantees proscribing the use of  nuclear weapons. It is a treaty that includes all of Latin  America and the Caribbean. All the meaningful countries ratified  it, except for Cuba, which did not sign it. However, I believe  that now with this ratification by Brazil, as well as by  Argentina and Chile -- which were the countries that promoted  the amendments -- Cuba will now sign it.    With this, Latin America and the Caribbean will be an area  totally free of nuclear weapons. It must be pointed out that  the treaty not only entails a commitment by Latin America but by  the nuclear powers as well not to use or keep nuclear weapons in  Latin America. [end recording]    The Tlatelolco Treaty also allows the control of nuclear  installations by the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> DESIGN ;  </P> <P> CHAMBER MATES FROM DOWN UNDER  </P> <P> SHERIDAN, the classy Australian showplace of the boudoir, has crossed the seas  to anchor two outlets on our shores: a cozy shop in Costa Mesa's South Coast  Plaza and a larger representative in the Century City Shopping Center. The  merchandise, which includes every conceivable bedroom accessory -- sheets,  duvet covers, comforters, beds, upholstery fabric, wallpaper, window  treatments, lamps and much more -- runs the gamut from frilly to sleekly  contemporary.  </P> <P> But it's the sheets that are the unqualified Sheridan standouts: vibrant  solid-colored linens that coordinate with exotic tropicals, men's-club paisleys  and a couple of playful designs from Australian artist / designer Ken Done. For  those who can't find what they want among the nine bedroom vignettes displayed,  sales consultants are available to advise.  </P> <P>  Sheridan, Century City Shopping Center, 10250 Santa Monica Blvd., Century  City, (213) 286-1638, and South Coast Plaza, 333 Bristol, Costa Mesa, (714)  540-9978.  </P> <P> BARBARA THORNBURG  </P></p>

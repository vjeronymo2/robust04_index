These demonstrations are also designed to protest the continued  siege of the Hazratbal Shrine, which the people visit to pay  respect to the sacred relic -- a hair from the beard of the holy  Prophet Muhammad, may the blessing and mercy of God be upon him.  This year, the people will not be able to visit the Hazratbal  Shrine because of the siege laid by Indian forces.    Meanwhile, 20 people have been killed and several others  arrested in the fresh operations carried out by occupation  forces in the occupied valley. An Indian military vehicle was  destroyed and two soldiers were killed in a land mine explosion  in the Nawanshahr area. In another operation, the freedom  fighters damaged the water supply system of Punch Cantonment.  According to another report, the freedom fighters attacked a  military position with a hand grenade in the Charasa area of  Srinagar, wounding a number of soldiers. There are also reports  of clashes between the freedom fighters and the Indian forces at  (Zomaran Top) of Doda District, in which several soldiers were  either killed or wounded.    Syed Ali Jilani, a leader of the freedom movement, in a  press  statment has appreciated the sentiments expressed by President  Clinton in his letter to Dr. Ghulam Nabi Fai, the director of  the Kashmir-American Council. Jilani said it is the result of  the unprecedented sacrifice of the Kashmiris that the United  States and Western countries have begun to take note of the  Kashmir situation.    Mohammad Farooq Rahmani, the Jammu and Kashmir People's  League, has appealed to the Kashmiri people to observe Indian  Republic Day on 26 January as a black day. He said on this day,  normal life activities should be suspended and all lights kept  switched off in the evening, to prove that the future of India  and Kashmir is different from each other. Rahmani has also  appealed to the people of Azad Kashmir to express solidarity  with their brethren living on the other side of the cease-fire  line.</p>

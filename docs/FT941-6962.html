			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / How to Spend It: Classics for the home - Looking for a desk that is beautiful enough for domestic use and practical enough for work? Lucia van der Post has the answer No-one who has visited Frank Lloyd Wright's famous building for S C Johnson &amp; Co in Racine, Wisconsin, forgets it. I still remember how it looked 12 years ago - a cool, tranquil, elegant building, filled with light and air, so unlike any other office building I had been in. It stood there, modern, yet classic, its slender, mushroom columns rising from the floors, a seemingly idyllic combination of the functional and the beautiful. But what impressed me most was that everybody, from the managing director to the humblest clerk and office worker, had a Frank Lloyd Wright desk of their own. They were not all identical but they all were recognisably from the same family. They were all variations on a theme and had been made specially for the building and its workers. For Frank Lloyd Wright, like his contemporary Charles Rennie Mackintosh, believed that a totally harmonious environment needed to be planned as a whole - furniture and artefacts had to be part of the grand scheme. Originally designed in the 1930s they are still in use and still look elegant. Anyone who is looking for a desk that is beautiful enough to fit into a domestic setting and practical enough need look no further than Cassina's reproductions. After a long courtship Cassina, the Italian furniture manufacturer, finally got permission from S C Johnson to have access to the original prototypes, drawings and stencils and it now offers a desk and chair that is a careful reconstruction of the original design. A classic design of this quality does not come cheap (Pounds 3,290) but it is of almost heirloom quality. There is a very limited choice of colours - a brick red frame topped by cherry wood (this is the closest colouring to the original) or a black, stained ash top on a black metal frame. The chair to partner the desk is made from painted steel with timber armrests and the finishes match the desk - black steel with black stained ash arm rests or brick red frame with cherry wood arm rests. The back and seat pad can be covered in fabric or leather, prices range from Pounds 640 for fabric versions, from Pounds 693 for leather ones. The chair and the desk can be bought from Atrium, Centrepoint, 22-24 St Giles High Street, London WC2H 8LN. Anyone wanting to know more about the furniture might like to visit the Frank Lloyd Wright room at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London where the chair and desk and other furniture and drawings can be seen. If Frank Lloyd Wright prices are beyond your means, but you are still in need of decent furniture from which to work at home, it is worth looking at Philip St Pier's carefully-made collection. He primarily makes to order or special commission but he has a small range of 'editions' which could be said to be standard pieces. Philip St Pier was originally a designer and maker but these days, in order to produce more and bring costs down, he sub-contracts the making to selected workshops. This means that he can sell a hand-made desk such as the Consort (sketched here) for Pounds 700. The chair he sells for Pounds 375, the coat-stand for Pounds 425. They can be ordered in a wide range of woods and can be modified to suit specific requirements. He has kept a workshop where he designs, makes up prototypes and mock-ups. Besides the desk and office collection he has some sturdy garden furniture and fine boxes.

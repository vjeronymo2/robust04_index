			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Labour to focus on key Tory marginals - Unemployment LABOUR is convinced that unemployment, particularly among white collar workers, could hold the key to the coming general election, amid evidence that joblessness is rising most swiftly in Tory marginals. Party officials believe the pattern of job losses is now quite unlike those in the early 1980s with the impact falling disproportionately on seats in the south and south east. Figures now being drawn up aim to maximise the impact of the issue among target voters in the 87 constituencies identified from the last week's local government elections as showing a swing towards Labour. These are expected to be published today in an effort to dispel a view widely held among the Conservatives that rising unemployment has little impact on its vote at a general election. Total unemployment is rising faster in Tory-held seats than Labour ones, officials claim, pointing out that in the south east, claimants have increased by 260 per cent as vacancies have dropped by 48 per cent. Party analysts say the pattern of job losses means the issue will influence an election outcome much more than in 1983 and 1987. Yesterday, Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman, signalled the shift in emphasis when he launched a fierce attack on Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, for failing to fight for adequate resources for his department. Accusing Mr Howard of complacency as unemployment was rising 'faster than in any other country in the western world', he said the department's training budget for the jobless now stood at half its real value the last time unemployment reached two million. Mr Blair said the unemployed had become the 'forgotten people of the country' and warned that the summer would see a further round of closures and redundancies. Countering the charges, Mr Howard insisted the government had produced measures to help the unemployed back to work. He went on warn Labour's plan to introduced a national minimum wage would destroy up to two million jobs. 'As you put up the minimum wage as a proportion of the average wage, the average wage in turn goes up and you will embark upon a never ending cycle of job destruction,' said Mr Howard.</p>

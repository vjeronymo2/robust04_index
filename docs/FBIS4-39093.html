			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe, 4 Jun -- Russia will take all measures to  protect Russian servicemen and ethnic Russians living in  Tajikistan. This was stated at a news conference in Dushanbe  today by Lieutenant General Anatoliy Chechulin, commander of the  Russian border troops in Tajikistan, in connection with the  killing of seven Russians, including five senior officers, two  of whom were border guards. All these were committed in a short  period between 31 May and 4 June.    Mecheslav Senkevich, Russian ambassador to Tajikistan, and  Major General Afanasiy Kim, military procurator of the Russian  border troops, who also took part in the news conference, said  that the question of adopting measures to protect Russians was  raised today at an emergency session of the Tajikistan  Government.    In the view of General Chechulin, the killings of the  Russians mark "the start of the implementation of directions  issued by leaders of the extremist wing of the armed opposition,  including Sayed Abdullo Nuri, leader of the so-called  government-in-exile, who have recently called for acts of  terrorism against Russian servicemen." Their aim, the commander  stressed, is to destabilize the situation in Tajikistan, to  wreck the second round of inter- Tajik talks, and also to  provoke negative public opinion regarding the desirability of a  Russian military contingent in Tajikistan.    Major General Gennadiy Blinov, first deputy interior  minister  of Tajikistan, acknowledged that the acts of terrorism against  Russian servicemen and ethnic Russian officers serving in  Tajikistan's national armed forces were planned. The search for  the criminals is being carried out in close contact with the  Russian military procuracy, he said. ITAR-TASS has learned that  three individuals suspected of killing Russian officers have  already been detained.    Having stated that the Russian leadership "does not intend  to  tolerate any more blows from behind and is adopting the most  decisive measures to ensure the armed protection of its  servicemen," General Chechulin called on Tajikistan's bodies of  law enforcement to take all measures to catch the criminals and  to carry out a strict and objective investigation.    Russian servicemen will do everything to "protect themselves  from the threat of banditry from whatever source, using their  professionalism and the force of their weapons," the commander  of the Russian border troops in Tajikistan stressed.</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Smaller building societies complain over large rivals DOMINATION of the Building Societies Association by larger societies is forcing their smaller counterparts to consider new ways of representing their interests, chiefs of the smaller societies claimed yesterday. The smaller societies said at the annual BSA conference in Bournemouth that they were unable to secure adequate representation in the association and that the interests of the 20 largest societies had diverged from those of the smallest 65. They complain privately that the industry's leaders are putting pressure on them to surrender their independence through mergers. Many of the small ones are smaller than most branches of Halifax, the largest society. In the past two years, several informal gatherings of small building societies have begun to meet regularly outside the BSA. There is also a small-societies forum at which common issues are discussed. Some executives in smaller societies say privately that this week's cuts in mortgage rates by the larger societies are partly intended to put pressure on smaller lenders. The small societies are also unhappy at remarks by Halifax Building Society that it is not a lender of last resort guaranteeing savings deposits in smaller societies. However, they have not yet declared an open revolt and appear reluctant to face the possibility that they might eventually have to set up a trade association of their own. Halifax and BSA officials yesterday disclaimed any knowledge of unrest. Nationwide, the second-largest society, is cutting the rate for new borrowers by 0.29 points to 10.7 per cent on loans of up to Pounds 60,000; by 0.25 points to 10.3 per cent for Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 120,000; and by 0.4 points to 10 per cent for Pounds 120,000 to Pounds 300,000. TSB has cut its rate for new borrowers from 10.95 per cent to 10.65 per cent. Neither has announced when existing borrowers will see a reduction. Complaints against societies are expected to have doubled in the year to the end of March, building societies ombudsman Mr Stephen Edell said yesterday in Bournemouth. Changes to savings rates and difficulties with cash machines top the list.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 234.225&blank;Activation of Warning System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As proposed, this section requires that a warning system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activate to provide no less than 20 seconds warning time before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the crossing is occupied by rail traffic. The labor/management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> group recommended that this section refer to a maintenance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather than a design requirement. Accordingly, they suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the rule be modified to require that the system be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained to activate in accordance with the design of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warning system. FRA has determined that while drafting this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section in terms of maintenance requirements may be appropriate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there remains a need to maintain a minimum activation standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for warning systems. We note that the 20 second period is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the design requirement of the MUTCD. In light of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the labor/management group comments FRA is revising this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to provide that the warning system be maintained to activate in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the design of the warning system, but in no event  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall it provide less than 20 seconds warning time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section requires that a highway-rail grade crossing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warning system be maintained to activate in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design of the warning system, but in no event shall it provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than 20 seconds warning time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 234.227&blank;Train Detection Apparatus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subsection (a) of this section as proposed requires that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> train detection apparatus detect the presence of a train or car  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when any part of a train detection circuit is occupied. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, subsection (b) of the proposed rule requires that when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a grade crossing equipped with a warning system is fouled by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> train or car, the warning system would continue to operate until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such train or car clears the roadway. Subsection (c) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal requires that when there are no other movements within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the limits of the warning circuit, the warning system shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discontinue operation after the train or car passes the point of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fouling the crossing. Subsection (d) requires that if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presence of sand, rust, dirt, grease, or other foreign matter is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> known to prevent effective shunting, appropriate action under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;234.105 must be taken to safeguard motor vehicle operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Various parties suggested that different portions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule be modified. The labor/management group recommended that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rule be modified to reflect the requirement for maintenance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of train detection apparatus rather than addressing ``design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards.'' FRA has considered this suggestion and revised the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule to provide that the train detection apparatus be maintained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to detect the presence of rail equipment in any part of a train  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detection circuit, in accordance with the design of the warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system. This new subsection (a) replaces proposed subsections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a), (b), and (c). It will serve the same purpose as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections replaced, but will do so in a clearer and more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> straightforward manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There were no comments regarding proposed paragraph (d)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which provides that if the presence of sand, rust, dirt, grease,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or other foreign matter is known to prevent effective shunting, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> railroad shall take appropriate action under &sect;234.105 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safeguard vehicle operation. This section, renumbered as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (b), remains unchanged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subsection (a) requires that train detection apparatus be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained to detect a train or railcar in any part of a train  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detection circuit, in accordance with the design of the warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system. Subsection (b) provides that if the presence of sand,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rust, dirt, grease, or other foreign matter is known to prevent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective shunting, a railroad shall take appropriate action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under &sect;234.105, ``Activation failure,'' to safeguard highway  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> users.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 234.229&blank;Shunting Sensitivity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As proposed, this section requires that each train detection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circuit that controls a highway-rail grade crossing warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system will detect the presence of a shunt of 0.06 ohm resistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when the shunt is connected across the track rails of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circuit, including fouling sections of turnouts. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labor/management group commented that the proposed rule should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modified to reflect the testing requirements of warning systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on certain technologies. The group noted that certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> types of constant warning time systems may not detect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``presence'' of a shunt. The group believes it would be more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate to require that the detection systems be maintained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to detect the ``application'' of a shunt. The group believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warning systems currently in use are designed so that they will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet that criteria. Southern Pacific also commented that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constant time warning devices should be taken into account in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drafting this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA agrees with the commenters and has modified the section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordingly. ``Application of a shunt'' is replacing ``presence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a shunt'' in the final rule. In the interest of clarity the text  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``including fouling sections of turnouts'' has been deleted and ``of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any part'' of the circuit added to the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA notes that the labor/management group stated that they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe warning systems currently in use ``could be tested for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance without using multiple shunts to simulate train  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> movements or performing other complex tests of questionable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value.'' We agree that multiple shunts may not be necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test for compliance with this section, however, multiple shunts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may indeed be needed to perform operational tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section requires that each highway-rail grade crossing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> train detection circuit shall detect the application of a shunt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 0.06 ohm resistance when the shunt is connected across the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> track rails of the circuit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

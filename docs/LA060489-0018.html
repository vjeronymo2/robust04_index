			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: MCCARTNEY GENERATION NEARS MIDDLE AGE;  </P> <P> PAUL MCCARTNEY "FLOWERS IN THE DIRT." CAPITOL ****  </P> <P> POP STARS: ***** Great Balls of Fire **** Knockin' On Heaven's Door *** Good  Vibrations ** Maybe Baby * Ain't That a Shame  </P> <P> The most affecting moments in McCartney's best solo album in more than a decade  remind us that it has been 25 years since the giddy exuberance of "I Want to  Hold Your Hand."  </P> <P> Where the Beatles' early work celebrated the innocence, energy and optimism of  a generation that believed it truly was different, "Flowers in the Dirt"  focuses on how that generation -- now approaching middle age -- is more likely  to be quietly exploring the same sobering questions that people have raised  throughout history.  </P> <P> If the 12 songs don't ever come out and directly ask, "What's it all about,  Alfie?," the best ones do touch on root-matters of life; they are gentle  expressions of personal and spiritual love, often set against the approaching  gray cloud of mortality suggested by the grave-site image of the title.  </P> <P> The large cast of musicians includes Elvis Costello, who co-wrote four songs  and provides a sharp, Lennonesque bite in the brassy, desperate "You Want Her  Too." But McCartney's clear and disarming personal vision marks the most  haunting moments: the parent-child affection of "Put It There," the romantic  devotion of "This One," the prayerlike grace of "Motor of Love" and the  nostalgic toast of "We Got Married."  </P> <P> One of the reasons McCartney's solo work has been so erratic is that he often  finds it difficult to reveal himself. When he allows himself to be intimate, he  can be an especially poignant artist. The best moments of "Flowers in the Dirt"  showcase that intimacy. ROBERT HILBURN  </P></p>

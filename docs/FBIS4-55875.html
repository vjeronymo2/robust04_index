			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report]  <H5>  Process Generally Orderly, Democratic </H5>   Reports appearing in the Hungarian media indicate that in  general the parliamentary election campaign and the first round  of balloting on 8 May were orderly and democratic, although the  campaign was marred by some irregularities. Gyula Horn, chairman  of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) -- which led the field  in the first round of voting -- declared that on the whole the  "tone" of the electoral campaign was "acceptable" (MAGYAR  NEMZET, 6 May), while National Electoral Committee Chairman  Janos Nemeth said that "the campaign was less rough than  expected" (NEPSZABADSAG, 9 May). Duncan Schiels, a spokesman for  the foreign journalists accredited to Budapest, said that the  campaign was so "calm" that it was "boring" (NEPSZABADSAG, 6  May), while a delegation of ethnic Hungarians from Romania who  toured the country to monitor the elections stated that the  election process was "incredibly civilized" compared to Romanian  elections (HETI MAGYARORSZAG, 13 May). A "moderate tone"  characterized the debate of prime ministerial candidates and  party leaders, according to MAGYAR NEMZET on 6 May, and the  voting itself was apparently considered fair in most quarters;  no reports of violations had been observed in the media as of 11  May.  <H5>  Biased Television Coverage Alleged </H5>   Although the election process was deemed satisfactory in  general, some sources indicated that it was marred by a serious  flaw -- Hungarian Television's biased coverage, which  purportedly discriminated against opponents of the main  government party, the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF).  NEPSZABADSAG reported on 4 May that "the majority" of the  parties were "dissatisfied with the behavior of Hungarian  Television." According to the paper's 5 May issue, an MSZP  spokesman declared that his party could show "proof" that the  state television system was conducting a "negative campaign  against the Socialists" and was "not neutral in its program  policies." Similarly, Gabor Kuncze, prime ministerial candidate  of the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), charged that  although he expected the voting and the counting of ballots to  be "legal," the lack of fair television campaign coverage  compromised the election. "The fact that evening after evening  the television drums the same opinions into the viewer without  publicizing the other parties' programs is not only unethical,  but also dangerous," because it prevents voters from making an  informed choice, Kuncze said (NEPSZABADSAG, 4 May). The  Independent Smallholders Party also filed a complaint saying  that the main television news program gave no information about  the party's program (MAGYAR HIRLAP, 22 April).  <H5>  Charges Against MDF </H5>   Hungary's high court ruled invalid the charges that the MDF  had abused access to government information for campaign  purposes. After the SZDSZ accused the MDF of using government  data to identify first-time voters and people who had benefited  from the government's compensation program to send them campaign  letters, the National Electoral Committee decided that the MDF  had acted "against the law," but the decision was struck down by  the Supreme Court. The Court said that the Electoral Committee  had "no authority to condemn anyone" and that its accusation was  also "faulty in its content" because the electoral law gives  parties access to lists of citizens in specified groups "under  certain circumstances." Saying that it had been vindicated, the  MDF charged that the National Electoral Committee had lost its  neutrality because the representatives of some parties on the  multiparty committee, "especially the SZDSZ," were using the  National Electoral Committee meetings to conduct a "political  campaign" (MAGYAR HIRLAP, 22 April).  <H5>  Defaced Posters </H5>   The campaign irregularity reported most frequently by the  media was the defacement of campaign posters, but reports  disagreed on the extent of the damage. NEPSZABADSAG on 5 May  charged that campaign posters "nationwide" were pasted over with  rival posters and that MSZP, SZDSZ, and Federation of Young  Democrats (Fidesz) posters were defaced with "slanderous  slogans," including anti-Semitic graffiti. Other sources  confirmed that defacement had occurred but suggested that it was  confined to certain areas. Members of the ethnic Hungarian  delegation touring Hungary before the election said that the  posters they saw throughout the country were defaced only "in a  very few places" (HETI MAGYAR0RSZAG, 13 May), while a "citizens  network" that monitored the election indicated that anti-Semitic  slogans and other graffiti were a problem in Budapest, including  in the capital's 20th District (MAGYAR HIRLAP, 4 May).  <H5>  Other Alleged Irregularities </H5>   According to the "citizens network," the defacement of  posters was just one of "countless refined and crude" attempts  to "consciously mislead" voters. Some parties and candidates,  said the group, were guilty of "cheating" in the process of  gathering nomination slips and of making verbal attacks that  violated electoral ethics. In some cases, the group alleged,  nomination slips were stolen from mailboxes and sold "in large  numbers" for 300 forints, while in the city of Vac,  representatives of the far right Hungarian Justice and Life  Party -- which ended up with less than 2 percent of the vote  nationwide in the first round of balloting -- toured gypsy  neighborhoods by car and illegally collected "masses of  nomination slips" for their candidate. In addition, said the  group, although the election ethical codex stipulated that the  parties were not allowed to "denigrate" each other, there were  "plenty of examples" of insulting behavior. One such example,  the group said, was a campaign letter sent out by the MDF  candidate in Budapest's third district which charged his MSZP  opponent with "demagogy," with making "unfounded and  unfulfillable promises," and with trying to "create false  nostalgia, which can lead to the strengthening of the left"  (MAGYAR HIRLAP, 4 May).  <H5>  Little Violence </H5>   The media reported few violent incidents during the  campaign.  The SZDSZ charged that in the city of Gyongyos on two occasions  its campaigners were beaten up by members of the MDF's youth  organization (NEPSZABADSAG, 6 May). In another incident, Fidesz  activists were attacked by unknown assailants in Budapest, but  the victims were not certain that the attack was politically  motivated (BESZELO, 28 April).</p>

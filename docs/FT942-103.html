			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: HTV signs local cable TV programme deal HTV, the ITV company for Wales and the west, has signed a deal to make 500 hours of local programmes annually for 140,000 cable homes throughout the Avon cable franchise area. The two-hour daily programme, described as 'local info-tainment,' is almost certainly the most extensive programming relationship between an ITV company and the cable television industry. Mr David Treadway, managing director of United Artists Communications, which commissioned the new programme, said yesterday its success would open new opportunities for other local programming ventures. The project will be produced by Hybrid TV, a six strong-team of young media graduates hired by HTV. HTV plans to set up two more of the graduate units - one based at Bristol and the other at HTV's Cardiff centre. The programme deal follows the decision by Flextech, controlled by TCI of Denver, the largest cable company in the US, to take a 20 per cent stake in HTV for about Pounds 27m. In another example of new local cable programming, Associated Newspapers plans to launch a 24-hour cable channel, largely based on news, called Channel One.</p>

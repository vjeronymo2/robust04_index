			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, March 15 (CTK) -- Nine Communist Party  parliamentary deputies have signed a letter drafted by their  party and sent on Monday [14 March] to the United States  Congress in support of a congressional initiative to lift  America's 35-year-old blockade of Cuba.    In informing CTK about the letter, however, the chairman of  the party's deputies group, Vaclav Exner, said it would have  been better if more deputies had signed it.    "A number of deputies from the Social Democratic, Liberal  Social Union and Left Bloc deputies groups have expressed their  view that in essence they support ending the blockade of Cuba,"  Exner said. "But it bothers them to a certain extent that the  suggestion came from our group."    The Congressional initiative is being led by Representative  Charles Rangel, who is expected to present it formally this week.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk today took part  in the second round of the election to the Supreme Council of  Ukraine. After taking part in the election, the head of state  granted an interview to representatives of the Ukrainian and  foreign mass media. You are invited to listen to a report filed  by our correspondent Eduard Kotenko.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified journalist] Leonid  Makarovych, as head of our state and its citizen, how do you  envisage the newly elected Supreme Council, if it is elected  today?    [Kravchuk] There is such a notion in statistics and in  sociology as insufficiency of data required for analysis.  Because sociologists take either 1,000 or 1,500 respondents  [pauses] ... It has its own laws.    Well, 90 deputies have been elected by now. At the previous  election we elected, as far as I remember, five out of 33 and  now we have elected four out of 16. Well, they failed to elect  approximately 25 percent of candidates altogether, 20 to 25 in  all. If we apply this figure to the coming elections, 25 percent  is not the kind of figure that would enable one to say that the  Supreme Council will not be elected. At present, we should  speak not about whether or not the Supreme Council will be  elected, but what will be the first steps of the new Supreme  Council, so as to create law-governed and responsible  authorities.    And I think the Supreme Council should gather, and the  deputies, because it is they who are responsible [words  indistinct], should adopt at least three laws: On the status of  the president, on delegating plenary powers, and on a mechanism  of subordinating lower-ranking bodies of the executive power to  higher-ranking bodies of power [words indistinct].    Then the election, if it does take place and if those laws  are adopted [pauses] ... People will know whom they elect and  what [words indistinct] enjoy. If we fail to do this at once,  we will create a source of conflict between the representative  bodies of power and the elected president. He will then say:  Good people, I was elected legitimately as head of state and  head of the executive power. And on which grounds are you  depriving me of these plenary powers? This often happened to  me: First I was granted powers, then I was deprived of them.    Well, we somehow managed to find a common language. But if  everything boils down to confrontation, we will again begin with  what we finished up and we will produce nothing new. This is a  question of principle, a question of principle, indeed. I only  want a legitimate, law-governed Supreme Council to be elected,  based on laws, responsibility, reason, and the real situation.  I would like it to be an authority which assumes control and  works for reforms, for democracy, and for our independent state,  and that it will work on the basis of the law and not on good  wishes only. [end recording]    [Announcer] That was an interview Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk granted at his polling station during the second round  of the election to the Supreme Council of Ukraine. The report  was filed by correspondent Eduard Kotenko.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dimitur Gotsev, former leader of the </F> Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Union of  Macedonian Societies, by Nadelina Aneva; place and date not  given: "Border Between Macedonia and Bulgaria Should Have Been  Formally Recognized Long Ago"]    [Text] Docent Dimitur Gotsev is a lecturer at the History  Faculty of Sofia University and deputy president of the  Macedonian Scientific Institute in Sofia. In 1990 the VMRO-SMD  [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Union of  Macedonian Societies] was restored and he was its leader until  30 March 1992. He is married with two children and lives in  Sofia.    [Aneva] Mr. Gotsev, despite the position adopted by the  Parliamentary National Security Commission, the Ilinden OMO  [United Macedonian Organization] is thinking of holding its  usual convention at the Rozhen Monastery. Is the Bulgarian  Government helpless in this case?    [Gotsev] The lack of any reaction by the Bulgarian  institutions cannot be justified by ignorance, incapacity, or  weakness in addressing this phenomenon. The Bulgarian people  are clearly aware that people outside the country are forcing  our politicians to tolerate this movement in Bulgaria. The  so-called supporters of Ilinden appeared in public after 10  November 1989. They are dangerous and at the same time pathetic  because, despite their conspiratorial origins, they are capable  of destroying our age-old traditions.    [Aneva] Who is responsible for our politicians' inaction?    [Gotsev] Before 10 November 1989 everything came from  Russia, which prohibited and refused us leave us to tell the  truth about the Macedonian question because it had its own  specific interests in the Balkans. Today, this factor no longer  exists, but the same policy continues to prevail, perhaps in an  even more arrogant form. Nevertheless, Serbian provocation on  such a scale, which denigrates everything Bulgarian and declares  that Bulgaria is an occupier, never occurred on our territory  prior to 10 November.    [Aneva] Where does VMRO stand in this situation?    [Gotsev] I think that VMRO is paralyzed and is unable to  affect these events. I cannot otherwise explain how a hostile  foreign organization has appeared to supplant it in the  territory where it is active.    [Aneva] There are many VMRO organizations. Which is the  true one?    [Gotsev] There is only one VMRO, and that is the one formed  by Gotse [Delchev] and Dame [Gruev, cofounders of the first  Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization in 1894]; all the  others -- about a dozen of them -- are false. They are formed  by someone or other and then disbanded when their lords no  longer need them.    [Aneva] Were you replaced by a coup organized to change the  line followed by the organization and to politicize it?    [Gotsev] I was in hospital when the announcement was made  that I had resigned. I think that this was arranged by foreign  embassies, and not only one, but two or three.    [Aneva] What do you think about the VMRO's intention to run  in the next elections?    [Gotsev] At the very outset, when the VMRO was restored,  some people had daydreams about turning it into a party, but so  far it continues to maintain that Bulgaria has enough parties,  and anyone who wants to enter parliament can do so through them.    Our movement is a national one, but has no political color.  No one can close down the VMRO until it has completed the  program outlined by Levski to protect and gather the Bulgarians  in one place.    [Aneva] Is it a realistic prospect that Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] may join  Bulgaria?    [Gotsev] I was one of the first to advise President Zhelev  that we should recognize Macedonia. There was then a chance  that Serbian troops would withdraw from there without a fight.  A referendum was held in which 96 percent of the people in  Macedonia declared for independence. Only a historian can  appreciate what a great event this was; it is one of the great  successes in our modern history. However, out of ignorance or  for other reasons, the Bulgarian politicians failed to use this  event to the benefit of our all-Bulgarian national cause.    [Aneva] What should have been done?    [Gotsev] During these last three years they should have done  everything possible to make the border between Bulgaria and  Macedonia a formal one. If one talks about historic chances,  God gave us such a chance after 100 years. However, to use this  chance the people have to be prepared, and we turned out to be  completely unprepared. Macedonia needed to obtain diplomatic  protection throughout the world, but we failed them. We ought  to have three railroad links by now: from Kumanovo to  Kyustendil, from Kocane to Blagoevgrad, and from Gevgeli to  Petrich. We did nothing to stop the anti-Bulgarian propaganda  there.    [Aneva] It is your idea that we should have a minister  solely in charge of Macedonian problems....    [Gotsev] Greece has a special Ministry for Macedonia-Thrace.  Over 2 million Bulgarians from Macedonia live inside Bulgaria  and there are about another 3 million outside. At least one  person in the Bulgarian Government should know where Macedonia  is and promote all good initiatives connected with Macedonia.  Before 9 September [1944, date of Bulgaria's liberation in  World War II], the government always included people with actual  and emotional connections with Macedonia. At that time, almost  50 percent of the scholars and scientists in Bulgaria were from  Macedonia, plus 50 percent of senior army officers, 50 percent  of the higher clergy, and more than 50 percent of diplomats.  Everywhere where it was necessary to defend the Bulgarian cause  in Macedonia, the Macedonian Bulgarians were in the forefront.  Accordingly, the Macedonian question was a Bulgarian one, and  no one in the world doubted that it was anything else. At  present, not a single Bulgarian in the state institutions and  the top administration is publicly committed to the Macedonian  cause. On the other side of the coin, during the last 50 years  half the diplomats in Serbia came from Macedonia, and many  people from Macedonia were recruited into their army, police,  and all their higher state institutions.    With the help of a few hundred Bulgarians from Macedonia  whom  it has bought, Serbia is holding Macedonia in subjection,  deluding the people into believing that Macedonians in fact rule  them. [Greek] President Karamanlis comes from the village of  Brodi in Aegean Macedonia, and Papandreou's first and second  wives are also Bulgarians from Macedonia. Formerly, when Venko  Markovski, who is also from Macedonia, published a new poem, a  note was always sent from Belgrade and the newspaper editors got  excited. Serbia and Greece did not allow film footage of  Macedonia to be shown in Bulgaria, and our authorities fulfilled  their wishes without question. It is the same thing now.    [Aneva] Nationalism is gaining quite good positions in  Europe, so is it possible for the VMRO to play the nationalist  card in Bulgaria?    [Gotsev] Nationalism does not exist in Bulgaria; it was  destroyed long ago and its sting has been extracted. Today the  Bulgarians have need of much patriotism, and we have to know  what policies we are pursuing, so as not to hate a foreign  nation for no reason. Why should we hate the Serbs and Turks  for exploiting our ignorance?    [Aneva] Do you personally sympathize with Zhirinovskiy, and  is a Bulgarian Zhirinovskiy possible?    [Gotsev] I do not think such a person can appear in our  conditions, but it is more than necessary for a Bulgarian to  appear to put things in order.    [Aneva] You mean a Bulgarian with a strong arm?    [Gotsev] I am not talking about a strong arm, but about a  Bulgarian who knows how to govern the state. It can be an  individual or a government, but it is high time that someone  rescued Bulgaria from this humiliating situation.    [Aneva] Do you see any strong individual in either of the  two main parties at present -- the SDS [Union of Democratic  Forces] or the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party], or in any new  party?    [Gotsev] In the state they are in at present, I do not see  anyone. There may be suitable individuals among them, but they  should come forward.    [Aneva] Who in Macedonia would offer his hand to them?    [Gotsev] At the present, only culture and cultural links can  bring us finally together. In Macedonia there is a strong  intellectual movement that a month ago formed its own  organization, the Movement for Cooperation Between the Republics  of Macedonia and Bulgaria, and it will stage an official  promotion in Skopje on 8 May. A similar movement is also being  formed in Bulgaria.</p>

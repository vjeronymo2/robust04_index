			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / US warns Serbs to halt attacks: Nato discusses air strikes as Bosnian position falls to 'huge offensive' US OFFICIALS yesterday sought to step up pressure on Bosnian Serbs to halt their military advance by presenting to a Nato conference in Brussels plans for tougher military action. Nato ambassadors interrupted talks last night after eight hours to consult their governments on a draft resolution on possible action within a United Nations framework. This was expected to include air strikes, which have been at the forefront of Washington's proposals. In Geneva, however, international mediators warned that the threat of air strikes, and the surge of fighting in Bosnia, could stall the peace process. In Sarajevo, Mr Ejup Ganic, the Bosnian vice-president, said Serb forces had captured Mount Bjelasnica, a key Bosnian position which overlooks the besieged capital, in a 'huge offensive'. The attack prompted Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, to threaten to pull out of the peace negotiations if the Serbs did not give up their latest prize. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, was reported to have agreed to surrender the mountain to UN control. Speaking in public for the first time since the talks started last week in Geneva, Mr Izetbegovic called for international military action in the area. 'We are carrying on talks without counting on any kind of military action . . . although we think it would be high time for the Americans and international community to come to our defence,' he said. As Nato ambassadors met, President Bill Clinton said in Washington he expected the allies to agree on a strategy. 'I don't believe the allies will permit Sarajevo to either fall or to starve,' he said. 'I think we'll have a common position.' Reflecting attempts to force the pace on the issue, Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, said the US was determined to 'move forward quickly' to break the Sarajevo siege through air strikes. In a private letter to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, he said air power must be put 'at the service of diplomacy'. Disagreement remains over whether the action should be limited to protecting the Nato ground forces and their humanitarian efforts or extended to enforcing the 'safe areas'.</p>

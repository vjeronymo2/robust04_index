			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Be determined by the State agency to be capable of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making presumptive eligibility determinations on the basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of preliminary information on family income; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Meet one of the following conditions: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Be receiving funding from the migrant health centers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or community health centers programs under sections 329,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 330, or 340 of the Public Health Service Act; funding from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the maternal and child health services block grant program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under title V of the Social Security Act; or funding under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Be participating in the Special Supplemental Food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program for Women, Infants, and Children established under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 17 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, or in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commodity Supplemental Food Program established under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 4(a) of the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 1973.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Be participating in a State perinatal program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Be the Indian Health Service or a health program or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility operated by a tribe or tribal organization under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Indian Self-Determination Act (Pub. L. 93&hyph;638). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All providers who meet the criteria listed above must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be considered qualified providers. Therefore, if a State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines that a provider is not capable of making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presumptive eligibility determinations for pregnant women,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that provider would not be considered ``qualified'' to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these determinations. We would permit States to exclude a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider that is qualified only under very narrow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances; that is, if a State can demonstrate that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is good cause to exclude the provider. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we wish to give States maximum flexibility in meeting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needs of pregnant women and, therefore, propose to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States to determine whether a program is a ``State perinatal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In interpreting the provisions of section 1920(b), we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would require States to provide qualified providers with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proper screening forms for pregnant women to request a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision of presumptive eligibility. We also would require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the States to provide instructions to qualified providers on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> how to apply the gross income criteria under the various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility groups under the State's approved Medicaid plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and how to determine the highest income criteria group under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the pregnant woman is most likely to be eligible if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> she applies for regular Medicaid. We are not prescribing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the specific content and format of the screening forms or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions. However, we expect State instructions to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in enough detail to allow a qualified provider (based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preliminary information provided by a pregnant woman) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make reasonably accurate income eligibility determinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 1920(c)(1), we would require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agencies to furnish qualified providers with regular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid application forms and train them to assist pregnant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> women who wish to apply in completing and filing these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forms. As provided by section 1920(c)(3) of the Act as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended by section 4605 of OBRA '90, the application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided may be an application developed by the State for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use by pregnant women who wish to apply as low-income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pregnant women described in section 1902(l)(1)(A) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1920(c)(3) of the Act seems to contemplate an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application for regular Medicaid that is separate from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screening form for presumptive eligibility for ambulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prenatal care. We believe the presumptive eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screening form and the regular Medicaid application can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combined. However, pregnant women cannot be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide all of the information necessary for a full-scale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid application when applying for only presumptive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility. If the forms are combined, a State agency can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offer the pregnant woman the option to complete the entire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application but cannot require that she do so in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish presumptive eligibility. A qualified provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must make a presumptive eligibility determination once a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pregnant woman has provided information about her family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income and cannot require additional information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A presumptive eligibility screening form alone cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be used to establish a filing date for a regular Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application. If a combined presumptive eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screening form and Medicaid application is used and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> woman chooses to complete the entire application, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completed application form must be forwarded promptly to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate State agency for a decision on regular Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility under the plan once the qualified provider makes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a decision on presumptive eligibility. In this situation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the date the completed form is received by the State agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is the Medicaid filing date for Medicaid eligibility. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the woman is determined to be eligible, this date will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the beginning of the period in which she qualifies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the more extensive services under the plan and will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish the month used to determine the dates of the 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months of retroactive eligibility, if the woman would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been eligible during the retroactive period. Under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> latter approach, pregnant women would not be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> file another application. However, they would not be exempt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from meeting with State agency staff as appropriate or from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing additional information necessary to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility under the plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

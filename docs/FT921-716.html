			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Indonesia disbands Dollars 4.75bn aid donor group THE Indonesian government yesterday called in ambassadors from leading donor countries following its unilateral decision on Wednesday to dissolve the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI), the forum through which aid is pledged. Last year Dollars 4.75bn (Pounds 2.74bn) was pledged through the IGGI, but Jakarta has disbanded it after accusing the Netherlands, which chairs the group, of political intimidation. The Netherlands is currently financing 175 projects in Indonesia involving about 250 foreign experts; all the projects have to be terminated within a month. The decision is likely to disrupt work on aid-related projects including education, family planning and development. The Indonesian government said it was reviewing projects financed by the Netherlands. Some would be financed with aid from other donors or funds from the Indonesian government itself and others would probably be postponed. Mr Moerdiono, the state secretary, said relations between Indonesia and the Netherlands, the former colonial power, had 'deteriorated sharply as a consequence of the reckless use of development assistance as. . . a tool for threatening Indonesia'. He said a letter rejecting new and continuing Dutch aid had been delivered to Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, although he stressed all debt repayments would be met. He cited the Netherlands' review of future aid following the killing of civilians by security forces in East Timor last November, and Dutch criticism of the execution in 1990 of six prisoners accused of participating in the 1965 coup attempt, as examples of intimidation. In its official response, the Dutch government said yesterday it was disappointed with the decision and 'deeply regretted the words in which it was phrased'. Mr Moerdiono said that Japan and US, the two leading bilateral donors, had been informed of the decision, although western diplomats in Jakarta described the announcement as a complete surprise. They said the move raises questions over future aid from Canada, which pledged Dollars 40m last year but is also reviewing new aid following the East Timor shootings. Indonesian government officials denied that similar action against Canada was planned. Indonesia has a public and private international debt of about Dollars 65bn and, with a debt service ratio approaching 30 per cent of export earnings, aid-flows are an important source of foreign exchange. For the 1991-92 financial year (ending in April), the Netherlands had pledged Dollars 91m, behind Japan (Dollars 1.3bn), the US (Dollars 133m) and France (Dollars 111m). The World Bank pledged Dollars 1.6bn and the Asian Development Bank, Indonesia's main multilateral donors, Dollars 1.1bn.</p>

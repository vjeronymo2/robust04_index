SEEN  </P> <P> Cambodia's warring factions opened a new round of peace talks in Jakarta,  Indonesia.  </P> <P> The latest negotiations center on a new Australian peace plan calling for the  United Nations to establish a caretaker government in Phnom Penh until free  elections can be held. The talks opened amid a new offensive by the  Vietnamese-backed government to drive resistance forces out of areas they  seized in northwestern Cambodia late last year. There were reports that Vietnam  at one point last October may have sent a contingent of 5,000 to 10,000 troops  back into Cambodia to help bolster the fledgling Phnom Penh army.  </P></p>

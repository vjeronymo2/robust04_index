			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> $1 MILLION RAISED FOR MEASURE M'S COFFERS  </P> <P> Supporters of a half-cent sales tax for transportation have crossed the  $1-million mark in fund raising with just four days left until Orange County  voters decide the fate of the hotly contested measure, according to campaign  reports filed Friday.  </P> <P> The last-minute additions to Measure M's campaign coffers were highlighted by a  $200,000 loan secured by the Irvine Co. and Disneyland. Those two companies  backed an earlier $250,000 loan to the campaign, and their latest loans --  combined with several other gifts and in-kind contributions from other  organizations -- bring the group's total war chest to about $1.14 million.  </P> <P> Reed Royalty, who chairs the Yes on Revised Measure M campaign, said the  contributions and loans will allow supporters of the sales tax to step up their  "education efforts," in the campaign's final days.  </P> <P> "We're doing mailings and telephone calling, and we'll keep doing it right up  until the end," said Royalty, area vice president for Pacific Bell.  </P> <P> Tuesday's election will mark the third time that Orange County voters have  considered a sales tax to pay for transportation improvements. A nearly  identical transportation tax, also called Measure M, was defeated by county  voters last November, 53% to 47%.  </P> <P> But while Royalty and other backers of this year's Measure M predict that their  ample campaign coffers will help strengthen support for the proposal down the  home stretch this time, opponents of the measure remain confident.  </P> <P> "Their polls and their consultants have led them to believe that if they spend  more money, they'll win," said Tom Rogers, a slow-growth advocate from San Juan  Capistrano and a leader of the anti-Measure M campaign. "I just don't believe  that's true."  </P> <P> Support for the measure has remained mixed in recent polls. A late October  Times Orange County Poll found 47% supported the measure, compared to 37% who  opposed it. When respondents were told of specific projects that the proposed  tax would pay for, support increased to 58%. JIM NEWTON  </P></p>

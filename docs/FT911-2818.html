			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / How To Spend It: The heavy mob's out to hook more cooks - Le Creuset makes pots and pans that delight serious chefs and Yuppies alike WHEN IT comes to cookware there is hardly a more blue chip name than Le Creuset. Le Creuset may be heavy to lift, its bright colours not too subtle, its shapes unchanged for generations, but it comes with that priceless thing  -an unshakeable image. For generations of housewives, particularly those whose cooking years were launched by the evocative prose of Elizabeth David, proper food only came in Le Creuset dishes. What other cooking pot was so perfect for transforming a tough piece of beef into a Provencale daube rich with wine and herbs and 'redolent of the deep South'? What other gratin dish so beautifully nurtured a gratin dauphinoise into that delicious combination of crisp topping and rich mush, what saute pan so combined functional sturdiness with deep aesthetic satisfaction? And what other cookware seemed to put one so instantly in touch with an authentic traditional cuisine, making one believe that food and culture were so entwined that only a philistine could neglect it? You might think that any cookware so strongly linked with such specific imagery might have trouble surviving in these no-cook workaholic days. You'd be wrong. Yuppies may not cook but they know a good thing when they see it and Le Creuset is the nearest the kitchen offers to a designer accessory. Even those who don't do much more than open a clingfilm-wrapped packet like to tip it into a comforting traditional dish and when it comes to looking traditional Le Creuset is in a class of its own. In the world of cast-iron nobody else can really touch it - The Danish firm of Copco produces a good small range but it, like its British rival Victor Castwares, lacks that inestimable advantage of a heritage rooted in French bourgeous cuisine. As for those who still do cook, the mood seems to be turning again to the robust bourgeois dishes that nouvelle cuisine so spurned - things like pot-au-feu, gigot d'agneau farci, country terrines - all of which are, of course, perfectly partnered by Le Creuset ware. All this is good news for the company, which last week announced profits up from Pounds 2.67m in 1989 to Pounds 3.1m in 1990. But for all that, nouvelle cuisine must have given them a bit of a scare for the company has been looking at ways and means of injecting 'a little momentum into the product without losing the magic . . . developing new products which would fit alongside the things we already do well.' It has not escaped its notice that the 90s are a health-preoccupied decade with too much fat playing the role of chief villain. Perfectly in tune with both modern fads and the Le Creuset existing range is the new enamelled stainless steel steamer which fits the middle ranges of their existing round casserole dishes - just the thing for producing the crisp, healthy steamed vegetables that foodies fancy today. In white only, prices range from Pounds 11.45 for one to fit the 3 1/3 pint casserole to Pounds 14.95 to fit the 7 1/2 pint model. More than one steamer can be stacked over the same saucepan to separate different flavours but cook in the same way at the same time. The casseroles themselves start at Pounds 20.25. Less aesthetically pleasing than the traditional cast-iron but as attractive as such things can be - given the functional parameters - is a collection of earthenware dishes aimed at the no-cook generation whose chief utensil is the microwave. There are ramekins and glass-lidded casserole dishes and plain oval, rectangular and square dishes. Price start at Pounds 2.65 for the ramekins and go up to Pounds 18.95 for the largest lidded round casserole. Finally, for the green generation there are three splendid enamelled steel non-electric kettles. They can be used on any hob but Aga owners particularly would love them. Sketched here is Zen, fat-bodied and welcoming, it comes in the white, red and black of the traditional cast-iron ware. Most good cookshops, in particular the Elizabeth David Cookshops which always keeps the complete range, and good department stores sell Le Creuset. For those who are not entirely familiar with the existing range it is worth pointing out that the ridged grill pans are the best domestic tool for producing that highly fashionable foodie item, char-grilled vegetables California-style. The ridges give the appetising grill scars and seal in the flavours. Le Creuset offers two - a round 9 in grill and an oblong meat grill while its company stable-mate, Le Cousances (its history is even older and stretches back to 1553) has a square grillomat.</p>

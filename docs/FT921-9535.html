			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: Boeing hit by United's move to cut deliveries UNITED Airlines, one of the three largest US carriers, said yesterday that it planned to take delivery of only 156 new aircraft between 1992 and 1995, compared with the 278 which it had on order or option for this period. The cost of the scaled-back deliveries will amount to Dollars 12.2bn, compared with Dollars 18.9bn had the full 278 aircraft been purchased. Boeing, the Seattle-based aerospace manufacturer, will bear the brunt of the cutbacks. United said that 'the focus of the change' would involve a reduction of 44 Boeing 737s and 60 Boeing 757s. Boeing's response was to point out that no firm orders, nor any options, had actually been cancelled by United; rather that delivery dates had been delayed until after 1995. The Seattle company also said that while the 'rescheduling' had affected some Boeing 737s that were on firm order, in general United's reduced fleet purchases between 1992 and 1995 affected aircraft which had only been under option. Boeing added that the effect of the reductions had been anticipated when it announced plans to reduce the production rate of its 737 aircraft from 21 a month to 14, beginning in October 1992. United, for its part, stressed that it intended to take the full 1992 complement of 66 aircraft - a mixture of Boeing 747s, 757s, 767s and 737s. After reporting its largest-ever quarterly loss of Dollars 252.6m, United last month warned of capital spending cuts of at least Dollars 2bn, blaming the sluggish economic outlook. Yesterday's announcement was designed to provide further detail, the airline said. Its rescheduling of aircraft deliveries follows similar moves by American Airlines, which decided last year to defer some options; allow others to lapse; and extend delivery dates for some aircraft on firm order. On the news Boeing shares shed Dollars 1 5/8 to close at Dollars 48. UAL, United's parent company, fell  7/8 to Dollars 144 1/4 .</p>

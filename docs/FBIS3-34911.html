In two meetings on Saturday and Sunday [12, 13 February],  the  Political Forces Dialogue Committee approved the formation of a  committee to consider views regarding the necessary security  guarantees to begin implementation.    The Political Forces Dialogue Committee also approved the  formation of another committee to prepare the necessary  appendices to the document and draft a statement announcing the  signing of the document. A third committee will take care of  protocol arrangements for the signing ceremony, which will be  held in the Jordanian capital, Amman, on 10 Ramadan,  corresponding to 20 February, per consultations with the  brothers in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.    The Political Forces Dialogue Committee agreed to meet next  Thursday to see what these committees will come up with and make  appropriate decisions.    The Political Forces Dialogue Committee has said it will  continue to be in session, in line with the constitutional,  legal, and procedural guarantees approved by the committee late  last week.</p>

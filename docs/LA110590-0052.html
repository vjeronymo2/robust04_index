			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> FREEWAY ADVISORIES TO BE BROADCAST  </P> <P> Motorists seeking to avoid construction-related delays on the Ventura Freeway  in Los Angeles County can now turn to the airwaves.  </P> <P> The California Department of Transportation is broadcasting traffic advisories  on 1610-AM to warn motorists of lane, ramp and connector-road closures caused  by the Ventura Improvement Project, which will continue until early 1992 in the  San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> The broadcasts in both English and Spanish will air during peak construction  periods between Thursday and Sunday nights, when post-midnight traffic in  certain areas is reduced to a single lane in each direction. Roadside signs  have been erected to alert drivers when the messages are airing.  </P> <P> The $76.1-million project, begun last November, will add a lane in each  direction on a 15-mile stretch between Woodland Hills and Universal City.  </P></p>

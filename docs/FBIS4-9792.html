			<p>BFN     [Text] On 1 April, the World-Class Sports Conference  featured an address by Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina on the  principal points of Cuba's foreign policy and the role that  sports plays in it:    [Begin Robaina recording] I must stress that our most  significant ambassadors are in the field of sports. Athletes  like Sotomayor, Ana Fidelia, and many others can attract 100,000  people to a stadium. These athletes can tackle the most diverse  issues. None of our diplomats, not the most acclaimed or  trained, can in such a short period achieve what one of our  modest athletes can -- transmit Cuba's image abroad.    I just spoke with our trainer in Thailand. During the first  official meeting in Bangkok with that country's foreign  minister, the number one issue of the talks was Cuba's trainer  there. They wanted to know if we had more and how we do it. I  believe this reflects not only what has already been  accomplished, but what we are willing to do and are capable of  doing.

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Paris unveils trade plan for EC FRANCE yesterday unveiled its plan for a tougher European Community policy against unfair commercial practices, which has become one of Paris's priorities in the Gatt world trade negotiations. France is proposing that Europe should imitate the US in instituting speedier and more automatic anti-dumping investigations and in aggressively retaliating against unfair trade practices, including those of the US, partly as a means of getting Washington and other Gatt partners to give Gatt greater powers to police world commerce. In the four-page memo which it has sent EC partners, France proposes the EC executive should be allowed more leeway to investigate European industry's complaints about dumped or subsidised imports and to impose punitive duties. Specifically, it backs a Commission plan which would make it harder for EC governments to stop the EC executive imposing dumping duties or safeguard restrictions against imports. Mr Gerard Longuet, France's trade and industry minister, cited a recent EC-US trade liberalisation deal in heavy electrical equipment, re-opening of talks on Japanese car imports into Europe, and recent curbs on imports of Russian aluminium and East European steel to show the EC could flex its commercial muscles. Yesterday saw the arrival of German officials in Paris to discuss France's ideas about refashioning the draft US-EC farm agreement. Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister, said the two countries positions 'are not yet harmonised'.</p>

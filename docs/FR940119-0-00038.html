			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Montana's program revisions include a requirement that conditionally exempt small quantity generators keep records of waste analyses for three years (ARM 16.44.402(2)(d)). This provision is broader in scope than the federal requirement and is not a part of the federally authorized program. Requirements more stringent than those of the federal program are found in ARM 16.44.402(3) and 16.44.109(19). These provisions require annual, rather than biennial, reporting for state generators and treatment, storage, and disposal facilities. More stringent provisions are a part of the federally authorized program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> C. Decision <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> I conclude that Montana's application for program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, Montana is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program as revised. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the State of Montana and the Environmental Protection Agency may have potential disagreement as to the scope of the State's jurisdiction over certain lands within ``Indian Country'', as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151, Montana has not requested authorization of its hazardous waste program, as revised, within ``Indian Country'' in Montana. Accordingly, today's decision to grant Montana final hazardous waste authorization, as revised, does not extend to ``Indian Country''. The Environmental Protection Agency retains all hazardous waste authority under RCRA which applies to ``Indian Country'' in Montana.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Montana now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitation of its revised program application and previously approved authorities. Montana also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA and to issue orders under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Montana has submitted draft applications for the hazardous waste program provisions in clusters non-HSWA V and VI, HSWA I and II, and RCRA I and II. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance With Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability of certain Federal regulations in favor of Montana's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 271 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Confidential business information, Hazardous materials transportation, Hazardous waste, Indian lands, Intergovernmental relations, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Water pollution control, Water supply. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  This notice is issued under the authority of sections 2002(a), 3006 and 7004(b) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended 42 U.S.C. 6912(a), 6926, 6974(b). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: December 30, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jack W.

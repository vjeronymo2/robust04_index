			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Euroinsurers suddenly come to life - But, there are serious doubts about their sustaining this recovery The European insurance sector is suddenly showing signs of life after a year in which it has seriously underperformed the markets as a whole. The shares of the French companies Axa, Assurances Generales de France (AGF) and Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) rose by around 10 per cent in the first half of the week, for example, while UK companies Royal and Sun Alliance and Sweden's Skandia were also up sharply. Analysts have put forward the possibility of shifts in German economic policy and lower interest rates to explain the shift in sentiment. However, the scope for recovery appears to be limited. In the longer term, fears about asset deflation, increased competition and higher claims are likely to undermine investor confidence. 'There is growing unease about the trend towards an asset deflationary environment,' says Mr Angus Runciman, an analyst with BNP Securities, whose insurance index shows that insurance shares, until just over a week ago, had underperformed the broader European markets by 27 per cent since August 1991. 'We doubt that the sector is on course to repeat the very strong performance of the mid-1980s.' The severity of the insurance sector's underperformance has been heavily influenced by events in Scandinavia where the failure of ambitious takeover plans has led to turmoil on the markets. But German, Spanish, Italian and French insurance shares have also been hit, falling by between 15 and 20 per cent in the third quarter alone. A fall in asset prices is one of the main reasons. Over the past few years a number of major European companies have spent heavily on overseas acquisitions, dissipating a hitherto unused pool of investment assets. French companies, in particular, have been hit by a fall in property prices. Their investments in property account for about 75 per cent of shareholders' funds, according to Mr Bob Yates, an analyst with Fox Pitt Kelton. Falls in property values of up to 30 per cent have reduced the scope for realised capital gains, which have traditionally bolstered bottom-line profitability, and left insurance companies' banking subsidiaries with losses on property-related loans. Many continental European companies account for their assets at historic rather than market cost, limiting the real damage to balance sheets from the fall in asset values. Even so investors' perceptions have been adversely affected. 'Events in Scandinavia have prompted people to ask whether the assets are really there. Markets are beginning to realise how quickly assets can be eroded,' says Mr Runciman. Mr Yates agrees: 'It's psychological. People are aware that assets are falling and they lose interest in insurers. There is a 'feel bad' factor at work.' Whereas in the bull markets of the 1980s investors were attracted by the rapidly rising asset values of insurers, in the 1990s they are looking increasingly at earnings. Yet this is at a time when profitability is being squeezed. While falling interest rates have depressed investment income, rising claims and continuing competition are hitting underwriting results. Insurers have been taken by surprise by the increase in claims frequencies this year, says Mr Tim Dawson, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, citing the sharp increase in car thefts in France, Italy, Germany and the UK. 'The earnings quality of German and French companies has been seriously eroded because of the rise in non-life claims,' he adds. At the same time, overcapacity and the continuing threat of rate competition is undermining the scope for rate increases. This is particularly the case in markets like Germany and the Italy, where rates for personal lines insurance have been maintained at artificially high levels. Although the new European framework for cross-border trading has only just been agreed, many companies are only beginning to adapt their strategies, and capital is still trapped inside national boundaries. However, the supply of capital into the industry could be increased by the entry of banks into insurance, especially in the home, motor and life insurance markets. 'I'm not sure that rate increases are sustainable,' says Mr Runciman. 'New capital will come in as soon as there is any upturn, blunting recovery.'</p>

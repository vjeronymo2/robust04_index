			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marica Lalovic] </F>   [Text] The talks that Radovan Karadzic, president of the  Srpska republic, and Aleksa Buha, foreign minister of the  republic of Srpska, held with a seven-member international  contact group, a working body for establishing peace in the  former Bosnia-Herzegovina, ended in Pale today.    After the talks, which were held behind closed doors, Aleksa  Buha, foreign minister of the republic of Srpska, and German  representative Michael Steiner made brief statements. Steiner  said that the group had presented its views and ideas and that  several interesting views and positions had been presented  during the talks. We sincerely hope that the ideas that we  presented here will be accepted, and that will have an effect on  the Serbian side, because our motive is to turn the situation  toward peace, Steiner said.    Aleksa Buha, foreign minister of the republic of Srpska,  said  that the group that came to Pale today to hold talks with the  representatives of the republic of Srpska should connect up the  broken threads of the peace process again. The two sides  exchanged views on that today. Our side, the Serbian side,  wanted the contact group to note everything that has happened in  the mean time, the bombing, the ultimatums, and the creation of  the Croatian-Muslim federation. We wanted the peace process to  continue with a different methodology and we informed the  representatives of the contact group about that.    Buha also said that both sides share the view that a good  start was made today and that they should continue in the same  direction.</p>

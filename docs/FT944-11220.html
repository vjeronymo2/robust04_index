			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (15): Slow, painful progress - Banking and financial reforms When the third plenary session of the 14th central committee of the Chinese Communist Party approved sweeping reforms of the financial sector in November 1993, the decision was hailed as a breakthrough. Twelve months later it is clear that actual reform of the banking system will prove painfully slow, and that it will be many years before China has constructed a modern financial sector to match its growing economic weight internationally. One indication of the difficulties involved in pressing ahead with financial reforms is the fact that the new Central Bank law is making slower-than-expected progress through the review mechanisms of the standing committee of the National People's Congress, some of whose deputies are wary of plans to expand the bank's authority. Discussion has focused on the role of a powerful monetary policy committee, to be established under the law. Sections of the bureaucracy such as the planning apparatus, which have been used to the People's Bank acting as a milch cow for their needs, are nervous about proposals to increase its independence. Among key elements of the new law is an end to the bank's direct financing of the budget deficit. Membership of the monetary policy committee will, of course, be crucial to exerting continuing influence over the central bank as it becomes a more independent institution under the planned financial sector reforms. The People's Bank governor would be chairman, and members would come from ministries as well as the central bank itself. Last November's party plenum nominated three areas for the transformation of the People's Bank into an institution that would, in theory, wield much the same power as its counterparts in North America, Europe and Japan, though under present circumstances it is difficult to envisage any Chinese institution freeing itself from fairly pervasive political influence. Under the plenum directive the People's Bank would first carry out independent monetary policy to maintain a stable value of the currency and to enforce financial regulations: in other words, lead the fight against inflation. The monetary policy committee would lay down guidelines for managing monetary and credit policy. Secondly, gradual implementation of the reforms would see the replacement of the credit plan by indirect instruments of monetary control such as interest rates and open market operations. The latter has begun in limited fashion through the trading of People's Bank bills on the Shanghai exchange. Thirdly, it is proposed that regional 'suprabranches' of the central bank be established to replace existing branches in provinces, cities and towns. This streamlining and strengthening of the People's Bank supervisory apparatus would be aimed at countering political influence at provincial level, one of the main threats to central bank independence. Other elements of financial sector reform endorsed by the party plenum included the transformation of the specialised banks into commercial banks, and also the conversion of rural and urban credit co-operatives into small-scale banks serving the credit needs of small-to-medium-sized enterprises and the local economy. Finally, the plenum sanctioned the establishment of three policy banks to separate policy lending from commercial lending, thus creating favourable conditions for transforming the specialised banks into commercial banks. China's big four specialised banks, which include the Industrial and Commercial Bank (ICBC), the Agricultural Bank (ABC), the Bank of China (BOC), and the People's Construction Bank (PCBC) are weighed down by policy lending responsibilities, chief of which is an obligation to continue propping up failing state enterprises. The three new policy banks are the State Development Bank (SDB), responsible for channelling long-term development credit to infrastructure and the state's key industrial projects, the Agricultural Policy Bank (APB), and the Export-Import Bank (EIB) whose mission is defined as lending to trade projects guided by trade policy considerations. In addition to the central bank law, a commercial bank law, the Banking Act, is also in preparation. This would define the legal rights and obligations of the specialised banks towards state enterprises, and in theory provide these institutions with legal protection from being obliged to make 'policy' loans to failing enterprises. While the above constitutes an ambitious programme of reform, Chinese officials themselves freely admit that the task is daunting. Not least of the problems facing institutions like the People's Bank is the sheer numbers of staff that would need to be shed before a meaningful rationalisation of its activities could take place. China's central bank employs 170,000 people in some 2,500 branches and sub-branches spread across the country. Vast numbers of staff would become redundant under a planned new computerised payments system (settlement accounts held by commercial banks at city and county levels would be slashed from 115,000 to 10,000), but it is not clear that the People's Bank is ready to deal with the personnel upheavals that would be involved. The four specialised banks, if they are ever to be transformed into commercial institutions, face a similar problem, although of much greater magnitude. China's 'big four' banks have a total of 120,000 branches and 1.3m employees. But far beyond the administrative barriers to reform of the specialised banks is the overwhelming problem of their obligation to continue funding ailing state enterprises. According to official estimates 20 per cent of loans to state enterprises are non-performing (what the Chinese describe as 'problem' loans), but the truth is that no-one really knows. An indication of the dimensions of the problem can be gleaned from the fact that at the end of 1993, total loans of state banks amounted to Yn2,600 trillion, of which more than 70 per cent was working capital loans mostly to state enterprises. Mr Tang Xu, director of the Graduate School of the People's Bank, commented ruefully in a recent article: 'Some of the enterprises are losing money and cannot repay loans on time, but the banks have no means to force them to do so. Worse still, they often have to increase loans to help maintain (political) stability . . . the balance sheets of the banks, however, do not accurately reflect the situation and may even record profits because of the accrued interest from these loans.' China's World Bank advisers say that while progress in the reform of both the operations of the central bank and the specialised banks will depend to a large extent on stopping the haemorrhaging of state enterprises, glimmers of promise lie in the fact that Chinese bankers now appear to have a better understanding of what is required to deal with the problem. But as with other developing countries China lacks the skilled manpower in its regulatory agencies, such as the central bank, to monitor developments and exercise control, especially at provincial and county level. A weakness of the new central bank law is the lack of provision for the adequate supervision of non-bank financial institutions such as trust and investment companies, some of which are offshoots of the banks themselves. This is clearly an unsatisfactory state of affairs. As a World Bank official says: 'Reforms of the financial sector still have a long, long way to go.'</p>

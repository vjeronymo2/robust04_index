			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Irish Life pays maiden 3p IRISH LIFE reported a 4.3 per cent drop in premium income for the first six months of 1992, from IPounds 324.9m to IPounds 311m (Pounds 293m), but declared a maiden interim dividend of 3p. The company, privatised in July last year, is the largest life and pensions insurer market in the Irish Republic, as well as that country's biggest fund manager. On the basis of a 1:2 interim/final split, the total dividend will be up by 10 per cent on 1991 according to Mr John Hogan, head of research at Riada stockbrokers in Dublin. 'This is up to the market's best expectations', he said. Irish recurring premiums were up 3 per cent to IPounds 135.9m (IPounds 131.9m). The overall downturn was due to the combination of a 10 per cent fall in single premium business in the home market to IPounds 61.3m (IPounds 67.9m), and a sharp fall in the US where new business at its Interstate Assurance subsidiary fell to IPounds 26.8m (IPounds 43.7m).</p>

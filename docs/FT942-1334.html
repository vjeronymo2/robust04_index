			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Exceptionals behind 56% rise to Pounds 22m at Courts Courts, the home furnishings retailer, yesterday became the second UK company to pay foreign income dividends, but went one step better than its predecessor, BAT, by offering to absorb the tax cost for investors. Courts is increasing the final pay-out by 36 per cent to 5p, for a total 27 per cent ahead to 7p. The increase in the final dividend represents a 9 per cent improvement on the previous final, plus an additional 25 per cent rise on the higher pay-out to protect shareholders from a 25 per cent tax burden. Mr Bruce Cohen, chief executive, said the decision to pay FIDs would benefit both investors and the company by helping to eliminate its advance corporation tax surplus. Courts was likely to continue paying further FIDs, given its unrelieved ACT burden of some Pounds 4.2m, he added. Mr Cohen was speaking at the announcement of Courts' results, which showed a 56 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 22.1m for the year to end-March. The outcome included an exceptional credit of Pounds 9.43m following the flotation of a stake in its Singapore subsidiary and property losses. The results were about Pounds 2m below expectations, with analysts expecting profits of Pounds 15m before the Singapore credit. Forecasts for the current year were pulled back from about Pounds 17m to Pounds 14m and the shares fell 24p to 779p. The disappointment came from dull trading and adverse currency movements in the Caribbean region. Courts' other overseas businesses continued to move ahead, particularly in south-east Asia. Sales of overseas businesses grew by 26 per cent to Pounds 148m, with profits before deferred income and exceptional credits up by 16 per cent to Pounds 22.6m. Transfers to deferred credits rose by 30 per cent to Pounds 11.8m. The transfers arise from Courts' hire purchase scheme, which is particularly popular in Asia. Courts finances the lease deals itself, but does not take the income from product sales into profits until payments are made. This is put into a deferred profit reserve which stood at Pounds 49.3m at the year-end. This would eventually flow through to profits, Mr Cohen said. The UK had shown signs of a recovery in the housing market, although it was still 'far from buoyant', said Mr Cohen. Nevertheless, Courts was encouraged enough to revive its expansion programme, which had been on hold for some time. Five new superstores were planned for this year, to bring the total to 34. Earnings rose by 73 per cent to 65.36p. Excluding the exceptional credit, earnings were 21 per cent higher at 31.17p.</p>

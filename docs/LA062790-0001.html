			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW YORK CARDINAL O'CONNOR'S WARNING TO CATHOLIC POLITICIANS  </P> <P> Thomas was correct when he said that Catholic legislators who cannot carry out  their job in an ethical way should resign. No responsible Catholic can support  the unjust killing of the unborn, and any Catholic who exalts this grisly  attitude should be excommunicated, if for nothing else, reality therapy.  </P> <P> According to science, a unique human being is created with all the biological  necessities for life at conception, and one hour later he starts a process of  development which will last a lifetime. For the individual who is subject to  murder, there is no difference between killing him in the first trimester, the  second trimester, infanticide, genocide, or at the age of 35. It's all the same  human being in different stages of development.  </P> <P> JEFFREY W. WEISS  </P> <P> Arcadia  </P></p>

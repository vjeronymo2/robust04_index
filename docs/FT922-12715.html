			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / World Trade News: US seeks negotiated end to beer row with Canada THE US will delay retaliatory duties on Canadian beer imports while trying to negotiate an end to a dispute over dismantling trade curbs on US beer sold in Canada, Mr Julius Katz, deputy US trade representative, said yesterday, AP reports from Washington. Canada had agreed to relax the curbs over three years, but the US rejected this, saying it would take too long to implement. The US had threatened to impose retaliatory duties on Canadian beer imports to the US starting on April 10 if Canada did not act quickly to remove the barriers. 'The Canadian response has been disappointing to date, but we have decided to delay for a short time, in the hope we can achieve a negotiated solution that will provide significant non-discriminatory market access by this summer for US beer in Canada,' Mr Katz said. Pending the outcome of talks, the US Customs Service would withhold liquidating duties on Canadian beer entered or withdrawn for consumption from warehouses. No extra cash deposits or bonds would be needed.</p>

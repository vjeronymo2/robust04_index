			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Arts: Maazel and the Bavarians - Concert Great Orchestras of the World is a bold title for a concert series. It invites questions. The latest visitor to the Barbican was the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra with its music director since last year, Lorin Maazel. The orchestra is well-known from its recordings with two earlier directors, Rafael Kubelik and Sir Colin Davis, as well as its radio concerts broadcast in Britain by the BBC. Maazel offered two monumental symphonies as calling cards, Mahler's Ninth on Sunday evening and Bruckner's Eighth on Monday. Maazel is certainly a vivid conductor - some would say a bit a flashy. It is hard to ignore his balletic manner on the rostrum, which veers between elegant nonchalance and a limp wrist at one extreme, and exaggerated miming of the expressive effect he wants to achieve at the other. But he certainly got results. He had the strings seated in a different arrangement from usual, with the violas to his right, cellos facing the audience, and second violins behind the firsts on his left. This produced a good balance and it dramatised the contribution of the violas as well as allowing the cellos a more direct impact. All the strings played marvellously; the violins were warm and silky in the unfolding sighs of Mahler's first movement and superbly controlled, without any ragged attacks or frayed endings in the long, fading farewells of the fourth movement. In the two middle movements the woodwind players enjoyed themselves visibly as well as audibly, smiling gleefully when the E flat clarinet squealed wildly in the Rondo-Burleske. For all that, the sound as a whole was perhaps too healthy and plump to be quite as sardonic as Mahler intended, and he might have wanted the second movement Landler to be more clod-hopping and uncouth. Still, as a whole, it was a really committed involving performance. Bruckner's Eighth Symphony on Monday evening was even finer, and gave no cause for questions about character. The warmth of the woodwind, with notable rapport between principal flute and clarinet, a beautifully focused oboe, the beefy and absolutely reliable brass - all were a joy. And again, those marvellous strings remained disciplined, strong and ardent in the severest test of their stamina. The eighth has darker, more sinister shadows than Bruckner's preceding symphonies, and its sense of uplift is achieved through sometimes painful dissonances; yet they are rendered as objective natural forces by the immense spaciousness of the design and Bruckner's characteristically abrupt juxtaposition of material. Maazel, conducting from memory, steered with a totally satisfying sense of pace. The work lasted more than 90 minutes yet it never felt protracted: the audience sat rapt. The Bavarians certainly earned their place in this series.</p>

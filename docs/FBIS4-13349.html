			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of statement issued by Interior Ministry, date not </F> given]    [Excerpts] Riyadh, 18 Apr -- The Interior Ministry has  issued a statement saying it is aware that individuals coming to  the Kingdom to perform the pilgrimage are carrying books and  leaflets for political, propaganda, or ideological aims. The  following is the text of the statement:    [Passage omitted] Every year and in days similar to these, a  happy occasion hovers over Muslims, when the hearts of believers  flutter as they go through these days with their hearts full of  faith. [passage omitted]    This Ministry has noticed that brother individuals coming  here are carrying -- either with good intentions, and that is  what we believe, God willing, or with a desire to exploit this  honorable occasion -- books, photographs, and leaflets for  political, propaganda, or ideological aims which would have an  effect on some people or directly harm others, contradicting the  noble aim of the pilgrimage.    Accordingly, the Ministry of the Interior, acting on the  information it has received, draws attention to the fact that  such things are totally prohibited. The Ministry hopes to give  pilgrims the chance to perform their rituals with reverence and  without being distracted from the worship that is the purpose of  their visit. While stressing this, the ministry hopes that  everyone will abide by the above and not overstep the rules.  Anyone breaking the rules will be punished and returned to the  place he came from.    Punishment will be decisive for anyone found carrying  prohibited material of any kind. The Kingdom's system of  punishment will be applied without leniency or mercy, because  this Ministry's responsibility is to protect the safety of  pilgrims and citizens and to ensure that this Kingdom is an  oasis of goodness and safety for all those coming to the house  of God or to visit the Prophet's mosque.    While the Ministry stresses the above to all pilgrims, it  would like at the same time to remind them of Allah's words:  "For hajj are the months well known. If anyone undertakes that  duty therein, let there be no obscenity nor wickedness, nor  wrangling in the hajj. And whatever good ye do, be sure Allah  knows it. And take provision with you for the journey, but the  best of provisions is right conduct. So fear Me, O ye that are  wise." [Koranic verse]</p>

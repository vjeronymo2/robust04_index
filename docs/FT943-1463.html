			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness upset Distiller Guinness tumbled 13 to 448p, in trade of 7.2m after the group reported figures at the bottom end of market expectations. Interim profits improved by Pounds 15m to Pounds 320m against market expectations of between Pounds 320m and Pounds 330m. Several brokers moved to downgrade full year profit expectations. They included Smith New Court, a bear of the stock over the last six months. The broker reduced its year end forecast by Pounds 24m to Pounds 894m and cut the following year's prediction by Pounds 30m to Pounds 960m. Mr John Beaumont at Smith believes the 'current rating of the shares is too high.' Reports predicting UK interest rates would be around the 10 per cent mark by the end of next year hit banking stocks. National Westminster fell 6 to 470p, while Barclays tumbled 13 1/2 to 554p, in busy trading of 6.5m. Lloyds gave up 9 to 530p. Industrial conglomerate BTR hardened 2 to 306p, on volume of 4.6m after BZW came out with a strong buy recommendation on the stock. Housebuilder Barratt Development gained a further 3 to 181p as analysts digested Wednesday's strong interim results. William Sindall put on 5 to 93p on rumours of acquisition news in the offing. Glaxo took a turn for the better, improving 15 to 574p with 5.8m shares traded. SmithKline Beecham too enjoyed positive territory and added 6 to 428p. Against a weak electricity sector Scottish Power mustered a rise of 6 to 392p with 2m shares traded. The increase came as Panmure Gordon launched a push on the stock, urging investors to buy before the regulatory reviews - which are due in a few weeks. Panmure utilities analyst Mr Angelos Anastasiou said that the Scots power company faces its supply and distribution review in a relatively strong position as it, along with Scots Hydro Electric, was floated with already tight regulation. Scots Hydro also improved yesterday, a rise of 3 to 383p. With the exception of Northern Ireland Electricity, which moved ahead 14 to 385p after a period of lagging the sector, most electricity stocks lost ground. Among them were Eastern which fell 10 to 777p; Midlands which gave up 18 to 799p and London which lost 9 to 717p. Confirmation by South West Water that it was challenging the Ofwat price limit saw the shares slip 5 1/2 to 527p although volume was thin. Shares in Granada Group advanced 7 to 491p, after several brokers recommended the stock. Kleinwort Benson favours the stock as does BZW which said: 'This is a well managed group with good prospects whose shares were recently left behind.' Airports group BAA stood out in a mostly lacklustre transport sector, rising 6 to 475p. Reports suggesting that Mr Rupert Murdoch, Chairman of media group News International is on the verge of setting up his own wholesale distribution network continued to exact a toll on several stocks. WH Smith gave up another 10 to 450p, while John Menzies fell 18 to 564p. Talk of a share buy-back plan at GUS following Northern Electricity's move on Wednesday saw the retailers shares appreciate 18 to 555p. Northern closed 31 down at 782 on profit taking. British Aerospace was a clear feature for the second day running, bouncing back strongly to recoup almost the whole of the previous day's results-hit losses. NatWest Securities and Hoare Govett both put out positive reports on the company and the upswing in sentiment was enough to push the shares 18 higher to 463p in 3.1m trades. Rolls-Royce, up 2 to 178p, came in for modest buying while controls and compressed air specialist Siebe jumped 12 to 549p on talk of an imminent upgrading of profits forecast by a top securities house. Following interim results the previous day, shares in Laporte slipped back 9 to 740p. Most brokers maintained their forecasts although NatWest upgraded its estimate for this year from Pounds 122m to Pounds 125m. Shares in United Newspapers firmed 2 to 500p after touching a day's high of 513p on company results that were a little above analysts' expectations. A cross by Goldman Sachs of 3.9m shares in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi at 195p, from one fund client to another, was behind the large volume of 7.1m in the stock, or 1.8 per cent of the company.

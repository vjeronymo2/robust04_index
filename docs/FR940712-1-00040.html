			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, management measures, reforestation, improved water quality, and a reduction in pesticide contamination (see factor E below) have enabled the Northern States populations to increase substantially overall. Much eagle nesting and wintering habitat is on publicly owned lands. Many of these lands are protected by habitat management plans and strict eagle nest protection and management guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pacific Recovery Region: Development-related habitat loss continues to be the single greatest factor limiting the abundance and distribution of the species in the Pacific Recovery Region (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1986). Habitat conservation efforts, including laws and management practices by Federal and State agencies and efforts by private organizations, have helped to facilitate bald eagle population increases in the Pacific Recovery Region since the 1960's. For example, interagency working teams in six of the seven Pacific Recovery Region States have developed implementation plans to address local issues more specifically than the recovery plan. Bald eagle habitat guidelines have also been incorporated into development covenants and land use. California and Washington have rules relating to bald eagles on private lands to encourage landowners to maintain nesting territory habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Southeastern Recovery Region: The accelerated pace of development activities within eagle habitat and the extensive area involved are the most significant limiting factors in the Southeastern Region. The cumulative effects of many water development projects impinge on the ability to maintain current nesting populations and ultimately may limit the extent to which recovery may occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To reduce these threats, habitat management guidelines are used to minimize development disturbance in and around nests. Several counties and municipalities have adopted the guidelines in their land use and zoning policies. In addition, a significant amount of new habitat has been created in the form of manmade reservoirs. Reservoirs primarily provide wintering and non-nesting habitat, but are used by nesting eagles as well (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1984, 1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, many of the States have or have had active hacking/reintroduction programs. Rehabilitation and release of injured eagles occurs throughout the Southeastern Region (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1984, 1989). As a result of these and other efforts, the bald eagle nesting population in the Southeastern Region has more than doubled in the past 10 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Southwestern Recovery Region: In addition to threats common with other Recovery Regions, such as human disturbance and availability of adequate nesting and feeding habitat, the bald eagles of the Southwestern Recovery Region are subjected to a high adult rate of mortality, isolation, heat stress, and nest parasites. The Arizona Bald Eagle Nestwatch Program has significantly increased survival of young by minimizing human disturbance during important incubation periods, and by removing harmful material such as parasites and fishing line debris from nests. However, the high death rate of adults and nestlings and the lack of gene exchange with any adjacent nesting populations, which may cause inbreeding to adversely affect the population's long-term survival, remain limiting; this population continues to require intensive management, particularly around each nest site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hunt et al. (1992) estimate a minimum annual mortality rate of 16 to 22 percent of adult breeding birds and believe it to be much higher. Bald eagles commonly live 20 years in the wild and up to 50 years in captivity (Stalmaster 1987). In the Southwestern Region, adult life expectancy may not exceed 10&hyph;12 years (Hunt et al. 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Historically, the bald eagle in Arizona was more widely distributed but probably was never abundant (Hunt et al. 1992). Prior to 1970, records can be found for 19 pairs of nesting bald eagles in Arizona (Hunt et al. 1992). In 1993, 27 occupied territories were reported for Arizona and 2 for New Mexico totalling 29 for the Southwestern Recovery Region.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Research to date indicates there has been no immigration to this population of bald eagles. According to Hunt et al., this small population is isolated and thus is subject to the genetic, demographic, and environmental threats known to be associated with small populations. For these reasons, the population is in continued need of strict protection and intensive management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There is no legal commercial or recreational use of bald eagles. The Service considers present legal and enforcement measures sufficient to prevent bald eagle extinction or a need to reclassify as endangered. The Service exercises very strict control over scientific, educational, and Native American religious activities involving bald eagles or their parts. With reclassification to threatened, the Service could issue permits for limited exhibition and educational purposes, for selected research work not directly related to the conservation of the species, and for other special purposes consistent with the Act (50 CFR 17.32 and 17.41(a)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

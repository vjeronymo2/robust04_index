			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Bablumyan report: "Emigration from Armenia Has </F> Assumed Character of National Disaster"]    [Text] Yerevan -- The "Unity" [Yedinstvo] Armenian  independent trade union has called on the people of Yerevan to  take to the city's streets on 1 May to announce to the  authorities their determination to launch a struggle for the  nation's survival.    The trade union's leaders illustrated the reality of  national  catastrophe with some quite impressive figures. A family of  four now needs 2,500 drams to buy bread, salt, sugar, kerosene,  and soap. The minimum wage in Armenia is just 176 drams -- less  than $1.    Unemployment is rising rapidly in the republic as a result  of  the collapse of the economy, and mass emigration from Armenia is  assuming the character of a national disaster.    Just recently Armenia itself used to admit and accommodate  Armenian expatriates from many countries. The last of them --  an Armenian from Iran -- returned home in November 1991. Since  then the traffic has been one-way, out of Armenia. Various  figures are cited, reflecting the process of emigration from the  republic -- between 300,000 and 800,000 in the past year. It is  not easy to keep a precise account of the numbers leaving  because the majority of them retain their residence permits,  thus confusing the sociologists' and statisticians' charts.  However, for a republic with a population of just 3 million,  the departure of even 300,000 people is too much. And whereas  people closed their eyes to this fact until recently, it is now  causing serious concern to the authorities who are worried by  the easily predictable demographic and social consequences of  the mass exodus.    The first to feel those consequences are surely the military  commissariats, which have received less than the expected number  of draftees and older military reservists summoned to training  camp. But even if the national army, which is in its formative  stage, has somehow managed to cope with this task, you cannot  say the same for the economic sphere.    At the moment the majority of enterprises are in a state of  enforced idleness. But soon, when the machinery starts working  at last, there will simply be no one to operate it. Many plants  in Armenia today are staffed primarily by people of  preretirement age who are coming to the end of their working  lives. The younger and more energetic people are going into  commerce which, incidentally, could only benefit everyone if  they were starting up business on their own land instead of far  from their native land.    It is not only entrepreneurs who are seeking their fortune  in  countries far and near but also construction workers, engineers,  doctors, and teachers. These are mainly young or middle-aged  people who in a certain sense constitute the hope and flower of  the nation. You can find many of them today in the consular  section of the Russian Embassy in Yerevan. They are trying to  legalize their residence in Russia by obtaining Russian  citizenship. The endless lines of people waiting to receive the  relevant stamp in their passport have forced the consulate to  temporarily stop accepting applications. Meanwhile the number  of applicants for Russian citizenship continues to rise....    Armenian emigres prefer to settle in Moscow, Krasnodar,  Stavropol, and Rostov. However, they are also seeking and  finding shelter in other less promising regions in the belief  that things cannot be worse than they are here.    The number of people wanting to go to the United States,  Europe, and countries in the Near and Middle East has increased  considerably. Besides the language barrier there is another  obstacle on the road to the outside world, and that is the  obvious reluctance of those countries to give refuge to these  unfortunates with no capital of their own.    "In Armenia today there are 107,000 officially registered  unemployed, 652,000 pensioners, 300,000 refugees, and around  100,000 invalids. Another 100,000 are living below the poverty  line and need immediate help," Ashot Yesayan, Armenia's minister  of labor and social security, explained.    These difficult times for Armenia cannot go on indefinitely  but the sooner all those who have been forced to leave their  land return, the sooner they will end. For the moment, however,  the windows in many homes in Yerevan remain dark even on those  rare evenings when the electricity supply is switched on. There  is simply no one to switch the lights on.</p>

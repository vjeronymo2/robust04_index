			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Arts: A touch of class at your fingertips - Television Taken as it comes, television seems increasingly like a shoddy street market where profit via popularity is such a dominant consideration that nothing else is of any real significance. Have you happened across any children's television recently? It looks like a penny arcade of repetitively violent American cartoons, interlarded with chat from youthful presenters who slavishly ape the style and language of the rougher playgrounds, presumably to gain 'street cred'. Much of adult television looks embarrassingly similar, being created, judging from appearances, with just one question in mind: will it be enjoyed by a tired 16-year old full of lager? The answer, of course, is to do everything in your power not to take television as it comes, and this is increasingly easy. For years the trouble was that when you switched on for a programme you really wanted (or just before switching off, having seen it) you found yourself trapped into watching some other rubbish, and when that ended you were lured into yet more nonsense. Today the video recorder allows you to catch just what you want, and to watch it whenever you like. True, channel controllers seem determined not to work to their advertised schedules, but provided you allow five minutes extra at either end you can normally outwit them and tape the whole of whatever you want. For a television critic this system often means finding yourself still stuck in front of the set at 3.00 in the morning. However, it also means that, over the last 10 days for instance, even though I have been bored by the banality of so many new comedies, appalled at the cynical way in which the Sky Sports satellite channel has exploited its exclusive coverage of the cricket World Cup (providing only three or four minutes of cricket between commercial breaks) and depressed by ITV's exhumation of Take Your Pick - all watched off air in real time - I have also been impressed with the standard of journalism achieved by a wide variety of programmes which I would probably never have seen had I not arranged to tape them. Monday brought Coast Of Dreams, the first of a pair of Channel 4 documentaries about the British colonisation of Spain's Costa del Sol. According to custom and practice such a programme should tear the lid off a can of worms to reveal the venality of the host community, the naivety of the expatriates, and the ghastly reality behind the glossy image of a retirement paradise. There were touches of all that, but Malcolm Brinkworth's programme was far more subtle and probed deeper. Without a reporter or even a voice-over he set up a clever comparison between the expectations of Kevin and Pam Smith, new arrivals who were just opening the Swan, and the experiences of Mike and Betti Thompson who have learned the hard way how to serve 186 plates of roast beef and Yorkshire pud at the Bees Knees. If the second programme, reporting from the Spanish viewpoint, is half as revealing it will make a superb pair. On Tuesdays ITV is currently screening Murder Squad, a 'fly on the wall' documentary series which provides a stark contrast to all those other accounts of murder on television, where eccentric detectives, obsessed by opera or modern poetry, solve labyrinthine mysteries on stunningly beautiful locations. Murder Squad does not show us the 'truth' (it shows us that even policewomen have their hair done when they know a television camera crew is arriving) but it gets 170 degrees closer to it than Marple and Morse. These murders are in council flats, hairdressers and night clubs. The detectives are ordinary sounding people, characterised by common sense, routine, weariness and efficiency. The voice-over is intrusively noticeable, doubtless indicating the old mistake of choosing an actor, but Robert Fleming's series gets closer to the mucky and mundane realities of the average murder (judging from experience as a news reporter) than any other series I have seen. Last Wednesday Channel 4 began Letters From St Petersburg, a series of 15-minute programmes made by Kevin Sim, who is staying in the city and sending his material back for sub-titling. Once the most forbidding place to make programmes, Russia now seems to have been transformed into the most accommodating. This opening programme showed us a huge old flat, shared by 15 families, with a whole line of gas stoves in the kitchen, and the inhabitants holding a typically gregarious new year's party. But Sim found resentful would-be shoppers who looked back to the notorious siege of the city as the good old days. Russia's real crisis may be still to come. Wednesday was also the night that BBC2 screened one of those near perfect programmes which turn up once in a blue moon, Miss Pym's Day Out in the 'Bookmark' slot. Producer James Runcie had the incomparable Patricia Routledge playing novelist Barbara Pym, and limited his account of her to a single day in 1977 when she visited London for the Booker Prize ceremony as one of the shortlisted authors. She lost, of course, but that was virtually irrelevant. This 50-minute melange of drama and documentary did not evoke Pym's books by reference, it exemplified her work by embodying her spirit; no mean trick when you are operating in such a dramatically different medium from that of the subject artist. Last week's episode in the BBC2 series about Spain, Fire In The Blood, which is going out on Thursdays, was not the best so far. The trick of running in parallel footage of a football match between Basque and Spanish teams and of the war between Basque separatists and the rest of Spain was effective enough. But this series, produced by Alan Bookbinder, is using an on-screen presenter - Ian Gibson - who does not stop short of indicating his opinion occasionally (invariably politically correct: women good, men bad, and so on). Yet this is not a full blown opinion piece, so we get neither a solid personal view nor a conventional objective report. The sheer strength of the series is proved by the fact that it survives this and still tells us a tremendous amount about Spain. Friday's Arena unfolded the story of David Hampton who, having made a living in New York by passing himself off as Sidney Poitier's son, is now suing for millions over a Broadway play which he asserts 'stole' his life story. Producer Debbie Geller piled irony upon irony to create a programme which told a weird yarn well and was also wonderfully funny. When Hampton's victims declined to be interviewed she had actors portray them . . . the very thing over which Hampton is suing. Her greatest success was to illustrate vividly the celebrity fixation which grips New York and presumably explains Hampton's success. His lawyer, although a millionaire, is desperate to succeed as a singer and readily sang (flat) for Geller's camera. Each of these programmes was a powerful piece of journalism, and each used a distinctive technique. On Sunday came Follow The Money on BBC2 which used yet another: utterly conventional on-screen Hird, interviews with key participants, archive footage, and so on. The material was scarcely new, either: Britain's failure to exploit its inventions such as the jet engine, penicillin and the CAT scanner. However, producer Richard Belfield combined it all to devastating effect; you came away furious and desperate because he made it so clear that we cannot blame just the City, or short-termism, or silly politicians, or unambitious managements, or neglect of R &amp; D, or shareholder greed - we have to blame all of them. With the number, variety and quality of factual programmes on television as impressive as this, it would be absurd to dismiss the medium as having succumbed wholly to street market values. However, the odds against happening across those seven programmes by chance, in the course of casual viewing, must be immense. The only way to be sure of finding what you want, and not being side-tracked, is to look at the schedules beforehand and then programme the video recorder . . . oh yes you can, anyone can, it is one tenth as difficult as driving a car and merely needs a little practice.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Company News: Battle at Foster's comes to a head - Kevin Brown and Bernard Simon examine the issues dividing the brewer's boardroom A backstage battle for control of Foster's Brewing Group, the world's fourth-largest brewer, burst into the open this week with the resignation of Mr Peter Bartels, the group's managing director. At first sight, Mr Bartels' departure appeared to be a victory for Mr John Elliott, the former chairman and chief executive of Foster's, who has been trying to regain control of the company. It also raised again the possibility that the board might bend to pressure from Mr Elliott to sell Courage, Foster's UK brewing subsidiary, or its 50 per cent holding in Molson Breweries in Canada. However, such a sell-off is unlikely. While the balance of power on the Foster's board appears to have shifted marginally in Mr Elliott's favour, the real winner would seem to be Asahi Breweries of Japan, which owns 19.9 per cent of Foster's. Asahi has emerged as the key to control of the boardroom, along with Mr Ted Kunkel, the chairman of Molson Breweries, who is to replace Mr Bartels as Foster's managing director. Foster's has been in turmoil since losing a record ADollars 1.3bn (USDollars 984m) in 1989-90, largely as a result of write-offs connected with non-brewing activities acquired during Mr Elliott's period as chairman. The disastrous result forced Mr Elliott to hand over management to Mr Bartels and become non-executive deputy chairman. But he retained a 58 per cent shareholder in Foster's - then called Elders IXL - through his private company International Brewing Holdings (IBH) - then called Harlin Holdings. Complicating the issue further, IBH had incurred heavy debt to acquire its shares, and was technically insolvent because of the weakness of Foster's stock, its sole asset. Mr Elliott bought some time by selling a 17 per cent stake to Asahi, leaving IBH with debt of about ADollars 2.5bn backed by 38 per cent of Foster's stock. The shares are worth about ADollars 1.6bn at last night's closing price of ADollars 1.90. Mr Elliott has until May to develop a strategy for repaying the debt which will satisfy his main creditors - Hongkong Bank, Citicorp, and BHP, the Australian resources group. His preferred solution is to spin off the group's non-core assets - mainly in property, aviation and finance - into a separate company, which could be floated to provide a capital return of some ADollars 1bn to IBH. However, that option was rejected by the 10-strong board in October after Mr Elliott and the two other IBH directors failed to persuade the two Asahi representatives and five independent directors to agree. Mr Elliott's response was an attempt to depose some of the independent directors at the annual meeting. He backed down only at the last minute after the board agreed to set up a committee - from which Mr Bartels was excluded - to study the IBH plan. Significantly, the compromise was brokered by Asahi, which at that stage appeared unwilling to side with either the Elliott camp or Foster's management, led by Mr Bartels and Mr Nobby Clark, the group's chairman. The deteriorating relations between Mr Elliott and Mr Bartels appear to have come to a head during boardroom discussions on the group's net profit of ADollars 77m for the six months to the end of December. Mr Bartels, backed by Mr Clark and some of the independent directors, argued that Foster's need to strengthen its balance sheet was so great that it should pass the dividend, as it had in the second half of the previous year. However, Mr Elliott's demand for a return to dividend payments was supported by the two Asahi directors, who backed a payout of three cents a share - equivalent to 87 per cent of profits. Asahi's action appears to have convinced Mr Bartels that his position was untenable. However, analysts say the Japanese brewer supported a resumption of dividends because of its own financial problems, rather than in support of Mr Elliott. Ms Eleanor Marsh, brewing analyst at SG Warburg in Tokyo, says Asahi is committed to capital expenditure of Y37bn (USDollars 276.5m) this year, but forecasts cash flow of only Y24.2bn. In addition, the group faces repayment of warrants totalling Y185bn in March and August next year. 'They are having a bit of a problem on the financial front, and they may just want some kind of return on the Foster's investment to help relieve some of the pressure,' says Ms Marsh. Given the balance of forces on the board, Mr Kunkel's role will be crucial. His position is strengthened by unanimous boardroom support, indicating that he is not a stooge for the IBH faction. Executives say he is a strong manager who is unlikely to be intimidated. Mr Kunkel, 48, is a veteran Foster's manager who was sent to Toronto in 1987 after the group bought Carling O'Keefe, then the smallest of Canada's three main beer companies. He directed Carling's merger with Molson in 1989. Described by a colleague as 'a man who doesn't mince his words', Mr Kunkel has spearheaded a shake-up in which seven of 16 breweries have been closed and the workforce has shrunk by 20 per cent. 'He's done a very, very good job,' says Mr Michael Palmer, analyst at Sanwa McCarthy Securities in Toronto. 'The merger was difficult to handle, but Molson got through it extraordinarily well.' Mr Justin Hilford, brewing analyst at Potter Warburg, in Sydney, says a break-up of the company remains 'extremely unlikely'. It would make sense only as a way of providing a capital return to IBH, which has already been ruled out by the board. Several other options remain open, including a revaluation and partial flotation of the Carlton and United Breweries subsidiary, and the sale of Foster's share options owned by IBH, which would raise up to ADollars 1.2bn for a 20 per cent holding. Mr Kunkel's appointment will revive speculation that Molson Companies, Foster's joint venture partner in Molson Breweries, may seek to increase its links with Australia by acquiring the options. The most likely outcome of the Foster's tangle is a deal which would refinance IBH's debt burden and remove some of the uncertainty surrounding the group. That would allow the share price to rise to a point where IBH could clear its debts by selling its remaining shareholding. 'I think what is going to happen is a mutual working-out of the situation, probably involving some kind of debt for equity swap between IBH, the banks and BHP,' says Mr Hilford. 'There may be some speeding-up in the sale of Foster's non-core assets, but I would be extremely surprised if there was any attempt to sell Courage or any other brewing business. That would destroy their whole strategy for recovery.'</p>

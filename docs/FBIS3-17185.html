And also about the accusations addressed to him? Rutskoy gets  off to a flying start: "It has all been invented in order to  take attention away from the serious crisis that the people in  the country are experiencing. The men in the regime are looking  for a scapegoat. This is what happened in 1991 when the  Communist Party was destroyed because it was becoming too much  of a nuisance. Then the same thing happened again the following  year in 1992. The target was the Supreme Soviet. In October  1993 they shelled Parliament. Now once again they want to  eliminate those who are a nuisance. Nobody planned a coup  because there has already been one."    [Livi] In practice, are you saying that the president's men  were the ones that spread the rumors about the coup?    [Rutskoy] I do not know who spread the rumors. What I can  say  is that it is all an act. I am sure that it is a farce.    [Livi] The alarm, the threat of destabilization: Everything  points to a degenerating situation. What are your forecasts for  the future?    [Rutskoy] Forecasts? The term sounds excessive. But this  instability, this making the boat rock from one side to the  other, the underhanded political games: These usually have a  bad ending.    [Livi] Do you think that there could be a repetition of what  happened last October, i.e., a hard and bloody confrontation?    [Rutskoy] Everything seems possible today. God save us,  however, I would not want to experience those events again. I  have had enough time to think over what happened and to draw my  conclusions.    [Livi] Which?    [Rutskoy] That the current situation in Russia is a  difficult  one. But we must not dramatize. A remedy can be found. As  long as we act on basic territory, the economy. As long as the  people do not have enough to eat, as long as they do not have  houses, medicine, and the security of stable laws, there is no  talk of this. The state must regain control of and manage the  economy. The reforms, incentives for production, and respect  for the law must be redefined. Policy today must be based on  these priorities if we want stabilization in the country.    [Livi] Is this a presidential program? Will you present  yourself at the presidential elections?    [Rutskoy] Keep calm. Perhaps those elections have already  been announced without my knowing anything? First, we must get  to the elections. And then it will be necessary for somebody to  propose my candidature. In that case we will see. I am ready,  I have stated clearly what my positions are.    [Livi] The new center-left "Agreement for Russia" opposition  front is not looking at you as a candidate, then?    [Rutskoy] According to me, all the political and social  movements that are developing in the capital do not have a great  deal of influence on the current situation. As I said before,  the stability of Russian society depends only on the solution of  vital problems: i.e., economic ones.    [Livi] How do you feel? Already president; vice president,  as you were before last October, or former vice president?    [Rutskoy] It depends on how one judges the events of last  fall. If the coup (by President Yeltsin -- IL MESSAGGERO  editor's note) is considered legitimate, then I am the former  vice president. But if it was against the law -- and is to be  considered such according to the Constitution of the Russian  Federation -- then I remain vice president. However, according  to the law I am a Russian citizen, with all the rights that  derive from this. [Rutskoy ends]    There is no use insisting. The bodyguards form an  impenetrable ring. The cameramen who try to break through are  pushed back, somebody in the crowd falls roughly on the ground.  Rutskoy has said what he wanted to. That he is not the  candidate of a party, but of a vast popular protest front. That  he is the anti-Yeltsin for the people who cannot make ends meet  today and who want to put an end to the "new rich" and the  mafia. The czar of the ultranationalists, Zhirinovskiy, will  have a tough nut to crack. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 31 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Despite voter  abstentionism bordering 83 percent, Guatemalan President Ramiro  de Leon expressed his "satisfaction" with the "yes" victory of  today's constitutional referendum.    Nevertheless, in statements to the media, de Leon  acknowledged that the "yes" victory--which garnered 84 percent  of the votes when only 51.5 percent of the total votes have been  tallied--did not reach the expected magnitude.    "In politics, what really matters, however, are final  results," the president said, downplaying the 82.8-percent  abstentionism evidenced by preliminary Supreme Electoral  Tribunal [TSE] results.    "The Guatemalan citizen voted and represented those who  decided not to vote," the president said.    The head of state attributed low voter turnout to the  peculiarities of the referendum as well as to fears of possible  terrorist attacks, such as ones the that occurred today and in  the previous weeks during which dozens of bombs exploded,  killing one, injuring 18, and causing numerous property damage,  especially to the country's electrical system.    De Leon said in 60 days the reforms will become effective,  and afterward the country's Supreme Court magistrates and  deputies will have to resign. Last year, the president went  through a power struggle with Supreme Court magistrates and  deputies when he attempted to purge both institutions due to  charges of corruption.    The president believes today's referendum marks a new page  in  the country's history, and he announced that once the  Legislative and Judicial Branch problems were solved, he will be  able to direct his efforts to the struggle against corruption  and impunity. Both the Legislative and Judicial Branch will be  changed once general elections, which have been rescheduled for  an earlier date as contemplated in the constitutional reforms,  takes place.</p>

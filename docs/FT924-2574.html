			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / International Bonds: UK financing arm of Daf in Pounds 180m, five-year issue THE recent sequence of securitised bond issues continued in the international markets yesterday with the launch by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew of a Pounds 180m issue for Truck Funding, a subsidiary of Leyland Daf Finance. UBS P&amp;D said the issue, for the UK financing arm of Daf, was the UK's first securitisation of tax-based leases. The notes are backed by vehicle leasing contracts from the Leyland Daf truck and van business in the UK. UBS P&amp;D said the structure represented a lower cost alternative to bank financing, at a time when the leasing and finance sector was finding medium-term bank financing harder to come by. Similar deals from other issuers are expected to follow, the bank said, although one current problem with leasing transactions was the absence of taxable profits against which to offset capital allowances. The issue, of Pounds 180m of five-year floating rates paying a margin of 50 basis points over three-month Libor at a fixed reoffer price of 99.65, offers a discounted margin to investors of 60 basis points. Proceeds will be used to replace more expensive short-term bank facilities. UBS P&amp;D claims to have solved the main problem of securitising UK tax-based leasing deals. These centre on the loss of capital allowances by the originator of a lease, in this case Leyland Daf Finance, if it transfers the underlying asset. 'This structure preserves the capital allowance position of the originator,' said Mr Mark Lewis, a vice-president at UBS P&amp;D responsible for structuring the transaction. 'All the tax benefits stay with it.' The assets and receivables are stripped away from Leyland Daf Finance in a tax neutral way, he said. The receivables and assets are first sold by Leyland Daf Finance to a special purpose vehicle. This then sells the receivables on to one company - Truck Funding - and the assets to another. Credit enhancement enabling the issue to qualify for its Standard &amp; Poor's triple-A rating comes in two stages. First, each Pounds 100 of bonds is backed by Pounds 106 of assets. Second, in the event of a shortfall, Union Bank of Switzerland guarantees to lend Pounds 25m to Pounds 30m on a non-recourse basis to Truck Funding, to be placed on deposit until needed to meet any arrears and losses. Repayment of the loan is subordinated to the claims of the noteholders. If UBS loses its triple-A rating, the loan will immediately be drawn down in full and proceeds put on deposit with an appropriately rated bank. The issue was well received with only minor carping, focusing on the absence of a rating by Moody's Investors Service. Swiss Re launched a Dollars 150m seven-year bond with callable five-year warrants, exerciseable into equity in MGIC Investment Corp of the US. The warrants are callable at any time, on 30 days' notice, in years four and five, to help increase the probability of exercise, said Goldman Sachs, the arranger.</p>

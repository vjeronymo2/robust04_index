			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA;  </P> <P> DRIVERS, STRIKERS SKIRMISH AT PLANT  </P> <P> Truck drivers scuffled with picketers Monday outside a Gypsum Canyon  pavement-products company after the strikers were accused of damaging trucks.  </P> <P> Brea police and county sheriff's deputies were called to Owl Rock Products Co.  at 1:30 p.m. after two men began fighting outside the plant. No one was injured  or arrested, Sheriff's Lt. Richard J. Olson said.  </P> <P> Company president Calvin B. Allen said picketers with the Operating Engineers  Local 12 have been harassing truckers crossing into the plant by throwing  pieces of metal in front of the trucks, puncturing some tires.  </P> <P> Union leaders could not be reached for comment Monday.  </P> <P> Four truck drivers not employed by Owl Rock Products began the fight after  their trucks were damaged as they drove into the plant, Allen said.  </P> <P> "These guys (truckers) got damned tired of it, and they went at them," he said.  "They gave the picketers a little working over."  </P> <P> The union, which represents heavy-equipment operators, has been striking  Arcadia-based Owl Rock Products for two months because the company has been  hiring non-union specialists for some jobs, Allen said.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies have been called to the plant several times since the strike  began Sept. 29, Olson said.

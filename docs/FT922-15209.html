			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Shares fall on prospect of Labour win SHARE PRICES in London fell sharply yesterday as investors came to terms with opinion polls showing the Labour party with a clear lead. The polls were the main factor driving the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares down 31.5 to close at 2,408.6. Prices of government gilt-edged securities fell too, closing nearly a point down. Mr Robin Aspinall, an economist at Schroders, the merchant bank, said: 'Last week six out of 10 people in the City thought the Tories would probably win the election. Now it's six out of 10 who believe a Labour victory is possible. The City doesn't like the idea of a Labour government and the nervousness we've seen is the result.' Yesterday's drop in the FT-SE index means the index has lost nearly 170 points since Budget day on March 10. The jitters also forced up rates in the London money market, indicating a perception that if Labour wins it might increase base rates. Relatively few investors shifted funds out of sterling yesterday. The fall in the pound against the D-Mark was just half a pfennig. The pound closed in London at DM2.85, 10 pfennigs below its DM2.95 central rate in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM). The market's worries had their effect on the key three-month interbank rate, at which banks lend among themselves. It climbed  3/8 of a point, to close at about 11 1/4 per cent. That pointed to an increase soon in base rates - which have been held at 10 1/2 per cent for nearly seven months. Mr John Shepperd, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, said: 'The markets are looking to a Labour victory, and many people are taking Mr John Smith (Labour's shadow chancellor) on his word that he will not devalue the pound in the ERM. But there is also a belief that as soon as Labour takes office, investors will test his resolve on this point, and sell sterling. On this basis, to keep the pound in its band, base rates will have to rise.' Mr Ken De La Salle, head of foreign exchange at National Westminster Bank, said another reason for nervousness was the size of the public sector borrowing requirement, which the Treasury says will be Pounds 28bn in the government's financial year.' To fund this, base rates might rise. irrespective of who forms the next government.'

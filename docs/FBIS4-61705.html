			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mariya Starozhitskaya report: "Circulation of Foreign </F> Currency Will Be Suspended in Ukraine"]    [Text] Kiev -- Ukraine intends to ban the free circulation  of any currency but the karbovanets on its territory.    Acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyagilskiy said that the  corresponding cabinet of ministers and National Bank decree has  already been drafted and will come into force in a few days as  one element in the preparations for the coming introduction of  the hryvnya. The regulated rate of the national currency has  been raised from 12,600 to 13,100 karbovantsy per U.S. dollar,  but it will not be abolished -- that is one of the terms on  which Ukraine is being given IMF credit. The average bank rate  of the dollar is 45,000 karbovantsy today.</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Montedison to sequester assets: Temporary order made against six former top executives MONTEDISON, Italy's huge chemicals group, which is deeply implicated in the spiralling political corruption scandal, has obtained permission from a Milan court to sequester up to L500bn (Pounds 209m) in assets from each of six former top executives. The temporary order, made in advance of a formal hearing on August 16, is against former senior managers and members of the Ferruzzi family, which controls Montedison through the Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company. Ferfin is now run by new managers who were imposed by bank creditors to the heavily indebted group. The holding company said the court action had been taken after the disclosure by Milan magistrates of 'various cases of mismanagement which have emerged from recent audits authorised by the new management and from the criminal investigations'. The company said that the sequestration, which also involves indirectly held assets such as bank accounts, was already under way. Ferfin warned that it might take further action against other managers, or seek to raise the amounts being sequestered. The list of the former top executives includes the heirs of Mr Raul Gardini, the entrepreneur who shot himself last month, Mr Carlo Sama and Mr Arturo Ferruzzi. Mr Ferruzzi, Montedison's former chairman, is the son of Ferruzzi's founder; one of the founder's daughters was married to Mr Gardini and another is married to Mr Sama. Also on the list are Mr Giuseppe Garofano, Mr Roberto Magnani and Mr Romano Venturi, three former Ferruzzi executives. Mr Garofano and Mr Sama have been key sources for the Milan magistrates investigating alleged political corruption involving the former Enimont chemicals joint venture between Montedison and the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group. Their testimony, widely leaked and believed to be reliable, alleges that Ferruzzi and Montedison paid about L135bn in kickbacks to politicans between Enimont's creation in 1989 and its collapse a year later. Mr Garofano, who returned to Italy from hiding last month to collaborate with magistrates, has also alleged other financial irregularities at Ferruzzi and Montedison while it was being run by Mr Gardini. The allegations involve covering up Dollars 350m-Dollars 450m in commodity trading losses incurred by Ferruzzi in 1989. These were kept off the group's balance sheet on Mr Gardini's orders and instead parked with offshore Montedison subsidiaries. The losses only came to light in June after Montedison's new management examined the group's books closely.</p>

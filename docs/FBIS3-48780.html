The United Arab Emirates was the largest crude supplier with  shipments of 383.78 million barrels, up 4.1 percent. It was  followed by Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Iran. Middle East  nations accounted for 76.3 percent of Japan's total crude oil  imports.    Imports of fuel oil dropped 13.8 percent to 178.26 million  barrels and exports of it grew 20.9 percent to 96.55 million  barrels.    Domestic sales of fuel oil slipped 0.8 percent to 1,420.60  million barrels, posting an annual decline for the first time in  eight years, the ministry said. The downswing was attributed to  sluggish demand for fuel oil C, reflecting lower demand for  thermal power due to the cool summer and factory closures amid  the economic slump.    Production of fuel oil came to 1,360.53 million barrels, up  3.0 percent for the sixth straight yearly rise.    The ministry said Japan's imports of crude oil in December  fell 9.1 percent from a year before to 137.37 million barrels,  marking the fifth successive month of year-on-year drops. The  largest supplier of crude in December was the United Arab  Emirates at 36.54 million barrels, followed by Saudi Arabia and  Iran.    December imports of fuel oil fell 9.9 percent to 14.40  million barrels but exports advanced 28.4 percent to 11.32  million barrels.    Domestic sales of fuel oil rose 1.3 percent to 145.05  million  barrels, the first increase in eight months.    Production of fuel oil scored the fifth straight month of  year-on-year rises, up 4.0 percent to 131.21 million barrels.</p>

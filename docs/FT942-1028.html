			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Major plays safe by denying Dehaene: British PM found it easier to fight all Europe than the Tory party So this time Mr John Major did not blink. After his humiliating climbdown two months ago over majority voting, the British prime minister calculated that isolation among his European partners was preferable to derision from Conservative MPs at Westminster. The decision to veto the appointment of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene as the next president of the European Commission was dictated more by domestic than by European politics. The anger and bewilderment he left behind in Corfu will be followed today by noisy applause from the Euro-sceptics on the Tory backbenches in the House of Commons. There would have been no enthusiasm in London for the candidacy of the Belgian prime minister even if Mr Major's political position had been strong. Mr Dehaene's instincts about the future shape of Europe are not those of the British government. But after narrowly avoiding catastrophe in the recent elections for the European parliament, Mr Major decided that his precarious political position dictated that he take his opposition to the limit. The political backlash which followed the fiasco over majority voting - when Mr Major first signalled that he would stand and fight to make majority voting more difficult in the Council of Ministers and then just as quickly retreated - had been a salutary lesson. The prime minister was told by party managers at Westminster that accepting Mr Dehaene in Corfu would revive the threat to his premiership. Mr Major did not arrive at the summit with a carefully laid plan to demonstrate his political virility by using Britain's national veto. He had been intensely irritated at the way the Franco-German axis had promoted Mr Dehaene. He had tried to persuade the Belgian prime minister not to enter the race by warning him in advance of Britain's opposition. But if he had decided in advance he could not acquiesce at this summit in the appointment of Mr Dehaene, Mr Major had hoped also for something less dramatic than a line-up of 11 to 1. The decision to employ the veto was taken only after a flurry of consultations with other EU leaders and with Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, late on Friday. Earlier, at the request of the Greek presidency, Mr Major had completed a voting slip in which he had marked Sir Leon Brittan as his first and Mr Ruud Lubbers as his second choice for the post. The presidency said there was no mention on the slip of a veto. Instead the British prime minister had simply placed Mr Dehaene's name third. At that stage there had been hopes still in the British delegation that a more generalised deadlock would allow the whole issue to be deferred until after the start of the summer parliamentary recess late next month. The recess, which runs until October, would have taken the immediate political pressure off Mr Major. But Chancellor Helmut Kohl's determination to secure Mr Dehaene's appointment before the first meeting of the new European parliament on July 19 changed the political calculation. An unpalatable decision could not be deferred until Tory MPs were safely away on holiday. Despite his public protestations to the contrary, Mr Hurd looked less than happy at the outcome. The foreign secretary had told cabinet colleagues before the summit that Mr Dehaene was no grand federalist in the mould of Mr Jacques Delors. Instead he was a political Mr Fixit whose integrationist instincts would have been tempered by a large dose of pragmatism. Mr Hurd could have lived with Mr Dehaene as commission president. The foreign secretary has indicated that he does not plan to bow out from the government in the impending cabinet reshuffle. He has said that before he leaves he wants to put in place the building blocks for Britain's approach to the 1996 intergovernmental conference on the next stage of EU development. But there must now be a question mark over how long Mr Hurd will be content running a foreign policy dictated by the Euro-sceptic wing of the Tory party. For Mr Major the immediate political consequences of the veto will be favourable. The European election results were just tolerable enough to remove the threat of a summer crisis over his leadership. He will now hope that his Thatcherite performance in Corfu has done enough in appeasing the right to remove the remaining threat of a challenge in the autumn. But in the longer term the picture is much less clear. In Europe, Mr Kohl will have no cause to help Mr Major out of the inevitable future scrapes that Britain will face. German officials appear contemptuous of Mr Major's insistence that he must follow rather than lead the Conservative party. Mr Major has no guarantee that the new candidate who emerges for the Commission presidency will be any less 'federalist' than Mr Dehaene. He explicitly acknowledged this when he set out his reasons for opposing the Belgian prime minister. Mr Dehaene had been unacceptable because he came from a 'tradition of big government and a tradition of interventionism'. No mention was made of his views on the future structure of the EU. At Westminster, the price of appeasement of the Tory right will be to antagonise further the pro-European centre-left of Mr Major's party. And it is they rather than the Euro-sceptics who have in Mr Clarke an alternative candidate for the premiership. Mr Major insists he is not in thrall to the right of his party. During the European election campaign he told cabinet colleagues that his exposition of the case for a multi-speed, multi-track Europe had been misunderstood as a precursor for British disengagement from the next stage of European integration. But it is hard to escape the conclusion that the successor to Lady Thatcher is being pulled inexorably into repositioning the Conservatives as the party of nationalism rather than of Europeanism. There is a good case to be put for developing the European Union of the future as a more flexible and diverse association than envisaged by old-fashioned integrationalists. But Mr Major did that case no service at the Corfu summit.</p>

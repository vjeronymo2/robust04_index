			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Part" of statement by Grigoriy Karasin, director of </F> information and press department of Russian Foreign Ministry, at  news conference in Foreign Ministry press center on 12 April --  recorded]    [Text] Ukraine: A statement by the government of the  Russian Federation. In the past few days the Ukrainian  authorities have carried out a series of provocative acts  against facilities and servicemen of the Black Sea Fleet, which  have threatened to escalate into armed clashes.    On 8 April the Ukrainian authorities used armed force in an  attempt to take over in the port of Odessa the Black Sea Fleet's  hydrographic vessel Cheleken, which was carrying out scheduled  work to service navigational equipment in the Black Sea. In  order to find a peaceful solution to the conflict, the ship's  commander showed the Ukrainian representatives the required  ship's documents. No infringement was indentified.    Nonetheless, the Ukrainian side forcefully attempted to  detain the vessel and to prevent the Cheleken from entering  Sevastopol. On the night of 10-11 April a unit of Ukrainian  servicemen numbering up to 120 men seized by force the 318th  Division of Black Sea Fleet reserve vessels, their shore base,  communications unit, weapons, and property. The commanders of  the division, Captain Feyoktistov and Commander Starikov, were  arrested and taken in handcuffs to the commandant's office.    The personnel of the shore station were immediately taken to  the village of (Chubanka), 10 km from Odessa. Some of the  personnel of the vessels and members of their families were kept  isolated on the territory of the division's garrison. During  the action the servicemen and civilians were subjected to taunts  and beatings.    This action by the Ukrainian authorities is a gross  violation  of the understandings between the president of Russia and the  president of Ukraine on refraining from unilateral actions in  respect of the Black Sea Fleet until the problem of the Black  Sea Fleet, all agreements between Russia and Ukraine on this  issue, and the flouting of the norms of international law,  including human rights, are resolved.    There is no doubt about the provocative nature of these  actions. The government of the Russian Federation is making an  emphatic protest to the government of Ukraine in connection with  such actions and demands the immediate release of the Black Sea  Fleet servicemen and family members, as well as immediate  restoration of the status quo in respect of the fleet's  installations prior to these provocative actions. It demands  that an investigation be launched and all necessary measures  taken against the culprits.    The government of the Russian Federation stresses that  Russia's course in respect of Ukraine has been and remains a  course of friendship and cooperation.    May I add to what has been said in the statement that what  has happened in Odessa is certainly an example of crude, perhaps  even shameful, methods of resolving things. All the more so  since we are talking about the one Black Sea Fleet, which is  under the joint command of Russia and Ukraine. The Russian side  has as a matter of urgency sent Admiral Feliks Gromov and  special envoy Yuriy Dubinin to Ukraine with the aim of looking  into what happened on the spot, with the involvement of the  Ukrainian side.    A whole series of questions arises over this incident.  First, why did this happen just now? Second, who stands to  gain from aggravating relations and increasing suspicion between  Ukraine and Russia? We are convinced of the need for a joint,  constructive approach to dealing with all the issues which have  arisen. This is what is demanded by the long-term interests of  inter-state relations between Russia and Ukraine.</p>

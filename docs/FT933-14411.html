			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: P&amp;G extends price cuts for detergents PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group facing competition from low-priced rivals, yesterday announced price cuts of between 3 per cent and 15 per cent on its liquid laundry detergents in the American market. The cuts, which will be effective on August 2, follow a 9 per cent price reduction on two of these products late last year and cuts earlier this year on powdered detergents. The company said the price cuts would be funded from savings from improved manufacturing techniques and other non-value added costs. The price cuts were not expected to affect earnings. P&amp;G has been moving away from a marketing strategy based on special promotions to one based on a policy of consistent, but lower prices. The normally secretive company is holding a rare series of meetings with analysts and the Press tomorrow where it is expected to outline its strategy and cost-cutting plans in greater detail. P&amp;G shares closed last night down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 51 5/8 . In a separate move, the company named Mr Erik Nelson, a 53-year-old vice-president of financial operations as chief financial officer, filling a position vacant since 1991.</p>

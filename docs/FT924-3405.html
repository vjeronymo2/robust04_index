			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Radio Clyde shows 30% advance RADIO CLYDE Holdings, the USM-quoted broadcaster, increased pre-tax profits by 30 per cent from Pounds 1.4m to Pounds 1.83m in the year to end-September. Turnover jumped 38 per cent to Pounds 13m (Pounds 9.45m), reflecting the merger with Radio Forth in April last year and increases in local and national advertising revenue, which contributed two thirds of overall income. Earnings per share improved to 13.2p (12.4p) the modest increase reflecting the larger number of shares in issue after the all-share payment for Radio Forth. A final distribution of 5.25p (5p) lifts the total to 8.5p (8.25p).</p>

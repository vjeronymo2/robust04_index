			<p>BFN     [Text] All Muslim-Bosniak prisoners in Mostar's Heliodrom  prison, except two, today ended their hunger strike.    At his first news conference today Vlado Sojic, new defense  minister of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, said, I quote,  that he feels like a minister of peace rather than war as he was  appointed at the time of the Washington agreement. Asked  whether the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was over he nevertheless  said:    [Begin Sojic recording] Unfortunately, the war is not over.  [end recording]    Of course, Sojic said, the Croat side will continue to do  everything, just as it has been doing hitherto, to achieve peace  through negotiations. He then called on his fighters to be  patient enough until a final peace, given the fact that they  have managed to save Croat territories and the Croat population.  Replying to a question as to who started the war and whether  the Croats are the losers, Sojic says:    [Begin Sojic recording] The Croats did not start the war,  nor  are they the losers. As to what extent they are the winners,  one can speculate in various ways. [end recording]    Minister Sojic also added that the Croats had so far always  accepted every peace agreement, ranging from the Cutillero  agreement to this latest Redman one. Asked whether the Croats  and Muslim can live together after so much bloodshed, Sojic says:    [Begin Sojic recording] The, shall I say, memories of the  war  with the Muslims are still fresh, so it is hard to talk about  coexistence, particularly so where there has been fighting, but  I nevertheless believe that Croats and Muslims can live in a  common state if it is organized in a democratic way and secures  the national rights of all peoples.

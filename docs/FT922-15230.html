			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / International Company News: Norges Postbank proposal detailed NORWAY'S minority Labour government has given details of its proposal to establish the controversial state-owned Norges Postbank, which is expected to begin operation before the end of this year. Norges Postbank is viewed by some as a new threat to the country's banking sector, which is struggling to survive after suffering several consecutive years of large losses. The decision to press ahead with the creation of Norges Postbank comes during Norway's worst banking crisis since the 1930s and at a time when a consolidation of the sector is underway. It also comes three months after the state became the owner of Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank, two of the country's top banks, as part of a rescue operation to save them from insolvency. The bank is to be established with equity capital of NKr2.175bn (Dollars 336m) and will have an equity ratio of 33 per cent in relation to risk-weighted balance sheet items. It will be formed from the Norges Postsparebank - a state-owned savings bank operated by the postal system, with assets of NKr41.3bn. Norges Postsparebank will also contribute NKr300m to the new bank. These funds will constitute a loss-reserve fund and infrastructure for Norges Postbank. Last year, Norges Postsparebank lifted operating profit to a record NKr517m, from NKr450.1m a year earlier. Unlike commercial and savings banks, Norges Postsparebank has suffered only minor credit losses in recent years. In 1991, its credit losses were just NKr36.3m, up from NKr27.2m in 1990. Norges Postbank will operate under the rules which govern both commercial and savings banks, forcing it to compete under the same conditions. It will have to charge fees on a par with the commercial and savings banks in order for the state to phase out subsidies.</p>

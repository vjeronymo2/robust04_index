			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir Flees to Cyprus: Labour calls for review of the case LABOUR leaders yesterday seized on Mr Asil Nadir's flight from Britain as another example of the need for more effective procedures for countering fraud. Ministers ignored demands for an immediate Commons statement as criticism was led by Mr Alistair Darling, opposition spokesman on Treasury affairs. He said Mr Nadir's departure from the jurisdiction of UK courts was a matter of 'great importance - damaging the ability of this country to prosecute serious City fraud'. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, told Mr Darling: 'You are referring to the man in question as if he had already been found guilty. That you must not do.' She said no minister had submitted a request to make a statement on the matter. Mr Richard Caborn, the Labour MP who is chairman of the Commons trade and industry select committee, said later yesterday that the fact that bail for Mr Nadir was set at Pounds 3.5m should have ensured that he was subject to the most stringent surveillance. 'Clearly there needs to be a review of the arrangements made in this case,' he said.</p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Sound cards top the charts An add-on circuit board that gives a standard PC the ability to record and produce CD-quality sound has been introduced by Logitech, the US PC peripherals company. Ultrasound is the first PC sound card capable of playing up to 32 digital synthesized voices simultaneously, or 16 stereo channels. It also offers the facility to mix music, voice and sound at the same time on two digitally multiplexed channels. The sound card, which was developed by Advanced Gravis of Canada, a company in which Logitech holds a controlling interest, is supplied with software including Ultra Soundstudio, a package designed for music editing and UltraFli, an application that synchronizes digitised and synthesized sound files, plus a wide range of sampled sound files and compositions. The UK price is Pounds 149 plus VAT. Some 3m PC sound cards will be sold in the US this year, up from 1m in 1991, according to industry analysts. Of these more than 60 per cent will be used by the entertainment industry. Logi: UK, 0344 891313/891452.</p>

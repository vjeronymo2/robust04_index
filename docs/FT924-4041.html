			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Lloyd's staff levels to drop MORE THAN 200 jobs are to go at the Lloyd's Corporation, the body that co-ordinates and regulates activities at the Lloyd's insurance market. The cuts, announced yesterday by Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, are part of plans to reduce the organisation's budget by 18.4 per cent to Pounds 117.9m in 1993 compared with Pounds 144.5m in 1992. Staffing levels will fall from 2,200 to 1,990 over the next 12 months. Mr David Rowland, chairman-elect, said: 'There is no possibility of the market prospering without a substantial attack on costs.' A radical review of the corporation's activities is under way and further cuts are not ruled out. Lloyd's also announced that Mr John Gaynor, 57, head of finance at the corporation, is to take early retirement, while the contract of Mr Brian Nicholson, a senior public-relations executive, will not be renewed. The moves are part of a reorganisation of the corporation's management structure. Lloyd's is freezing pay levels of corporation employees, abolishing flexitime arrangements and consolidating some benefits into basic pay. The spending cuts will allow Lloyd's to reduce the expenses of Names, the individuals whose capital supports underwriting at the market, and syndicates, which in turn should make a return to profitability more likely. The cost of membership subscriptions that Names must pay will be reduced from 0.5 per cent of gross allocated capacity (the amount of premium income a Name is allowed to accept) in 1992 to 0.4 per cent in 1993. Rents paid by syndicates for space in the underwriting room are being reduced from Pounds 307 a sq ft to Pounds 280 a sq ft. Lloyd's also announced that its council, or governing body, had nominated Mr Robert Hiscox, chairman of Roberts &amp; Hiscox, a managing agency, and Mr Stephen Merrett, a leading underwriter, to be deputy chairman to Mr Rowland.</p>

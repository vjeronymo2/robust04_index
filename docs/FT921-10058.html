			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Letter: Not in the same category Sir, Mr Grossman's attempt (Letters, February 5) to include Lloyd's in the 'regulatory disasters' of BCCI and the Maxwell pension funds is misguided. Generalised assertions and allegations are easy to make but should not be confused with evidence, let alone proof. In Britain, one is innocent unless proven guilty by a court of law. Lloyd's has not been found 'guilty' of any fraudulent conduct. Although Lloyd's has taken its own effective disciplinary actions in a number of cases, those relate primarily to events that occurred before the passing of the new regulatory framework under the 1982 Lloyd's Act. Mr Grossman is a plaintiff against Lloyd's in the US and his letter has the appearance of an attempt to argue his case in the media rather than the proper forum.

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Bombay share index breaches 4,000 level The Bombay Stock Exchange's index of leading stocks yesterday crossed the psychologically-important 4,000 level for the first time in 21 months amid hopes that next month's budget will bring new impetus to India's economic liberalisation, writes Stefan Wagstyl in New Delhi. Foreign financial institutions, which were admitted to the market only last year, triggered the rally, which has seen the index rise 54 per cent since the beginning of November. Yesterday, the index rose 82 points to close at 4020.87. Shares are now approaching the record levels of the 1991-92 rally which ended with the Bombay securities market scandal, more than doubling from their post-scandal lows in the spring of last year, when sentiment was depressed by the continuing investigation of the scandal and the religious unrest following the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque. Foreign investors have bought about Dollars 1bn in Indian equities and Dollars 1.6bn in Indian companies' overseas issues, most of it since last summer. Foreign fund managers are buying in the hope that India's reforms will stimulate economic growth. Managers of emerging funds are also seeking to diversify from east Asian markets which could be set for declines after very rapid increases last year. Foreign fund managers have not been put off by a dispute between stockbrokers and the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the markets watchdog, which led to a two-week strike in December. The brokers stopped work in protest at the board's order to sell positions in an informal forward market called badla. The board alleged the forward market was being used to generate excessive speculative demand for shares. Despite the brokers' protests, the board has held firm and insists that existing forward positions must be liquidated by early March. After that, it proposes to allow forward deals only if they are reported separately from cash transactions. The board's efforts are expected to help improve transparency on India's 22 exchanges, including the Bombay exchange, which accounts for two thirds of all trades. The campaign against the badla market was spearheaded by Mr GV Ramakrishna, SEBI's outspoken chairman, who moves to a lower profile position at the government's Planning Commission.</p>

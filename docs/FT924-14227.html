			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Better news at Lloyd's THERE was good news this week for those Lloyd's Names facing difficulties because of the market's record losses. Lloyd's announced changes to its 'hardship arrangements' which lighten the burden of Names unable to meet their obligations. The changes remove the prospect of lifelong indebtedness. According to Dr Mary Archer, chairman of the members' hardship committee, they will make hardship a more attractive prospect than bankruptcy, the alternative course for Names in trouble. Up to now, Names benefiting from hardship relief signed an agreement with Lloyd's whereby it would take a charge on their income and their assets for life, or until their debt was repaid. The Name typically would be allowed to retain an annual income of Pounds 15,000 and a modest house valued at around Pounds 150,000. Where Names depend on investment income, Lloyd's converts assets into a hardship deposit trust fund, earmarking an annual amount to Names - again, typically around Pounds 15,000. Under the new arrangements, Names would still need to sell most of their assets to meet their loss, and may have to move to a cheaper home. But Names in hardship would benefit in a number of ways. Hardship would cease at the end of three years leaving Lloyd's with the charge on the Name's property, as well as any proceeds from Lloyd's-related litigation and tax recoveries. Names would then be free to build up assets and pay off the charge on their principal residence. Those still working would retain all their earnings, but Names would also get the the full benefit of any windfall income. Names relying on investments as their main source of income would benefit, too, although they would continue to get roughly the same level of income from their hardship trust. The creation of a Pounds 50m fund, financed by contributions from brokers and agents, means that Lloyd's can supplement Names' income when necessary. Money from this fund can be used for several purposes. These include buying annuities on behalf of a member; paying income to the spouse of a deceased member; buying 'necessary domestic commodities'; and paying certain school, nursing home or retirement home fees, and medical expenses.</p>

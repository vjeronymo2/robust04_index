			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / International Company News: Germany seeks US concession on listings GERMANY has called on the US to allow German companies to be listed on American stock markets on the strength of German style balance sheets and profit and loss accounts. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, told Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, that German companies did not wish to follow Daimler-Benz and be obliged to produce both German and US accounts to obtain listings on US exchanges. In talks over the weekend, Mr Waigel said US companies were able to obtain listings in Germany. It should be possible for German companies to be quoted on US markets. A German banker warned that without a change in US policy, other German companies were unlikely to follow Daimler-Benz, and no German bank would publish US accounts to get a US listing. Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chairman of Dresdner Bank's managing board, said he favoured mutual recognition of different countries' accounting rules to solve the problem. In his talk with Mr Waigel, Mr Bentsen promised to review the situation and raise the matter with the US Securities and Exchange Commission but warned that the SEC was an independent organisation. In a letter last week to the Wall Street Journal, Mrs Mary Schapiro, SEC commissioner, strongly defended US insistence that foreign companies should conform with the US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) when seeking a US market listing. But she underlined that the SEC's adherence to the standards was not arbitrary and it had accommodated deviations on a case-by-case basis. The difference between the standards was highlighted when Daimler-Benz published two sets of accounts in preparation for a New York Stock Exchange listing. The US accounts showed it a loss of DM949m in the first half, while under German rules it reported a profit of DM168m.</p>

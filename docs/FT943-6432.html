			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Sanguine mood could linger on into autumn - New York Last Wednesday's surprising 70-point surge by the Dow industrials is still a mystery on Wall Street. Before Friday, when the Dow added another 51 points, some analysts were dismissing the jump as a technical aberration. Most notably, a report in The New York Times traced the initial burst to the consequences of a single fund manager's options trade. His strategy was said to have triggered what one analyst earlier described as a 'panic reflow' of money back into depressed cyclical stocks in the final half-hour of trading. The plausibility of that explanation hardly seems to matter this morning. Whatever the cause, Wednesday's events have sparked what may turn out to be a long upturn in share prices. It now appears the groundwork was laid earlier in the week, when the market welcomed an announcement by Deere, the US agricultural equipment maker, that it was lifting its production schedule in response to higher demand. Later, technology stocks sprang to life when analysts issued encouraging remarks on several companies, and IBM decided to follow Compaq's lead in lowering prices on many of its PCs. There is little doubt that investors are entering the final week of the summer with an inclination to accentuate the positive. Four trends seem to be working in their favour: bonds are up, the dollar has stabilised, the outlook for corporate earnings has improved and the economy is trotting along at a manageable pace. Friday's advance, after a modest retreat the previous session, demonstrated that buyers were not ready to return to the sidelines after just one outing. Stocks could well have declined, as the Commerce Department announced an upward revision of second-quarter economic growth. Instead, investors were relieved that the revision, from 3.7 per cent to 3.8 per cent, fell well short of expectations. The report also lent credence to the theory that inventories had piled up in the quarter because of soft sales, not stepped-up production. Many analysts are now betting that the Federal Reserve will delay its next move to tighten credit until November. This week, thin trading conditions in the run-up to the long Labor Day weekend could exaggerate the market's movements in either direction. With the monthly cycle of government economic data getting under way again, some volatility is not out of the question. Nevertheless, most portfolio managers are likely to refrain from making fresh commitments until the release of August employment data on Friday. Economists are forecasting a moderate increase in non-farm payrolls of between 200,000 and 250,000. If the figure falls in that range, the sanguine mood on Wall Street should carry into the autumn.</p>

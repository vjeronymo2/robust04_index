			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Tokareva report: "Where Is Politics Here, and Where </F> Economics?"]    [Text] A week ago, when the anticrisis program submitted  by the pillars of the socialist economy under the leadership of  Academician Shatalin was widely publicized, Sergey Glazyev  modestly reported at a news conference in the State Duma that  the academicians' program for overcoming the crisis and for  economic policy, to put it mildly, was not the only one.    The academicians' program, which, for want of any better  ones, was printed in many periodicals, has proved to be one of  many. The theses of four more reports aspiring to the role of  programs and also the data of statistical reports characterizing  the state of the economy were made public yesterday in  parliamentary hearings in the State Duma.    According to a report by the chairman of the Russian  Federation State Committee for Statistics, over the past year  retail prices increased 900 percent, and wholesale prices 840  percent. The federal budget deficit stood at 17 trillion rubles  [R]. Profits amounted to R40 trillion. Some 17 percent of  enterprises worked at a loss over the year. Mutual nonpayments  amounted to R17 trillion. Industrial production fell 15 percent  compared with the previous year. In the military-industrial  complex it fell 29 percent. Capital investments fell 15  percent. Of 652 capital construction projects, just 193 were  commissioned. Grain production fell 7 percent compared with  1992.    How do economists in opposing camps rate these results, and  what prescriptions for the future do they propose?    Yakov Urinson, first deputy minister of economics, who  submitted an extensive report for the parliamentary hearings to  Sergey Glazyev, who chaired those hearings, declared that the  results of the economic year are contradictory. "Inflation has  fallen, and the population's monetary incomes have increased.  Enterprises are coming to a halt, and yet unprofitable  enterprises are continuing to work, devouring resources. Some  R12 trillion has gone on expenditure which was not provided for,  and this when the state has a debt of R4 trillion to the  military-industrial complex and the agrarian complex."    Ya. Urinson proposed a prescription for curing the crisis in  the economy along the lines of the economic policy of Gaydar and  Fedorov: not to change the tax policy for two years; to abolish  tax breaks; to toughen up control over the expenditure part of  the budget; to monitor the effectiveness of subsidies, capital  investments, and subventions. To continue privatization, which,  after completing the voucher stage, is to enter the stage of  forming the "efficient private owner." To pursue a selective  policy, reducing the number of priorities. Targeted support is  needed for enterprises and particularly important sectors.    This is the forecast result: a budget deficit of 5 percent,  a lowering of inflation to 2-3 percent, and an increase in  unemployment from 3.8 to 7 million.    Deputies were not delighted with the plans of the leader of  the Ministry of Economics. The discussion between them and  Urinson was conducted in various languages. The deputies mostly  used rally language, while Urinson employed economic concepts.    Boris Fedorov, now a member of the Committee for the Budget,  Taxes, Banks, and Finances, delivered a brief speech which once  again dotted the "i's" in the submitted summary of the program.  In his speech Fedorov chiefly carried on polemics with  Academician Shatalin and other admirers of "reforms with a human  face." Briefly, concisely, and wittily, as always, Fedorov  remarked that economic prosperity cannot be achieved just by  printing money. He drew attention to the fact that we are  already living in a market economy whether we want this or not  and whether we call this market a bazaar or are moved by it.  All the measures that were needed to create the market have  already been taken, the former minister of finance said. Now it  is only necessary to remove the inflationary tax. Fedorov  remarked that there is no longer any need at all to write any  programs. The government must adopt decisions every day in  accordance with the principles of market economics. And, above  all, the principles of financial discipline.    Sergey Glazyev, who submitted to the hearings a serious  report which certainly does not categorize his economic views as  socialist, emphasized that the main principles of future  economic conduct are the reduction of preferential credits  granted out of the state budget for purposes of funding the  national economy and a ban on their use to fund trade  operations. Particularly to acquire imported goods. The theme  of protecting the Russian economy against the pernicious  influence of competition with the Western economy loomed large  in Glazyev's report.    Glazyev believes that the monetarists have achieved only an  outward similarity with a market economy. That in the course of  the reforms they failed to form a sensible structural policy.  As a result of the policy of radical liberalization a  spontaneous structural restructuring is taking place, consisting  in the destruction of processing industry sectors and in the  preferential development of raw material sectors. Thus, the  potential of future growth is lost, and the economy goes over to  depressed functioning as a raw materials periphery. Glazyev  believes that it is necessary to encourage exports of  commodities with a high proportion of VAT, not raw material  goods.    Yevgeniy Saburov, who held the post of vice premier in Ivan  Silayev's government, called the report by the academicians  under Shatalin's leadership "good but not technical" in that it  urges people to live well but does not say "how." He called  Fedorov's report "technical" but said it does not inspire  confidence that the prescription will lead to anything good.    In the conference lobby Yevgeniy Saburov explained his  viewpoint: Only changes in the financial sphere are being made  quickly and easily. But in the sphere of changing production  and of new technologies there are no quick results. As a result  of getting carried away with measures merely of a financial  nature, we will get mass unemployment in addition to inflation.  But even Saburov said words to the effect that a moderately  tough credit policy is necessary. At the same time he  pronounced some words which at first did not take appropriate  shape in economic terms -- "accord with the people." But soon  he got away from populist terminology and said that he had in  mind cartel agreements among industrialists.    Lvov, corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences, had  the biggest success with deputies. This was evidently because  he put things in a manner comprehensible even to those deputies  who have not mastered the subtleties of unadapted economic  slang. But most likely it was because he pronounced out loud an  intimate secret: The country will be ruined by disregard for the  high-tech military-industrial complex and by enthusiasm for the  fuel and energy complex. In our country the sectors of the  latter produce 30 percent of the profit, and machine building  just 1 percent.    Lvov called VAT a powerful factor for whipping up inflation.  He proposed making rent the basis of a new system of taxation,  as it does not have to be taken any further along the whole  manufacturing chain but is levied just once, as well as a tax on  pollution of the natural environment.    So there is diversity among the programs. There is even a  certain similarity among them, at least on one question: a  moderately tough credit policy. At the recent congress of the  Association of Russian Peasant and Private Farms I also heard  from peasants that more than half the credits are embezzled by  banks and by commercial structures associated with them.    Understanding of this question, at least, is growing in  society. But there are few prescriptions for treating the  crisis of nonpayments, unemployment, and hopelessness for  high-technology Russian industry. This is why the document  entitled "Recommendations of Parliamentary Hearings on the  Economic Situation in the Country" mainly contained bitter words  about the present state of the economy. It recommends that the  government adopt an anticrisis program within three weeks  clearly indicating the substance of the measures, the deadlines  for fulfillment, and the expected results. The State Duma is  recommended to include draft laws in the plan of priority  legislative work according to application.    Still to come is a "roundtable" with the participation of  members of the Federal Assembly, the government, political  parties, and public movements for the purpose of reaching public  accord on the main areas of socioeconomic policy.    It is sad that no more than 25 deputies were left in the  hall  by the end of the session. To all appearances, the economy is  of far less concern to them than purely political altercations.  Deputy Fedorov left the hall as soon as it had heard his own  speech. So Mr. Lvov spoke without his most important opponent  being present.</p>

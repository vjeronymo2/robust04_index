NODONG SINMUN today says this shows that the wildcat war  provocation moves of the South Korean puppets have reached a  most dangerous phase.    The news analyst points out:    Such military provocation moves of the South Korean puppets  are all the more dangerous as they are timed to coincide with  the aggressive U.S. military actions against the DPRK now at a  very grave stage.    It has been made clearer that the "civilian government" and  "unification" on the lips of the Kim Yong-sam group are no more  than a smoke screen to cover up its moves for confrontation and  war.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam clique, clean [as received]  indifferent to the destiny of the nation and busy to find a way  out in its military adventure as a stooge of the aggressive  imperialist reactionaries, will be under fire at home and abroad.    The DPRK is ready for both dialogue and war. If the South  Korean puppets ignite a war, continuing reckless military  provocation moves in league with outside forces, our heroic  People's Army and people will deal one thousand-fold fatal blows  at them.</p>

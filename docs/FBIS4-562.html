			<p>BFN     [Text] Head of Government Roch Marc Christian Kabore on 9  April publicly announced the counter proposals made by the labor  unions in response to the government's 5 April proposals. The  issue that has set a lot of tongues wagging is certainly that of  salary increase, heightened by rumors of a hypothetical  15-percent increase said to have been authorized by the World  Bank and the IMF. This has once again sparked off the debate  over whether or not to believe the government, which has been  telling the whole world that budgetary constraints resulting  from the structural adjustment program do not enable it to  significantly increase salaries. Prime Minister Kabore refutes  these rumors and also gives some facts on the sales tax the  government is levying on fuel.    [Begin Kabore recording] We have been hearing here and there  that the World Bank and the IMF have authorized the government  to increase salaries by 15 percent and that it is refusing to do  so, in the hope that by bullying workers it could get them to  accept its proposals. I would like to dispel any doubts on the  matter, which I believe was reported by JEUNE AFRIQUE news  magazine which I would say is not a negotiator between these  institutions and our country. I would also like to reaffirm  that at no time was Burkina Faso authorized, under the current  program, to effect a 15-percent salary increase. It is  therefore important for us to dispel such doubts since the  rumors being circulated could cause some confusion among workers  and Burkinabe in general. We need to remove all such doubts on  the matter.    The other problem is that when people look at the price  structure they accuse the government of levying too many taxes,  especially in regard to fuel and a certain number of items. I  would simply like to draw everyone's attention to the fact that  the basic revenue -- the 6 billion we have been talking about --  constitutes earnings generated from taxes levied on various  products. Thus, logically speaking, if we (?invest) 126  billion, in light of the taxes we are collecting today, it is  obvious that if we reduce the value of these taxes, we would  actually be reducing the state's revenue and it would therefore  be unreasonable to demand salary increases.

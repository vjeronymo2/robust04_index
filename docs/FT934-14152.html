			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Germany rebuts criticism of its waste recycling laws GERMANY yesterday defended its controversial waste recycling legislation, calling criticism from other EC states 'one-sided'. Strict German recycling laws have been attacked for producing more waste packaging than the country can process, resulting in large exports of waste paper and plastic. Britain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Spain have all complained that their young recycling industries are being so overwhelmed by subsidised German exports that domestic waste no longer has an outlet. Mr Clemens Stroetmann, state secretary in the German Environment Ministry, told an FT conference in London on international packaging and the environment that the criticism failed to take account of imports of raw materials into Germany. The country used around 16m tonnes of paper a year, of which more than 8m tonnes were imported. 'It is almost impossible to ensure the environmentally-sound disposal of used paper levels in Germany using our own national capacity alone.' He denied that the export of valuable waste raw material was subsidised, either by municipal authorities or by the financially troubled national recycling scheme, DSD. 'Valuable raw materials are collected in a system financed by ordinary citizens, either in the form of refuse charges to the municipal authorities or in the prices of the products they buy, which of course also reflect the costs of the green dot (the DSD system). This financing, however, is for actual services, the setting-up and operation of collection systems,' he said. The recycling scheme came under attack from Mr David Veitch, vice-president of public affairs for Procter &amp; Gamble Europe, who said waste packaging legislation 'leads all too easily to net extra cost', as was the case with DSD. New national packaging legislation risked undoing the benefits of the single market.</p>

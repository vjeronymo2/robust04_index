			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report given by Acting Governor Tian Fengshan at the </F> provincial people's congress standing committee meeting on 20  May]    [Text] Chairman, Vice Chairmen, Secretaries General, and  all Committee Members:    This chairmanship meeting of the provincial people's  congress  has nominated me as a candidate for vice governor and acting  governor. I feel very uneasy. The party and the people have  entrusted me with a very heavy task. They have not only shown  great confidence in me but also entrusted me with heavy  responsibility and set higher demands on me. I deeply feel the  heavy responsibility and big pressure on me. In my case,  although I have been trained and educated by the party for many  years and successively assumed leadership work in townships,  counties, prefectures, cities, and the province with the help  and support of the veteran comrades, and have gained  understandings in the work of the grass roots and some aspects,  however, measuring the requirements of this post, my practical  experience, organizational ability, and leadership level still  fall short of the requirements. I am afraid that I may create  great losses to the party's cause and disappoint the  expectations of the party and the people. If my nomination to  the posts is approved, all I can do is to pluck up my courage,  undertake the heavy tasks, and try my utmost to do the work well.    Under the leadership of the provincial party committee and  through the efforts of the past leading bodies and the masses of  cadres, our province has achieved fairly big progress in reform,  opening up, economic construction, and social undertakings,  laying a foundation for future work. In spite of the fact that  Heilongjiang is now facing some practical problems and  difficulties in economic development, however, it has its own  distinctive advantages and tremendous potentials. If I am  approved to be the acting governor by this people's congress  standing committee meeting, I have the determination to work  together with the broad masses of workers, peasants,  intellectuals, and cadres at all levels across the province to  conscientiously implement the guidelines of the 14th party  congress and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee under the leadership of the provincial party  committee, the supervision of the people's congress and its  standing committee, act in line with the 20-character policy of  the Party Central committee and the overall objective on reform,  development and stability defined by the second plenary session  of the seventh provincial party committee and the second session  of the eighth provincial people's congress early this year,  carry out all sorts of major measures in a down-to-earth manner,  and comprehensively fulfill this year's various work tasks. At  present, we should look squarely at the problems and  difficulties in front of us and recognize the good opportunity  we may meet. Thanks to the endeavors of the party committee,  the provincial government and all sectors, Heilongjiang's  problems and difficulties have been comprehended and taken  seriously by the Party Central Committee and the State Council.  Entrusted by Comrades Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, Vice Premier Zhu  Rongji has led responsible comrades of the relevant departments  of the State Council to our province to conduct investigation  and study and help us solve problems. This is a major  opportunity for our province's reform, opening up, and economic  development. We should treasure this opportunity, firmly grasp  it, expand the dynamic of our work, and push our future work to  a new height. The key to solving our province's problems on the  way of advance is to push economic development forward.  Therefore, as far as we are concerned, under the situation in  which the state has helped us solve some problems, it is very  important for us to change concepts, keep our eyes inward and  rely on our own efforts to become strong. It is necessary to  give full play to our province's natural resources, trained  personnel, and industrial advantages, base on ourselves and rely  on our own efforts to overcome difficulties, and through solid  and effective work, translate the factors that currently  restrict the province's development into advantages for  invigorating Heilongjiang. In line with the ideas of "five  extensions and two accelerations," we should grasp well the  development and construction of major projects, cultivate and  develop new economic growing points, and strengthen the staying  force for the national economy. Through reform, transformation,  opening up, and development, we should promote state-owned large  and medium-sized enterprises to change mechanisms and enhance  their vitality and strength. We should consolidate agriculture,  the foundation of the national economy, and vigorously increase  the comprehensive economic results of agriculture. While making  contributions to the state, we should further achieve  development; earnestly enforce the strategy of having science  and education make the province prosperous; promote the  scientific and technological progress; do a good job in the work  of personnel affairs; and upgrade the economic quality of the  province as a whole. Only by firmly fostering the unswerving  and persistent belief and determination of waging arduous  struggle can we fully discern that the current difficulties are  just the temporary ones cropping up along the advancing road and  are possible to overcome. Thus, the province's prosperity and  development will certainly be very hopeful as long as we  heighten our spirit, make concerted efforts, unite as one, go  all out to make the province strong, refrain from engaging in  myopic behavior for a single day, and engage in our work in a  down-to-earth manner for several years by displaying the  indomitable spirit and will. In order to fulfill these duties  and to do a good job in the government work, the acting governor  expressed in his report that he is ready to make efforts in the  following five aspects after the repeated meditation:    First, the government work should be strictly placed under  the leadership of the provincial party committee and under the  supervision of the provincial people's congress and its standing  committee. The linking of work and contacts with the provincial  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]  committee and various democratic parties should be positively  enhanced.    The provincial people's government should closely rely on  the  leadership of the provincial party committee. The leading body  of the provincial people's government should set an example in  earnestly implementing the arrangements made by the CPC Central  Committee, the State Council, and the provincial party  committee, and vigorously enable the work of the government and  various departments to embody the demands set in the party's  basic line. As for important and major policy decisions and  measures that have a bearing on reform, opening up, economic  development, and social stability, it is necessary to report  them to the provincial party committee in a timely manner and to  ask for instruction. The provincial people's government should  unswervingly implement the guidelines, policies, and work  arrangements defined by the provincial party committee. By  effectively conducting our work, we should ensure the  down-to-earth implementation of these guidelines, policies, and  arrangements and score results in the implementation. All  personnel from acting governor himself to the leading cadres and  staff members of units under the provincial people's government  should strengthen their sense of responsibility to the party and  their sense of organization and discipline and act in unison  with the CPC Central Committee in ideology and action.    In line with the provisions set in the Constitution and the  local organizational law, we should actively report our work to  the people's congress and its standing committee and fully  respect the power and duties imposed by the law on the people's  congress and its standing committee. We should also earnestly  implement the decisions, resolutions, and local regulations and  rules adopted by the people's congress and consciously accept  the congress' supervision. These decisions, resolutions, and  local regulations and rules are legally authentic and are  important basis for standardizing the government conduct. The  provincial people's government and its subordinate departments  should earnestly implement these decisions, resolutions, and  local regulations and rules and actively put forward legal  motions in the course of establishing the law systems of  socialist market economy so as to gradually orient the  government work onto the track of legal systems. Efforts should  be made to enhance the sense of democracy and legal systems; to  do things strictly according to the law; to perform the  administrative duties in line with the law; and to persistently  take the lead in studying, enforcing, and abiding by the law.  We should consciously accept the inspection conducted by the  deputies of the people's congress over the government work. As  for the criticism, opinions, and suggestions raised by the  deputies of the people's congress and by the special committees  under the people's congress, we should earnestly discuss and  handle them and embody them into our practical work so as to use  them to promote and improve the government work.    Governments should even more actively enhance their linking  work with the provincial CPPCC committee and various democratic  parties and fully attach importance on the role played by them  in participating in and discussing government and political  affairs and in conducting political consultation and democratic  supervision. We should report in a timely manner the situation  prevailing in the important and major issues to them and  earnestly listen to their opinions and suggestions relating to  the government work, economic construction, and social  undertakings.    Second, we should make concerted efforts, advance in a  united way, and bring into full play the overall functions of  the ordinary personnel of the provincial government.    We should further unify our thinking to lay a good  ideological foundation for bringing into play the overall  functions of the ordinary personnel of the provincial  government. We should conscientiously study the basic line of  the party and a series of principles and policies,  conscientiously implement the important arrangements made by the  party Central Committee and the State Council and the guidelines  of the important instructions on the work of Heilongjiang made  by the leading comrades of the central authorities, and reach  common understanding on a series of major issues. My own  ability and energy are limited. We should rely on the wisdom  and forces of the collectives, conscientiously listen to the  people's opinions when making policy decisions on major issues,  carry forward democracy, pool the wisdom and efforts of the  people, mobilize the enthusiasm of ordinary personnel, bring  into full play the advantages of the whole, and strive to make  policy decisions more democratic and scientific. According to  the principles of democratic centralism and of linking  responsibilities with rights, each and every government leading  member and each and every functional department should bring its  functions into play in dealing with the routine work of the  government; and assume responsibility for its work, its own  rights, and fulfill its duty according to the principle of  division of work. It is necessary to strictly perfect a system  of responsibility for fulfillment of assigned work, intensify a  mechanism for grasping the fulfillment of work, and bring into  play the main functions of leading bodies and all departments  under the governments. It is necessary to further perfect and  intensify the system of chiefs assuming responsibility for major  work and the leadership responsibility system among each level.  We should adopt effective measures to ensure that the  government work is under normal and orderly operation so as to  make the ordinary personnel of the governments work with one  heart and soul and do solid work and to promote the progress of  the economic and social undertakings.    Third, we should persist in the mass viewpoint and rely on  and serve the people wholeheartedly.    The mass viewpoint is not only a requirement for the work  line of the party but also a decision made according to the  purpose of the party. So, we should firmly foster the mass  viewpoint and regard wholeheartedly relying on and serving the  people as a point to start with and conclude the government  work. We should strive to mobilize the masses' enthusiasm for  reform and development and fully believe and rely on the masses  to rise over various difficulties cropping up in the course of  advance. The government should regularly accept the supervision  by the broad masses of the people so as to make the government  work more visible to the public and to enjoy the understanding  and support of the masses. The major policy decisions on reform  and development should be passed to the masses for discussions.  We should fully listen to the voices of the masses, respect the  experiences gained by the masses through practice and their  pioneering spirit, and embody their aspirations. We should go  all out to do solid work for the masses and always be concerned  with the weal and woe of the people. At present, we should pay  particular attention to the issues relating to price hikes, help  the enterprises in danger and those with difficulties solve  their problems, and solve the production and living problems of  the poverty-stricken rural areas. We should positively and  conscientiously handle the affairs that are in keeping with the  interests of the people and resolutely refuse to do the things  that go against the personal interests of the people so as to  make the government work and all policy decisions reflect and  fall in with the will of the people.    Fourth, we should study hard to ceaselessly upgrade the  leadership level and the ability in controlling the overall  situation.    I profoundly know that Job himself does not entrust  abilities  of man. Even now as I take on the post of acting governor,  this does not mean my work abilities suit the work  requirements. There must be a process of improvement. An  important task ahead of me at present is to study again. I have  to learn from books and mainly study the basic principles of  Marxism, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, and the theory on socialist market  economy. Simultaneously, I should also learn modern scientific  and technological knowledge and modern economic, social, and  administrative management methods; ceaselessly widen my own  knowledge fields and upgrade my leadership abilities. We should  learn from practice, regularly go down to the grass-roots units,  pay attention to investigation and study, discover the new  situation and study new problems in a timely manner, and sum up  the experiences created by the grass-roots units and the broad  masses of people so as to enrich ourselves and to guide our  work. It is necessary to learn from veteran leaders and  comrades. These veteran comrades have engaged in leadership  work for many years and accumulated many practical experiences.  They gave us lots of help in the past. I am willing to and  earnestly hope that these veteran leaders and comrades will  continue to offer views and suggestions for me and for the  government work and enable us to avoid detours and mistakes.    Fifth, we should perform the government work honestly and  diligently, do practical work, and enhance the cohesion of the  government.    "One who is just will do things uprightly and one who is  clean and honest will enjoy high prestige." I deeply feel that  only a clean and honest government can enjoy prestige and have  cohesion. I will start with this way of doing things myself,  set strict norms to keep my own conduct within proper bounds in  line with the central demands, and never abuse my own power to  seek personal gain or do things to harm the image of the party.  Meanwhile, I will pay attention to educating my family members,  children, and the functionaries around me. And on this basis, I  will work together with all of you to grasp administrative  honesty and diligence in the government and its subordinate  units. I will uphold the principle of taking a two-handed  approach in work and be tough with both, and while concentrating  efforts on grasping material civilization, exert efforts to  grasp the spiritual civilization. In economic activities and our  routine work, I will always attach importance to the people's  ideological and political work and actively promote the spirit  of building our country by means of thrift and hard work, giving  consideration to the overall situation, maintaining unity and  cooperation, performing official work diligently, cherishing the  people, and being eager to make dedications among the broad  masses of cadres and the people. I will resolutely struggle  against all sorts of corrupt phenomena, never avoid  contradictions, never tolerate or yield to the evil, and  realistically check the unhealthy trends existing in major  trades and important departments that seriously affect the  relationship between the government and the masses. Meanwhile,  I will strengthen comprehensive management of public security,  deal strict blows to all sorts of criminal activities, and  maintain social stability. As the saying goes, diligence can  make up for one's unskillfulness. Although my ability and level  are limited, I will strive to handle the government work  diligently, exert my utmost efforts, and devote more time and  energy to managing each and every work well in order to make up  for the deficiencies in my ability level. I will exercise  strict self-discipline by using the tenet of being realistic in  ideology and practical in work style and doing solid work and  concentrate the major energy and attention on solving practical  problems that affect the overall situation. As long as the work  style of working hard and being steadfast in work and plain in  living is formed and maintained in the government and its  functionaries, the government will surely become one enjoying  trust from the people and support from the masses.    Chairman, fellow vice chairmen, secretary general, and all  committee members, I heartily thank the chairmanship meeting of  the provincial people's congress standing committee for  nominating me as the candidate for acting governor. If my  appointment has been approved, I will act according to my  report, match my words with my deeds, perform my duties well,  speak less and work more, and undertake this historical heavy  task with untiring efforts. If my appointment has been  declined, I will continue to work hard as before, and will not  disappoint your great expectations on me.    Thank your very much.</p>

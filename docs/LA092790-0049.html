			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TASK FORCE PROBE IS SECOND LOOK AT OFFICER'S LINK TO PROSTITUTE  </P> <P> San Diego Police Sgt. Sal Salvatierra, whose home, car, locker and desk were  searched last week by the Metropolitan Homicide Task Force, was a subject of a  1985 internal affairs investigation into allegations that he and other police  officers had sex with prostitute Cynthia Maine, The Times has learned.  </P> <P> Investigators ruled the allegations "not sustained," meaning they could not  determine whether the claims about the officers were true or false and have  closed the case, two sources who have knowledge of the probe said.  </P> <P> "The allegations were that Maine was sexually involved with a number of  officers," said one source, who asked not to be identified. "These are the same  kind of allegations that are surfacing now."  </P> <P> The Metropolitan Homicide Task Force, which is investigating the murders of 43  women -- mostly prostitutes and transients -- searched Salvatierra's home last  week and the officers were said by one of the sources to be looking for  photographs of Maine and slain prostitute Donna Gentile. Law enforcement  officials said it was well-known that the two were close friends and police  informants.  </P> <P> Gentile was found slain in East County shortly after testifying against two  police officials. One was demoted and the other fired. Authorities long have  theorized that she may have been killed by police because her mouth was filled  with gravel, a sign of possible retaliation.  </P> <P> Although the task force interviewed Maine's relatives nearly a year ago, they  searched Salvatierra's home only last Thursday, when news got out about the  family's frustration that so little progress had been made in Maine's case.  Salvatierra was transferred to a special projects division pending the outcome  of the investigation.  </P> <P> The Times reported Wednesday that at least five police officers and a former  officer were under investigation by the task force for their association with  Maine or Gentile. Salvatierra's attorney, Everett Bobbitt, said police have no  evidence to link his client with Maine's disappearance.  </P> <P> Bobbitt said he had no comment about the internal affairs investigation  involving Salvatierra. Police Cmdr. Leroy Brady said the department had no  comment about Homicide Task Force matters. Internal affairs investigations  typically are secret and the results rarely made public.  </P> <P> Task force spokeswoman Bonnie Dumanis would not provide details on anything  having to do with the police officers.  </P> <P> "Should allegations arise about police misconduct, we'll look into it," she  said.  </P> <P> San Diego police officers can be fired for having sexual relations with  prostitutes, according to department policy.  </P> <P> Maine's family said she was intimately involved with John Fung, a member of the  narcotics street team, and as an informant, worked closely with Sgt. Dennis  Sesma, Fung's boss at the time.  </P> <P> Lori Helle, Maine's sister, said Maine often mentioned meeting with  Salvatierra, who then worked in the gang unit, and Les Oberlies, who worked in  criminal intelligence.  </P> <P> Oberlies, Fung and Sesma did not return telephone calls Wednesday. In an  interview Tuesday, Sesma said he had no connection with Maine other than  dealing with her as a police informant.  </P> <P> Sesma said Fung was like a father figure to Maine, providing her with cash from  his own pocket at times when she was short. It is easy to understand, Sesma  said, how Maine might have fallen in love with Fung.  </P> <P> But Maine's relatives said Fung returned the affection and began a 1 1/2-year  sexual relationship.  </P> <P> Lori Helle, Maine's sister, told The Times on Wednesday that notations in her  sister's diary indicate that she met Oberlies three times in 1984. They also  show a number of entries involving Fung. On one page, Maine wrote: "Loose lips  sink ships, John said."  </P> <P> On another page, Maine wrote: "John called 1st time in two weeks, came over,  talked 2 hours, headed for bedroom. (Her son) woke up from nap. Oh well."  </P> <P> On another: "Made John 2 dozen chocolate strawberries." Helle said Fung met  Maine on July 2, 1984, after he arrested her for prostitution and, thereafter,  she noted the second day of each month in her diary as an anniversary date.  </P> <P> Besides Fung and Oberlies, Helle said, her sister often mentioned that she was  going to meet Salvatierra and Sesma. She did not know whether the meetings were  related to her work as an informant, but said Maine never mentioned being  sexually involved with any of the officers except Fung.  </P> <P> Late last year, the homicide task force asked for Maine's diary and took some  photographs from her sister, which they returned two weeks ago.  </P> <P> Helle said two members of the task force interviewed her at that time and asked  about various officers, including Fung. Task force members and police officers  Jeff Dean and David Ayers showed her pictures of prostitutes, she said, many of  whom she did not recognize and all of whose names she did not know.  </P> <P> When they returned the diary two weeks ago, Dean and Ayers told Helle that they  planned to interview Fung and Maine's former boyfriend, Steve Smith, who is now  in jail. Fung has since been interviewed.  </P> <P> Cynthia, or Cindy, Maine was a heroin addict and spent upwards of $700 a day on  the drug, said her mother, Lynda Coleman. She turned to street-walking, mostly  along El Cajon Boulevard, to support her habit and met Fung in 1984, her family  says.  </P> <P> Maine landed in jail in November, 1985, for passing worthless checks, but her  four-month sentence was cut in half. Court records show that Capt. Mike Tyler  wrote a letter on her behalf asking that her sentence be reduced.  </P> <P> Maine's sister said she decided to provide internal affairs with information  linking officers with prostitutes.  </P> <P> "The only thing I know is that, when she was in jail, she ratted on some cops  to get out early," Helle said. "She had information about bad cops using  prostitutes. I'm not sure who they were."  </P> <P> When she got out of jail, Helle said, her sister was frightened because of  possible retaliation from police officers she had named.  </P> <P> "She had told on police," Helle said. "She was afraid of what she had done."  </P> <P> Two months after her release from prison, Maine disappeared on Feb. 23, 1986.  Six weeks later, with Steve Smith's general description of her car's location,  Coleman found Maine's locked yellow Pontiac Sunbird in the parking lot of the  El Torito Restaurant &amp; Cantina in La Mesa.  </P> <P> Inside were a newspaper dated Feb. 22, 1986; a purse holding a little more than  two dollars, a cigarette lighter, cigarettes, cosmetics, and a jacket, her  mother said.  </P> <P> Although she reported her daughter's disappearance to the La Mesa and San Diego  police departments, neither was initially interested in pursuing the case.  </P> <P> But when the task force made a connection between Gentile and Maine late last  year, they showed interest, Coleman said.  </P> <P> Coleman said she holds little hope that her daughter, who would be 31 next  month, is alive.  </P> <P> "It's a two-edged sword," she said. "Sometimes I wish I'd get the call that  they found her body. My life has to go on. I'm raising her bright 8-year-old  boy, who knows very little about his mom."  </P></p>

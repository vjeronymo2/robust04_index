			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHELLS RAIN ON BEIRUT FOR 3RD DAY;  </P> <P> BOMBARDMENT IS WORST IN 5 MONTHS IN LEBANON CAPITAL  </P> <P> After a break of only two hours, the heaviest sustained shelling in the  five-month battle of Beirut thundered with the dawn Saturday, obscuring the  city in a shroud of smoke at the start of another day of destruction.  </P> <P> For the third straight day, Syrian and Christian artillerymen trained their  guns across nearly half of Lebanon but poured the brunt of their fire on the  ruined, near-lifeless capital and its suburbs. By Saturday night, police  reports said 22 people had been killed and more than 110 wounded.  </P> <P> On Saturday, the French and Argentine embassies were hit by Syrian rockets, and  one French Embassy guard was slightly wounded, security sources said. The U.S.  and Brazilian embassies were also reported hit, according to Reuters news  agency. No injuries were reported.  </P> <P> At nightfall, an orphanage in West Beirut was hit by shellfire from Christian  forces, and three children were hospitalized in critical condition, according  to the Muslim-run Voice of the People radio station.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Diplomats' Houses Under Fire  </P> <P> In overnight shelling, the residences of U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy and  French Ambassador Rene Ala in suburban Yarze came under fire, the second time  in 48 hours. No one was reported injured at either location.  </P> <P> The summer-dry hills south of the city were afire, according to reports  reaching Cyprus, 90 miles offshore. Christian gunners searching for Syrian  battery emplacements had shelled the hills and villages with rockets and cannon  fire, turning the brush to flames.  </P> <P> A police spokesman said the Syrians showered the Christian bastion of East  Beirut and the mountains beyond with volleys of rocket fire at 6 a.m. Saturday,  ending a two-hour lull in the overnight shelling.  </P> <P> The Syrian rockets were answered by the heavy artillery of the predominantly  Christian Lebanese army, commanded by Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun. Shells from Aoun's  American-made 155-millimeter howitzers fell on suspected Syrian gun positions.  </P> <P> Shells and rockets rained down on some areas at the rate of 60 per minute,  security sources said Saturday. On Thursday and Friday, residents had said  rockets were falling at the rate of 40 a minute. At least 62 people have been  killed and nearly 400 wounded over the three-day period.  </P> <P> At Khalde, south of Beirut, the incoming shells sent Syrian soldiers manning a  checkpoint diving into roadside trenches. Some motorists hid under a highway  bridge, according to press accounts.  </P> <P> In Paris on Saturday, President Francois Mitterrand launched an international  peace initiative to end the artillery duels, asking Foreign Minister Roland  Dumas to send envoys to the Syrian capital of Damascus, Moscow, Washington and  the United Nations to try to end the shelling.  </P> <P> "The president has asked the government to do all it can to once again alert  the international community and interested countries to the Lebanese problem,"  the French Foreign Ministry said in a statement.  </P> <P> Officials will also consult members of the three-nation mission sent by the  Arab League to find a solution to the conflict, it added.  </P> <P> In a communique issued July 31, a league committee -- made up of King Fahd of  Saudi Arabia, King Hassan II of Morocco and Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid  -- declared it had reached an impasse, saying specifically that its proposals  for peace in Lebanon were turned down by the Syrian government of Hafez Assad.  </P> <P> In fact, Syria on Saturday vowed to step up its fight against Aoun, saying his  rule threatens the security of the Arab world.  </P> <P> "The conspiracy implemented by Aoun is clear," said the official Tishreen  daily. "The Arab responsibility requires intensifying efforts to prevent its  escalation because it does not only threaten Lebanon's security but that of the  Arab world."  </P> <P> For his part, Aoun on Saturday called for sanctions to be imposed on the  Damascus government.  </P> <P> "We call on the international community, especially the five permanent members  of the United Nations, to impose a political and economic boycott on the Syrian  regime, which has proved to be Nazi and barbaric," Aoun said in a statement.  </P> <P> In West Beirut, Sunni Muslim Premier Salim Hoss, who is backed by Syria, issued  a statement reflecting the despair of many Beirut residents.  </P> <P> "We would not be exaggerating when we say that for the first time since the war  broke out, we feel we are left blowing in the wind with no ceilings above our  heads," said Hoss, who heads a Muslim Cabinet vying for power with Aoun's  Christian military Cabinet.  </P> <P> The all-out artillery exchanges began Thursday afternoon, continued for 15  hours without letup and then eased for nine hours before resuming in Friday's  13-hour siege. On Friday, Christian shells fell on the eastern,  Syrian-controlled city of Baalbek, 40 miles northeast of Beirut, enlarging the  circumference of the artillery war.  </P> <P> More than 40 people were reported killed in shelling Thursday and Friday,  pushing the death toll over the past five months to nearly 600. The city has  been largely evacuated. The estimated 200,000 residents who remain in Beirut  leave their homes and shelters only for food and water. Electricity is  available no more than an hour a day, and often in the past week not at all.  Telephone connections to Cyprus have been out for days.  </P> <P> Only the artillerymen are at work -- and those who clean up the damage they  leave.  </P> <P> "Nations are not built on shelling and destruction and the killing of men,  women, children and old people," Sheik Mohammed Kabbani, the leader of  Lebanon's Sunni Muslims, declared Friday, imploring both sides to silence their  guns. "Where are the country's wise men to stop this tragedy, this mass murder,  this blood bath?"  </P> <P> Kabbani's predecessor as Sunni grand mufti, Sheik Hassan Khaled, was  assassinated in a car bombing in West Beirut last March, just as the artillery  war began.  </P> <P> In Washington on Friday, the State Department issued another appeal for a  cease-fire, again initially unheeded.  </P> <P> "The United States condemns the indiscriminate slaughter of innocent people and  the renewed use of heavy-caliber weapons," said spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.  U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar met with the five permanent  Security Council members on the situation.  </P> <P> During the Beirut hostage crisis that has gripped the outside world, the  Syrian-Christian shelling eased. However, nearly two weeks ago, just three days  into the crisis, the Arab League effort to halt the Beirut fighting broke down.  </P> <P> With the political initiative in collapse, diplomatic and press accounts from  Beirut reported both sides moving up heavy arms. Syrian troop and truck  movements were spotted in the eastern Bekaa Valley. Reinforcements on both  sides were noted at Souq el Gharb, a bloodied ridgeline village southeast of  Beirut where Christian and Muslim forces have faced off for years.  </P> <P> Several Beirut newspapers reported that the Syrians were placing tanks and  heavy guns along the Green Line that separates the Muslim west and Christian  east sectors of the capital. Throughout the more than 14 years of the sectarian  Lebanese civil war, weapons along the dividing line have fallen in the category  of small arms -- rifles, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades.  </P> <P> The developments of the past week seemed to signal that in the absence of a  political settlement, the Syrian forces were preparing a direct land assault on  the Christian enclave. That has not happened yet, but politicians are clearly  discouraged by the vacuum left by the abandonment of the Arab League effort.  </P> <P> The field has been left to the military men.  </P> <P> Aoun has predicted that a "river of resistance" will rise in Lebanon's cities  and villages against the 40,000-member Syrian army that controls two-thirds of  the country. The determined, tough-talking artillery general, head of the  Christian side of Lebanon's divided government, triggered the fighting in March  when his forces blockaded Muslim militia ports. The Syrians blockaded Christian  ports in return. When the shelling began, Aoun declared a "war of liberation"  against the Syrians, who first entered Lebanon in 1976 as Arab League  peacekeepers at the outset of the civil war.  </P> <P> Walid Jumblatt, head of the militant Druze forces in Lebanon and a firm ally of  Syria's Assad, foresaw the worst for Beirut. "Beirut will be another Stalingrad  and its future is very dark," the Druze leader told an Arab reporter last week.  "Beirut will be demolished and leveled to the ground."  </P> <P> In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Tutwiler had specifically mentioned  as "particularly destructive" the Syrians' Soviet-made 240-millimeter mortar,  which fires a massive round. Last week one fell on an underground shelter in  East Beirut, collapsing it and killing 11 occupants. Several of the giant  mortar rounds have fallen on the grounds of Aoun's presidential palace in the  past three days.  </P> <P> No weapon is more frightening than the rockets used by both sides. Fired from a  truck-mounted launcher of 40 tubes -- a modern version of the old Soviet  "Stalin Organ" -- the rockets stream toward their targets like huge handfuls of  explosive darts.  </P> <P> Describing a recent rocket exchange over West Beirut, a young secretary told a  British reporter: "When they began shooting at each other with these rockets --  40 on each side -- it was like an earthquake. My back started vibrating. Shells  were colliding in the air."  </P></p>

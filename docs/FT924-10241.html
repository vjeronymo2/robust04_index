			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Danish premier under threat from scandals WHEN DENMARK'S foreign minister, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, sets out this week to sell his country's ideas on the Maastricht treaty to the other European Community governments, he will leave behind an administration adrift on a sea of domestic troubles. These problems could become so acute within the next few weeks that the prime minister, Mr Poul Schluter, might have to resign after 10 years in office. This would almost certainly precipitate an election in which the opposition Social Democratic party would have an excellent chance of emerging as the winner, with its leader, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, as the next prime minister. All this would be happening at a particularly difficult moment, with Denmark to assume the presidency of the Community on January 1, but a change of government might help gain Danish electoral acceptance for the Maastricht treaty next year. When the treaty was voted down by referendum last June, the result was determined by the fact that 60 per cent or more of the supporters of the Social Democratic party rejected their party's advice and voted against. In government, the party's authority and ability to persuade its supporters to back the treaty in a second referendum would be much greater, according to a senior diplomat. The government's troubles have nothing to do with Maastricht, but are related to a series of political-administrative scandals. The most serious is the long-running 'Tamil scandal'. In 1987, a minister of justice broke the law by denying the right of Tamil refugees in Denmark to bring in their close relatives to join them. The prime minister had no part in his minister's action but, in April 1989, he reported to parliament on the matter with the words: 'Nothing has been swept under the carpet'. A judicial inquiry, conducted by High Court Judge Mogens Hornslet, has spent almost two years trying to establish whether there is a case for further proceedings against any of the ministers or civil servants involved. The judge's report is expected early next month. Politicians and political commentators believe Mr Schluter will have to resign if the report criticises him either directly or implicitly.</p>

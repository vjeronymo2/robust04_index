			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Balladur hopeful for jobs MR Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, yesterday predicted that his economic regeneration plans should start to halt the rise in unemployment by the end of this year. The prime minister said in a television interview that he planned to table legislation this autumn to liberalise France's notoriously strict labour laws. The reforms will include measures to reduce working hours, cut costs for employers and boost youth training schemes. Mr Balladur plans to continue his job creation theme in the 1994 budget by reducing employers' contributions to family allowance payments, thereby making it cheaper for them to hire new staff. Other measures will include cuts in income tax in an attempt to stimulate the recession-struck French economy. He also confirmed that the special government bond issue launched 10 days ago to finance his existing job creation programme had been 'very well received'. The issue, which is expected to raise at least FFr40bn (Pounds 4.7bn), is being heavily marketed as a precursor to the government's privatisation programme. The proceeds of the issue will be ploughed into the FFr63bn economic regeneration package that Mr Balladur unveiled after his centre-right coalition took office in late March. The prime minister said those measures should start to take effect 'around December or January'.</p>

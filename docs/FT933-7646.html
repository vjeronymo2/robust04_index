			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / 100,000 companies 'breaking data protection law' MORE THAN 100,000 businesses and other data users are illegally handling information on private individuals, says a report from the National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog. The report, which reveals widespread ignorance about the existence and purpose of the Data Protection Act 1984, calls for a renewed effort to increase registrations and a better policing system to ensure full compliance with the law. Mr Eric Howe, the data protection registrar, who administers the act, has told the watchdog that only about 150,000 organisations have registered under the legislation. Mr Howe admits that there is no 'satisfactory or reliable' method of establishing the number of data users who should register. His most recent estimate of 250,000 is thought to be a conservative one. Under the act data users cannot use or disclose information other than for strictly defined purposes. Individuals have right of access to the information, which can be amended or erased if it is inaccurate. Failure by qualifying data users to register under the act is a criminal offence, although there have been few prosecutions because of difficulties in proving illegal activity. The watchdog reports research by the registrar which suggests that one in three small companies and nearly one in six large companies are unaware of their statutory obligation to register. One in eight small companies know nothing about the act. According to the watchdog, there is 'little investigative effort' aimed at checking registration, with most attention paid by the registrar to ensuring the renewal of registration on expiry. Even so, the report says, many data users are failing to re-register, while attempts to monitor compliance with good practice among registered data users are limited and are usually invoked only in response to complaints from the public. But high levels of ignorance also persist among the general public, the watchdog says. It reports that although four out of five people regard protecting people's rights to personal privacy as very important, the same proportion is unaware that the law grants them rights and safeguards about information held on them. The watchdog says that a campaign to publicise the act should be launched. The report, however, acknowledges the legal and financial constraints that limit the registrar.

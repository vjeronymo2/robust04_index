			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- Press Secretary of the  Russian president Vyacheslav Kostikov told a briefing here today  that the Russian-Western "romantic embrace" is over.    "I think what has happened is that Russia, Europe and  America  have passed the stage of romanticism in post-totalitarian  diplomacy when both sides embraced each other so tightly that  national security interests were left aside," he said.    "Russia increasingly sees itself as a great power and it has  started saying this loudly. Europe has understood that Russian  interests will no longer dissolve in the interests of European  diplomacy. At the same time, I would not say we are talking  about a cooling of relations," noted Kostikov.    "I think it is good, it is right because it will save us  from  disappointments or even mistakes in the future and negotiations  will have a sound pragmatic basis," he stressed.</p>

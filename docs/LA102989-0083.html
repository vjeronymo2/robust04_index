			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE'S MEASURE N AND THE ISSUES OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND PRIVACY  </P> <P> It disturbs us that both proponents and opponents of Irvine's Measure N have  chosen to play on the fears of the voters. Opponents say if you support Measure  N, then you are a religious and political extremist and a gay and lesbian  basher. Supporters say that if you oppose Measure N, then you advocate  destruction of family and church and promote deviant sexual activity. Neither  position is supported by the facts. Both positions are wrong morally and  legally. Measure N is not a civil rights issue, it is a privacy issue.  </P> <P> Should we create special legal categories to protect people because of their  sexual behavior? Do we add to the affirmative action programs "sexual  orientation" as a special protected category? Gay activists say that they are  discriminated against like racial religious minorities. How do we know if we  are discriminating?  </P> <P> The Human Rights Ordinance insists that we recognize "sexual orientation" and  disclose it to our employers, landlords and government institutions to prevent  discrimination. If sexual practices are a basis for special recognition in the  law, then why not other behaviors? The law does discriminate against certain  behaviors. It discriminates against and regulates the behavior of smokers, drug  users and alcohol abusers. Aren't their behaviors equally in need of special  protection?  </P> <P> It is unquestionably wrong to persecute or discriminate against gays, lesbians  and bisexuals. They deserve the full protection of the law because they are  ordinary citizens, but not because of their sexual behavior. Without the  language of "sexual orientation" in the Human Rights Ordinance, the law  protects and reaffirms the protection of fundamental rights of all citizens  guaranteed by the U.S. and state constitutions.  </P> <P> Measure N is not a civil rights issue, it is a behavior issue. The right of  privacy protects our sexual behavior from invasion by others. Present law  grants the right of privacy and decriminalizes sexual practices. Our sexual  practices are protected from disclosure. But the Human Rights ordinance invades  that privacy.  </P> <P> No one's sexual conduct is entitled to special legal protections. The right of  privacy becomes immediately invaded when our employers, landlords and  government must look into our homes to check our sexual orientation in order to  prevent discrimination.  </P> <P> You are neither a sinner nor a bigot if you vote Yes on N. A Yes vote will keep  your sexual orientation your own business, not the city's. A Yes vote on N  preserves civil rights by protecting the rights of persons based on their life  status or religious beliefs, not their behavior. Protect your freedom and your  privacy. Vote Yes on N.  </P> <P> HUGH BRECKENRIDGE  </P> <P> KIT BRECKENRIDGE  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

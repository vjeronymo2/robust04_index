Federal Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel  announced today that he wanted to convince his Russian  counterpart Andrey Kozyrev of NATO's position in their talks in  Athens. Chancellor Helmut Kohl stressed that everything had to  be done to "include" Russia.    Before flying to Athens for a meeting with his counterparts  from Greece, Belgium, and Germany, Kozyrev gave an assurance  that Russia would not allow anyone to divert it from the path of  strategic partnership with the United States and the other  Western countries because of the Bosnian crisis. Air strikes by  NATO in Bosnia could, however, bring about the collapse of the  peace process, Kozyrev warned.    Kohl told the daily paper DIE WELT that he was glad there  was  now a joint decision by NATO and that U.S. President Bill  Clinton had assumed "some kind of leadership role." There was  now "another chance for an end to this terrible war in the  Balkans and, above all, the horrific suffering of the  population." Although the Bundeswehr cannot make available any  troops of its own in the former Yugoslavia for historic reasons,  he wanted to give logistical support outside that territory if  it was necessary and Bonn was asked for it.    Speaking on the private television station VOX, Kinkel said  the deployment of German soldiers on AWACS aircraft is not  affected by possible NATO air strikes against Serb positions in  Bosnia. The stationing of Bundeswehr soldiers on NATO ship  convoys in the Adriatic is also covered by the Constitution.    The former Bundeswehr General Elmar Schmaehling had earlier  warned in a DDP/ADN interview that the participation of German  soldiers in AWACS reconnaissance flights in the event of a NATO  air strike against Serb positions in Bosnia would violate the  Constitution. The German Government would, after all, be taking  part in "military attacks" outside NATO territory. This would  be in contravention of Article 87a of the Basic Law, according  to which German forces can only be deployed for defense purposes.</p>

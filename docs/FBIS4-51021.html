			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporters] </F>   [Text] Beijing has issued a pre-4 June emergency order to  allow immediate arrests on any kind of suspicion. The  authorities had ordered the strictest security seen in five  years in the capital, sources said yesterday. China's leaders  are on full alert against a possible uprising as the fifth  anniversary of the 4 June, 1989, Tiananmen Square incident looms.    A special committee has been set up by the State Education  Commission, the Beijing municipal party committee and district  party committees to deal with any sudden developments, sources  close to the Chinese authorities said.    There are strong signs of rising tension in the capital,  with  the People's Liberation Army (PLA) patrolling the streets and  leaders nervous about a possible power struggle as paramount  leader Deng Xiaoping's health declines. The sources said  protest marches and demonstrations planned for the 4 June  anniversary were being forced underground by the clampdown.    The authorities have banned large gatherings in Beijing  during this sensitive period. A charity fund-raising campaign  being organised by a group of Hong Kong businessmen to be held  later this week has had to be cancelled because of the emergency  order.    The authorities fear that another upheaval like the  pro-democracy movement of 1989 could spark a power struggle,  sources said. A source quoted a state leader's son as saying  that Deng Xiaoping had become a "vegetable" because of serious  illness.    There have been strong rumours about Mr Deng's declining  health since he appeared on Chinese Central Television earlier  this year looking dull. "State leaders are living in a very  tense atmosphere and are alert to every small change," the  source said.    Leaders fear, a power struggle when Mr Deng dies--a  repetition of what had happened after the death of the party  chairman Mao Zedong. Meanwhile, high inflation and a large trade  deficit had put huge pressure on state leaders, he said.    "Many Chinese officials wish that Deng Xiaoping could appear  in public again to stabilise public feeling." On previous  anniversaries of the crackdown, only armed police have been on  patrol, a resident said.    But now PLA troops have been seen patrolling day and night  in  Beijing, including at Chang An Street, the main street and the  longest in the capital. Meanwhile, Beijing has sent a circular  to institutions, urging citizens to be cautious in the "serious"  period between 6 May and 10 June. "Do not listen to the rumours  of conspirators, do not gather around to watch in public areas,  treasure the present good and stable atmosphere that the  opening-up policy has brought," it said.</p>

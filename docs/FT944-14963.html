			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Forte creates separate County Hotels chain Forte yesterday reshuffled its hotel portfolio, putting 80 of its lower-grade properties in a new company which will not carry the group's name. Forte said 60 of its Heritage hotels and 20 unbranded properties would be placed in a new company called County Hotels. The hotels will be promoted separately from the rest of the group. Forte intends to look for a buyer or joint venture partner for them. Forte's Heritage group of hotels will be halved in size to 51 properties which will be in the three- and four-star categories. The Heritage hotels are traditional properties in rural locations, historic cities and market towns. The group also announced that it would refocus its Forte Grand hotels, making them partners for the Meridien chain. Forte won control of Meridien last month, defeating Accor of France. The Grand hotels are 26 of Forte's first class properties. They include the Waldorf in London, the Bath Spa and the Balmoral in Edinburgh. Some of the more traditional Grand hotels, such as the Compleat Angler in Marlow are to be moved into the Heritage group. The Grand hotel group does not include Forte's most luxurious properties, which are part of the Exclusive group. The reshuffle leaves Forte with the following brands: Exclusive: these are 17 luxury hotels, including the Plaza Athenee and George V in Paris, the Sandy Lane in Barbados, the Hyde Park in London and the Ritz in Madrid. Forte Grand: 26 hotels. Forte Heritage: 51 hotels. Meridien: 54 hotels. Meridien properties are in several cities in which Forte has had no presence, including Tokyo, Singapore, Jakarta, Bangkok and New Delhi. Forte Crest: 30 hotels. These are four-star hotels in city centres and at airports, offering business facilities. Forte Posthouse: 65 hotels. These are modern three-star hotels, many near large towns and motorways. Forte Agip: 18 hotels. A joint venture with Agip, the state-owned Italian petrochemical company. These are modelled on Forte Posthouse. The chain has 17 hotels in Italy and one in Hungary. Forte Travelodge: These are budget hotels, mainly on motorways and main roads. Forte opens its 100th UK Travelodge on Monday. It also has two in the Irish Republic and is building two in Spain. It has 436 Travelodges in the US.</p>

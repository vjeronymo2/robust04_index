Zhu Yucheng, deputy director of XINHUA news agency Hong Kong  branch, accused the British side of playing mathematics games,  saying Hong Kong residents should establish a monitoring group  to supervise the construction of the new airport.    Zhu said, "We have reiterated that the airport should be  constructed in accordance with the memorandum of mutual  understanding. But the fourth proposal put forward by the  British side still poses a big problem: who should be  responsible for the more than 20 billion H.K. [Hong Kong]  dollars (2.564 billion U.S. dollars) debt."    He accused the Hong Kong Government of intending to shift  the  debt burden to the Special Administrative Region Government of  Hong Kong by changing the provisional airport authority into the  so-called airport corporation.    On the composition of the monitoring organization, he said  this needs further consultation as it is the Hong Kong residents  who pay for the construction of the airport.</p>

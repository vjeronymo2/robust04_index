			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> QUAYLE ASSAILS CARTER'S ORTEGA TALK AND TAKES A JAB AT REAGAN  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle today criticized former President Jimmy Carter for  holding discussions with Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, saying "it has a  chance of complicating matters."  </P> <P> He also took a back-handed jab at former President Ronald Reagan, indicating he  occasionally used excuses to duck out of talking with reporters.  </P> <P> Noting that the United States refuses to talk with Ortega, Quayle said:  </P> <P> "Obviously, when you have a former President meeting with heads of state we  don't meet with, it has a chance of complicating matters," he told reporters  following the inauguration of Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez.  </P> <P> U.S. Ambassador Otto Reich said Quayle, midway through a three-day visit to  Latin America, would not meet here with Ortega. The Nicaraguan leader shared a  peace proposal in a meeting Wednesday with Carter and Perez.  </P> <P> Reich said Quayle had no plans to meet with Carter, although the two did speak  briefly Wednesday night at a reception.  </P> <P> Quayle and the U.S. delegation are trying to learn more about the peace  proposal Ortega brought with him to Caracas.  </P> <P> Asked if he had talked to President Bush since arriving here Wednesday, Quayle  noted that Bush had a cold and laryngitis. "Reagan used to use that (as an  excuse) not to have press conferences, but it won't be in this Administration,"  he said.  </P></p>

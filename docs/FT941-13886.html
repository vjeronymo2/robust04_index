			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Books: The Iceman cometh THE MAN IN THE ICE by Konrad Spindler Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 18.99 305 pages To call this 'the archaeological event of the century' smacks of hyperbole. The man who was hacked out of a glacier in the Tyrolean Alps in September 1991 may have been over 5,000 years old, but he was not a chieftain or a demi-god. He bore no fine insignia, commanded no great armies, patronised no bards and had no stores of gold. Nameless, illiterate, astray from his home, he was found by chance; and he survives in spite of, not because of, the clumsy effort to extract him from the ice. His promotion as the Tutankhamun of the North seems thoroughly perverse. Yet the Iceman commands our imagination in ways a pharaoh never could. No doubt he led a wolfish and niggardly life, but his simple masteries of Alpine subsistence will appeal to anyone with a flinty spark of the Boy Scout in them. He carried a pannier on his back, whose frame was made of hazel wands and larch wood. He wore an impervious belt pouch, with fire-kindling devices inside. Two containers, made of birch bark, were found near his body; his last meal had been of dried ibex, perhaps from an animal he had earlier dispatched with his bow. At the time of his death, he was carrying a slightly unfinished yew bow-stave; and the contents of his deerhide quiver reveal that he had some work to do on his arrows, too. A small flint dagger served as his penknife, and he also had a copper-bladed axe, which the first discoverers of the lceman took to be a quaint Victorian ice-pick. All these items bespeak an enviable ingenuity, and the sort of survival skills which a modern commando would hardly match. Tenderly documented in this book, the lceman's clothes are particularly instructive. He wore a knee-length cape of plaited grass, a snug bell-shaped cap, and various layers and leggings of leather and fur: his leather bootees were grass-upholstered too. But of course the insulation was not enough. Trapped in bad weather at an altitude of over 3,000 metres, he lay down, probably exhausted. In a short while he was frozen under a pelt of snow. And that makes a second claim upon us. Pity rises easily for this proto-Alpiniste. Just as, with the wretched people of Pompeii, one can rebuild a melodrama from the figures caught in Vesuvian ash, so a mixture of fantasy and detection yields a story for this wizened nonentity. The romance concocted by Professor Spindler is that the Iceman was escaping a local pogrom, in which his village had been destroyed. He may have escaped after a struggle, for several of his ribs were recently broken before his death; at thirtysomething, he may have lost all that he loved (including his best bow). Perhaps a Neolithic Titus Oates, the poignant loneliness of his end is only tempered by the consolation of his archaeological utility. Fully-dressed and equipped Europeans of 3000 BC have never been preserved like this before: for proper burial normally ensures their organic reintegration with the world. The Iceman's loss of rights, then, is a scientific gain. In this book, and elsewhere, the lceman has achieved a type of saintliness. It is born of his portable herbal nostrums, his epic little journeyings, his wisely-made accoutrements: all of which say more about modern yearnings for the state of noble savagery, not our passion for Neolithic knowledge. But there may be one predominant subliminal motive for canonising the Iceman. According to a Swedish system of determining kinship amongst populations, a man who lived over 5,000 years ago has a certain ratio of generational contact extended over the centuries. In short, as Professor Spindler puts it, the Iceman 'must be distantly related to us all.'</p>

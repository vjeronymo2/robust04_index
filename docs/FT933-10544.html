			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Bundesbank cuts rate for short-term lending THE BUNDESBANK helped to restore order to foreign exchange markets yesterday by cutting the cost of short-term lending to commercial banks. The action helped to correct the D-Mark's appreciation against other European currencies after the relaxation of the exchange rate mechanism's rules on Monday. The German central bank's decision to cut its repo rate by 0.15 percentage points to 6.80 per cent was the third surprise it has given financial markets in less than a week, and was followed by a sharp appreciation in the value of the French franc, which closed in London at FFr3.485 against the D-Mark from a previous FFr3.505. In late New York trading it firmed slightly. The action also helped other currencies, including the Danish krone and the Spanish peseta, to rise against the D-Mark after suffering sharp falls in recent days. The Bundesbank's decision, however, could not prevent several European governments from continuing to express concern that their currencies might suffer sharp depreciations in the wake of Monday's transformation of the ERM and from taking protective measures in financial markets. Denmark continued to defend the krone's value by keeping its money market interest rates at extremely high levels. At one stage yesterday, the interest rate for borrowing krone overnight was 250 per cent, with one-month interest rates at 25 per cent through the day. These interest rates helped the krone to appreciate to a London close of DKr3.975 against the D-Mark, having been as low as DKr4.0467 at one stage, and was unchanged in New York. The Belgian authorities intervened in currency markets for the second day running, buying the Belgian franc as the currency came under a modest speculative attack from dealers and fell to its lowest point in this crisis. The Belgian government may be worried that the fracturing of its link with the D-Mark will highlight basic economic problems, including a government debt level estimated at 130 per cent of gross domestic product. European governments may be unwilling to cut rates, risking currency depreciation, until they have improved the level of central bank reserves, badly depleted by the intervention to support their currencies last week. The Bank of Spain, however, may have encouraged other central banks to ease monetary policy by cutting interest rates and seeing the peseta move sharply higher against the D-Mark. After the repo rate was cut from 11 per cent to 10 1/2 per cent, the peseta rallied to a London close of Pta81.48 to the D-Mark, having been at Pta83.17 at the start of trading. Strong speculation about a base rate cut in the UK continued to affect sterling markets, with long-dated gilts rising on the day. Some analysts said that yesterday's cut in the German repo rate may have partly reflected the Bundesbank's need to take control of the money market after the turmoil of recent days. The cost of borrowing overnight funds from German banks has tumbled by about 1/2 a percentage point since last Friday.

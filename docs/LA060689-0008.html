			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A standard blood test for kidney functioning may indicate a heightened risk of  dying within eight years among people with high blood pressure, a study  suggests. The study, of 10,768 people with high blood pressure, found that  those with high levels of creatinine, a waste product produced by muscle  tissue, in their blood showed higher death rates from heart attack and stroke  as well as kidney disease, the researchers said. Death rates rose with rising  creatinine levels. Kidneys normally remove creatinine from blood, so high  levels can signal kidney trouble. The work by researchers at several medical  schools is presented in the May issue of the journal Hypertension.  </P></p>

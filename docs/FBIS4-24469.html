			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 27 KYODO -- Armed police beat and  rounded up some 40 Tibetan merchants who demonstrated against a  tax hike in the Tibetan city of Lhasa, informed sources said  Friday [27 May].    The policemen also confiscated the camera, films and  passports of four foreign travellers, including American  tourists, who photographed the scene of the clampdown, the  sources said.    The police charged the Tibetans as they shouted such slogans  as "we oppose a tax increase" in front of the local  administration office, according to foreign travellers who  witnessed the beatings.    A column of some 100 armed policemen blockaded roads leading  up to the scene of the brawl for a few hours, they said.    The latest clampdown followed the arrest of a Tibetan  Buddhist priest who demanded independence from Chinese rule on  April 24.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Members of the Indian Communities set up barricades  today on the main northern roads to protest an initiative to  reform the law on agrarian regulations. The barricades halted  traffic on the northern stretch of the Pan-American Highway  blocking one of the main roads at the height of [name  indistinct] and Cotopaxi, 100 km from Quito.    The bill approved on Friday by Congress proposes modifying  the agrarian reforms to increase production in the nation's  farming fields. Now, only President Sixto Duran-Ballen's  approval is required for the bill to become law. The Indian  Communities, however, have threatened to block roads and isolate  Quito if the president approves the draft bill. We are not  willing to accept this aggression, said an Indian leader. We  have not been taken into account. They think they can do as they  please behind our backs; we will show them how the people react,  he said.    A leader of the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of  Ecuador [Conaie] told REUTER NEWS AGENCY, that the blocking of  the roads today is only a first step of a series of measures to  be taken, if the president of the Republic ratifies the draft  bill.    In our noon newscast we had reported the position of several  Indian organizations, particularly those of Imbabura, Pichincha,  Tungurahua, Cotopaxi, and Chimborazo.    A government spokesman indicated that Duran-Ballen could  make  a decision on the issue in a few hours. The bill is very similar  to another reform bill presented by the government that was  recently rejected by the Congress, after a series of protests by  Indians associations that considered it detrimental to their  interests.    The Social Christian Party drafted the current bill,  indicating it is fairer than the previous bill but also seeks to  encourage better use of land to increase farming production.  Nevertheless, the bill has been questioned by every sector,  arguing it is a copy of the previous one with some changes that  are merely cosmetic, with no real changes. The draft bill  presented by Conaie to the Congress, has not been discussed.  According to several Indian groups, the reform draft bill wipes  out the Agrarian Reform's gains and authorizes the government to  confiscate lands currently in Indian hands and to turn them over  to rich land owners.    Vicente Chato, Indian leader of Tungurahua, indicated that  Conaie and other Indian associations will meet tomorrow to  decide on the measure to be taken. They seek to pressure the  government to put aside its intention of eliminating the  Agrarian Reform.    Traditionally, the Indian protests in our nation have been  characterized by the closing of highways and occasional  confrontations with the police without reaching excessive levels  of violence. This weekend in Chimborazo Province it was reported  that some Indians groups had met somewhat secretly to decide on  measures on the agrarian bill approved last week.</p>

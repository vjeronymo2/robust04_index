			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 14 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Defense  Secretary William Perry said here today he took "full  responsibility" for the incident in which two U.S. helicopters  were shot down by two U.S. fighter planes in Northern Iraq this  morning.    Perry told reporters at a special news briefing that the  helicopters were Army UH-60 Blackhawk and the fighter planes  were Air Force F-15c.    The incident took place at approximately 35 miles north of  Irbil in Iraq at about 3:30 am eastern daylight time when the  helicopters were attacked by missiles fired by the fighter  planes.    "Apparently the U.S. helicopters were mistakenly identified  as Iraqi Hind helicopters operating in the northern no-fly  exclusion zone," Perry said.    There were about 12 American crew members on the two  helicopters and more than 20 passengers including U.N. officers  from several nations.    Visiting British Defense Minister Malcolm Rifkind said at  the  news briefing that two British officers were likely to be killed  in the incident.    Perry expressed regrets over the tragic incident, adding  that  "I take full responsibility for today's tragedy" and "I pledge  that I will take a direct role in ensuring that the  investigation is conducted as thoroughly, as quickly as  possible."    General John Shalikashvili also expressed "deepest sorrow  and  regret" over the incident, saying that "as chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff I feel a sense of personal responsibility for  this tragedy and the loss of so many lives."</p>

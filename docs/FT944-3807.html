			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / The Union turns its gaze towards the south After a tilt to the east, now a move south. Over the next 18 months the rotating presidency of the European Union will be in the hands of countries with Mediterranean coastlines, starting with France on January 1, to be followed by Spain and Italy. For the past six months the Union has been dominated by German preoccupations with its neighbours - the former communist countries of eastern Europe - and the expansion of the Union to Austria, Sweden and Finland. France now intends to redress the balance by turning its attention southwards, with issues such as the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, immigration from North Africa, terrorism and drugs high on its agenda. Spain has announced that it will host a special EU-Mediterranean conference during its presidency in the second half of next year to discuss relations between the Union and its southern neighbours. Such a dialogue, however, would stop short of full-fledged membership of the Union for them. Only Malta and Cyprus are preparing for accession, but negotiations will not begin until after the 1996 intergovernmental conference. EU leaders at the weekend showed their commitment to their southern neighbours by blessing a plan to embrace North Africa and the Middle East in a free trade zone. The EU's ultimate ambition is to create a Euro-Mediterranean economic area. France, at odds with Germany over Europol, a proposed cross-border police agency, committed itself to reaching an agreement on establishing the new body by the next EU summit at Cannes next June. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, said the French commitment was one of the most important advances of the weekend. Justice and home affairs ministers will have to find a 'balanced solution' for the structure of the system, blocked until now not only by France but also by Spain and the UK. France has insisted that national police officers attached to Europol must have standardised data pooled in the agency, and also more sensitive intelligence. Germany, backed by the other member states, wants to restrict access to sensitive data except where Europol and national liaison officers attached to it are directly involved. Mr Mitterrand's commitment delighted Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who believes Europol will help stem rising crime in Germany, in particular car theft, and assuage anxieties about the smuggling of nuclear material from Russia.</p>

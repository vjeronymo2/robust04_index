			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> THOUSANDS BATTLE 29 WESTERN WILDFIRES  </P> <P> Thousands of firefighters -- plagued by erratic winds, lightning and a summer  heat wave -- fought to contain about 29 wildfires that were burning more than  87,000 acres in Western states, threatening homes in some places. Fire crews  were at work in Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, California and  Washington. Four big fires burned in interior Alaska, one having charred an  estimated 24,000 acres. The Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho said 7,000  to 7,500 people were on fire lines, along with 42 air tankers and 10  helicopters. Many of the fires were in areas that had not burned in a number of  years, spokesman Arnold Hartigan said, and some were in inaccessible terrain.  </P></p>

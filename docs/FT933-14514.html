			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / People: Read plugs into Logica network Logica, the computing services company, is strengthening its senior management by promoting David Mann into the new position of deputy chairman, and bringing in Martin Read (right) as the next managing director and chief executive. Paul Bosonnet, who took over when Logica's founder Philip Hughes stepped down in 1990, says that, unlike Hughes, he is a part-time chairman 'with the accent very much on the part-time'. This means that he has 'had very little involvement with customers'. Hence Mann, who has been at Logica since 1969, will be able to devote more time to customers and industry partners now he is freed of day-to-day management responsibilities. Meanwhile, 43-year-old Read has been headhunted from GEC-Marconi. Appointed managing director of Marconi Command and Control Systems in 1989, he was then made managing director of Marconi Radar and Control Systems on the 1991 merger with Marconi Radar. In the following year he also took on the supervisory managing directorship of the GEC systems engineering company EASAMS, as well as the GEC-Marconi Research Centre. This year he collected similar roles at GEC Computer Services and GEC-Marconi Software Systems, an accumulation of extra responsibilities that Bosonnet calls 'very encouraging'. 'We were looking for somebody who did not replicate everything we already had inside Logica,' says the chairman. 'He is not unfamiliar with software and he has enough educational background to understand our business.' Read has a natural sciences degree from Cambridge and an Oxford DPhil in physics. He is also expected to inject more than a whiff of the culture of his previous employer. 'Coming from GEC he is a little more hard-nosed and commercially-oriented; we inevitably start from our interest in technology,' as Bosonnet puts it. However, despite holding down international management positions for Overseas Containers and International Paint before joing GEC-Marconi in 1985, he has no real operating experience in the US, where Logica continues to experience difficulties. 'If you compile a list of all the attributes you want, you rule yourself and everybody else out,' Bosonnet says philosophically. While Read becomes boss of a publicly listed company, Logica, which employs 3,300 people and has annual sales of Pounds 200m, is considerably smaller than the outfits he has been running. Marconi Radar and Control Systems alone sees a turnover of Pounds 310m and has more than 4,000 employees.</p>

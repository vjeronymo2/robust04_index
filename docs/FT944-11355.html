			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / This Week: The mystery that is Formula One - Sport Hamlet should have been running Formula One motor racing. 'The play's the thing,' he urged as the Danish monarchy struggled to shake off some terrible PR. Despite a season that could scarcely have begun with worse portents, including the death of Ayrton Senna and the Benetton fire, somehow the Grand Prix circus is once again delivering the goods. The duel between Michael Schumacher and Damon Hill for the championship is providing a finish that hasn't been as tight or absorbing since Senna v Prost in 1991, while the newly-announced partnership of Mercedes and McLaren shows that F1 is still the motor-sport arena that counts with the biggest motor companies. Worldwide television audiences have shown a huge increase, against all pre-season predictions. ('Don't under-estimate the morbid desire to watch the 20th slo-mo replay of Senna's death,' a cynic in the pit-lane cautioned me). In his office above Knightsbridge, in London, barrister Max Mosley, who is the ringmaster of Grand Prix, is cautiously satisfied. Overall, he says, the most important end-of-term conclusion is that the officials are back in charge of their massively powerful vehicle. 'Basically, we try to slow the cars down and the teams attempt to speed them up,' he says. 'This season we have proved that we can control the technology, for the good of the sport.' Regulating a game like soccer - 22 lads and a ball - cannot be anything like as difficult as regulating Grand Prix. The sport lives or dies by its creation of technical regulations to produce closely-matched racing. Yet when every Formula One car receives between 50 and 100 modifications between each race, the task of scrutineering becomes impossible. 'The days when you employed an engineer with a micrometer, tape measure and oily rag are over,' says Mosley. 'A device like traction control, for example, will have several million lines of code in the on-board computer. Checking something like that requires an expert.' Last winter the governing bodies agonised over repeated criticisms that the average F1 race had become a dollar-driven technology procession. The best-funded teams had cars that were unbeatable. Drivers were becoming jaded button-pushers, ran the argument. Mosley, a former competitor, was sympathetic. Traction control was banned, and next season sees smaller three-litre engines and revised aerofoil systems, all designed to reward driver skill and innovative low-budget teams. Yet surely all this is window-dressing. In terms of results, nothing has changed. After Williams, McLaren, Benetton and Ferrari, the average non-afficianado would struggle to name an F1 team. The only glimpse most of us have of a Simtek or a Ligier is when the on-board camera on Schumacher's car shows them being lapped. 'I think we've closed the gap somewhat,' claims Mosley, stopwatch and calculator in hand. 'The top 20 cars this season would have lap times within three seconds of each other. I don't think Formula One has ever been so competitive.' There are those who say that the sport created its own suspense and stopped the season being a total Benetton benefit when it banned Schumacher for two races and disqualified him after he had crossed the line first in Belgium. It put Damon Hill back in with a chance, which he consolidated by winning the Japanese Grand Prix yesterday. Does the sport now require quasi-judicial intervention to ensure that excitent is maintained? 'People talk blithely about a Golden Age,' counters Mosley. 'But there were huge disparities in performance in those days. One Mercedes would lap the field, and if there were three Mercedes, they'd all lap you. A podium result remains very, very hard to get.' Without huge financial muscle, all the talent and engineering imagination in the world is just froth in Grand Prix racing. Jordan is now being spoken of as a potential force for 1995. Why? Because it has been adopted by Peugeot, discarded as engine-suppliers by a McLaren happily besotted with mighty Mercedes. 'The really big money is now being spent by the major manufacturers who provide the engines,' says Mosley. Although critics of F1 profligacy invariably take cigarette sponsors as their example, it is now the motor industry that is calling the shots. When Nigel Mansell came back for one race in mid-season it was at the insistence of Renault, at the budgetary heart of the Williams team. Worried by the adulatory coverage Peugeot was receiving, Renault needed a PR coup on the eve of the French Grand Prix. Again, it was Renault which booked Mansell to drive for the last three events of this season. Only a company that big could afford to pay him the Dollars 1.5m he was demanding per appearance. There was also a 'disappointment' clause. If Williams/Renault told Mansell he was 'excused driving' at Jerez, Suzuka or Adelaide, then the driver was to receive an additional Dollars 3m for hurt pride. Grand Prix racing remains an enigma. Much of it is unappealing or just plain boring. When danger delivers the goods, with a fatality, it is revolting. Yet it goes from strength to strength, recovering miraculously from near-mortal wounds. Mosley talks about an innate mysticism. He says: 'No one knows why Formula One is so popular. But it is. So don't let's change it too much.'</p>

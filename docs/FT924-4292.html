			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Industry rejects pay norm proposal THE Confederation of British Industry has rejected suggestions that the private sector should be liable to the 1.5 per cent pay norm the government wants to impose on the public sector. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI, said public-sector pay rose 20 per cent in the past two years while that of the private sector increased only 14 per cent. 'It would not be reasonable to expect the private sector slavishly to follow the public-sector model in the next year,' he said. Mr Davies distanced himself from suggestions by some ministers that public-sector pay restraint might act as an example for the private sector. He warned, however, that the competitive advantage handed to UK exporting companies by the devaluation of sterling would be squandered unless unit labour costs continued to be reduced. Mr Davies told East Midlands business leaders in Nottingham yesterday that pay rates should be determined by the profitability and productivity of individual companies. A 1.5 per cent rise for the one in seven manufacturing companies already in a pay freeze would therefore be inappropriate, he said. Mr Davies said the engineering industry's total pay bill last year increased by 1 per cent, although average earnings rose by 6 per cent with a 5 per cent fall in employment. 'To return to a system of pay norms in the private sector would be a severely retrograde step,' Mr Davies said.</p>

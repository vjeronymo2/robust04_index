			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EX-ROMANIAN SECRET POLICE ON TRIAL;  </P> <P> EAST BLOC: THEY ARE AMONG THE 21 DEFENDANTS ACCUSED OF STEALING AND BURNING  CORPSES OF 40 PROTESTERS.  </P> <P> The trial of 21 former secret police and others opened today with the  prosecution charging that, to cover up their crime, they stole and burned the  corpses of 40 protesters they had killed.  </P> <P> Local residents jeered the 21 defendants in this Transylvanian city, birthplace  of the December revolution that swept dictator Nicolae Ceausescu from power in  December.  </P> <P> Official figures released at the hearing showed 94 people died in Timisoara  during the pro-democracy demonstrations, 300 others were badly wounded and 23  simply disappeared.  </P> <P> The 21 defendants -- former Securitate officers, senior police officials and  two Bucharest cemetery supervisors -- were led into the dock wearing  beige-and-brown striped uniforms, the dress of convicts. Their heads were  shaved.  </P> <P> A small crowd booed and jeered as they pulled up in a police van flanked by  armored cars. The courthouse was ringed by armored personnel carriers and about  100 soldiers.  </P> <P> The most senior Securitate officer on trial is Gen. Emil Macri, head of the  security police's counterintelligence. He was sent from Bucharest to Timisoara  by Ceausescu to quell the pro-democracy demonstrations, military prosecutor  Mihai Radulescu said.  </P> <P> He said Macri's first orders on arriving in Timisoara were effectively to  isolate the city of 320,000 from the rest of the world. All roads around the  city were blocked off, foreigners were barred and all telephone links were cut.  </P> <P> The 21 face charges of complicity in genocide and assisting in genocide, and  all face maximum terms of life imprisonment if found guilty by the three-man  military tribunal.  </P> <P> Reports that thousands of people had been killed by the Securitate in Timisoara  in mid-December spread around the country, triggering the revolution.  </P> <P> The initial figures were grossly exaggerated, but there were gasps in court  today as prosecutors described how the bodies of 40 demonstrators had been  disposed of. The corpses were reportedly stolen, cremated and their ashes  tipped down a drain.  </P> <P> On the night of Dec. 18, Timisoara's deputy chief of the Securitate, Maj. Ioan  Corbodeanu, acting under Macri's orders, went to the district hospital where  the bodies of protesters shot a day earlier were being kept, Radulescu told the  court.  </P> <P> Saying the Securitate was helping the hospital to make more space, Corbodeanu  loaded the bodies into a truck that was driven to Bucharest, 300 miles away.  </P> <P> All electricity in the hospital was switched off during the three-hour  body-snatch.  </P> <P> In Bucharest the bodies were taken to the city's main crematory where four  workers were paid the equivalent of $20 to "forget" what they had seen.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kragujevac, 26 Jun (TANJUG) -- Aleksa Buha, foreign  minister of the republic of Srpska, told Kragujevac radio today  that "a conceptual muddle" regarding the resolution of the  crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina continues. To the correspondent's  remark that the formula is "take it or leave it" and that the  lifting of the arms embargo and a continued implementation of  the sanctions are proposed if the Serbian side does not accept  the formula, Buha said that the international community has been  warned hundreds of times that the conflict could then assume  unforseeable proportions, as Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev has warned.    "I do not believe that the international community will  allow  things to get out of hand and take that course if the plan is  not accepted. It is more likely that pressure will be put on  all sides to reach a compromise, and perhaps a solution will be  found within the new proposal, but with certain corrections. I  believe the whole matter is in U.S. hands," Buha said. He said  everything will become clearer in the next fortnight, after a  series of talks.    "The solution lies in the recognition of the three peoples'  right to self-determination, that is, to having their states and  territorial borders, and after that all sovereign nations would  establish the sort of relations that suit them," Buha said.</p>

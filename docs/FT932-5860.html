			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Clash in Belgrade after Cosic ousted POLITICAL turbulence in Belgrade boiled over into violence yesterday as police fired tear gas at demonstrators trying to storm the federal Yugoslav parliament. The clash follows the ousting of federal President Dobrica Cosic through a no-confidence motion brought by radical Serbian deputies backed by the ruling Serbian Socialists. His departure has raised doubts about political stability in the rump Yugoslavia, which consists just of Serbia and Montenegro. Up to 4,000 demonstrators were brought on to the streets by the head of the opposition Serbian Renewal Movement, Mr Vuk Draskovic. Chanting 'Rise up, Belgrade', they smashed windows in the parliament building and tried to break in. Police wielding truncheons moved into the crowd, who threw stones at them, and police responded with tear gas. Mr Draskovic earlier called on his followers to prepare for combat. His call came after one of his deputies was knocked unconscious with a single punch by a radical Serb deputy outside the chamber, in the fraught aftermath of the vote against the federal president. Mr Cosic was voted out after being accused of holding a secret meeting with Yugoslav federal army leaders on the country's constitutional future. The head of the ultra-nationalist Serb Radical Party, Mr Vojislav Seselj, also claimed Mr Cosic had held secret talks with Croatia over the Serb-held region of Krajina, and was willing to carve up the Serb province of Kosovo - where 90 per cent of people are ethnic Albanians - with neighbouring Albania. Political analysts said that Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the socialist president of Serbia, appeared to have sacrificed Mr Cosic, once a close political ally, in the hope of ensuring his own survival in a no-confidence vote later this month in the Serb parliament. Without the support of hard-line Serb deputies, his minority socialist government, accused of failing to address a disastrous economic situation, could be toppled. Mr Milosevic had recently seemed to distance himself from Mr Seselj, a fierce opponent of the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia, by adopting a more conciliatory position. Although he refused western requests to deploy UN monitors along Serbia's border with Bosnia, Mr Milosevic promised to stop Bosnian Serbs getting fuel and weapons via Serbia. But Serbian petrol tankers still rumble over the bridge at Sremska Raca, the main border crossing with Bosnia. Mr Milosevic is likely to face increased opposition in Montenegro as a result of ousting Mr Cosic. Montenegrin deputies from all parties spoke in favour of Mr Cosic during the debate. The Montenegrin government, already resentful because UN sanctions have damaged its economy more seriously than that of Serbia, is taking a more independent stand. Montenegro has said it is willing to accept UN monitors along its border with Bosnia.</p>

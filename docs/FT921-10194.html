			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / FT Law Report: Mareva principles apply to shares STANDARD CHARTERED BANK AND ANOTHER v WALKER AND ANOTHER Chancery Division: Mr Justice Vinelott: December 18 1992 THE COURT has power in an extreme case to restrain a defendant shareholder from wilfully dissipating a company's assets or destroying security given by the company to creditors, by exercising his voting rights in such a way as to lead inevitably to its collapse. Mr Justice Vinelott so held when granting an interlocutory application by Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) and TSB Bank plc, plaintiffs in separate actions against both defendants, Mr George Walker and Birdcage Walk Ltd, shareholders in Brent Walker Ltd, for injunctions restraining them from exercising their voting rights other than in favour of proposals for the reconstruction of Brent Walker. HIS LORDSHIP said that an extraordinary general meeting of Brent Walker was due to take place at 10am the following day. Mr Walker and Birdcage Walk, a Hong Kong company, were beneficial owners of substantial blocks of ordinary and preference shares in Brent Walker. The preference shares carried votes on certain resolutions at the extraordinary general meeting equal to four-fifteenths of the votes on the ordinary shares. The votes capable of being exercised at the extraordinary general meeting in respect of those shares amounted to between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of the votes capable of being cast at the extraordinary general meeting. That percentage might be critical. On the present application, SCB and TSB sought injunctions requiring the defendants to vote in favour of, or restraining them from voting against, resolutions to be proposed at that meeting. The effect of the resolution if passed would be first, to confirm a proposal for reconstructing Brent Walker and its indebtedness; and second, to remove Mr Walker and a colleague, Mr Hemingway, from their offices as non-executive directors. The banks proposed the reconstruction. Brent Walker's liabilities to the banks exceeded its likely realisable assets. They were not willing to go ahead with the reconstruction arrangements unless Mr Walker and Mr Hemingway were removed. In the summer of 1990, 47 banks were owed about Pounds 850m. Brent Walker was not in a position to service the interest without an injection of money or a sale of assets. In September 1990, Pounds 100m worth of bonds were offered to shareholders to provide the necessary funds to enable the company to survive. It became apparent that Brent Walker's problems would not be solved by the bond issue alone and that bank facilities would have to be renegotiated. Mr Walker entered into negotiations. The banks appointed SCB as their agent, and appointed a steering committee of eight banks. In November 1990, a global facilities agreement provided for continuation of current banking facilities, which had increased to more than Pounds 1bn, until midnight December 31 1991. The purpose of that agreement was to enable restructuring arrangements to be negotiated. In the course of the negotiations, in May 1991, the steering committee removed Mr Walker from office as chief executive. He remained a director. The banks were increasingly unwilling that he should remain a director and convened an extraordinary general meeting for July 1991 to consider resolutions for his removal, together with his wife and Mr Hemingway. The articles of association required a 75 per cent majority. Mr Walker issued a writ to restrain SCB, the steering committee and TSB from giving instructions that any shareholding be voted in favour of his removal. An application for an interlocutory injunction in those terms was dismissed by Mr Justice Morritt on July 1. Nonetheless, the resolution failed because the votes fell just short of the 75 per cent majority. An appeal by Mr Walker was dismissed. It was apparently accepted by Mr Justice Morritt and by the Court of Appeal that if Mr Walker remained a director the restructuring proposals would almost certainly founder and the company would come to an end. In the present application the court had further evidence supporting that view. Lord Kindersely, the present chairman of Brent Walker, said in affidavit evidence that it took more than nine months for the restructuring proposals to be put together and approved by the banks. The banks were not prepared to go ahead with the proposals unless 90 per cent of the bondholders agreed to support them. Undertakings by 90 per cent of the bondholders had now been obtained. Lord Kindersley emphasised that the terms of the restructuring proposals must either be approved in their entirety or fail in their entirety at the extraordinary general meeting on December 19. He referred to a letter to shareholders and bondholders of December 3, in which he stated that if the restructuring plan did not become effective Brent Walker would run out of funds and collapse would be inevitable; and that if it collapsed there would be no prospect of any payment to bondholders, convertible preference shareholders or ordinary shareholders. That was supported by SCB's affidavit, where it was also said that if the restructuring proposals were not approved, Brent Walker would run out of money before any other proposals could be prepared, because the enlarged facility was repayable on January 9 1992. The banks believed that if the restructuring arrangements were not approved, Brent Walker's collapse would be inevitable and the shares would be worthless. Mr Burton for the banks submitted that the court had jurisdiction on the principles which underlay its power to grant Mareva relief, to grant an injunction restraining a defendant from doing something which would destroy his assets or greatly injure them to the detriment of a creditor, either because he had some ulterior motive for putting pressure on the creditor to agree a claim or because he was simply not rational in his conduct. The jurisdiction was not limited to the case where a defendant sought to remove his assets to a place of safety or embarked on an uncharacteristically extravagant way of living. Mr Oliver accepted that the jurisdiction existed though he submitted rightly that the court should hesitate long before interfering with a defendant's freedom to deal with his own property, unless satisfied that he was acting from some ulterior purpose. It was only in an extreme case that the court would interfere by injunction with the exercise by a shareholder/debtor of the voting right attached to his own shares. However, in the present case the banks had shown that a vote against the restructuring proposals would cross that boundary. There was no reason to doubt Lord Kindersley's judgment that if the vote were not in favour of restructuring, it would be the end of the company and that the shareholders and bondholders would then have no prospect of receiving anything. Opposing or in any way obstructing the reconstruction proposals would be so pointlessly harmful that, whatever motive inspired it, it would amount to the wilful dissipation of assets which the court had jurisdiction, consistently with Mareva principles, to prevent. There was an added feature to the case. Each of the plaintiff banks had a charge on other shares which they were in a position to vote. The security they had over their shares would be destroyed along with any prospect of executing a judgment against shares beneficially-owned by the defendants. Mr Oliver said that the proposition that a creditor with a security over shares should be entitled to prevent a defendant from voting shares over which he had no security, in order to preserve the value of the shares over which he had security, was extravagant. It was not an extravagant proposition. The situation was that the shares over which the security existed could not be preserved except in a way which also preserved the other shares. The aim was to ensure that the debtor did not act in a way which was destructive of the security he had given to the creditor. However that jurisdiction was described, whether it was waste or brought under some other head, courts of Equity did have power to restrain conduct which would destroy property over which a debtor had given a charge, in appropriate and rare circumstances. Judgment for the banks. For the banks: Michael Burton QC and Robin Dicker (Theodore Goddard). For the defendants: David Oliver QC and Steven Gee (DJ Freeman).</p>

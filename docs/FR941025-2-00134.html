The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments from interested persons on the amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Description and Purpose of the Amendment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OPRA requests an extension of the pilot program that was the subject of an amendment previously filed on May 14, 1992, <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  providing for the dissemination of certain implied volatility quotations in FCO's directly by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (``PHLX'') through selected vendors, rather than through the OPRA network. This pilot has been extended twice, first until September 1, 1993 pursuant to a letter amendment dated March 26, 1993, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  and then until November 1, 1994, pursuant to a letter amendment dated August 12, 1993. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30906 (July 16, 1992), 57 FR 31546. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32154 (April 21, 1993), 58 FR 21481. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32771 (August 19, 1993), 58 FR 44865. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the pilot program is to permit PHLX to accommodate those institutional investors in foreign currency options who desire to receive indications of the current state of the FCO market expressed in implied volatility quotations. These quotations serve only as indications of the state of the market; actual trading in FCO's continues to be conducted through bids and offers expressed in terms of the prices at which options may be bought or sold which continue to be disseminated over the OPRA system. Because the existing specifications of the OPRA system were not designed to accommodate implied volatility quotations, OPRA has consented to PHLX's arranging for the transmission of this information through selected vendors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OPRA plans to extend the pilot once more until January 1, 1996, the date proposed for the unbundling within OPRA of market information services pertaining to FCO's. Prior to that date, a decision will be made concerning the continued availability of implied volatility quotations in FCO's. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

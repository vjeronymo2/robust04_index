Tilman Zuelch, the head of the  society, said today that although Kinkel had been fully aware of  the Croatian human rights violations and war crimes, he had not  made any serious efforts to put pressure of the Croatian  Government.    Zuelch was speaking in connection with a GfbV report  submitted to the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva on  Croatian human rights violations against the civilian population  in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The report accuses Croatian troops in  particular of confining and starving 55,000 Muslim deportees and  displaced persons in the town of Mostar for months, of razing  towns through large-scale bombardment, and of killing hundreds  of civilians.</p>

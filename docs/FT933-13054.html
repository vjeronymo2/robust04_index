			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Philip Morris The noxious smoke which Philip Morris blew over other consumer products companies when it first cut the price of Marlboro cigarettes grew thicker yesterday. Its decision to make the price cuts permanent provoked fresh fears about brand values. The UK market, though, appears to have particular trouble peering through the smog. It knocked the shares of both Unilever and Cadbury-Schweppes, which are in wholly unrelated businesses, while leaving those of tobacco giant, BAT Industries, untouched. This may owe something to Philip Morris's simultaneous decision to raise the price of its discount cigarettes. The market's reaction seems perverse nonetheless.</p>

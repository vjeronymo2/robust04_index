			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi, May 26 (AFP) -- Vietnam denied Thursday that  a leading political dissident was on a hunger strike to protest  harsh prison treatment. The US Human Rights/Asia Watch  organisation said Tuesday that professor Doan Viet Hoat went  began a hunger strike in April after being put in chains at a  reeducation camp in northern Vietnam for refusing forced labour.    A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday that Hoat was not  on hunger strike, had not been forced to work and had not been  treated any differently than other prisoners. But the spokesman  confirmed that Hoat, former vice-rector of the Van Anh Buddhist  University, had been transferred to another prison camp closer  to the Laos border.    "This is a normal transfer under Vietnamese law," he told  AFP. But Asia Watch maintains that the camp, Thanh Cam, is for  hardened criminals.    Hoat, who suffers from serious kidney problems, was being  held in Ba Sao prison camp, south of Hanoi, before his transfer.  Asia Watch expressed concern for his health since he had been  put in chains. It also said Hoat's wife had been refused  permission to see him.    The spokesman said the reports were untrue and maintained  that Hoat was in normal health. Hoat was jailed for 15 years in  July 1993 for activities "violating Vietnam's penal code."    On Tuesday, Hanoi denied reports that four Buddhist monks,  jailed following violent incidents in Hue a year ago, were on  hunger strike at a reeducation camp in the southwest.</p>

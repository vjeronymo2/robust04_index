			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Ukraine wins Gore's support US Vice-President Al Gore yesterday offered American support for launching 'comprehensive economic reform' to stabilise Ukraine's ailing economy. Mr Gore is one of the first foreign leaders to visit Ukraine's new president, Mr Leonid Kuchma, who is just two weeks in office. His emphasis on the economy was a departure from previous high-level US visits, which have focused on dismantling Ukraine's nuclear arsenal, and comes one week after the head of the IMF met the president. Mr Gore said: 'A strong and prosperous and independent Ukraine is a stabilising force for peace in central Europe and throughout the entire region.' The US has offered Ukraine Dollars 700m, making it the fourth largest recipient of American aid. Mr Gore forwarded an invitation from President Bill Clinton to Mr Kuchma to visit Washington on November 29. The Ukrainian leader accepted.</p>

What is the United  States waiting for, why do they allow the destruction of the  Yalta system, others wondered, marveling at messages totally  different from what they hoped for, primarily from Baker,  Zimmermann, Eagleberger, and other officials of the Bush  administration. A third group thought that the United States  only needed time to wake up and that it would intervene in favor  of the just cause sooner or later.    Much water has passed under the bridge since then, as it was  three years ago, but those who claimed the United States needed  time to realize, or better yet, find its interest in the matter  seem to have been right. Our country did not get help from the  6th Fleet, but something else -- with far-reaching consequences  for Croatia -- has begun to happen, both regarding the  involvement of the United States in solving the Balkan crisis,  understanding the real situation, and making moves that could  produce results.    Mr. Charles Redman, President Clinton's special envoy, who  has visited Zagreb twice in the last week, has made it clear  that the Clinton administration is very seriously involved in  trying to find the solution for reaching an agreement on  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and has pointed out that "the present  involvement could lay the foundations for the future of both  Bosnia and Croatia, a future in which the two countries would be  closely connected with the mainstream of Europe."    What is Redman trying to say? What does the United States  want from Croatia and what is it offering in return, pointing  out that Croatia could play a pivotal role in helping (the  United States) to reach a peaceful solution in Bosnia? First of  all, they want Croatia to cooperate and attempt to find a  peaceful solution, and they want the Bosnian Croats to do the  same, in addition to being prepared to make compromises.    The United States is simply insisting on the immediate  cessation of hostilities between the Croats and the Muslims in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and on a new alliance of the two former  allies, currently bitter enemies; they want a clear situation so  as to be able to put more pressure on the Serbs. What are they  trying to accomplish by that? Their primary concern is to give  a positive reply to the pressure coming from the Islamic  countries, which want the United States to protect the Bosnian  Muslims. Moreover, by insisting on connecting the Croatian and  Muslim parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina and resting that against the  Republic of Croatia, they want to enable that state creation to  survive and have firm ties with Europe. Therefore, Redman  promised Croatia, and also a Bosnia-Herzegovina connected to  Croatia, integration with the West, the European Union, and the  United States.    The Frankfurt rapprochement of Granic's and Silajdzic's  negotiating positions is an important indicator of the success  and efficiency of the new U.S. approach. And so is the  unilateral cease-fire of the Croatian Defense Council, and the  clear promise of the West to protect besieged Croatian areas.    The world wants to use the favorable climate created by the  NATO ultimatum and the withdrawal of the Serbs -- and the United  States has now taken the leading role -- to begin the process of  normalization on the territory of former Yugoslavia. If the  Muslims relinquish their maximalist goals, they will be offered  survival and a state fit for existence; the Bosnian Croats are  being offered and guaranteed equality in Bosnia-Herzegovina as  well as safety in the currently besieged enclaves, and Croatia,  apart from having the silent economic embargo lifted, is offered  inclusion in European and other international integration  processes. Furthermore, the United States has made it clear to  Croatia that, in addition to solving the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, it will take determined action to establish  full sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia within its  internationally recognized borders.    Post-ultimatum peace initiatives should be taken as  seriously  as the Serbs are serious in their response to the ultimatum;  especially if those initiatives are taken and backed by the  United States, which is also pointing out that it is acting in  full concordance with the European Union. This initiative --  realistically speaking -- could finally bring peace to  southeastern Europe, even without the direct involvement of the  6th Fleet, although one must never forget that it is close at  hand.</p>

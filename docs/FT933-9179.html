			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / GEC 'had agreed to buy' Swan Hunter GEC HAD agreed to buy Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, before it went into receivership in May. But the draft agreement signed between the two companies lapsed when Swans failed to win a contract to build a helicopter carrier for the Royal Navy, Price Waterhouse, Swans' receiver, said yesterday. The contract went instead to VSEL of Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. After a fruitless 24-hour search for another backer, Swan Hunter called in the receiver. Since then 19 interested parties have contacted Price Waterhouse, which wants to sell Swan Hunter as a going concern. It said talks were continuing but details were commercially sensitive. In its first report to creditors, Price Waterhouse also confirmed that unsecured creditors of the company were 'unlikely' to salvage anything from its crash. A creditors' meeting in Newcastle upon Tyne heard that the company had debts of more than Pounds 40m. Its assets had a book value of Pounds 39.2m, but a sale would realise only Pounds 6.3m, said the receiver. Some Pounds 27.7m is owed to secured creditors - Pounds 12.2m in loans from Lloyds Bank and Pounds 15.5m owed to the General Surety and Guarantee Company. The Pounds 15.5m is the face value of bonds provided to the Ministry of Defence to ensure the completion of three Type 23 frigates. The receiver said Pounds 5.2m owed to preferential creditors in tax and national insurance, holiday pay, wages and pension contributions would be paid. Swan Hunter's management accounts showed a Pounds 1.6m profit in the first six months of the year, reversing two years of losses totalling Pounds 26m. The shipyard's financial problems had been cited by Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, as contributing to the company's failure to put forward a low enough bid for the contract. At the time Swan Hunter went into receivership, 90 per cent of its business was with the Ministry of Defence for the construction of the three Type 23 frigates. VSEL has said it wants to take over these contracts and finish the work on Tyneside. The receiver indicated this would not satisfy the desire to sell Swans as a going concern.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Barlo launches conditional IPounds 22m offer for IRG BARLO GROUP, the Irish-based radiator manufacturer, yesterday announced an IPounds 21.7m (Pounds 19.7m) bid for IRG, a plastic packaging business with manufacturing plants in the Irish Republic, the UK and Belgium. At current prices, the share-exchange terms of 55 Barlo shares for every 20 IRG ordinary value the latter at 143p, a premium of 6 per cent on the last dealt price and of 50 per cent on the price at April 9, the day prior to Barlo acquiring 14.89 per cent of IRG. About 35.8m Barlo shares would be issued, representing 32 per cent of the enlarged capital. Barlo said its offer was conditional on irrevocable commitments being made on a further 15 per cent of IRG shares by 5pm today, which would bring its stake to 29.9 per cent. The bid is also conditional on the IRG accounts for 1991 showing pre-tax profits 'not less than IPounds 1.8m and total borrowings not exceeding IPounds 15m'. IRG has yet to announce those results, but local analysts expect profits of IPounds 2.2m and earnings per share of 12.5p. Barlo proposes to raise Pounds 10m through a placing on the offer being declared unconditional in all respects; an open offer will made to shareholders. This is expected to reduce the estimated IPounds 15m debt of IRG. Earlier this month Barlo reported a return to profits for the year to March 31 1992, following two years of losses, and despite a continuing recession in the UK construction industry. This has been largely attributed to the rationalisation carried out by the new management team put together under Mr Tony Mullins, managing director since September 1990. It is this expertise which Barlo hopes to apply to its target should the bid be successful.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] La Paz, 25 December (LOS TIEMPOS)--Minister of  Government German Quiroga has stated that the performance of his  ministry during the period up to 31 December has been positive.  He pointed out that this office, which in the past was marked by  its essentially repressive role, has been turned into an  instrument through which cooperation is sought and promoted and  which plays an important role in reaching viable solutions for  the social conflicts which arise in the country.    He indicated that in political terms Bolivia has made  progress of great significance, which has been recognized by the  international community as a whole. He stated that the  development of the political and democratic process in the  country during the past 10 years has definitively left behind it  the ups and downs of the military coups d'etat which  characterized Bolivia in the past.    In the social field he emphasized that the Ministry of the  Interior, initially, and the Ministry of Government, more  recently, played a preponderant role in the solution of a series  of social conflicts which came up in the country. This was done  through negotiations and agreements reached with the Bolivian  Labor Federation, as well as with organizations representing  peasant farmers, particularly those which represented the  producers of coca leaves.    At the same time he said that effective results have been  achieved in the difficult and continuing struggle being carried  out against narcotics trafficking. He indicated that the most  important achievements in this regard included breaking up gangs  of drug traffickers. He mentioned the cases of Wilson Ferrufino,  who had resources of more than $4.0 million in Cochabamba, and  later on that of "Nando" Gutierrez, whose property in Santa Cruz  was evaluated as being worth more than $3.0 million. Their  principal subordinates are under arrest and face trial. In the  institutional sense he pointed out that the Ministry of  Government is involved in the changes taking place on the basis  of the restructuring approved by the executive branch. These  changes are fundamentally directed toward the reorganization of  the judicial system, in accordance with the objectives set forth  in the political agreements signed on 9 July 1992 during the  previous administration.  <H5>  The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly </H5>   In the evaluation made by Minister Quiroga of his actions in  the Ministry of Government since 6 August 1993 he underlined the  following, significant aspects:    The good was that he has undertaken an important process of  institutional change in the Bolivian Police to turn it into a  highly effective organization able to inspire confidence and to  provide security in society as a whole.    The bad was that he was not able to set out in concrete form  the objectives proposed for 1993, particularly regarding the  order issued by the Supreme Court of Justice for the capture of  criminals against whom sentences have already been handed down.  This is the situation regarding Luis Garcia Meza, the former  dictator who continues to be a fugitive from justice.    The ugly was that he has personally become involved in "the  worst job" in the cabinet, holding a ministerial portfolio which  is a "shock absorber" for all of the conflicts which come up in  this country and is almost always the first to receive bad news.</p>

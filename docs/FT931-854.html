			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities fail to hold on to early gains POST-BUDGET confidence was beginning to wear thin on the UK securities markets yesterday as government bonds faced a further sell-off while equities found the FT-SE 2,950 mark under increasing pressure. An early mark-up in share prices reflected optimistic comments on British manufacturing output from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and took the FT-SE Index to 2,873.7. However, there was little support at these levels and by the close many shares had returned to overnight quotations. The final reading for the two week equity trading account left the FT-SE Index at 2,852.9, just 0.1 up on the day, with the London market showing little sense of direction in late dealings when Wall Street was a shade off as it opened its new trading session. The Footsie 2,850 mark is significant as chart analysts see little further support above 2,800. Mr Ian Harnett of Strauss Turnbull yesterday said again that, without a rate cut, the index would head for 2,800 following the Budget. Prospects for a cut in base rates appeared to remain elusive yesterday as, despite firmness in sterling, government bonds were sold off. Longer dates closed around  11/32 off, but losses among Index-linked gilts were smaller. Inflation concern in gilts was fuelled by the CBI's prediction that manufacturing output will rise over the next quarter. Bonds are also overshadowed by the prospective weight of government funding. Over the two week Budget account which closed last night, the Footsie has lost about 2.2 per cent, with most of the loss recorded this week as the Budget implications for Advance Corporation Tax and for dividends on overseas earnings have unsettled share prices. Also discouraging have been trading statements from such blue chips as Wellcome and Redland, both of which raised worries in the stock market over the near-term outlook. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index also ran into further selling pressure yesterday, closing 14.6 down at 3,099, now around 1.7 per cent below the peak reached just after Budget Day. Some strategists expressed concern at present valuations of the stock market, where the FT-SE 100 shares are now trading around 20 times earnings. Retail issues weakened yesterday as investors looked for more convincing signs of the recovery in consumer spending which is still seen as the only genuine precursor of economic recovery. Market indices were dragged down by renewed pressure on some drug stocks in the wake of Wellcome's trading statement.</p>

A final decision on this will be made by the Rukh National  Convention scheduled for 16 April.    The incumbent President Leonid Kravchuk said originally that  he would not run for presidency because he disagreed with the  timing of the elections. He said that if a new parliament was  not elected within the month while the president was engaged in  an electoral campaign the country might find itself "without  authorities."    Another possible candidate, former prime minister Leonid  Kuchma, intends to announce his decision later.    Kravchuk won over 60 percent of the votes and Chornovil,  nearly 28 percent in Ukraine's first presidential elections in  December 1991. Kuchma did not run then.</p>

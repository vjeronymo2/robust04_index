			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THESE 'HIGHWAYS' ARE WIDE, UNDERUSED;  </P> <P> COMMUNICATIONS:VAST ELECTRONIC NETWORKS ARE IN PLACE AND WORKING. BUT  DATA-HANDLING TECHNIQUES LAG.  </P> <P> Ignore the creaking of America's Rust Belt, the thud of her frost-bitten  Florida oranges, the din of stalled freeway traffic. Don't despair over our  crumbling infrastructure.  </P> <P> There is a hidden infrastructure that is building steadily: our public and  private telephone networks.  </P> <P> The giant AT&amp;T is a vast, growing resource ready to add to our nation's  wealth. And its smaller rivals, mainly MCI and US Sprint, have developed  electronic long-distance communications routes that parallel AT&amp;T's  "highways" in much of the country.  </P> <P> When AT&amp;T went on the fritz one day last month, calls could have been  handled by the other carriers if a transfer mechanism had been in place.  </P> <P> It has been estimated that today's long-distance line capacity is four times  that of eight years ago. Another way to view this hidden infrastructure:  AT&amp;T, with about 70% of interstate long-distance revenues, controls only  about 40% of the nation's long-distance capacity.  </P> <P> Unlike companies that simply buy circuits in bulk from AT&amp;T and resell them  MCI, Sprint and others are building their own facilities. They are creating 16-  and 32-lane communications "highways" where only four existed before.  </P> <P> Thousands of miles of private networks are also being created, such as those  owned by Boeing and Westinghouse. And there are networks that duplicate those  of local phone companies. These networks expedite data from private firms or  access long-distance companies cheaply.  </P> <P> In short, we have the capacity to transmit communications many times over what  we use. This huge, under-utilized system can carry voice, data and fax  transmissions -- in fact, anything but regular television pictures -- from  anywhere to anywhere. Most important, it may provide a workable fuse to ignite  the much anticipated information revolution in computing and communications.  </P> <P> The gunpowder has been in place for awhile. That is, of course, the computer  power behind information processing. Take microchips. Today the most  sophisticated chips have 2 million electronic components. By the year 2000,  they're expected to have 1 billion, 500 times the power at the same cost.  </P> <P> But the communications end of the process -- moving data around quickly -- is  the holdup. Like a donkey transporting uranium, communications developments  have not kept pace with computing.  </P> <P> As consumers, we experience this when we have to wait longer than we care to  for bank-card machines to respond. The computation takes only a fraction of the  time spent on the transaction. The time thief is the messenger, not the  message.  </P> <P> Multiply the small delays by the billions of information transactions made  daily, and it's even more evident that we need to have communications networks  move faster. That is the policy challenge of our communications network: Can  our under-used capacity bring the transmission end of information processing up  to our ever-accelerating computing capacity?  </P> <P> At the very least, the networks, which are now under-used, should be encouraged  to carry more traffic. How? Lower long-distance rates will encourage more  long-distance calling. This is already being done to some degree. Since 1987,  AT&amp;T's rates have declined nearly 30%, and MCI and Sprint have kept pace.  Americans are making more toll calls than ever because of lower rates.  </P> <P> We need to look at communications as an alternative to transportation. For  example, an upsurge in the use of computer modems, which allow computers to  talk to each other over phone lines, could reduce the need to transport  documents.  </P> <P> Even the ubiquitous fax machine can be replaced with data signals from a  computer. Need a hard copy? Send the data, in seconds, then print it out on  your machine instead of tying up the phone line with a fax transmission.  </P> <P> We can encourage "telecommuting," in which employees work at home using a  computer connected to the office. There is a turn-of-the-century irony in  seeing a worker stalled in rush-hour traffic while unused cable that could make  the trip unnecessary sits under clogged roads.  </P> <P> Finally, and most difficult, we must find a way to make our under-used national  communications resource and our computer power work together.  </P> <P> Perhaps harvesting all the benefits of our communications infrastructure is too  big a job. Like desalinizing ocean water, it's a good idea that may prove too  difficult to realize. But unlike sea water, man created communications  networks. We ought to be able to find a way to direct them to their most  productive ends.  </P></p>

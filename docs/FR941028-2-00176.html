			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull; Cough-inducing procedures should not be performed on patients who may have infectious TB unless the procedures are absolutely necessary and can be performed with appropriate precautions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;All cough-inducing procedures performed on patients who may have infectious TB should be performed using local exhaust ventilation devices (e.g., booths or special enclosures) or, if this is not feasible, in a room that meets the ventilation requirements for TB isolation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;HCWs should wear respiratory protection when present in rooms or enclosures in which cough-inducing procedures are being performed on patients who may have infectious TB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;After completion of cough-inducing procedures, patients who may have infectious TB should remain in their isolation rooms or enclosures and not return to common waiting areas until coughing subsides. They should be given tissues and instructed to cover their mouths and noses with the tissues when coughing. If TB patients must recover from sedatives or anesthesia after a procedure (e.g, after a bronchoscopy), they should be placed in separate isolation rooms (and not in recovery rooms with other patients) while they are being monitored.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Before the booth, enclosure, or room is used for another patient, enough time should be allowed to pass for at least 99% of airborne contaminants to be removed. This time will vary according to the efficiency of the ventilation or filtration used (Suppl. 3, Table S3&hyph;1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Special Considerations for Bronchoscopy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;If performing bronchoscopy in positive-pressure rooms (e.g., operating rooms) is unavoidable, TB should be ruled out as a diagnosis before the procedure is performed. If the bronchoscopy is being performed for the purpose of diagnosing pulmonary disease and that diagnosis could include TB, the procedure should be performed in a room that meets TB isolation ventilation requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Special Considerations for the Administration of Aerosolized Pentamidine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Patients should be screened for active TB before prophylactic therapy with aerosolized pentamidine is initiated. Screening should include obtaining a medical history and performing skin testing and chest radiography.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Before each subsequent treatment with aerosolized pentamidine, patients should be screened for symptoms suggestive of TB (e.g., development of a productive cough). If such symptoms are elicited, a diagnostic evaluation for TB should be initiated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Patients who have suspected or confirmed active TB should take, if clinically practical, oral prophylaxis for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> P. carinii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  pneumonia.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> I. Education and Training of HCWs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All HCWs, including physicians, should receive education regarding TB that is relevant to persons in their particular occupational group. Ideally, training should be conducted before initial assignment, and the need for additional training should be reevaluated periodically (e.g., once a year). The level and detail of this education will vary according to the HCW's work responsibilities and the level of risk in the facility (or area of the facility) in which the HCW works. However, the program may include the following elements:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The basic concepts of <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  transmission, pathogenesis, and diagnosis, including information concerning the difference between latent TB infection and active TB disease, the signs and symptoms of TB, and the possibility of reinfection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The potential for occupational exposure to persons who have infectious TB in the health-care facility, including information concerning the prevalence of TB in the community and facility, the ability of the facility to properly isolate patients who have active TB, and situations with increased risk for exposure to <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  M. tuberculosis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The principles and practices of infection control that reduce the risk for transmission of M. tuberculosis, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  including information concerning the hierarchy of TB infection-control measures and the written policies and procedures of the facility. Site-specific control measures should be provided to HCWs working in areas that require control measures in addition to those of the basic TB infection-control program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The purpose of PPD skin testing, the significance of a positive PPD test result, and the importance of participating in the skin-test program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The principles of preventive therapy for latent TB infection. These principles include the indications, use, effectiveness, and the potential adverse effects of the drugs (Suppl. 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The HCW's responsibility to seek prompt medical evaluation if a PPD test conversion occurs or if symptoms develop that could be caused by TB. Medical evaluation will enable HCWs who have TB to receive appropriate therapy and will help to prevent transmission of <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to patients and other HCWs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The principles of drug therapy for active TB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The importance of notifying the facility if the HCW is diagnosed with active TB so that contact investigation procedures can be initiated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The responsibilities of the facility to maintain the confidentiality of the HCW while ensuring that the HCW who has TB receives appropriate therapy and is noninfectious before returning to duty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The higher risks associated with TB infection in persons who have HIV infection or other causes of severely impaired cell-mediated immunity, including (a) the more frequent and rapid development of clinical TB after infection with <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  M. tuberculosis, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (b) the differences in the clinical presentation of disease, and (c) the high mortality rate associated with MDR&hyph;TB in such persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The potential development of cutaneous anergy as immune function (as measured by CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts) declines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Information regarding the efficacy and safety of BCG vaccination and the principles of PPD screening among BCG recipients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The facility's policy on voluntary work reassignment options for immunocompromised HCWs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> J. HCW Counseling, Screening, and Evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A TB counseling, screening, and prevention program for HCWs should be established to protect both HCWs and patients. HCWs who have positive PPD test results, PPD test conversions, or symptoms suggestive of TB should be identified, evaluated to rule out a diagnosis of active TB, and started on therapy or preventive therapy if indicated ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). In addition, the results of the HCW PPD screening program will contribute to evaluation of the effectiveness of current infection-control practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Counseling HCWs Regarding TB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Because of the increased risk for rapid progression from latent TB infection to active TB in HIV-infected or otherwise severely immunocompromised persons, all HCWs should know if they have a medical condition or are receiving a medical treatment that may lead to severely impaired cell-mediated immunity. HCWs who may be at risk for HIV infection should know their HIV status (i.e., they should be encouraged to voluntarily seek counseling and testing for HIV antibody status). Existing guidelines for counseling and testing should be followed routinely ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 56 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Knowledge of these conditions allows the HCW to seek the appropriate preventive measures outlined in this document and to consider voluntary work reassignments. Of particular importance is that HCWs need to know their HIV status if they are at risk for HIV infection and they work in settings where patients who have drug-resistant TB may be encountered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;All HCWs should be informed about the need to follow existing recommendations for infection control to minimize the risk for exposure to infectious agents; implementation of these recommendations will greatly reduce the risk for occupational infections among HCWs ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 57 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). All HCWs should also be informed about the potential risks to severely immunocompromised persons associated with caring for patients who have some infectious diseases, including TB. It should be emphasized that limiting exposure to TB patients is the most protective measure that severely immunosuppressed HCWs can take to avoid becoming infected with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . HCWs who have severely impaired cell-mediated immunity and who may be exposed to <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  may consider a change in job setting to avoid such exposure. HCWs should be advised of the option that severely immunocompromised HCWs can choose to transfer voluntarily to areas and work activities in which there is the lowest possible risk for exposure to <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This choice should be a personal decision for HCWs after they have been informed of the risks to their health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Employers should make reasonable accommodations (e.g., alternative job assignments) for employees who have a health condition that compromises cell-mediated immunity and who work in settings where they may be exposed to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . HCWs who are known to be immunocompromised should be referred to employee health professionals who can individually counsel the employees regarding their risk for TB. Upon the request of the immunocompromised HCW, employers should offer, but not compel, a work setting in which the HCW would have the lowest possible risk for occupational exposure to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Evaluation of these situations should also include consideration of the provisions of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990* and other applicable federal, state, and local laws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> *Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990. P.L. 101&hyph;336, 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;All HCWs should be informed that immunosuppressed HCWs should have appropriate follow-up and screening for infectious diseases, including TB, provided by their medical practitioner. HCWs who are known to be HIV-infected or otherwise severely immunosuppressed should be tested for cutaneous anergy at the time of PPD testing (Suppl. 2). Consideration should be given to retesting, at least every 6 months, those immunocompromised HCWs who are potentially exposed to <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  because of the high risk for rapid progression to active TB if they become infected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Information provided by HCWs regarding their immune status should be treated confidentially. If the HCW requests voluntary job reassignment, the confidentiality of the HCW should be maintained. Facilities should have written procedures on confidential handling of such information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Screening HCWs for Active TB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Any HCW who has a persistent cough (i.e., a cough lasting "3 weeks), especially in the presence of other signs or symptoms compatible with active TB (e.g., weight loss, night sweats, bloody sputum, anorexia, or fever), should be evaluated promptly for TB. The HCW should not return to the workplace until a diagnosis of TB has been excluded or until the HCW is on therapy and a determination has been made that the HCW is noninfectious.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Screening HCWs for Latent TB Infection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;The risk assessment should identify which HCWs have potential for exposure to <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and the frequency with which the exposure may occur. This information is used to determine which HCWs to include in the skin-testing program and the frequency with which they should be tested (Table 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

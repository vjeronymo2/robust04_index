			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Sergey Babkin </F> and Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow 4 April, TASS -- Visiting U.N. Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali highly appreciated the level of  interaction between the Russian diplomacy and the world body in  solving problems of maintaining peace in the territory of the  former Soviet Union and peacekeeping operations in other areas  of the world. Ghali was addressing a press conference in the  Russian Foreign Ministry press centre today after his meetings  with Russian officials.    According to the secretary general, Russia is one of the  founders of the U.N.O., a permanent member of the U.N. Security  Council and a super power. That is why the U.N. is interested  in that Russia should play an important role in international  affairs. Ghali assured that the U.N. will provide maximum  possible help to Russia to overcome temporary transitional  difficulties. He expressed the hope that this transitional  period will be quite short.    The U.N. secretary general recalled that the international  organisation is going to celebrate its 50th anniversary next  year. In this context he spoke about intentions of the U.N. to  organise three international conferences. A summit meeting on  questions of social development will be held in Copenhagen in  March 1995, a conference on problems of population and family  planning will be organised in Cairo in September, and finally,  the third international conference on problems of women will be  held in Beijing, he said. Butrus-Ghali said that he had  received support from the Russian leadership in organising U.N.  golden jubilee celebrations.</p>

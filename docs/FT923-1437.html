			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Prospects of Labour Europe clash recede THE PROSPECT of a clash within the Labour leadership over European policy appeared to be receding last night on the eve of a crucial debate on a new document aimed at outlining the way ahead after the UK's abandonment of the exchange rate mechanism. Speculation had been mounting that Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow heritage secretary, might quit the shadow cabinet in protest at the paper that seeks to reaffirm Labour's claims to be 'the party of Europe'. Mr Gould's aides indicated last night that they believed he would have little difficulty in accepting the terms of the paper that lays out broad principles for British membership of the ERM, while arguing for flexibility within the system. The paper, drawn up by Mr John Smith, the party leader, in consultation with Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, aims to position Labour as still firmly behind the Maastricht treaty. It also rules out Labour support for a referendum, widely backed by Euro-sceptics within the opposition party. The document, to be submitted for endorsement to the national executive before proceeding to the shadow cabinet tonight, appears to offer few hostages to fortune on when Labour would seek the UK's readmission to the ERM. Accepting the de facto devaluation of the pound, it instead argues for a return to a flexible ERM in which periodic realignments are customary. Its main aim is to castigate the government for presiding over circumstances where the pound was unable to resist the wave of speculation in the foreign exchange markets that forced sterling's withdrawal from the ERM last week. Close allies of Mr Smith have grown increasingly angry over recent days with what has been seen as maverick behaviour by Mr Gould. In a number of interviews the shadow heritage secretary has claimed that the Maastricht treaty was as good as dead and appeared to urge a British plebiscite on the accord. However, the Labour leader's advisers have also made the case for seeking a compromise acceptable to Mr Gould, who fought Mr Smith for the Labour leadership this summer. They are more than aware that any showdown between Labour's Euro-sceptics and the pro-Maastricht leadership would be damaging on the eve of tomorrow's Commons debate on the economy and next week's annual party conference in Blackpool.</p>

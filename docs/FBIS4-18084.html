			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Three Sentenced in Iraqi Supergun </F> Case"]    [Text] (ANSA) Terni, March 30 -- Three Italians charged  with manufacturing parts for Saddam Husayn's planned Supergun  today received suspended sentences in this Umbrian city, home to  the Societa' delle Fucine company which made 75 [metric] tonnes  of components for the Iraqi dictator's Babylon Project. The  trial of another four defendants, two Britons and two Iraqis, is  scheduled for November 8.    One of the two British engineers, Christopher Cowley, 55,  has  testified to the Italian parliament's commerce and industry  committee that he designed the cannon according to  specifications provided by Canadian ballistics expert Gerald  Bull, killed in mysterious circumstances in Brussels on March  22, 1990. Cowley says Bull was murdered by the Israeli secret  service, Mossad.    The other Briton to be tried on November 8 is John Heath,  58.  Both worked for Ati, a Belgian company that allegedly  sub-contracted parts of the project to firms around Europe.    One of the three Italians sentenced today is an engineer  from  the northern city of Brescia, Aldo Savegnago, 71, appointed by  Ati to monitor Societa' delle Fucine's execution of its part of  the work. The other two are the company's attorneys Paolo  Castellazzi, 51, from Milan, and Umberto Varazi, 51, from Terni,  who allegedly negotiated the sub-contract with Iraqi officials.    All three received sentences of less than two years in  prison  (with Savegnano also fined 800,000 lire, or 485 dollars) after  plea-bargaining on charges of "aiding and abetting the  construction of unlicensed weapons of war."    The two Iraqis are Al Mishedani Shakir, 39, and A.K. Azzawi  [names as received], Iraqi industry ministry officials on  secondment to the Iraqi embassy in Rome to draw up the contract  and follow its execution. Italian authorities have been unable  to trace them.    The seven defendants were indicted last July after months of  investigations in Spain, Greece, Belgium, Britain and  Switzerland.    The case broke in May 1990 when Carabinieri police seized  the  75 tonnes of parts in the port of Naples just before they were  shipped to Iraq. The Iraqi government maintained they were to  be used for an oil pipeline, but Italian investigators pointed  to a match with similar cannon parts, posing as heavy machinery  or tubes, seized elsewhere in Europe including Britain.    Before the trial, Societa' delle Fucine had consistently  maintained that it acted in good faith, saying it had "no idea"  that the parts could be used to make a huge-caliber long-range  cannon.</p>

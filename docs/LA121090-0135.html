			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'ROOKIE' GETS LESSON FROM PAIR OF PUNKS;  </P> <P> BOX OFFICE: 'HOME ALONE' WHIPS COMPETITION WITH $14.6-MILLION WEEK. 'EDWARD  SCISSORHANDS' TAKES IN A NICE CUT WITH LIMITED RELEASE.  </P> <P> Clint Eastwood's latest action film took a beating -- yes, from an 8-year-old  boy left home alone during the holidays -- during a box office weekend that  also saw a special lad named "Edward Scissorhands" put in a strong performance  in limited release.  </P> <P> "The Rookie," directed by and starring Eastwood and co-starring Charlie Sheen  as his young, upstart partner, had ticket sales of about $5.5 million on 1,862  screens, for a weak per-screen average of $2,953. The Warner Bros. film, which  ranked third among weekend titles, is Eastwood's second disappointment of the  year, following his critically admired box office dud, "White Hunter, Black  Heart."  </P> <P> Released on just two screens, 20th Century Fox's "Edward Scissorhands,"  directed by Tim Burton ("Beetlejuice," "Batman") and starring Johnny Depp as an  unusual young man with scissors for hands, had ticket sales of about $159,000  -- for a startling $79,500 per-screen.  </P> <P> Also startling was the fourth-week performance of Fox's "Home Alone," which  again claimed the No. 1 spot -- jumping 2% over the previous week's earnings --  with receipts of about $14.6 million on 1,342 screens for a per-screen average  of $10,879.  </P> <P> In second place, down 29% from its opening weekend, was Columbia Pictures'  "Misery." Directed by Rob Reiner from Stephen King's novel about an imprisoned  writer, the film earned about $7.1 million on 1,299 screens for a per-screen  average of $5,465.  </P> <P> Orion Pictures' "Dances With Wolves" was ranked fourth, with receipts of about  $5.3 million on 1,054 screens, an average of $5,028. Touchstone Pictures'  "Three Men and a Little Lady" -- after just three weeks in release -- spiraled  to fifth place with ticket sales of about $4.6 million on 1,282 screens, an  average of $3,588.  </P> <P> In other box office news, Paramount Pictures' "Ghost" earned another $1.34  million for ninth place. With grosses of $199.94 million, the film is expected  to materialize into the $200-million zone tonight.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the action sequels "Predator II" and "Rocky V" continued their  plummets. From Fox, the sixth-place "Predator II" dropped another 51% over the  previous week, with receipts of about $2 million. And MGM/UA's "Rocky V"  slipped another 43%, with ticket sales of approximately $1.9 million, to  seventh place.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA believes that first aid training for only a select  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> few individuals, such as supervisors and fellers, is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate to ensure that injured loggers receive first aid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is timely and appropriate. First, when only a few  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selected employees are trained, they may not be close enough  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the site of the accident to render assistance in time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The WIR survey indicates that more than one-half of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injuries reported occurred at cutting sites, that in most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases are remote from landings and from medical facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The WIR survey is consistent with the OSHA FCI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> study, that indicated that more than 70 percent of logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees killed were working at cutting sites (Ex. 4&hyph;61).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One hearing participant reinforced this problem:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The rigging crew is often 1,000 feet and sometimes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5,000 feet from the landing. The work site is usually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on rough, steep ground, and these workers often use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous cutting implements such as axes and chain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> saws. If the first aid trained person and the first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aid kit are in the yarder, that can be 15 minutes or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more from where the worst exposure is (Tr. OR 21).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, since the final rule allows employees to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintain contact with another employee by visual or audible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contact, an employee may be miles from the contact person  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when radio communication is used. In such cases, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contact person may not be able to provide immediate first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aid assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Second, limiting first aid training to all supervisors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and some additional personnel may not be adequate when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supervisors are not at the work site when an accident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurs. According to the State of Washington, logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supervisors usually have two or more logging crews working  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly for them (Ex. 5&hyph;34). These logging crews are often  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dispersed over five square miles or more. In addition, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> larger operations, foremen usually see each crew only once a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day and rarely for more than one hour of the workshift.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenters said in his experience it was not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncommon to find a group of employees working in a location  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without a supervisor and no other employee in the group has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a current first aid certificate (Ex. 91&hyph;5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, a logger's injuries may be of such severity that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several persons trained in first aid may be needed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stabilize the injured employee and treat the injury. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only one employee is trained, the first aid assistance may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be sufficient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourth, when only one employee in a work site is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trained, as the proposed rule contemplates, first aid will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obviously be inadequate if the trained person is the one who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is injured. (Although first-aid training does include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instruction in self-aid, the injuries may be severe enough  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to incapacitate the trained employee.) For example, in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small working crew that has no supervisor, the feller may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the only employee who is trained in first-aid. If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feller is injured, there may be no other logger in that work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crew who is trained to provide first aid. The WIR survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates that one-half of all loggers who were injured were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performing felling tasks (i.e., felling, limbing, bucking)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fifth, when only a few employees receive first-aid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training, there is a greater likelihood that there could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crucial gaps in coverage due to sickness, vacations, other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leave, or employee turnover of those few who have received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training. In addition, an employer may not know from day to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day if an employee will be present that is holding a current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first aid certificate (Ex. 5&hyph;7).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

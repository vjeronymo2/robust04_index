			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Newton Kanhema and Guy Jepson] </F>   [Text] One thousand members of the embattled National  Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] have been fired since its formation in  late January, according to its commander, Major-General Gabriel  Ramushwana. The former Venda military strongman also hinted at  further purges of undisciplined force members after the  spectacular failure of the NPKF in less than a week at the sharp  end on the East Rand. A special investigation team is to probe  allegations of misconduct and indiscipline against members of  the multiparty force since its deployment in Thokoza, Katlehong  and Vosloorus last week.    Wayward members are alleged to have held their commanding  officer hostage for three hours in a de facato mutiny, disobeyed  orders while on patrol, panicked under fire, consumed alcohol  and smoked dagga [marijuana] on duty, and shot at the police.    Among the more startling allegations against the  peacekeeping  force told to WEEKEND STAR by an impeccable NPKF source was that  some Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC armed wing]  (MK) elements had passed on key intelligence on its operations  on the East Rand to ANC-aligned self-defence units (SDUs). "We  would strategise what we ought to be doing and before  implementing the strategy the word would have been passed to the  residents -- especially to the SDUs," said the source. "There  is no trust between the SADF [South African Defense Force] and  the MK soldiers. How can you describe an army which locks its  own commander inside an amoured vehicle. They were sending  messages to the people."    The NPKF, which had been fired on repeatedly by  Inkatha-supporting hostel dwellers in Thokoza and Katlehong  since its deployment, beat a hasty retreat on Wednesday as a  full-scale war erupted between hostel dwellers and the SDUs.  But before they left, at least 20 people had been killed, among  them THE STAR's chief photographer Ken Oosterbroek, who was  allegedly shot on Monday by a panicking NPKF member during a  fierce three-day gunbattle in Thokoza.    The NPKF -- which will continue to perform "non-aggressive"  duties in East Rand townships, such as providing escorts and  protecting key points, schools and polling stations -- was  replaced by the SADF, which had stabilised the area since the  withdrawal of the controversial Internal Stability Unit in  February.    At a joint press conference on Thursday, NPKF and SADF  commanders explained that the two forces would remain under  separate commands but would conduct joint operations. The SADF  is to carry out "aggressive" tasks -- searches, foot and vehicle  patrols and roadblocks -- in the trouble spots. Significantly,  while the NPKF is tasked with "liaising with the community," the  SADF is responsible for the liaison forums -- key dispute  resolution bodies set up in conjunction with community leaders  in February.    In an astonishing turn of events following heavy gunbattles  in Thokoza on Monday and Tuesday, NPKF commander Colonel Quinton  Painter was allegedly held hostage inside an armoured vehicle  for three hours by MK elements within the NPKF. Painter had  reportedly been due to attend a task force meeting which would  include IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] representatives. He was  reportedly freed after threatening to call ANC president Nelson  Mandela. ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] premier  candidate Tokyo Sexwale, who addressed MK force members  privately in their barracks after the incident, subsequently  called for Painter to be dismissed.    Sexwale's discussion with the MK members infuriated SADF  elements in the force and drew strong criticism from  Ramushwanna. "I do not accept any politicians coming into any  of my barracks and addressing soldiers privately. We are an  integrated force and we do not want unnecessary tensions," he  said.    Commenting on the mutiny allegations, Ramushwana said he had  not yet received a report from his officers. "I have heard it  as a rumour and I cannot comment until I receive a report."    Asked what went wrong on the East Rand, Ramushwana said an  incorrect perception had been created when the SDUs used NPKF  armoured vehicles as cover when they attacked the hostels.  "They were shooting at the hostels from under and on the sides  of our vehicles and the IFP people saw us as part of the  attack." However, the general stressed that the IFP had  threatened before the arrival of the force on the East Rand that  it would not be welcome. "They were prepared to create problems  for us."    Ramushwana said any NPKF soldier who acted partially would  be  fired and confirmed that 1,000 soldiers had been dismissed --  many for being absent without leave. It is understood that a  large number of those dismissed were MK members.    The source said several SADF soldiers had their lives  threatened and some had chosen to leave the force.</p>

			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (11): The belt feels the strain - A look at Faridabad, a leading industrial township AUTO PINS India is a medium-sized company in the old part of the new industrial township of Faridabad. It is doing well amid neighbouring giants, such as Escorts and Batas, The company was launched in 1953 shortly after the township, now in the main industrial belt in Haryana, was started to rehabilitate refugees from the partition of Punjab in 1947. Land was cheap and available then. However, it has since all been snapped up by industries anxious to start operations near Delhi, 16km away. Mr Ravindra Singh, finance director of Auto Pins India, says he does not know how much the company's two-acre was bought for but admits: 'It was dirt cheap. Land was available in abundance then.' The township has grown enormously since the early 1950s. It now has a population of more than 700,000, with 9,000 small and large factories spread over its 4,050 acres. The factories employ over 120,000 people but many more find jobs in related occupations as the township has grown in all directions. Like Auto Pins India, which makes leaf springs for truck manufacturers such as Ashok Leyland and Telco, most are doing well despite problems they face in common. Shortage of space to expand is just one of them - the main highway from New Delhi is built up on both sides by large and small factories, all anxious to find a slot near Delhi. Many more are in Faridabad itself which is now a cluster of tall, billowing chimneys. That is why Auto Pins India is unable to expand. Although its two-acre site is sufficient for its present operations - including making anti-roll bars in collaboration with Krupp Bruninghaus of Germany - its management feels that it will have to go elsewhere if the company expands. The company employs 400 workers and with a turnover of Rs115m, it is doing well. There are many others like Auto Pins India and all of them bemoan the shortage of electricity. Faridabad's two thermal generating plants lie almost across the road to Auto Pins India and they lack the capacity to provide power to all of Faridabad's factories. 'We had to install a captive generating set than runs on diesel. It is expensive to run but it has to be switched on whenever we have power cuts,' says Mr Singh. Power cuts are common and nearly all companies in Faridabad have captive generators to allow uninterrupted operations. The local authorities have plans to improve generation but the existing plants are now old and need replacement themselves, so power shortages will remain indefinitely. All complain that Faridabad is losing production, or production costs are high, because of the lack of cheap electricity. There will be no early easing of the shortage although Faridabad is slated to have a gas-based station (at present in the planning stage). Labour problems also sometimes affect work in Auto Pins India, often because outside unions interfere; it has no problems with its own workers' union. Wage demands are the main reason even though Auto Pins India pays an average of Rs1,500 a month, which is good by Indian standards. But outside unions of transport operators are a major headache. The Faridabad-Ballabgarh industrial belt is one of the country's biggest, with a combined turnover of Rs48bn. Large and medium companies producing goods ranging from needles to giant earth movers and smaller companies acting as ancillaries. It provides Haryana with its main industrial centre (the other being the Ambala region). The other major problem is housing. Faridabad was never meant to be its present size. A satellite town for Delhi, to which a large part of its population commutes by bus and train every day, its growth has been haphazard and its present congestion has deprived it of its planned township look. Inevitably, pollution is a problem. Residential sectors across the main highway are now a coveted area while land prices have risen in the past few years owing to lack of space. Despite the Haryana government's industrial policy for Faridabad, the township's residents feel neglected and say that the authorities have failed adequately to cater for its need for amenities. In any case, Faridabad has grown almost as much as it can and further industrialisation will have to be in areas surrounding it.</p>

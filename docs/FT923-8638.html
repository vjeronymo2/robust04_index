			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Letter: Abbey National house sales plan has flawed basis, ignores realities and is likely to fuel inflation (1) Sir, Abbey National's proposal to revive the housing market ('House sales boost urged as prices fall further', August 4) is flawed in terms of cost and of long-term economic prudence. The current housing malaise is caused by deep-rooted problems within the UK economy - exacerbated by excessive borrowings to finance home purchases in the 1980s. It will not be solved by implementing short-term palliatives. The scheme is flawed because: Insisting that home-owners reinvest their tax credit in property is unlikely materially to reduce the level of debt in each household and therefore unlikely to improve confidence and consumer spending; Even if all 375,000 home-owners with 'negative equity' were to use the scheme it is doubtful that it would stimulate the housing market sufficiently to offset the dampening effect caused by record repossessions; It is manifestly unfair that particular individuals, no matter how distressed, should enjoy a free option funded by the taxpayer; The recession may finally persuade the public that home ownership is not a one-way bet and act as a brake preventing the speculation of the 1980s. Hopefully this would persuade individuals to release savings for productive investment; As Lex (August 4) rightly contends, effectively underwriting loans would improve the quality of the lender's assets, but it would also improve the credit-worthiness of those lenders. This would allow these lenders to raise capital more cheaply than they might otherwise deserve to the detriment of other issuers. Surely this government would not wish to be a party to such a distortion in the markets? Philip Bedos, 57 Woodhall Lane, Welwyn Garden City Herts AL7 3TG</p>

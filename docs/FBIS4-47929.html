			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 6 SAPA -- Thabo Mbeki, named as a  first deputy-president by African National Congress President  Nelson Mandela on Friday [6 May], was born in Idutywa, Transkei,  in June, 1942.    His appointment as first deputy-president significantly  increases his chances as ANC crown prince, favoured to succeed  Nelson Mandela as leader. He is also the ANC national chairman.    Both his parents were teachers and activists. His father,  Govan, was a university graduate who was later jailed on Robben  Island for his part in the ANC's campaign against apartheid.    Earlier, Govan was a leading figure in ANC activities in the  Eastern Cape.    Thabo Mbeki joined the ANC Youth League at 14 and quickly  became active in student politics. After his schooling at  Lovedale was interrupted by a strike in 1959, he completed his  studies at home. Thereafter, he moved to Johannesburg where he  came under the guidance of Walter Sisulu and Duma Nokwe.    While studying for his A-levels, he was elected secretary of  the African Students' Association (ASA).    He went on to study economics as a correspondence student  with London University.    The ASA collapsed following the arrest of many of its  members, at a time when political movements were coming under  increasingly severe attack from the state. Mbeki's father was  arrested at Rivonia and sentenced to life imprisonment.    Thabo Mbeki left the country in 1962 under orders from the  ANC. From Tanzania, he moved to Britain where he completed a  Masters Degree in Economics at Sussex University in 1966.  Remaining active in student politics, he played a prominent role  in building the youth and student sections of the ANC in exile.    After his studies, he worked at the London office with the  late Oliver Tambo, who was to become ANC president, and Dr Yusuf  Dadoo before being sent to the Soviet Union in 1970 for military  training.    Later that year, he arrived in Lusaka where he was soon  appointed assistant secretary of the revolutionary council.    In 1975, he was acting ANC representative in Swaziland.    Appointed to the ANC National Executive Committee in 1975,  he  served as ANC representative to Nigeria until 1978, then moved  to Lusaka to become political secretary in the office of Oliver  Tambo, and then director of information.    From this position, he played a major role in turning the  international media against apartheid. His other role in the  '70s was in building the ANC in Swaziland and underground  structures inside South Africa.    During the '80s, Mbeki rose to head the Department of  Information and Publicity and co-ordinated diplomatic campaigns  to involve more white South Africans in anti-apartheid  activities.</p>

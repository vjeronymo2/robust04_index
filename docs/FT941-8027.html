			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / South Wales Police Authority fails to resolve financial crisis The South Wales Police Authority yesterday failed to resolve a financial crisis that threatens to shut as many as 60 police stations. After a heated discussion behind closed doors, the authority rejected as 'totally unacceptable' Chief Constable Robert Lawrence's closure plans. Instead, it ordered a review of its finances in an attempt to find other ways of offsetting a deficit of nearly Pounds 2m before the next financial year - just six weeks away. A budget review team will meet on Friday to examine possibilities such as switching some functions, such as the traffic warden service, to the control of county councils. More than 3,000 police officers, represented by the Police Federation, passed a vote of no confidence in the authority. The local government union Unison, representing 800 of the 1,300 civilian staff, supported the move, claiming south Wales had been made to look 'a laughing stock' and warned that the force was in danger of losing its official certificate of efficiency. After the meeting in Bridgend, Mid Glamorgan, Mr Roy Jones, authority chairman and county councillor, said the budget review group would attempt to draw up an alter-native to police station closures. As well as closing police stations, the chief constable's report included the option of selling police cars and cutting spending on uniforms.</p>

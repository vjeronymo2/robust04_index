			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Samir Ghawshah, PLO Executive Committee </F> member and secretary general of the Palestinian Popular Struggle  Front, in Tunis, by Fawzi al-Jundi in Cairo, date not given;  from the "Dialogue From Afar" program--recorded]    [Text] [Al-Jundi] Undoubtedly the Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations must rest on basic and firm principles. Could you  tell us about the foundations of the Palestinian position on the  negotiations during the coming stage?    [Ghawshah] As of this moment, no decision has been made by  the PLO Executive Committee or by the Palestinian leadership to  resume the negotiations. After the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque, a decision was made to suspend the negotiations until  the Security Council adopted a resolution. The Security Council  has now passed Resolution 904, which includes a series of  measures for Israel to carry out--such as disarming the settlers  and providing for an international presence--and some other  steps that concern the United States and Russia, the cosponsors  of the Madrid Conference, to ensure the implementation of these  measures. As of this moment, nothing has been implemented.  During the recent talks held in Tunis with the Israelis, the  U.S. envoy and his delegation, the Russian envoy, and Norwegian  envoy Mr. Larsen, the discussion focused on the need to set up a  mechanism for implementing Security Council Resolution 904.    [Al-Jundi] So it is clear that the Palestinian side is eager  to secure international protection for the Palestinians inside  the occupied territories so that such massacre will not recur?    [Ghawshah] Yes. Thus, the PLO leadership has underlined a  number of issues, including the question of international  protection and the need for the presence of international  observers as stipulated under the Security Council resolution,  and the disarming of settlers and confiscation of their weapons,  which is also specified under the Security Council resolution.  The PLO leadership has reiterated a number of demands: namely,  international protection, the entry of a Palestinian police  force into Hebron, the formation of tripartite patrols made up  of international observers, Palestinian police, and Israeli  police to ensure security in Hebron, and the need to ensure that  the settlers leave the city.    [Al-Jundi] But how can the Palestinians benefit from the  Israeli offer to expedite the implementation of the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles [DOP]?    [Ghawshah] Before we talk about implementing the DOP we must  first talk about a delicate and more urgent issue than the DOP,  and that is the question of the settlers. How can the DOP be  implemented when Israel continues to procrastinate over pulling  the settlers out of Hebron? The urgent and basic question on  which the Palestinian people want to see practical and tangible  measures is the Security Council resolution, the withdrawal of  the settlers from Hebron, and the banning of the settlers from  carrying their weapons around among the defenseless  Palestinians, who are being murdered and annihilated by the  settlers and the Israeli Army. The Palestinian leadership will  study the situation and make appropriate decisions in light of  Israel's answers and practical measures, either deciding to  resume the talks or to continue their suspension because of  Israeli procrastination and failure to implement tangible and  practical measures after the Hebron massacre.    [Al-Jundi] Do you believe that a high-level  Palestinian-Israeli meeting could contribute to straightening  things out and narrowing the differences between the two sides?    [Ghawshah] I do not think so. Several meetings have  previously been held, both with Prime Minister Rabin, Peres, and  other envoys. The main issue is the need for the Israeli  Government to make a serious decision--that is, what are the  measures that will be taken to end the murders by the settlers  and pull them out from the Palestinian cities? Failing that,  the cosponsors of the conference will have to take measures.    [Al-Jundi] Thank you Dr. Samir Ghawshah, PLO Executive  Committee member and secretary general of the Palestinian  Popular Struggle Front, who is on the line with us from Tunis.  Thank you and welcome to Voice of the Arabs.    [Ghawshah] You are welcome.</p>

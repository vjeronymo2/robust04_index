			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> LUSH VIGNETTES TREAD IN INDIAN TERRITORY;  </P> <P> THE SNAKE GAME BY WAYNE JOHNSON; ALFRED A. KNOPF $18.95, 262 PAGES  </P> <P> Wayne Johnson has set his book in the woods and lakes of northern Minnesota,  where Ojibway and Chippewa Indians struggle to retain their existence and  identity in a world darkened by the world of the whites.  </P> <P> The 19 stories in "The Snake Game" are a portrait of violent encroachment. It  is as if the passenger pigeon were telling us the history of its own  extinction.  </P> <P> The stories, most of them brief, harsh vignettes, touch upon two families over  the course of 30 years from the 1950s to the 1980s. One, an extended kinship  group, centers around Osada, an old Ojibway craftsman and follower of the old  ways. It includes Red Deer, his son; Martha, his wife, and Joe, father of two  other children by Martha: Bear and Eli.  </P> <P> In contrast to these blurred and shifting relationships -- which conceal an  abiding, organic loyalty -- is the tight, white family of Dr. Neal Sorensen;  Mary, his wife, and their son Martin. The tightness is an opposite illusion;  the coarsely macho father, his pinched wife and the sensitive and rebellious  son are cold galaxies apart.  </P> <P> The vignettes, lush and bitten-off at the same time, and stylistically in  considerable debt to Upper Michigan Hemingway, select incidents in the lives of  the families that make the author's points about the beleaguering of the  Indians and the arrogant domination of the whites. The Indians are portrayed  with a full sense of their mystery, their values, and the loss that their loss  represents. The whites are written with as much nuance as a weather report  about a killer drought.  </P> <P> The first story tells of the deadly encounter that scattered the Osada clan.  The state had ordered the Ojibway children into school, thus restricting their  families' freely wandering life. The children do badly; the authorities  threaten to take them away. Osada, Joe and friends go to take them home; there  is a confrontation that turns violent, and one of Joe's brothers is killed.  </P> <P> Osada leaves his family and goes north to live in a lake cabin and work  occasionally as a guide to a fishing camp. Red Deer, Bear and Eli will  eventually join him and find work there. Many of the stories are set in and  around the lake, and shift back and forth between the Indians and the white  families who go up for fishing holidays.  </P> <P> The Sorensens are one of the families. From the beginning, Martin, regarded by  his father and his father's friends as something of a sissy, is drawn to the  Indians. He will, as time goes by, become the author's voice. Several of the  stories, in fact, tell of his acts of rebellion against the values of his  father and friends, and of solidarity with those of the Indians.  </P> <P> As a boy on a picnic run by one of the fathers of the white families at the  lake, Martin sneaks hot dogs to Bear, who is a year or two older. Years later,  he gets a job as a camp guide, submits to a harsh initiation by Bear, his boss,  and gradually gains his acceptance. When the camp owner dumps a load of trash  in the marsh near Osada's cabin, provoking the old Indian to fury -- it is one  more encroachment -- Martin douses the marsh with gasoline and sets it on fire.  </P> <P> He becomes a trusted friend of Bear and Eli. After the Vietnam War -- Martin  flees to Canada in another protest against the conservative values of his  community -- he comes back to the lake to find that Bear has been killed.  Ostensibly, it was in a hunting accident; in fact, the "accident" was arranged  by one of the whites who had held a long-standing resentment of Bear's uppity  ways.  </P> <P> In one of the best of the stories, Martin wins back Eli's trust. After his  brother's death, Eli has chosen to judge all whites the same. The two walk to a  promontory 70 feet above the lake. Eli jeers that Martin is afraid to go near  the edge. In a foolhardy gesture of anger and heroics -- a legendary, nonwhite  gesture -- Martin grasps Eli by the waist and hurls them both off the edge.  </P> <P> Johnson tends to use melodramatic and occasionally sentimental touches. His  plotting can be excessively contrived to bring out the nature of the Indians'  pain and the white man's oppressiveness.  </P> <P> Martin's leap, though, is authentic drama. Here, and in some of the stronger  stories, the author matches an extraordinary lost gesture with the  extraordinary lost reality of the Indians. Martin cannot save his Indian friend  or his friend's two brothers -- one killed, one in an aimless depression. But  he can embrace him and fall with him.  </P> <P> It is despairing, but it makes its point. Johnson's whites are object lessons  in shortsighted arrogance. Our lakes are filling up with trash. We may not  entirely believe all the maneuverings of these stories, but we do believe in  the Indians, and in what we are all losing with their loss.  </P> <P> Next: Elaine Kendall reviews "Bad Desire" by Gary Devon (Random House).  </P></p>

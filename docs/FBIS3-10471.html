Bolstered by the  military lobby, deputies and senators from the North will  introduce amendments to change the way Indian reservations are  demarcated and limit the creation of new Indian areas in the  regions near Brazil's borders.    The Native Missionary Council (CIMI) has calculated that 230  amendments have already been submitted on the Indian question  alone. In CIMI's opinion, all but ten of them pose a threat to  Indian constitutional rights. Among major changes is an  amendment submitted by Senator Coutinho Jorge, (PMDB-PA)  [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, Para State], that would  insert into the Constitution an obligation for the federal  government to consult the state governments before drawing the  boundaries of Indian lands.  <H5>  Retreat </H5>   The proposal, which has won the sympathy of Deputy Nelson  Jobim (PMDB, Rio Grande do Sul), the rapporteur for the  revision, is being interpreted by Indian rights defenders as a  retreat from gains made in the 1988 Constituent Assembly.  Concerned about the proposed changes, Bishop Apparecido Jose  Dias, the CIMI president, will travel to Brasilia to meet with  party leaders. "The federal government must not bow to the  states. If that amendment passes, it will be a disaster for the  indigenous peoples," Dom Apparecido Dias warned.    Senator Coutinho Jorge, a former environment minister,  defends his position by arguing that his proposal seeks to  correct existing distortions in the mechanism for demarcating  Indian reservations. "This is only a technical amendment," he  said. The senator's proposal was inspired by an episode that  occurred last year in the Para municipality of Altamira, when  FUNAI [National Indian Foundation] began ratifying the  boundaries of the Cachoeira Seca reserve in an area where INCRA  [National Land Reform and Settlement Institute] had put 4,500  settlers. Faced with this impasse, the Ministry of Justice was  forced to annul the ratification of the Indian zone. "The  amendment aims to prevent this kind of problem from arising,"  Coutinho Jorge pointed out.    Another proposal opposed by the NGO's is the plan to veto  the  demarcation of reserves in the 150-km strip along Brazil's  borders. With military permission, PDT [Democratic Labor Party]  leader Deputy Luiz Salomao (Rio de Janeiro), submitted an  amendment that would insert the following sentence into Article  20 of the Constitution: "Areas intended for permanent possession  by Indians shall be demarcated outside the border strip." This  idea was criticized by Deputy Sidney de Miguel (PV-RJ) [Green  Party, Rio de Janeiro] who called it "completely unacceptable."  The green congressman submitted seven suppressive  amendments designed to prevent proposals such as the PDT measure  from being approved during the revision.    According to CIMI figures, approval of this amendment would  directly affect 200 Indian areas and about 100,000 Indians who  now live in the border strip. To mollify those who are upset  about this, Luiz Salomao will probably meet with representatives  of the NGO's and the military after Carnival. The PDT leader  argues that his amendment does not prohibit Indians from living  in the border strip but simply takes into consideration that it  is a national security area.</p>

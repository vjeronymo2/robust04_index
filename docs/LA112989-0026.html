			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> VISTA TAKES ROUND 1 IN BID FOR NEW COURT  </P> <P> A $100-million expansion of the North County courthouse complex in Vista was  recommended Tuesday over construction of a second courthouse in Escondido.  </P> <P> Escondido plans to fight the recommendation when it goes before the county  Board of Supervisors next week.  </P> <P> Norman Hickey, chief county administrative officer, endorsed the opinion of a  special advisory committee that Vista's bid for the court expansion project  made more financial sense than Escondido's, even though the Escondido proposal  offered about $10 million in "up-front" funds, while the Vista proposal offered  none.  </P> <P> North County court and jail facilities are located in Vista. The court  evaluation committee, composed of county technical staff, recommended expansion  at the present site to avoid the "bifurcation" of courts, which would require  transporting prisoners from the Vista complex to court appearances in  Escondido.  </P> <P> Hickey said the Vista proposition met the requirements of the county bid  proposal, offering to provide a 51-courtroom facility and adequate surface  parking, while the Escondido proposal offered a scaled-down 22-court complex  with an adjacent parking structure.  </P> <P> The cities see the courthouse facility as a way to draw related professional  and commercial businesses.  </P> <P> Municipal Court Judge Victor Ramirez said Tuesday that North County municipal  judges unanimously support the Vista complex expansion. Superior Court judges  will be polled on the recommendation Thursday.  </P> <P> Vista's offer includes using a six-acre parcel adjacent to the present county  courthouse complex for surface parking, thus avoiding the expense of building a  parking structure.  </P> <P> In addition, the committee report states, $700,000 to $800,000 would be saved  annually because inmates would not need to be transported from the Vista jail  to courts located in Escondido.  </P> <P> Although Vista offers no up-front funds to cover the planning and design of the  expansion, the committee noted that county-owned land in Escondido -- Deer  Park, which now is used to house California Conservation Corps volunteers --  could be sold for about $2.4 million to finance the court expansion in either  location.  </P> <P> Ken Lounsbery, a former Escondido city attorney and now spokesman for the  Escondido courthouse bid, called the committee recommendation for a Vista  location, "an endorsement of yet another indefinite delay in construction of  much-needed North County courts."  </P> <P> He said the Vista proposal depends on financing from the half-cent sales tax  approved by county voters last year to fund court and jail expansion. Those  funds, he said, have been frozen ever since a Riverside County judge overturned  the matter.  </P> <P> Lounsbery argued that the project could be delayed for up to five years until a  final decision on use of the sales-tax funds is made, probably by the U.S.  Supreme Court.  </P> <P> "It is inconceivable to me that county staff believes construction (on the  courthouse expansion) can begin without funding," Lounsbery said. Escondido has  proposed construction of a 22-courtroom complex within its civic center  development at Broadway and East Valley Parkway. The city, along with Lusardi  Construction Co., offered $10 million toward their scaled-down, and less  expensive, $32.5 million facility.  </P> <P> In its proposal, Escondido offered to buy the Deer Park property from the  county to provide immediate funds for the courthouse development.  </P> <P> Bob Campbell, economic development director for the city of Vista, said that  the funds from the county-owned Deer Park sale and property taxes due the  county from Escondido's and other cities' redevelopment efforts could be used  to begin immediate planning for expansion of the courts at the Vista location.  </P> <P> Long-term financing could be handled by issuing bonds through a joint-powers  authority formed for that purpose, Campbell said, and would not be delayed  until the outcome of the sales-tax suit in the courts.  </P> <P> Campbell stressed that nine to 11 courtrooms with support facilities could be  available in the near future under the Vista proposal. A 2,000-car parking lot  also could be provided on the 6-acre parcel that the city of Vista, which  partially owns the land, has offered to acquire, he said.  </P> <P> He conceded that the proposed $104-million Vista courthouse proposal could not  be completed without an affirmative outcome for the use of sales-tax funds, but  stressed that temporary portable courtrooms, lease of nearby office space for  auxiliary services, and other interim measures could resolve the present  overcrowding at the Vista facility until the sales-tax suit is settled.  </P> <P> County supervisors have scheduled a 10:30 a.m. hearing Tuesday to hear  arguments from the two cities.  </P> <P> Supervisor John MacDonald, whose district includes most of the North County  judicial district, was unavailable for comment because of a personal emergency.  His chief aide, Nancy Allen, said he is expected to have a statement on the  issue after he has reviewed the committee report.  </P></p>

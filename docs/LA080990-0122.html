			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONROVIA;  </P> <P> LIBRARY TO CLOSE BRIEFLY  </P> <P> The City Council voted Tuesday to close the library from Aug. 25 to Sept. 8 in  order to bring the facility into the computer age.  </P> <P> Librarians and volunteers plan to spend 95 hours placing bar codes on the  library's 94,432 books so the volumes can be scanned by computers similar to  those used in supermarkets. The library has been using a manual, card-catalogue  system.  </P> <P> The last week of August and the beginning of September are traditionally slow  for the library because the summer reading program is over and many people take  vacations around Labor Day weekend, librarian Monica Greening said.  </P></p>

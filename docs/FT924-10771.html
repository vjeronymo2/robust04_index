			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Eastern vision WHAT THE European Community desperately needs is what Mr George Bush labelled the 'vision thing'. It is not coming from the politicians. But a spark has come from Mr Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. What the leaders of the Czech and Slovak republics, Hungary and Poland, in London yesterday for their first joint summit meeting with the EC, need is action on one of Mr Attali's ideas: that for a Continental common market. The economic and political destiny of eastern and central Europe lies with the west. As is noted in the European Bank's latest Quarterly Economic Review, several countries in the region have already seen the share of the EC markets in their exports rise from 20 to 30 per cent in 1989 to more than 50 per cent. But if eastern and central Europe must look to the west, the west cannot afford to ignore the east. Eastern Europe now needs what the west obtained after the second world war: integration through multilateral trade. Mr Attali rightly condemns the so-called 'Europe Agreements' between the EC on one side and Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, on the other. These, he has argued, appear designed to 'restrict their access to key western markets rather than to integrate them'. Not only are the agreements restrictive, they are also bilateral. What is needed, instead, is a multilateral framework binding eastern and central Europe both to western Europe and to one another. The EC leaders should propose a European free trade agreement or customs union of which the European Economic Area, incorporating the EC, would be the core. The agreement should be open to any European country committed to the market economy and to democracy. It would offer free access to the markets of western Europe for manufactures and movement towards free trade in agricultural products and services. Meanwhile, safeguard mechanisms, such as anti-dumping, should be made subject to multilateral surveillance. This is a vision worthy of discussion at the Edinburgh summit. The EC exists to stabilise Europe. If it tries to promote western stability while ignoring eastern chaos, it will fail.</p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Gaza town to have Dollars 60m port built Agreement has been reached on the construction of a Dollars 60m port near Gaza town, in a move intended to provide a boost to the economy of the newly autonomous Gaza Strip. An international consortium headed by Ballast Nedam, the Dutch dredging and construction company, has signed a turnkey contract with the Palestinian National Authority, the organisation representing the Palestine Liberation Organisation, which has taken control of the Gaza strip. The new port will be the first commercial harbour on the Gaza strip, now served only by a fishing jetty. It will be built to take vessels of up to 5,000 dwt and will have a water depth of 9 metres. The port will be built in shallow water to the south of Gaza town and will include a breakwater. It will open up the Gaza Strip to trade which has previously been constrained by the need to move goods through neighbouring Israeli ports. It is being financed with Dutch, French and Italian government aid. When final financial approval has been given in about three months, dredging and construction work is expected to take a further year. The other members of the European Gaza Development Group are Grabowsky &amp; Poort, Dutch engineering consultancy; Spie Batignolle, French construction group; and Sistema Ingegneria of Italy.</p>

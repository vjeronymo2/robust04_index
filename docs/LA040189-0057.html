			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TENACIOUS DELAHOYA LEADS GRANT;  </P> <P> SENIOR THROWS 152 PITCHES, HITS GRAND SLAM IN WIN OVER POLY  </P> <P> If the East Valley League baseball game between Grant High and Poly on Friday  was to be judged for beauty, it would probably receive straight zeroes.  </P> <P> Despite the dismal hitting and pitching of both teams and Poly's shoddy  fielding, Grant survived a seventh-inning rally and won, 10-9, at home to gain  revenge for a 17-run loss to the Parrots earlier this week.  </P> <P> "It was an ugly win," Grant Coach Tom Lucero said.  </P> <P> However, the missed ground balls and hit batters could not overshadow the drama  of Javier Delahoya's game-winning grand-slam in the fifth. With two out,  Delahoya ripped relief pitcher Mario Gomez's two-and-one pitch over the  right-center-field fence to give the Lancers a 10-6 lead and cap a six-run  inning after trailing, 6-4. The home run was Delahoya's fourth of the year.  </P> <P> The game was far from over, though. The Parrots took advantage of two walks, an  error and a hit batter to score three runs in the final inning.  </P> <P> Delahoya (3-0), who had allowed only one earned run in 14 innings this season,  walked nine and hit two batters while throwing 152 pitches in a complete-game  effort.  </P> <P> The senior right-hander was clearly tired by the seventh inning. With one out,  Delahoya walked Robert Flores and Gomez was safe at first on an infield error.  </P> <P> Roy Lozano was hit by a pitch to load the bases and Robert Azala walked,  allowing Flores to score and pull the Parrots to within 10-7. With two out,  Shad Martinez drove in Gomez and Lozano with a single. The two-hour, 45-minute  game ended when Adulfo Hernandez struck out with the tying and go-ahead runs on  base.  </P> <P> Delahoya, who last pitched 10 days ago, couldn't remember the last time he had  been so ineffective.  </P> <P> "It's been a long time," he said.  </P> <P> But his perseverance, plus a timely swing, swung the outcome in Grant's favor.  </P> <P> "I got all of it," Delahoya said of the grand slam. "It felt good."  </P></p>

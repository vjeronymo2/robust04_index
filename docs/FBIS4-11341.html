			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] In Tijuana, Baja California, Dr. Ernesto G. Mesina,  president of the so-called American Union Party, has been  released from prison. Mesina is allegedly linked to Mario  Aburto Martinez, perpetrator of the Luis Donaldo Colosio  Murrieta murder, which took place one month ago in this border  town.    Shortly before his release, members of the Special  Prosecutor's Office conducted raids at the residence and office  of Dr. Ernesto G, Mesina, who has expressed to local media his  pleasure over Colosio's killing. Mesina also considers Mario  Aburto Martinez as a true hero and patriot for the murder.  Regarding this topic, Gerardo Segura has filed this report:    [Begin recording] [Segura] Was Mario Aburto a member of this  party?    [Mesina] Of course not, but I would be honored if he would  have said: Dr. Mesina, I have read your book and the title of  one of your articles, and they were the inspiration for my  action. It is good this happened because this will allow us to  have a fair government. I know people may criticize him a great  deal now, but history will acquit him sooner or later.    [Segura] There is talk he maintained contacts with militants  of this party and this somehow inspired him to commit the crime.  There is talk he held certain meetings here. It is even said  he was at this building planning everything before the crime.    [Mesina] Of course not. I did not have the pleasure of  knowing Mario Aburto Martinez, but we would have had other  meetings in any case. [sentence as heard] I have never met him,  but this does not mean I do not admire him for what he did, for  his courage. The assertions that this crime was an act of  cowardice are not true.

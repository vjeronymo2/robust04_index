			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Strong business at convenience stores helps lift T&amp;S to Pounds 6.8m T&amp;S STORES lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.54m to Pounds 6.79m in the six months to July 3, helped by the strength of its convenience stores business which offset falling margins at its core Supercigs discount newsagents. The shares fell from 166p to 160p as the company moved up to the standard rate of tax which reduced earnings to 7.06p (7.69p). The interim dividend goes up to 2.5p (2.4p). Total sales rose to Pounds 171.2m (Pounds 166.1m). T&amp;S said full year results depend on its Supercigs initiatives launched at the end of April. The company had cut the cover prices of 150 magazines by between 5p and 20p in 80 of its 210 (212) Supercigs stores and would extend the discounts to 100. This, and a flexible multi-purchase confectionery promotion had lifted transactions since the half year end. 'The number of transactions in Supercigs at the end of June was down 5 per cent compared with this time last year but has since climbed back up by 7.5 per cent,' said Mr Kevin Threlfall, chairman. Operating profits at Supercigs fell to Pounds 1.77m (Pounds 2.04m) as operating margins declined 10 per cent. Cigarettes, some 75 per cent of Supercigs' sales, felt manufacturers price increases and increased tax which pushed the price through the 'Pounds 2 barrier' in a market which shrank by 5 per cent over the period. The Dillons convenience stores, now 102 (87) outlets, contributed operating profits of Pounds 2.53m (Pounds 1.99m). The Dillons confectionery, tobacco and newsagents business contributed a static Pounds 2.55m. The pre-tax figure reflected interest charges of Pounds 259,000 (Pounds 288,000) on short-term borrowings. Profits on disposal dropped to Pounds 88,000 (Pounds 222,000). Mr Stephen Boddice and Mr James McCarthy have been appointed joint managing directors. COMMENT T&amp;S shares are held back by the group's dependence on the difficult UK tobacco market and fears of a rights issue for acquisitions. It has virtually ruled out the latter, and plans to reduce the proportion of cigarette sales from 59 per cent to 50 per cent through internally funded expansion of its convenience stores over the next four years. November's budget presents the threat of another tax-led squeeze on tobacco margins which would hold back Supercigs second half, notwithstanding its attempt to extend discounts to all its non-cigarette goods. Stripping disposal gains, pre-tax profits are forecast for Pounds 13.5m giving a multiple of 11 which looks somewhat undervalued given the good performance of convenience stores and management's ability to stimulate non-tobacco purchases in Supercigs.</p>

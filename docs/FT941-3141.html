			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Oxford Molecular Pounds 30m flotation Oxford Molecular, the first company to be spun out from Oxford University, is planning a Pounds 30m flotation next month which will value the university's stake at about Pounds 3m. The company was formed in 1989 to commercialise computer software for use in drug design developed at Oxford and other academic laboratories around the world. Although it recorded a loss of Pounds 1.2m on revenues of only Pounds 1.4m last year the company is keen to distance itself from other 'blue sky' flotations, particularly those in the biotechnology sector. Mr Martin Robinson, of Henry Cooke Lumsden, the company's stockbrokers said: 'Oxford Molecular is not asking for money to develop technology but to expand and market technology that is tried, tested and already selling.' He compared the company to Tadpole Technology and Division, the successful flotations of which the broker also handled. Rather than invest heavily in development itself Oxford Molecular takes software written by academics, to whom it pays royalties, which it turns into a commercial product. Mr Tony Marchington, deputy chairman, said this approach was one of its strengths. 'Our main US rivals have taken one product from a university which they add to in-house. We get a continuous transfer from 30 academic teams around the world.' He said the relationships with these academics represent a 'high barrier to entry'. The market for 'computational' chemistry software is currently worth about Dollars 200m (Pounds 140m) and is growing at an estimated 25 per cent a year. Most is used by computer experts but Mr Marchington argues that the software will soon find its way onto the desk-top computers of chemists without specialist computer knowledge. 'Then the market will grow by an order of magnitude.' Customers include Pfizer, Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham and British Bio-technology. All the Pounds 10m to be raised from the flotation will go to the company with the existing shareholders barred from selling for two years. The company was co-founded by Mr Marchington, 38, who worked for ICI after completing his doctorate at Oxford, and Mr Graham Richards, 54, a reader in computational chemistry. Mr Timothy Cooke, who spent 20 years with software house Logica, has joined as chief operating officer.</p>

			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Arts: A dragon with three heads - National Theatre The pantomime season has started early at the Royal National Theatre, and a very clever choice has been made. Dragon, by the Russian playwright Yevgeny Shvarts, is actually more of a fairy tale than a panto. It also has more than a touch of satire. Whichever way you look at it, it fulfils the seasonal requirement of containing something for everyone. Shvarts (1896-1958) was one of those writers who, however hard he tried to write in code, was generally seen through by the censors, so that his works were seldom performed in his lifetime. Dragon was stopped in its tracks in Leningrad in 1944 and not publicly shown in the Soviet Union until 1962 - after the denunciation of Stalin. There was an English-language version at the Royal Court in 1967. One can see why the censors objected. The dragon is plainly Stalin: he has three heads and it is no use cutting off just one. Moreover, the moral goes further: those who slay the dragon, or are accomplices to the act, are quite capable of becoming dragons themselves and perhaps even more tyrannical than the original. So much for the politics. A dragon with three heads is a wonderful subject for a fairy tale. In this new version by Alan Cumming and Ultz, everything has been thrown together: the resources of the Olivier stage, villains, a damsel in distress, a talking cat. Some assistance from the television programme, Spitting Image, and the latest in rap from MC Kinky, who used to work with Boy George. There is a story as well. The dragon is slain by Lancelot who disappears after the battle as mysteriously as he has arrived. That is when the new tyranny sets in and the prisons become even fuller. After a year, however, Lancelot returns and the ending is happy, even sententious: 'The dragon in each and every one of us must be slain.' I can't say I much liked the music, though others may disagree. Among the parts that stood out for me were 'a spot of market research' by the new villains. They consult a fish, a snake ('there's another slippery customer') and a parrot, which simply repeats what they have just said. Then there is the traditional pantomime technique in asking the audience (let's have a referendum): 'Do you want us to kill the dragon?' Overwhelming shouts of 'yes'. The revolving stage and all the resources of lighting and sound are used to the full. There is the noise of an aerial battle involving helicopters and light aircraft as the dragon is finally killed. When Lancelot is absent and rumours start as to his whereabouts, the letter 'L' begins to appear all over the theatre. Scott Brooker of Spitting Image has been at work on dragon, whose three heads are separately cast, like giving a credit to the hindlegs of the pantomime horse. Minor delights include the talking blue cat, Lancelot bouncing up and down a group of puppet dogs ('they set the dogs on me and we became friends') and the piglets who turn out still to be alive on the banquet table. Ultz directs as well as designs. The cast is changing parts each performance, so Dragon is almost the ultimate in company playing. There is no guarantee that it will be the same show every time. Saturday's was delightful; parents might like to know that it lasts less than two hours with an interval. Repertory. Olivier Theatre. (071 928 2252)</p>

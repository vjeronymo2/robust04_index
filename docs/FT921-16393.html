			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber buffer stock manager may buy today MR ALDO Hofmeister, the International Natural Rubber Organisation's buffer stock manager, said yesterday he might resume support buying today and stressed that he had funds to continue his buying programme, reports Reuter from Kuala Lumpur. 'Conceivably, I may step in', he said. 'We can enter the market but we are not going to use the (financial) resources in one day.' Inro's five-day price average has fallen below the group's 'must-buy' level, at which the manager must buy stockpile rubber, but traders said there was no intervention yesterday.  ------------------------------------------------------------------ LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ------------------------------------------------------------------ (As at Monday's close) tonnes Aluminium +32,225 to 987,150 Copper     +1,925 to 327,425 Lead         -125 to 126,375 Nickel       -180 to  11,922 Zinc       -4,600 to 152,200 Tin           +15 to  13,695  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

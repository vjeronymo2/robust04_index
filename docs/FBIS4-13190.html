			<p>BFN     [Text] Nabil Sha'th, chief Palestinian negotiator to the  PLO-Israeli talks, has said that within a week of the signing of  the Gaza-Jericho agreement 6,500-7,000 military and police  personnel will enter Gaza and Jericho as the backbone of a  Palestinian security force.    In statements to the Egyptian daily AL-AHRAM published  [words  indistinct] that considering that their families will accompany  them, a total of 30,000 Palestinians will enter Gaza and Jericho  within a week. Most of these, he noted, belong to the refugees  who were displaced in 1948. Together with them will also enter  the entire political Palestinian leadership [passage indistinct]  to look into the return of the persons displaced in 1967.    Sha'th emphasized that the presence of a national authority  inside will lead to the institution of some symbols of  sovereignty like measures related to economic development. He  indicated that the donor countries that have decided to  contribute financial grants toward the development of Gaza and  Jericho are waiting for the signing of the accord and the  installation of the Palestinian authority. Economic development  and water, he said, will be the most pressing issues for the  Palestinian authority. If a solution is not found to the water  issue, there will be a retrenchment in the agricultural sector.  We will rely more heavily on pollution free modern technology,  tourism, and trade, said Sha'th.</p>

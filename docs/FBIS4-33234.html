			<p>BFN     [Text] Democracy was not the only protagonist on 29 May.  Peace was too, and it arrived on board a plane hoping for a  better future, and this was the message Israeli Foreign Minister  Shimon Peres brought with him.    Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin, accompanied by a large  delegation of the Jewish and Palestinian communities residing in  the Colombian capital, received Peres at Catam Military Airport  in western Santa Fe de Bogota.    Peres, on a brief tour of Latin America that includes only  Mexico, Colombia, and Chile, will discuss topics such as  economic rapprochement and technological cooperation with  Colombian officials. The topic of peace predominated, however,  during the foreign minister's news conference at the Catam  runway.    The Colombian foreign minister said: "Peres is a protagonist  of peace. Colombia must pay homage to him for his efforts and  the success he has had in both this first chapter of peace  between Israel and the Palestinians and for everything he is  doing in the Middle East, as an example to the world on how  peace should be made."    Peres stressed the importance of the democratic process he  witnessed upon his arrival. "Colombia, despite the bad press,  has always been a country that is stronger due to its votes  rather than its bullets. I am certain the results of today's  elections will allow it to continue down the path of economic  recovery and growth in other sectors."    "Just as you are doing, we are trying to consolidate peace  among our people and in our region. In Israeli, we are  determined to continue with the upcoming chapters of peace in  the process we have begun," Peres said.    With contagious optimism, the Israeli foreign minister  expressed his conviction the peace being built in the Middle  East will be a solid and lasting one. "I believe the entire  world is progressing from a history of wars to the creation of  peace. Nothing that is important in life can be achieved  through war. What can be achieved through war has ceased to be  important," he added.    According to the foreign minister, the step that was taken  with the implementation of the Palestinian autonomies in the  Gaza Strip and the Cisjordanian city of Jericho, as established  in the declaration signed by the Palestine Liberation  Organization (PLO) and Israel in Washington last September, is  irreversible. "I believe we are deeply interested in securing  peace for our children. We are tired of war. Neither side has  achieved anything by military means," he said. The peace  process in the Middle East is loaded with obstacles, however.  Perez' view is pragmatic.    Asked about the statement by PLO President Yasir 'Arafat  about the recent call for a "holy war" for the liberation of  Jerusalem, Peres said actions are far more important than words,  adding "we are satisfied that despite Arafat's statements he has  continued to fulfill our agreement."    Peres emphatically said: "Jerusalem will remain a united  city, the capital of Israel. Jerusalem is politically closed  but religiously open. We are not going to turn it into a  Berlin, divided in two. It will be open to all religions."    Peres anticipated a new era in relations with Catholics and  Muslims. "We will sign an agreement with the Vatican in  Jerusalem and exchange ambassadors this year. This was not an  ordinary political move. It is something that took 1,994 years  to happen. All of the sacred sites will remain open to all  religions," he reiterated.    For Peres, the key element of the changes that are occurring  worldwide is the economy. "If one has an adequate economy, one  obtains adequate results," he said. He affirmed, therefore,  there will be no peace in Israel if this country remains an  island of prosperity in a sea of poverty. "We will do  everything within our means to improve standards of living in  all parts of the region, not only in Israel."    Peres mentioned an economic example of the importance of  peace in the region. According to him, the Middle East spent  more than $1 trillion in 10 years to buy bombs. If half this  amount had been spent on education, the Middle East would be a  very prosperous region, he said.    Peres offered his country's technological assistance to  Colombia. "We will gladly share whatever experience we have in  the agricultural field. Israel has improved its agricultural  production by 1,200 percent in 25 years without water or land."    He said Latin America is also experiencing a profound  transformation, a factor which plays a significant role on the  world stage. "Colombia, one of the four most important  countries in Latin America, will play its proper role," he said.    Nevertheless, Peres reserved his highest praise for the  Colombian foreign minister. "We are very happy to improve  relations between Colombia and Israel. The Colombian foreign  minister's visit to Israel was very successful. She made a  magnificent impression on us."</p>

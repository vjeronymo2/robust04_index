			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SOUTH PASADENA;  </P> <P> ELECTRIC POWER RESTORED  </P> <P> Electric power was restored to the city's Police and Fire departments on  Tuesday after a three-day outage. Rainwater from the weekend storm had leaked  into an electrical panel in the basement of city offices last Saturday and  contributed to an extensive internal power failure, City Manager John Bernardi  said.  </P> <P> For nearly 30 minutes on Saturday night, calls to the city's 911 emergency  phone number were automatically transferred to the San Marino Police  Department, Bernardi said. The Fire Department used generators and the Police  Department drew its power from extension cords connected to City Hall  administrative offices next door.  </P> <P> "We're not really sure what happened at this point," Bernardi said, adding that  the failure in the electrical system, installed when City Hall was built on  Mission Street more than three years ago, is being investigated.  </P> <P> It took until Tuesday to make the repairs because crews were unable to obtain  needed parts during the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend, Bernardi said.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 3 March carries in its  regular 10-minute newscast several reports on the fighting in  the republic. Reception is fair.    The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 1st Corps Information Center  reports from Sarajevo that "this morning just after 0800 the  chetniks fired with small arms on members of the UN Protection  Forces [UNPROFOR] in the Jewish cemetery area. UNPROFOR  immediately returned fire. The aggressor also directed small  arms fire at Mijatovica Kosa."    Describing the situation in the Bihac region, Mirza  Sadikovic  describes "yet another hellish night here, with incessant  shelling of the defense positions in (Grabez) and Hasin Vrh.  After firing hundreds of howitzer shells and mortars, the  chetniks attempted an infantry breakthrough at (Vrh), but the  5th Corps' heroic defenders managed to repulse it." He says  that "around midnight they [the Serbs] mercilessly shelled the  center of Cazin and its outskirts."    Summing up the military situation yesterday in its  operational zone, the Bosnia-Herzegovina 3rd Corps Press Center  says that "it was relatively quiet. The chetniks intensified  their small arms fire on the Zavidovici front, and occasionally  shelled the defense lines and civilian targets from  (Podseljanici), (Podmalovani), and Glavica. They were seen  regrouping and bringing in more military hardware, and frequent  helicopter flights were also reported on the Mt. Ozren-(Vozuca)  route. The chetniks fired several 120-mm mortar and B-1  artillery shells at Bugojno, wounding one child. They also  fired five 60-mm mortars at Mala (Oporista) on the defense line  toward Teslic." He says that "the cease-fire in central Bosnia  was seriously violated last night at 1840 in Vitez, when a group  of HVO fighters entered no-man's land near (Ciganluk) and blew  up a house. Sporadic provocative fire was registered in this  region, particularly around Kruscica, [words indistinct]. As  for Gornji Vakuf, the HVO fighters fired several 60-mm and 82-mm  mortars. On the other parts of the front, there were absolutely  no violations, particularly in the Bilalovac region, where not a  single bullet was fired."    In his report from Gracanica, Izudin Durakovic says that  "over the last 24 hours, the enemy continued to attack the  entire front line in the operational zone of Operative Group 2.  The chetniks launched their heaviest attacks on the Trebava  part of the front. Using heavy artillery support, they attempted  an infantry attack toward (Prijeko Brdo) and Lukavica, but the  defenders were not taken by surprise. Indeed, a  counteroffensive enabled them to extend the front line to our  advantage. The chetniks will most certainly try to recapture  that territory today." He says that "as for the Doboj front,  the chetniks fired 80-mm and 120-mm mortars at the defense lines  and at civilian targets in Brijesnica, (Stanic Rijeka), and  (Klopotnica). On the Lukavac front, the chetniks fired from  Vijenac at residential areas, killing one civilian and wounding  three. At the moment of filing this report, the enemy is  shelling Gracanica, and the general alarm has been in force  since 0635 this morning."    The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 4th Corps reports from Mostar  that "the cease-fire is generally being observed here. There  are still some provocative bursts of small arms fire and sniper  activity on the streets of Mostar, and intersections in the city  center. The HVO fighters were somewhat more active on the  southern parts of the Mostar area. One 120-mm mortar was fired  from the enemy positions, while antiaircraft machine guns were  firing sporadically at the defense lines. Negotiations on the  exchange of prisoners of war are to continue today in  Medjugorje." He says that "overnight and this morning have been  quiet."</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAL LUTHERAN BASEBALL PREVIEW;  </P> <P> PITCHING, DEFENSE THE KEYS FOR KINGSMEN  </P> <P> With six position players and three starting pitchers returning from a team  that went 31-16 and advanced to the NAIA District 3 playoffs last year, Cal  Lutheran would appear to have another strong squad this season.  </P> <P> But third-year Coach Rich Hill is approaching today's opener against visiting  Whittier College with guarded optimism.  </P> <P> "Our strength will be our ability to score runs," Hill said. "Our pitching and  defense is very untested right now and that's what wins ballgames. . . . Our  pitching staff is all coming back, but they've been very inconsistent in winter  ball."  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran's schedule doesn't leave much room for error. The Kingsmen play  three NCAA Division I teams and two Division II schools -- including Cal State  Northridge on Sunday -- in their first 10 games.  </P> <P> In addition, catcher Anthony Espitia and second baseman Henry Campos (both  All-District 3 selections) have graduated, and shortstop Daren Cornell has  moved on to the Milwaukee Brewers' organization, leaving a large void to fill  in the infield.  </P> <P> Jeff Brouelette, an all-district third baseman, will split time between his old  position and first base this season, while fellow seniors Darnell Mitchell  (center field), Leonard Matsumoto (catcher) and Devon Schutzler (first base)  will also start.  </P> <P> Junior outfielder Dan Weis is another returning starter, as is Dave Leonhardt,  who played second base last year before a broken hand ended his season.  </P> <P> Senior right-hander Mike Clark, who had an 8-2 record and a 2.15 earned-run  average as an all-district pitcher last season, should anchor a staff that  includes senior left-hander Kevin O'Neill, who was 5-2 with a 3.20 ERA in 1989.  </P> <P> Dean Martinez, a senior right-hander, is expected to be the stopper out of the  bullpen. He will be joined by sophomore Mike Rooney, a transfer from  Northridge.  </P></p>

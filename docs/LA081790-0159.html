			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REGULATORS VETO FARWEST PLAN TO RAISE CAPITAL;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: THE REJECTION, PLUS NEW CURBS ON THE S&amp;L'S ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS,  RAISE QUESTIONS ON WHETHER IT CAN SURVIVE.  </P> <P> In a stunning blow to FarWest Savings &amp; Loan, federal regulators have  rejected the thrift's plan to raise new capital and have imposed harsh new  restrictions on its ability to do business, the ailing firm said Thursday.  </P> <P> For the time being, FarWest will not be able to make new loans without  regulatory approval.  </P> <P> The action raises new questions about whether FarWest, owned by the billionaire  Belzberg brothers of Canada, can survive. Newport Beach-based FarWest is among  the few thrifts that invested heavily in risky junk bonds to so far avoid  government seizure.  </P> <P> The action also appears to bring added pressure upon the Belzbergs to shore up  the firm's capital base -- or possibly risk losing their investment.  </P> <P> The 28-branch FarWest, principal subsidiary of Los Angeles-based FarWest  Financial Corp., said it was appealing to Washington officials the rejection of  its capital plan by the Office of Thrift Supervision in San Francisco.  </P> <P> The S&amp;L also reported new losses Thursday, apparently caused by growing  problems in its portfolio of real estate loans. FarWest said it lost $3.7  million in the second quarter after setting aside new reserves of $16.9 million  -- almost three times its first-quarter reserve -- to cover potential loan and  investment losses.  </P> <P> FarWest's losses for the first half of the year now total $29.9 million. The  S&amp;L lost $46.1 million last year, all in the final six months. Much of the  red ink has been attributed to the government-mandated writedown of its junk  bond portfolio, which was valued at $412 million as of March 31.  </P> <P> While the appeal of its capital plan rejection is pending in Washington, the  thrift has been barred from selling or purchasing assets or making new loans  without prior approval of the Office of Thrift Supervision's San Francisco  office.  </P> <P> The thrift will continue to service already issued loans and maintain other  operations as normal. Deposits will continue to be insured up to $100,000 per  account category.  </P> <P> Selling a large chunk of its assets to raise cash was a key ingredient of  FarWest's capital improvement plan. FarWest officials have said they intended  to shrink the S&amp;L's asset base to $2.7 billion from $3.7 billion now.  </P> <P> FarWest Financial said the capital plan "depended in part on the liquidation of  a wholly owned subsidiary into FarWest Savings," but federal regulators in San  Francisco opposed the sale. FarWest would not identify the subsidiary.  </P> <P> Rejection of the plan by the regional OTS office "is a fairly significant  action," said thrift analyst Ken Thomas, president of KH Thomas Associates in  Miami. "There are many steps along the way that we look at for signs of when  the government will get into the situation, and this is always considered a  very big step. The rejection of a capital plan is not to be taken lightly."  </P> <P> If the thrift's capital improvement plan is not reinstated by the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corp., which oversees thrift regulation, FarWest S&amp;L said  its net worth would plunge to somewhere between negative $23.6 million and  negative $75 million.  </P> <P> The company currently has a net worth of $37.7 million, which means the thrift  is still solvent, but it is still below capital standards mandated by the  federal thrift law.  </P> <P> FarWest officials emphasized the thrift continues to be profitable on an  operating basis.  </P> <P> The unanswered question in FarWest S&amp;L's case is whether the Belzbergs are  now willing to pump more of their own money into the thrift to keep it alive.  </P> <P> Charles Green, FarWest S&amp;L's president and chief executive, said Thursday  that he has not been informed of any investment decision by the Belzbergs.  </P> <P> Green declined to characterize the impact of the OTS decision on FarWest, but  said the restrictions on loans and disposition of assets shouldn't impose a  hardship. "I believe we will be able to get approved what we want approved," he  said.  </P> <P> Green also said regulators have not set a time limit on the thrift's efforts to  raise capital.  </P> <P> A cash injection from the three Belzberg brothers, whose wealth stems from a  diversified real estate, energy and financial services empire and from success  in corporate raids, was not part of the capital improvement plan rejected by  the OTS.  </P> <P> "The capital plan clearly didn't contemplate money from the brothers," analyst  Thomas said. "Just because they've got deep pockets doesn't mean they are going  to dig into them."  </P> <P> FarWest is among a handful of thrifts that invested heavily in junk bonds, the  high-risk, high-yield debt securities that helped pay for many corporate  mergers in the 1980s. But Congress last year passed legislation requiring  thrifts to dispose of those portfolios by 1994.  </P> <P> As a result, the junk bond market has suffered and many thrifts with large  holdings have been hurt, including Columbia Savings in Beverly Hills, Lincoln  Savings in Irvine, Imperial Savings in San Diego, Gibraltar Savings in Beverly  Hills, CenTrust Bank in Miami and Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan in  Denver.  </P> <P> FarWest Financial said Thursday that the federally mandated capital improvement  plan for the S&amp;L, which was filed with regulators Dec. 26, was rejected  when thrift regulators in San Francisco determined that the proposed  liquidation of a major subsidiary was not feasible.  </P> <P> Gerry Finley, a Brea-based thrift analyst, said the liquidation plan appears to  have been an attempt by FarWest to claim the net worth of the subsidiary unit  as its own.  </P> <P> FarWest did not identify the subsidiary, but some analysts believe it is the  thrift's stock and direct real estate investment unit, which had a $463-million  portfolio as of April 12. New investments by thrifts in those areas now are  barred by federal law.  </P> <P> FarWest also said it is currently undergoing its regular annual audit by state  and federal regulators. The examination could result in the thrift being forced  to establish higher reserves for loans.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 6 KYODO -- The country's multimedia  market will be worth 123 trillion yen in the year 2010 if the  telecommunications infrastructure is improved, Posts and  Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki said Thursday [6  January]. Unveiling a "vision" for Japan's policies for the  information and telecom industries in the 21st century, Kanzaki  told a press conference after this year's first cabinet meeting  that the market has the potential to create 2.4 million jobs by  that year.    Kanzaki's estimates are based on an assumption that every  household in Japan is equipped with optical fibers, capable of  transmitting light which can carry far more information than  traditional copper wire.    The nation's fast-growing multimedia market had a scale of  16  trillion yen in 1990. Multimedia is the communicating of  information in more than one form and includes the use of text,  audio, graphic, animated graphic, and full-motion video formats.    The minister said the government needs to take various  measures to nurture multimedia and other information and telecom  industries, seen as one of the key sectors for the future  Japanese economy. He cited improvement of the information and  telecom infrastructure, promotion of new businesses, lessening  segregation between the telecommunications and broadcasting  sectors, and international collaboration as the chief goals for  the government.    In detail, Kanzaki said the telecommunications council, an  advisory body to the posts and telecom minister, plans to come  up with proposals on the problem of infrastructure.    Proposed new businesses include English-language FM  broadcasting, which foreign residents have been requesting, he  said. Also considered is greater exchanges of information with  the United States and the European Union on regulations for  these sectors.</p>

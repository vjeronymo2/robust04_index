			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Government off the hook over fishing A BILL aimed at conserving British fish stocks received its second reading in the Commons last night despite being opposed by three rebel Tory MPs, David Owen writes. Opposition to the measure by Mr David Harris, the MP for St Ives, Mr David Porter (C Waveney) and Mr Robert Hicks (C Cornwall South East), helped restrict the government majority to 29 (216-187). Mr Harris expressed concern that fishermen from other countries would 'continue fishing while our boats are tied up.' The Sea Fish (Conservation) Bill would restrict time at sea for some 3,800 vessels over 10 metres in length and increase sharply to Pounds 50,000 the maximum penalty for breaching a fishing licence condition. Mr David Curry, fisheries minister, said the government did not intend extending restrictions on the number of days that fishing boats may spend at sea to vessels under 10 metres in length 'unless it were necessary'.</p>

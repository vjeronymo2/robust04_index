			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 1 (XINHUA) -- Iran, croatia and bosnia  today issued a joint communique to launch a trilateral  cooperation in a bid to resolve the Bosnia crisis.    Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic said here today that  they reached agreements in the trilateral negotiations on  resolving the Bosnian crisis and sending humanitarian aid to the  Moslems in Bosnia.    According to the communique, any territorial claim of the  neighboring countries of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia was  condemned and border disputes had to be settled without recourse  to violence.    The communique said that the Serbs should immediately  withdraw from areas occupied by force and to allow the return of  all refugees dispersed in Croatia and other countries to their  homes, as well as in other areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Talking to reporters before his departure, Valentic said  that  his government believed that there was a good chance that Serbs  would also attack Macedonia, Kosovo and Sanjak in view of their  aggressive policies.    He said that international organizations and UN Security  Council should implement their resolutions issued concerning  Bosnia and not to allow Serbs to continue their aggressions.    Iran's First Vice-President Hasan Habibi said that the three  countries agreed on almost all issues concerning a trilateral  cooperation among the three countries.    Habibi said that the negotiations resulted in setting up a  joint commission between Iran, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina to  expand economic cooperation and to provide access to open seas  for Bosnia through Croatia.    According to Iranian official news agency IRNA, three  protocols were signed by Valentic and Iranian officials on  transportation, cultural, social, commercial and technical  cooperation.</p>

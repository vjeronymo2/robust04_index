			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> LABORED LOOK AT AMERICAN ORIGINAL AT ODYSSEY  </P> <P> John Cleves Symmes thought the world was hollow. The musical about him,  "Symmes' Hole," at the Odyssey, is hollow.  </P> <P> Symmes (1780-1829) was an Army captain (War of 1812), farmer and half-baked  amateur scientist. He concluded there were holes at the North and South poles,  leading into the warmer recesses of the earth.  </P> <P> According to the program notes, Symmes' "declaration of a hollow earth in 1818  . . . ultimately led to a public campaign for the first government-sponsored  scientific expedition" -- an 1838 endeavor that supposedly discovered  Antarctica, among other feats.  </P> <P> Actually, most sources credit the discovery of Antarctica to three explorers  who saw it in 1820. If the accuracy standards are this lax in the program  notes, imagine what they're like in the musical itself.  </P> <P> Not that accuracy of this kind should matter very much. But except for the  fruits of the expedition that Symmes purportedly inspired, author Randy  Dreyfuss hasn't come up with a reason for us to care about Symmes. In fact,  it's not clear that Dreyfuss himself really cares about Symmes.  </P> <P> The tone of the show is steadfastly trivial and/or cartoonlike. It's supposed  to be a whimsical examination of a cockeyed American dreamer; instead it's a  labored look at a remote character who seems not much more than a buffoon. His  story might be interesting as a footnote in a history book, but it's hardly  worthy of treatment in a full-length musical.  </P> <P> At first the low comedy is mildly amusing. Some of the jokes are so bad they're  good. But gradually, as it becomes apparent that there isn't much of anything  else inside this show, they become merely bad.  </P> <P> The first act attempts to stir up some lyricism over the notion of one man's  unrelenting quest for knowledge, and the second act attempts to make a  statement about the little guy being used by the greedy big guys.  </P> <P> But the strained rhymes and the self-congratulatory lines that dot the lyrics  undercut these efforts. The music is equally fussy and forgettable, and Mark  Reina's choreography adds little more than clutter to Carol Corwen's staging.  </P> <P> Nor does the performance of Albert Macklin as Symmes deepen our sympathy for  this guy. He looks perpetually wild-eyed, as if he's half-mad. He doesn't age,  so we don't appreciate that his was a long-term crusade. And some of his lyrics  are lost, even though it's a small house.  </P> <P> Orson Bean gamely goes through a kind of vaudeville-act-with-big-words as  Symmes' loyal disciple. Craig Zehms plays two smoothie roles smoothly, Lori  Michael vamps around the stage as Symmes' fertile Myrtle of a wife, and Tom  Dugan, Thom McCleister and Kevin Pariseau contribute a gallery of subsidiary  roles.  </P> <P> For a show that's supposed to be about our ability to imagine new worlds, Don  Llewelyn's set and Doc Ballard's lighting are awfully drab and earthbound. Neal  San Teguns did most of the costumes, but not the one that provides the best  sight gag of the show: a "planet suit" worn by Bean at a scientific  demonstration and credited in the program to Carlos Leon.  </P> <P>  At 12111 Ohio Ave., Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 7 p.m.  Tickets: $15.50-$19.50; (213) 826-1626.

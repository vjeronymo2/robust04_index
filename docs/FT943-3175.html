			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Observer: Tory fare Baroness Thatcher may not be quite so ubiquitous as she once was, but her supporters are clearly planning a nostalgic gathering at this year's annual conference in Bournemouth. There at the top of the list of approved restaurants published in the official Conservative guide is Mrs T's Supper Room, which promises a six-course feast in a Victorian atmosphere. If that palls, the faithful can go to Glorianna's or the Old England, also recommended. No doubt Ken Clarke and Michael Heseltine will be at the European Restaurant, which, paradoxically, offers English food. John Major will probably be at Clown's.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Brushing off the welcome mat - Michael Skapinker looks at Holiday Inn's efforts to improve standards and woo back customers Raymond Lewis, Holiday Inn's head of marketing, tells the story of an apprehensive American woman who arrives in Beijing, sees a building with a Holiday Inn sign on it and weeps with relief. There are other stories, such as the couple, travelling through the US some years ago, who entered a Holiday Inn and left minutes later, appalled by the squalor. Lewis does not deny such things have happened. Holiday Inn accepts that by the end of the 1980s standards at some of its US hotels had deteriorated, damaging the company's reputation. When Holiday Inn began in 1952 its aim was to spare travellers unpleasant surprises. Kemmons Wilson, its founder, built the first Holiday Inn in Memphis, Tennessee, after despairing of the poor quality of US hotels. When Bass, the UK brewing and leisure group, bought Holiday Inn in 1990, its priority was to restore the company's good name, probably the world's best-known hotel brand. The company owns an advanced computerised booking system, which it values at Dollars 250m (Pounds 177m). But unlike some hotel companies, Holiday Inn has not been a big investor in property assets. The company owns only 104 of the more than 1,700 Holiday Inns worldwide. It manages some others, but most are run by franchisees. The Holiday Inn brand is the company's most important asset. 'A brand describes a set of expectations,' Lewis says. 'How you deliver against those expectations is the strength of your brand. Anyone can get a customer in the door the first time. But the way you build a business is by getting them back.' The first challenge was to raise the standards of its hotels, about 90 per cent of which are in the US, to ensure customer expectations of a reliable service were met. Bryan Langton, Holiday Inn chairman since the Bass takeover, says the company needed a sense of urgency. He found 2,450 staff at the company's headquarters in Memphis, many under-employed. 'You could have had a heart attack and died at your desk and you wouldn't have been discovered for a couple of weeks,' he says. He moved the headquarters to Atlanta, reducing staff to just over 1,000. Michael Leven, the executive charged with raising the franchised hotels' standards, is ideally suited to the task, having once been thrown out of the Holiday Inn system after a disagreement over spending on upgrading. Holiday Inn later hired him as president of its franchise division. He believes the brand pulls in customers. Nevertheless, when he came to Holiday Inn the first thing that struck him was the lethargy. 'The franchise division was living on past glories,' he says. Inspection of franchised Holiday Inns has been increased from once to twice a year. In his first year, Leven deprived 75 Holiday Inns of their franchises. Last year, 30 were thrown out. Leven expects this year's number to be 75. He closed down the Holiday Inn training 'university' in Mississippi, replacing it with smaller courses at the Atlanta headquarters. By the end of 1994, all the US hotels will have facilities to do their training on their own premises. A group of 32 trainers, dubbed 'Roads Scholars', travel to the hotels. However, they will soon be replaced by 42 trainers, known as Area Service Delivery Consultants. The second challenge facing Holiday Inn is to protect and expand its position in the crowded, medium-priced market. In the 1950s, there were two medium-priced hotel chains, Holiday Inn and Howard Johnson. By the 1980s, they had been joined by chains such as Renaissance, Clarion, Ramada, Quality and Courtyard. Holiday Inn's previous managers had created two new brands, Embassy Suites and the budget Hampton Inn chain. Under Bass, the company has decided to keep the Holiday Inn name, using sub-brands to expand its share of the medium-priced market. In the US, in addition to its standard hotels, the company has set up Holiday Inn Express hotels which are pitched at the cheaper end of the middle market. In Europe and South Africa, Holiday Inn Garden Court hotels aim to draw in a more budget-conscious market. Above its standard hotels, the company has the more up-market Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza hotels, a name created by the previous management. Langton sees the Crowne Plazas as the solution to another problem: the difference in quality between Holiday Inn's hotels in the US and in Europe, where they are considerably smarter. The absence of a uniform standard is a weakness at a time of increasing international travel. All the large hotel groups try to persuade their US customers to use their hotels when they travel. Langton argues Crowne Plazas offer a worldwide standard. Managers in competing companies say the rehabilitation of the Holiday Inn name has some way to go. The Crowne Plaza hotels are seen as particularly vulnerable to competition from more expensive brands.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / 400 Names face average Pounds 80,000 loss ABOUT 400 Lloyd's Names will learn this week that they must pay an average of more than Pounds 80,000 each to meet losses sustained since 1983 by syndicate 387, which specialised in offering stop-loss reinsurance policies to other Names. Syndicate 387's losses for 1989 alone amount to Pounds 32.93m - more than five times the size of its stamp or capital base, and one of the worst results produced by any of the 401 syndicates trading at the Lloyd's insurance market in 1989. Lloyd's is expected next month to report a loss of between Pounds 1.6bn and Pounds 1.8bn for 1989, according to the latest estimates. The affairs of more than 70 per cent of the syndicate's Names were handled by agencies linked to the Lime Street agency. Names will be asked to meet the losses by mid July. The syndicate was formerly managed by the Gooda Walker agency, which went into liquidation last October. Many of the Names - individuals whose assets back underwriting - already face severe underwriting losses as a result of their membership of syndicates managed by Gooda Walker, Rose Thomson Young and other agencies which underwrote spiral reinsurance business, in which syndicates and London market companies reinsure each others' exposure to catastrophe loss. Syndicate 387's present managers, GW Run Off, have called in cash to meet losses on five separate underwriting years, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1988 and 1989. All have been left open because of uncertainty about future claims. Losses for the five years amount to Pounds 54.93m. Mr Ralph Sharp of GW Run Off said that the deterioration on the earlier years was because of increasing losses from pollution and asbestos-related claims, many of which emerge many years later. The losses for 1989 could eventually amount to more than Pounds 43m, according to Mr Sharp. In the years from 1983 to 1989 the syndicate's membership ranged from 239 to 448, but many were members in more than one year. In 1989 a handful of Names committed between Pounds 30,000 and Pounds 40,000, and face losses of up to Pounds 300,000 each. An early-day motion concerning alleged malpractice by professionals at Lloyd's was withdrawn from the Commons order paper yesterday. The motion had been tabled by two Tory MPs - Mr Paul Marland, MP for Gloucestershire West, and Mr Henry Bellingham, MP for Norfolk North West.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco Jose  Sintura was forced to remove his private secretary from office  after an elite investigative team working directly under the  authority of Prosecutor General Gustavo De Greff found evidence  justifying an investigation of the official for alleged "bribes."    As Sintura's private secretary, Orlando Caceres Henao had  succeeded in making himself indispensable in the office. Taking  advantage of that position, he apparently hinted that he wielded  some influence in the processing of documents and demanded sums  of money in return for his "services."    Complaints from several citizens--said to be contractors and  suppliers for the Prosecutor General's Office--led the  prosecutor general's elite investigative team to begin its  respective inquiries. Only hours ago, a prosecutor made the  decision to take Caceres Henao into custody.    Once the investigators had informed Sintura of the result of  their preliminary investigations and of the decision made by the  prosecutor handling the case, the deputy prosecutor general  removed the official from his post.    Reliable sources told EL TIEMPO that "Caceres was demanding  commissions allegedly ranging from 300,000 to 700,000 pesos,  assuring the potential blackmail victims that he could speed up  the obtention of signatures needed on contracts.    The source stressed that "what was most unusual about this  case is that Caceres was not in a position to influence any  decision because his responsibility amounted to no more than  verifying whether documents required by the Prosecutor General's  Office were complete and in order."    Nor did the official have access to confidential reports  that  form part of the records in cases involving drug trafficking or  plea bargaining.    Even as EL TIEMPO continued its efforts to get in touch with  Sintura yesterday, no more than a brief bulletin was released by  the Press Office. In it, the deputy prosecutor general deplored  the events and noted that routine internal inspections had led  to the "discovery of conduct that might constitute a violation  of criminal law."    Sources consulted by EL TIEMPO indicated that the alleged  crime of extortion was based on the original report said to have  been given to the elite team.    Impeccable sources report that Caceres, who is to be  questioned in the hours ahead, once worked for the Office of  International Affairs, another department under the Office of  the Deputy Prosecutor General.    However, those same sources refrained from giving out any  details about the period under investigation or other rumored  irregularities that the Prosecutor General's Office may have  discovered. The bulletin from the Press Office reads as follows:    "The deputy prosecutor general regrets to inform the public  that routine internal inspection procedures established by the  institution some time ago have led to the discovery of conduct  that might constitute a violation of criminal law. Because of  the investigation being conducted by the Office of Prosecutor  General, Orlando Caceres Henao was taken into custody following  his removal from the post he held as private secretary to the  deputy prosecutor general."</p>

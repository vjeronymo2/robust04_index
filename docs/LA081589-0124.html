			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE APPROVES RADICAL PLAN TO CLEAN THE AIR  </P> <P> A radical 20-year plan designed to cure the nation's worst smog problem via  sweeping changes in the way Southern Californians live and work was unanimously  approved today by state air quality regulators.  </P> <P> On an 8-0 vote, the state's Air Resources Board adopted the 1989 Air Quality  Management Plan for the smog-plagued region, encompassing the counties of Los  Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside.  </P> <P> "We will never be able to clear the skies of this basin unless we are willing  to innovate and change," ARB Chairwoman Jan Sharpless said. "While no plan is  perfect, (this one) represents an innovative and necessary step forward."  </P> <P> The plan, approved by local smog regulators in March, will be forwarded to the  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, although many of its provisions,  especially those dealing with vehicles emissions, do not require federal  approval.  </P> <P> The plan has been five years in the making and is required by the federal Clean  Air Act.  </P></p>

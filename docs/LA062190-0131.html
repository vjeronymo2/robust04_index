			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> SPECIFICS SOUGHT ON SPILL PREPAREDNESS  </P> <P> Mayor Thomas J. Mays, in a detailed letter to the State Lands Commission, has  asked the agency to explain its emergency procedures involving offshore oil  platforms.  </P> <P> Mays took the action in the wake of the June 11 offshore oil spill at Bolsa  Chica State Beach, the source of which has still not been pinpointed. Oil  carried by ocean water stained part of the state beach, causing its temporary  closure. Mays said he believes that the oil came from one of two offshore  oil-drilling platforms about a mile off the city's shore.  </P> <P> The State Lands Commission has jurisdiction over California shores from the  high-water mark to three miles at sea. Many of the state's offshore oil  platforms have been built within the three-mile limit.  </P> <P> In his letter to the state, Mays said the city has questions about the  environmental and physical safety of the offshore oil platforms. He said the  city's questions include:  </P> <P> * Who is responsible for the day-to-day standards, operation, maintenance,  training, inspection and safety of the offshore platforms within the Huntington  Beach city limits?  </P> <P> * Specifically, who and what governmental agency is in charge of spills, fires  or other emergencies when they occur?  </P> <P> * What emergency contingency plans and standing orders are in place?  </P> <P> * Who prepares these plans and who insures compliance?  </P> <P> * Specifically, what emergency resources are immediately available to cope with  these emergencies?  </P> <P> * Specifically what deficiencies are there, and what is the action program to  ensure maximum safety and environmental protection?  </P> <P> Mays' letter said that "too often citizens and public officials find out too  late that full protective measures were not in place." He said a recent example  was the February oil spill on city beaches from the tanker American Trader.  That spill of 394,000 gallons of oil occurred when the tanker ran aground on  its anchor. The U.S. Coast Guard said the depth of the water surrounding the  mooring had not been regularly surveyed. BILL BILLITER  </P></p>

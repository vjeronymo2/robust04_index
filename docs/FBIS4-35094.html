			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 28 Jun (AFP) -- Seven former Nicaraguan  recontras (rearmed contras) entered the Colombian Embassy in  this capital today to demand political asylum, Government  Ministry sources reported.    Another group of 15 former recontras of the so-called 3-80  Northern Front, an armed group which demobilized in April,  occupied the offices of the OAS International Commission of  Support and Verification (CIAV-OAS) in a simultaneous act this  morning, demanding government compliance with the disarmament  agreements, official sources confirmed.    Although the former rebels inside the Colombian Embassy have  not publicized the reasons for demanding asylum, local sources  believe both actions seek the same objective: to exert pressure  demanding compliance with the agreements in which the government  offered them protection, land, and the participation of a former  guerrilla sector in the police, among other things.</p>

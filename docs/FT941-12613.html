			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Delors calls for a Greater Europe Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, yesterday called for a review of policy to help speed the political and economic integration of central and eastern Europe. The review follows a message from US President Bill Clinton that the European Union must do more to help the former communist countries. But it also anticipates renewed pressure from the east Europeans for closer ties and eventual EU membership following the anti-reformist, nationalist backlash in Russia. The Commission study will cover technical aid, foreign policy co-operation, and the operation of the Common Agricultural Policy in relation to eastern and central Europe. It is also likely to examine the prospects for new security links, including possible associate membership of the Western European Union. Mr Delors said in his annual address to reporters in Brussels yesterday that it was time to think of a 'Greater Europe'. It was not enough to admit four new members (Sweden, Austria, Finland, and Norway), send a friendly signal to Cyprus and Malta, and offer encouraging words to eastern Europe. 'Europe needs to know where it is going,' he said. Mr Delors also indicated that thinking about a new European architecture would inevitably re-open sensitive questions about the institutional balance, including the weight of voting between small and large countries. At the Copenhagen summit in June 1993, the Twelve told the east Europeans they would be able to join the Union, but did not offer a firm timetable. They also pledged more formal political ties and greater market access. In the past six months, attention in Brussels has been diverted by events in Russia and a failed drive to conclude a new partnership and co-operation agreement with Moscow.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Arts: Lucinda Childs - Dance In New York in the early 1960s dance experiment was centred on Judson Church. There the earnest and the eager set about forging a new dance - post-modern, post-Cunningham - which sought a radical re-shaping of everything that 'dance' had meant up to then. It was, I suppose, symptomatic of its time, and marked by a Puritanism that accorded well with current theatrical and musical austerities. One of Judson's formative figures was Yvonne Rainer, who declared 'No to spectacle; No to virtuosity; No to transformations and magic and make-believe . . .' (I saw a Rainer performance, which was crucifyingly boring, and offered no substitute for anything at all - least of all dance). An ideal had been stated for many who followed in her unlovely footsteps. This year Lucinda Childs, one of the most acclaimed Judson graduates, is making a first British visit with her company. Sophie Constanti reported here on her Edinburgh Festival debut; on Tuesday night, as the Dance Umbrella season got under way, Miss Childs and her troupe came to the South Bank - a glum and not inapt location. The Childs manner offers small cells of activity which repeat and repeat, re-align and slowly mutate - it is no accident that she uses minimalist scores as accompaniment - so that the viewer is made aware of a cumulative structure. This building-blocks approach to dance would be more fascinating - as the Shades entry in Bayadere is fascinating in its repetitions and augmentation  -were the blocks themselves of interest. But to pile up banalities, to shift their direction, to pass them among a cast like so many tiny austerities, is not so much architecture as parsimony. The major piece in Tuesday's programme was Available Light, almost an hour of routines set below and on a bridge-structure. First made as a museum installation in Los Angeles a decade ago, it has a score by John Adams which is vastly more enterprising in the working out of its patterns than Childs' movement sequences. Ten dancers (looking like sci-fi laboratory assistants in overalls that reveal pallid inner legs and arms) tread and re-tread their well-worn paths. Virtuosity is Rainer-ishly denied - the cast look unstretched - and the development of these ideas is simple-minded. ('Those two have just turned and run. That means that the other two in black, and then the four in red, will do the same' - and they do). Miss Childs manifests herself twice, Cunningham-fashion, but even in these unambitious technical surroundings, her performance has a constrained air. The second piece, Concerto, dates from last year and uses Gorecki's harpsichord concerto. It lasts nine minutes, and its dancers, in smart black shirts and trousers, nip along pre-destined tracks with something like vivacity. (The trams are moving faster). Here Childs' style matches the motor energy of the score in recurring patterns of action, if not in emotional density. The piece is short enough for the message to seem intriguing without turning into an acreage of tape-loop repeats. Brevity is not the soul of post-modernism - but it is a tremendous bonus here. Lucinda Childs is at the Queen Elizabeth Hall until October 20.</p>

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Seoul tries to break up big business groups THE South Korean government is to offer financial incentives to conglomerates that streamline their operations and specialise in a few industries. The Industry Ministry proposal is likely to be the centrepiece of President Kim Young-sam's policy toward the chaebol, the big business groups that dominate the Korean economy. Korean governments for the past decade have tried to reduce the size of the chaebol, but with little success. Officials have long argued that the chaebol have diversified into too many unrelated industries, which is harming their efficiency and global competitiveness. Korea's leading chaebol, on average, operate in nine different industries, while Japanese business groups normally concentrate on one to three industries, says the ministry. Under the proposed guidelines, the 10 biggest chaebol, which include Hyundai, Samsung, Lucky-Goldstar and Daewoo, would select three core industrial sectors and the next 20 largest would pick two sectors to develop. The chaebol must select their core industries by the end of the year. In return, the government would lift restrictions on bank loans and possibly foreign borrowing for these core companies, while providing research and development support. Chaebol that dispose of other non-core subsidiaries would be allowed to select an additional one or two core industries. The plan bears some similarity to the last chaebol policy, introduced in 1991, which stipulated that the 30 leading conglomerates had to select three core industries, which would then receive unrestricted bank loans. But this programme failed to reduce the size of the chaebol or fulfil the government's hope that the chaebol would select their most advanced industries. Instead, the designated core companies were often those needing the most capital investments, such as the troubled petrochemical industry, or ones with the heaviest debts. The government this time is proposing that core companies must meet certain conditions to qualify. Selected companies, for example, must already account for at least 10 per cent of group sales, which would indicate that they are already competitive. South Korea will free most interest rates on November 1 in a key step toward financial liberalisation, the finance ministry announced yesterday. The action, long anticipated, will deregulate all lending rates offered by financial institutions, except for rates connected with low-interest state-controlled policy loans to strategic industries. Interest rates on long-term deposits of more than two years will also be freed. The government has promised to deregulate all interest rates by 1997. The ministry said that most lending and deposit rates would be liberalised as a result of the current measure. However, non-bank financial institutions will enjoy more freedom in setting interest rates than banks, which have traditionally been under tighter government regulation. All lending rates offered by non-bank financial institutions will be liberalised and most deposit rates. Banks say they are seeking an accelerated liberalisation of deposit rates, now scheduled to be completed by 1996, in order to compete more efficiently against rival institutions in attracting funds. But the government has adopted a cautious approach in liberalising deposit rates because it is concerned that it would force financial institutions to raise deposit rates, with a corresponding increase in lending rates to maintain interest rate margins, as they compete for funds. The new measure is expected, at least temporarily, to increase loan rates, which could further slow economic growth, at 4 per cent a year already at its lowest level in 13 years. The government has indicated that it may increase the money supply to keep loan rates from rising sharply.</p>

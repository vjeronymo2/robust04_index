			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> DEVELOPERS TO PAY FOR ART  </P> <P> Developers will have to help pay for public art displays in the city if a City  Council proposal made last week is approved.  </P> <P> In a 6-1 vote, the council directed City Atty.  </P> <P> Robert M. Myers to draft an ordinance that would require developers who build  non-residential projects to pay 55 cents per square foot of their projects to a  fund for city art projects. Councilwoman Christine E. Reed voted against  drafting the ordinance.  </P> <P> The fee, which could generate $2.6 million in the next 20 years, would go to  the city's Cultural Trust Fund and would come under the control of the Arts  Commission. Under the proposal, 50% of fees from a given project would go to  art displays in the vicinity of the construction site, while the rest of the  money would be available for displays citywide.  </P></p>

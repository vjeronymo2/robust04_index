			<p>BFN     [Text] Khartoum, 25 May (MENA)--Dr. Hasan Jad al-Haqq,  Egypt's ambassador in Khartoum, this evening held a celebration  on the occasion of Africa Day during which he delivered  President Muhammad Husni Mubarak's speech in his capacity as  chairman of the OAU, in the presence of over 500 guests,  including ambassadors and ranking accredited African and Arab  figures in Khartoum.    The Sudanese Government's representative was noticeably  absent from the celebration, despite the fact that the Sudanese  Government was sent an invitation by the head of the African  diplomatic corps.    Ugandan Ambassador to Sudan E. Obitre Gama, doyen of the  African diplomatic corps in Khartoum, delivered a speech in  which he condemned the measures taken by the Sudanese  authorities against the Egyptian interests in Khartoum, such as  the Egyptian Club, where the celebration was supposed to have  been held. Because of this, the celebration was moved to the  home of the Egyptian ambassador in Khartoum.    Ambassador Gama thanked Egypt and its ambassador for hosting  this celebration and not cancelling it. This gave many Africans  an opportunity to celebrate their day.    During the celebration, the Egyptian ambassador received  notification from the head of the Egyptian Irrigation Department  in Sudan that this evening the Sudanese authorities took control  of another house of the Egyptian Irrigation Department in  Khartoum, the resident of which is currently on annual leave in  Cairo. This report drew condemnations from the sons of the  African communities in Sudan who were attending the celebration.    Thus, the number of houses that have been occupied has risen  to 14, in addition to the Egyptian Defense Office's three rest  houses.    In a statement to the MENA correspondent in Khartoum, Dr.  Hasan Jad-al-Haqq affirmed at the end of the celebration that no  matter what happened, today's celebration of Africa Day was not  going to be cancelled. He affirmed that he considers the  residence of the Egyptian ambassador in Khartoum to be the home  for all Africans in Sudan.</p>

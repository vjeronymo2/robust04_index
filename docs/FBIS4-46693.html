			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Maksimov: "Fuel Is Like Bitter Tears"] </F>   [Text] Remember how many times the cost of gasoline  has risen unpredictably just recently, causing headaches to car  lovers. And there are always lines in filling stations and,  alas, there is always a justified expectation: Once the cost of  fuel rises, prices of all the rest will also increase. The  petroleum fever has unwound the flywheel of inflation, devaluing  the ruble, the population's deposits, pensions, and wages. What  is this--inevitability connected with the drying up of  underground storerooms and with the excessive appetites of  petroleum producers or businessmen trading in fuel? We have  managed to reveal some secrets of "black gold." The editorial  department has come across strictly confidential material,  sensational in its own way, from the Ministry of Fuel and  Energy, in which this sector's analysts present the most  unexpected data, which make it possible to see the petroleum  problem in a new light.    For example, it turns out that in our country there is an  abundance of petroleum. And what abundance! This is what the  analytic survey "for internal use" states in connection with  this: "... By the beginning of the second quarter more than 6.5  million tonnes of unsold crude petroleum accumulated in the  system of main transport, which exceeded the permissible  technological level. All free capacities of petroleum and gas  producing enterprises and petroleum refining plants are filled  with petroleum and finished products, the remainders of which,  as compared with the end of last year, have increased one and  half-fold. Owing to the lack of free capacities, petroleum  producing enterprises were forced to shut down wells..."    The Russian economy has always been unpredictable and  paradoxical. Even from precious petroleum we have managed to  make unsalable goods. Of course, both the nonpayment  crisis--today consumer enterprises owe the Russian Federation  fuel and energy complex about 20 trillion rubles--and  shortcomings in the implementation of intergovernmental  agreements on mutual settlements for petroleum have led to this.    The wealth of "petroleum kings" is also no more than another  myth. We quote the same document. "Various state taxes make up  about 70 to 90 percent in the structure of the price of  petroleum products. Tax policy leaves enterprises without funds  minimally necessary for their functioning and development. High  taxes and charges make even the export of petroleum products  inefficient. Their price has almost reached the world level  mainly owing to taxes, which has made deliveries to the foreign  market unprofitable..."    That is, in the very near future the "king" may prove to be  naked. Of course, it is a matter of professional petroleum  industry workers and producers, not of crafty middlemen, who  manage to extract personal billions from state property. The  entire sector may prove to be unemployed and bankrupt. These are  not merely words. From 1992 until today our export to near  abroad has been reduced to one-half! The reasons are known. The  insolvency of the Commonwealth countries and the existing price  formation system... Forget about them, someone will say, we will  sell petroleum not to the CIS, but to the West for "pure bucks."  It is not worth having illusions. In 1993 the volume of exported  fuel and energy resources increased by 23 percent, but prices  dropped by 19 percent.    Commercial structures in the chase after quick "profits"  sell  strategic raw materials more cheaply. Momentary advantages are  the chief things. Who benefits from this? As a result, world  petroleum prices drop, while our "domestic" prices rise. With  such a very wild trend, how to fight for sales markets?    So much was said about Ukraine's strongest dependence on  deliveries of Russian fuel: For the sake of gasoline Kiev will  make any concessions to Moscow. But recently Ukraine has  purchased 2 million tonnes of petroleum products in Rotterdam.  It turns out that there they are cheaper than in our country.  However, the laws of the economy are harsh: Having lost the  market, later you will spend twice as much in order to get it  back.    True, the fuel and energy complex has done a great deal to  solve problems. For example, last year it gave about one-half of  the entire Russian export and, on the whole, ensured the state's  positive foreign trade balance. It also gave about 40 percent of  the revenue part of the federal budget. It did not permit  serious disruptions in deliveries of energy carriers, which  business managers feared so. Professionalism and experience were  manifested in this. However, how to proceed further so that the  failures, at which we have arrived today, do not occur?    In the market world the calculation of the cost of any  commodity--from a necktie to a car--begins from the  determination of the cost of 1 tonne of grain and 1 tonne of  petroleum. Later everything "starts" from these two base  figures. And not otherwise. For now this correlation "walks" by  itself, causing attacks of the disease in the entire economic  organism. However, if price proportions are set for a long  period, for example, for 5 years, other sectors could then  operate in a stable and calm situation.    What is happening today--a spasmodic rise in the cost of  energy carriers--gives nothing except waves of inflation and an  economic chaos. Of course, it is important for the state to  subsidize this process at the initial stage and to help to  unwind the market mechanism. Later it will begin to produce a  harvest by itself.    Right now, however, without waiting for global shifts, what  has already been adjusted can and should be preserved; for  example, trade ties with near abroad. We should continue to sell  it petroleum, although for some time, on credit; of course,  strictly indexing calculations. Otherwise, competitors will  simply capture the market. Incidentally, property can be  acquired in republics for debts. There are already examples of  this. The Ministry of Fuel and Energy is now acquiring the  controlling block of shares of the Lisichansk Petroleum Refining  Combine, one of the three best production facilities of the  former Union. A new construction of such a complex in Russia  would cost billions...    In brief, everything is not yet lost. However, to wait until  everything is buried, until inflation drags the country to an  abyss, is a folly. We must finally get rid of the constant price  jitters and lack of confidence in tomorrow and begin to live  under conditions of a civilized economy.</p>

This followed earlier  incidents at roadblocks in the small section of Bophuthatswana  around Thaba'nchu in the Orange Free State.    The roadblocks seemed to be set up to prevent Mr Mandela and  a large ANC and press contingent from laying a wreath on the  grave a former ANC president, Dr James Moroka, whose family  still farm in the Thaba'nchu District.    ANC NEC [National Executive Committee] member and the  organisation's Orange Free State presidential candidate, Patrick  "Terror" Lekota left his vehicle as Bophuthatswana defence force  soldiers ordered the 20 to 25 car caravan to stop. "We were  told we would not be allowed through -- but went anyway," Mr  Lekota told SAPA after the wreath laying ceremony.    Mr Mandela told more than 30,000 cheering supporters at  Botshabelo, about 50km from Bloemfontein: "As we entered  Thaba'nchu we came across a roadblock set out up by Mangope.  They were lucky they did not prevent us. I made it clear to my  men here, whether they liked it or not, we would go through.  Mangope on several occasions has said why does the president of  the ANC single me out from other homeland leaders. The question  is answered by him throwing up roadblocks preventing people  carrying on free political activity. This makes us loathe him  from the bottom of our hearts."    Wearing a blue and grey blanket and Basotho hat Mr Mandela  added: "We don't need permission from Mangope to move around our  country. You must understand that Mangope and his police force  are cowards. As we approached them his police were fiddling with  their guns. I was sure if I left the car and walked towards him  he would drop the gun and run away. In spite of all this, if  Mangope wants to settle we are prepared, for the good of our  country and the good of our people, to listen to what he has to  say to us."    Mr Mandela is believed to have a meeting with Mr Mangope on  Monday morning before the Bophuthatswana leader goes into talks  with the government on the Freedom Alliance's [FA] participation  in the election.    Speaking about former FA members, Mr Mandela mentioned  Transkei and Ciskei leaders who had left the alliance. "Now  (Ciskei leader Brig Oupa Gqozo), who was part of the Freedom  Alliance, has deserted them and come into the democratic  movement. We have accepted Brig Gqozo into the Transitional  Executive Council and some of his men are being trained as part  of the National Peacekeeping Force. These leaders from the  homelands have shown more vision than Mangope or Gqozo. And in  spite of all the unspeakable crimes he (Mangope) has committed  we are prepared to sit down and find a solution with him," Mr  Mandela said to deafening applause and drumbeats.    Mr Mandela then addressed the issues of the upcoming  election  and told his audience that many of them had been driven away  from the farms. "Many of you are without jobs, houses and  security. Your problems are due to the fact that the National  Party [NP] government does not consider that your problems,  suffering and hardships are part of their responsibility. They  are interested in serving the needs of the white minority. The  majority of the farmers support the NP and that is why they do  not care for you. That is why you have low wages. That is why  they don't care."    He then went on to tell the crowd their votes were secret  and  no one would know who they voted for.    On a lighter note he suggested when an employer offered a  worker money and transport to the polling station to vote for  the NP, "you should take his R[rand]10, let him take you to the  voting station and then cast your vote for the ANC.    Speaking about NP claims the ANC did not have the resources  to implement its proposals, Mr Mandela pointed to large scale  government corruption and the selling off of state enterprises  that, he said, "were only set up to benefit whites". "And then  they say we have no resources to carry out our reform  programmes." "Now that there is a possibility of a black  government taking over they have decided to get rid of those  state enterprises and privatise them. The effect of  privatisation is that wealth will remain in the hands of whites  in this country. The conspiracy between the government and the  mining houses by which the mining houses own the mineral  resources under the ground is another way of taking money away  from a new government. Up to two years ago the minerals were  the property of the state, and the mining houses only had  permission to remove them. Now as a black government is to take  over they have changed the rules."    "Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank stated that in  one year R10-billion had left this country. That money has left  the country because of the actions of the present government,"  Mr Mandela said.    "The NP now argues after the corruption, privatisation and  its covert operations, we should not have a programme which will  ensure a better life for our people. What hypocrisy. We are  dealing with hypocrites, people with no vision, who are now  panicking."    "The number of people who have turned up during my election  campaign shows very clearly that the NP is detested by our  people like leprosy. And lepers they indeed are."    He also called on the top levels of the civil service to  start thinking about programmes for a new government and to stop  behaving as custodians of apartheid. "The public service  continues to behave as if apartheid was alive and well. The sad  truth is that the public service still behaves as if they are  servants of the National Party. It is time for the public  service to demonstrate its allegiance to South Africa. There is  no one in South Africa who does not know the ANC is going to be  the next government. President de Klerk still behaves as if the  public service is his, and the SADF [South African Defense  Force] is his private army."</p>

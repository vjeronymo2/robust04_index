			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] -- On ZDF's [Second German Television Channel]  "Heute Journal" program, [State Minister Bernd] Schmidbauer said  that since the summer of 1992, the Federal Government has "not  just had vague indications but very specific indications" that  "a subterranean facility is being built in a dry valley" in  Tarhuna. This facility "was discovered and uncovered, and all  the necessary steps" were initiated in international cooperation  to warn all "relevant companies." "Interministerial work  groups" have "watched this project for many months."    It has been "possible to identify the project before the  project was completed, before any machine was in this project,  and up to now, these machines have not been housed in this  project." "For the first time," it has been "possible to inform  the companies beforehand, to follow up on all information, and  to approach relevant companies that produce such equipment."    There is "not a single clue pointing to a German company  that  is furnishing this facility"; however, there are indications  that in building the tunnel, multipurpose equipment, which is  used all over the world, has been used, which "could also come  from Germany." These clues have been under investigation ever  since they turned up. Schmidbauer: "This new chemical factory  cannot be built as planned because there were certain  precautionary measures that did not permit it; however, such a  company is still being built."

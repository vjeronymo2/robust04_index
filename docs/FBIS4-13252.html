			<p>BFN     [Text] The Jordanian-Iraqi relations have sharply  deteriorated recently, particularly after the assassination of a  prominent Iraqi opposition figure, Shaykh Talib al-Suhayl, by  Iraqi diplomats in Beirut. His majesty's cable of condolences  to the family of the deceased carried clear denunciation of the  assassination. His majesty said that he "received the news with  indignation and disgust," and that "it was perpetrated by  vicious hands which derive their ability to commit evil from  sick hearts that have been so blinded by hatred that they are  accustomed to shedding innocent blood, forgetting that nothing  will save them from the wrath of man and God."    The killing of Shaykh al-Suhayl, who carried the Jordanian  and Saudi nationalities and who is known for his friendship with  his majesty the king and the Hashemites in Iraq, has put an end  to the Jordanian-Iraqi attempts over the past two weeks to  revive the Baghdad-Amman ties after a long period of stagnation  and after Saudi Arabia insisted on its position and closed all  doors of reconciliation with Jordan, which exerted tremendous  efforts to mend fences.    Dr. Sa'id al-Tall, the Jordanian deputy prime minister, went  to Iraq last week on a visit that was not officially announced,  carrying a special message from the king to Saddam Husayn. The  message stressed Jordan's concern to restrengthen the  Iraqi-Jordanian relations and face the U.S. pressures directed  against Jordan through the continuation of the unjust blockade  of al-'Aqabah port.    President Saddam Husayn sent a reply which was brought to  Amman by the Iraqi Information Minister Hamid Hammadi a few days  ago. The Iraqi president welcomed the king's proposals and  voiced Iraq's readiness to resume joint cooperation in the  political and economic domains.    However, the Iraqi information minister's visit to Jordan  started a crisis with Jordan instead of effecting channels of  contacts between the two countries. This is because of the way  the Jordanian media reported the visit, describing the Iraqi  official as envoy of the Iraqi leadership in contrast with the  Iraqi media description of him as President Saddam Husayn's  envoy.    In order to ascertain if this allusion to the minister was  an  intentional move by the Jordanian decisionmakers or a media  contrivance, the Iraqi side made contacts on all levels and was  convinced that this was done by the Jordanian decisionmakers who  wanted to officially ignore Iraqi President Saddam Husayn and  depict Jordan as dealing with an Iraqi leadership and an Iraqi  people.    This crisis could have been contained if al-Suhayl had not  been assassinated on the same day the Iraqi president's envoy  arrived in Amman. Accusations were leveled at the Iraqi  leadership based on the fact the he was a prominent Iraqi  opposition figure. Al-Suhayl left Baghdad in 1958 following the  14 July revolution. He held Jordanian and Saudi nationalities  and his name was recently mentioned as the mastermind behind the  assassination attempt against President Saddam Husayn revealed  by the U.S. press recently.</p>

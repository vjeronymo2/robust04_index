			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTER SUFFERING HEART ATTACK, LEE ELDER NOW ON COURSE ON SENIOR TOUR  </P> <P> Lee Elder is the surprise entry in the senior division of the Tournament of  Champions, which ushers in the professional golf season beginning Thursday at  La Costa.  </P> <P> Fourteen months ago, Elder had no intention of playing in this tournament. He  was in a hospital fighting for his life.  </P> <P> Only tournament winners qualify for the opening tournament of the season. Elder  climaxed an extraordinary comeback by winning the Gus Machado tournament in  late November. His 6 under 65 on the last round enabled him to win by 5 shots  with a 54-hole total of 202. He had made it back almost a year to the day after  suffering a heart attack that threatened his life.  </P> <P> After finishing ninth in the Gus Machado at Key Biscayne, Fla. Nov. 22, 1987,  Elder became ill. He had been on a busy schedule in October and November,  flying coast-to-coast twice and to Japan, competing in tournaments every week.  He had complained of back and side pains during the tournament, wearing a brace  for the last round after leading the first round.  </P> <P> "I probably was worn out, but I thought it was a back problem," Elder recalled.  "I never thought about a heart attack. Something like that couldn't happen to  Lee Elder. But it did. By 10 that night I was in terrible pain. I had to go to  the hospital."  </P> <P> Elder was in the intensive care heart unit for 5 days and remained in the  hospital another 9 days.  </P> <P> "The doctor told me that only extensive tests would determine whether I would  ever play golf again," said Elder, who arrived early in Southern California to  practice for the tournament. "It was frightening. I was only 53 and golf was my  life. I didn't know anything else. There was a chance I would wind up like  Arthur Ashe, unable to compete again.  </P> <P> "As it turned out, I was lucky. There was only a small tear in the heart. Tests  indicated there was very little blockage of the arteries. The doctor said being  a golfer, being outside so much and walking, probably kept me from having a  much more severe attack.  </P> <P> "Ten days after going to the hospital, my doctor came into the room and said,  'I have some very good news for you. You will be able to play again. It's your  choice. You had a stress cholesterol attack. Rest, time, no stress and  rehabilitation are the answer. It's up to you.' "  </P> <P> It meant a complete change in life style. He had to give up smoking, decrease  his drinking, go on a low cholesterol diet and take cardiovascular treatment  daily.  </P> <P> "I had been a heart attack waiting to happen," he said. "I smoked two or three  packs of cigarettes a day and I had been drinking heavily. I had very high  cholesterol and wore myself out physically with all that traveling. I ate the  worst possible foods, eggs, fatty meats and lots of it. I let myself get fat.  In addition, I kept my anger inside of me, under control on the course. I  wanted to keep up an image. Of course, there were times in the clubhouse when I  blew my top. I would throw the offending club -- it's always the club's fault  -- around the locker room after a poor round.  </P> <P> "I was determined to follow orders and continue my career. Quitting smoking was  easy. I couldn't smoke during the 14 days in the hospital. The diet and the  drinking, except for the holidays, were not too tough, either. I'm on a 1,700  calories per day diet and I haven't had an egg in more than a year. I go to the  cardiovascular treatment center every day and I walk at least 2 miles."  </P> <P> When the doctor told Elder he could start chipping in January, Elder said he  wanted to play in the Senior PGA, which is played near his Palm Beach Gardens,  Fla. home, and started Feb. 10. He was told he couldn't.  </P> <P> "But, he told me I could start swinging a club Jan. 20," Elder said. "He told  me it would probably hurt at first. I was to stop, take a nitroglycerin pill  and try again. It never did hurt at all. The first few days I was afraid to  swing hard, but when I finally did, it still didn't hurt.  </P> <P> "When I started hitting golf balls, it was like hitting into a three-club wind.  I had no strength. It wasn't that difficult to adjust, especially with the  irons. I have always been a good iron player."  </P> <P> Elder, to the surprise of his doctor, played in the Senior PGA. He amazed  everyone by shooting a 70 in the first round. Although he faded somewhat, he  still earned $7,000.  </P> <P> "I knew I still had a long way to go," he said. "Probably a year. At first, I  would play a tournament and rest one week. In warm weather I could play two in  a row.  </P> <P> "Guys I used to outdrive were now hitting the ball farther than I could. I  wanted to do some weightlifting to regain my strength, but the doctor wouldn't  let me. However, I was allowed to use 3-pound weights when I went for my walk.  </P> <P> "The change was gradual. My caddy has been with me 8 years and when I  practiced, he would measure off the distance I hit with each club. But, I could  tell by the way I felt that I was hitting the ball better."  </P> <P> By late summer, Elder was playing regularly again and challenged in a couple of  tournaments.  </P> <P> "I would have felt good if I never shot better than 80," he said. "It was  wonderful just competing again. It was a real bonus when I won the tournament."  </P> <P> The victory put Elder in select company. He is one of nine pros to win $1  million on the Regular PGA tour and also on the Senior tour.  </P> <P> Elder was the first black golfer to play in the Masters. He was the first to  make the Ryder Cup team, and the first to win a million on each tour. But he  doesn't consider himself a pioneer.  </P> <P> "Oh, no," he said. "I had it easy. Charlie Sifford, Pete Brown and Rafe Botts.  They took most of the knocks. They did the fighting. They were the ones not  allowed to even dress in the clubhouse. I experienced some things, but it keeps  getting better. I'm just trying to make it easier for those who will come along  after me.  </P> <P> "The worst experience was at the Masters in 1975. I was always on stage.  Everybody wanted to know how it felt. And some wondered, 'Is he a gentleman?' I  was a little bit better than the caddies.  </P> <P> "In the week we (his wife Rose) were at the Masters, we had to change houses  four times. The pressure was unfair. I couldn't think about golf. It was the  first time I was ever happy to miss the cut. The next year Calvin Peete was  there, too, so it was nothing."  </P> <P> All the problems in a pro career that began 30 years ago don't seem too  important since the heart attack.  </P> <P> "The Lord gave me a second chance and I'm not going to get upset about  anything," Elder said. "Maybe, I do have one little goal. I want to outdrive  those guys again. Maybe this is the week I'll do it."  </P></p>

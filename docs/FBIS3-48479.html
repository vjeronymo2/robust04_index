Terrifying Resemblance Between Early  Showa and Early Heisei    In retrospect, the Fifth Year of Heisei [1993] paralleled  the  5th Year of Showa [1930], the year of the "Showa Depression", in  so many ways. The year 1993 coincides strikingly with the year  1930: The aggravation of a deflationary recession under the  sluggish world economy, a belt-tightening economic policy which  has enhanced such deterioration, a worsening domestic  agricultural situation, increasing criticism of the government's  handling of international negotiations, and so on.    Furthermore, the economy in the first five years of the  Showa  period [1926-1989] was in a period of deflation in which the  price level dropped approximately 50 percent. In comparison,  Japan was hit by "asset deflation" in which stock and land  prices dropped by about half in the first five years of the  Heisei period [1989].    The difference between the Heisei and the Showa is that  stocking of the economy has progressed in the Heisei period as  the accumulation of assets has proceeded. It is not difficult  to imagine, therefore, that the current sharp decline in asset  values has had an extremely serious effect on the overall  economy.  <H3>  Mistakes by Policymaking Bodies has Lead the Economy Into a  Bottomless Pit </H3>   As the deflationary recession of the Showa period came from  outside Japan, so did the beginning of the Heisei's asset  deflation. Its origin can be traced back to Black Monday in 1987  in the United States, and more recently, to the collapse of  Eastern Europe in 1989 (the first year of Heisei). In  particular, worldwide monetary tightening was caused by a major  change in the flow of world funds because the former West  Germany had to financially support the collapsed former East  Germany.    As a result, the stock and real estate markets of Western  nations, which are sensitive to interest rates, were hit  directly and almost without exception, and stock and land prices  dropped steeply. It was only a matter of time before the  effects were felt in Japan.    Along with such external factors, there was the domestic  "policy slump" factor behind recession in Japan. That is, when  asset deflation had become serious due to the collapse of stock  and land prices in Europe and the United States in the beginning  of the 1990's, Japan, without considering the international  situation, exercised excessive monetary restraint out of fear of  domestic inflation.    In fact, this "misgovernment factor" is another echo of the  Showa Depression. At that time the government adopted an  austerity policy to deal with the anticipated impact in Japan of  the Great Depression. In particular, the lifting of the gold  embargo at the old parity rate is well known to have aggravated  domestic deflation.    Unfortunately, present-day policymakers lacked a global  point  of view and carried out over-regulated loan restriction and a  strengthening of the tax system to "break the bubble economy"  domestically. As a result, asset markets, including the land  market, became inactive. Above all, the impact of quantitative  regulation of loans for real estate, and the strengthening of  taxes on real estate through the administrative guidance of the  Bank of Japan [BOJ] and the Ministry of Finance was extremely  large. This can be said to be the biggest cause of the Japanese  economy being driven into a bottomless recession.    Since then, regulations and taxes for land have not really  changed, except for a perfunctory relaxation of monetary  conditions. Partly as a result of that, as you can see in Table  1, there is as yet no indication of land prices ceasing to fall  in metropolitan areas, and the rate of decline is growing in  local areas. Besides, as there is no trade in the market, real  prices are definitely lower than those shown in the table.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1 The Rate of Fluctuations in Land Prices: 1993                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Area                     |Commercial Land          |Residential Land         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tokyo Area               |-20.5 (-12)              |-12.3 (-12.7)            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Osaka Area               |-21.4 (-23.1)            |-12.1 (-22.8)            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Nagoya Area              |-12.6 (-12.0)            |-7.6 (-7.8)              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Local Areas              |-3.0 (-1.0)              |-0.7 (0.3)               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Notes: 1.

In particular, the following are emerging as  the characteristics of Japanese-type depression caused by asset  deflation.  <H5>  (1) Financial Crisis Is Progressing </H5>   Because asset deflation occurred rapidly, almost all large  real estate loans became nonperforming loans, and the balance  sheets of financial institutions were seriously undermined. The  total amount of bad loans in the widest sense, including loans  where the market value of the collateral is now less than the  value of the loan, is said to be 100 trillion yen. In  particular, most of the weaker small and medium financial  institutions have virtually failed, and there was even a case of  a run on a regional bank due to the large withdrawal of  deposits. Currently, regional shinkin banks [credit unions] and  credit cooperatives are undergoing reorganization and  consolidation. In the circumstances, the financial intermediary  function of the private sector has almost come to a halt, and  private lending has increased little.  <H5>  (2) Frequent Occurrence of Business Failures </H5>   Most corporations, including Japan's leading big businesses,  lost their latent assets, and are now suffering from the weight  of liabilities. In particular, "enterprises of good standing"  that had carried out aggressive, growth-oriented management in  the past are more likely to be practically bankrupted because  their liabilities exceed their assets. Instances of listed  major enterprises going into bankruptcy have begun to appear,  and it has been predicted that there might well be between 20  and 30 cases of large-scale bankruptcy. Also, many small and  medium companies that have been raising funds by offering assets  such as land as security are now deadlocked in terms of both  finance and business, and small-scale bankruptcies are rapidly  increasing.  <H5>  (3) Era of Mass Dismissals Begins </H5>   The number of unemployed has already reached 2 million, and  there are estimated to be a further 3 million who are employed  but have no real job to do. Companies have begun to cut such  surplus workers. Although companies have to cut staff costs if  they are to survive, it is difficult to cut wages and bonuses  uniformly. As the number of jobs drops, the number of surplus  staff within companies is increasing. Therefore, there is no  alternative to cutting surplus workers at the moment. The  unemployment rate will sharply rise to the Western levels, and  the ratio of job openings to job seekers will keep on dropping.  <H5>  (4) Vicious Cycle of Price Destruction Continues </H5>   As the "price destruction" of assets occurred, with stock  and  land prices dropping by half from their peaks, sharp reductions  in price have now become a matter of course in all sectors. To  the detriment of below-cost prices, bargain sales are being held  to recover funds, and this initiates the price destruction  effect. This will lead to a further cut in costs, bringing  employment adjustment, wage cuts, and investment restraint.  Those firms that cannot handle the process will go bankrupt.  Also, there will be price destruction from the demand side too  as the buying strength and intentions of individuals and  companies contracts. The liquidation of assets to cover  ordinary losses triggers a further decline in stock and land  prices, and everything contributes to drag deflation down  further.    In addition to the impact of the above discussed process,  which accelerates in a vicious cycle, the economy seems to be  driven to a state of depression influenced by confusion in  politics over "the issue of liberalizing rice imports" and "the  political reform issue".    Therefore, if what is happening from 1993 to 1994 were  videotaped and played back in the "fast play mode", one would  see that a depression, which is what happened in the early Showa  period, is underway at the moment.  <H5>  Will There Be `Sudden Death'? </H5>   Why, then, is the "Heisei Depression" emerging at such a  slow  pace?    The first reason is that corporations and banks which gained  strength by accumulating assets continue to support their  "keiretsu" companies and business connections without disclosing  that the firms have in effect failed. In particular, a problem  company which has collateral now worth less than its loan, and  where the relation of rights to that collateral have become  complicated, cannot be easily closed down, especially if it is a  large-scale business. In other words, "an attempt to solve the  issue is deferred by sharing the burden", and it requires time  to solve the problem.    Secondly, there is the underlying support of enormous public  funds. Over the past two years, expenditure of 30 trillion yen  in projects has been made, and this public finance has been  distributed mainly in housing and among small and medium  business. In particular, lending through the Housing Loan  Corporation generates housing demand among the primary  acquisition class, which was affected little by asset deflation,  and works to keep the bottomless fall of the economy from coming  to light.    However, it is doubtful that this support will last much  longer. Even powerful corporations and banks are losing their  own latent assets due to the influence of the deflationary  recession, and it has, therefore, become difficult for them to  support companies in trouble any longer. Also, there is a  growing resistance to the further expansion of public support  measures because the steep decline in tax revenue is directly  hitting the government.    Furthermore, demand for housing cannot be expected to  increase any further if the influence of unemployment and  bankruptcies is going to reach white-collar workers as the  recession worsens.    If existing support is cut and the underpinnings of the  economy are lost, problems will rise to the surface at once. In  that case, there would be a danger of "sudden death" depression  in Japan, accompanied, typically, by panic.    How can we tell, then, if "sudden death" will come, or the  "state of coma" will continue with the economy remaining  sluggish, or if there is going to be a sign of recovery in the  future?    The answer cannot be found, as before, by using the real  growth rate as the economic indicator, and interest rates and  spending as the policymaking indicators. Rather, nominal growth  rate, price trends, and trends in land and stock prices are more  important. In other words, one must pay attention to the  nominal rate of deflation, not the real rate.    The reason is that if general prices and stock and land  prices keep declining in nominal terms, the weight of  liabilities will become unbearable sooner or later, but if such  prices start to rise, then the burden of liabilities becomes  lighter.    As the rate of deflation increases, the burden of real  interest rates becomes heavier, and vice versa. In other words,  whether the deflation becomes worse, stops, or turns in the  direction of inflation is the biggest factor in predicting  whether the future economy suffers a "sudden death" depression,  becomes "a vegetable", or shows signs of recovery.    The reason the traditional economic forecast model was not  able to predict the current deep recession is because it only  focused on analysis income or profit and loss, and ignored  changes in assets or balance sheets. The model also looked only  at real growth rate as the key economic indicator, and it saw  prices only as a measure of inflation.  <H5>  The Lessons To Be Learned From Our History and From Abroad </H5>   In the Sixth Year of Showa (1931), the second year of the  Showa Depression, the recession became more serious both at home  and abroad. Unemployment increased rapidly in the cities, and  rural communities became more impoverished. Social unrest and  discontent were on the rise. In September of the same year, the  Manchurian Incident broke out. The world was plunged into an  uproar, and social confusion reached new heights. Meanwhile,  criticism of the Minseito [Constitutional Democratic Party]  cabinet, which persisted with its policy of austerity and  lifting the gold embargo, became so strong that it ultimately  led to the mass resignation of the cabinet in December. Its  successor cabinet, led by Tsuyoshi Inukai of Seiyukai [Friends  of the Constitutional Government Party], immediately announced  the end of the gold standard system, began a positive financial  policy, and avoided economic catastrophe through special loans  from the BOJ.    Will the Sixth Year of Heisei (1994) follow the pattern of  the Sixth Year of Showa, which became a historical turning  point? Will the "Heisei Depression" last another year? Does  the government have to be changed to achieve a change in policy?  On monetary policy, will special lending be delayed until the  change in BOJ governor planned for December 1994?    At any rate, the policies needed to stop further deflation  and avoid the "sudden death" depression have become clear, and a  consensus has already formed in the market. They include the  following "three measures" which highlight the liquidation of  land. Most of the measures are already recognized by the market.  <H5>  1. Income Tax Cuts Totaling More Than 10 Trillion Yen </H5>   The implementation of large-scale income tax reduction, not  as tax reform accompanied by a tax increase but as an economic  stimulus measure financed by the issue of deficit-covering  bonds. Tax cuts of 5 to 6 trillion yen have already been  discounted, and cuts of more than 10 trillion yen is expected.  <H5>  2. Sharp Reduction in Official Discount Rate </H5>   Since prices are declining due to deflation, nominal  interest  rates must be lowered as close as possible to zero. What is  needed, to begin with, is a sharp cut in the official discount  rate to less than 1 percent, and measures to aggressively  increase the money supply.  <H5>  3. Liquidating Land and Measures for Bad Loans </H5>   The write-off of bad loans by financial institutions should  be accelerated by encouraging transaction in land through the  use of public funds, along with a relaxation of the controls and  tax systems related to land. In such a case, it is necessary to  reorganize small and medium financial institutions which are  close to failure through the issue of special BOJ loans.    In this respect, the way U.S. savings and loan associations  were consolidated, or the "life boat plan" in which British  nonbanking financial institutions were reorganized are both  noteworthy. In particular, the way the U.S. RTC (Resolution  Trust Corporation) solved the issue of bad loans by seizing and  liquidating the assets of failed savings and loan associations,  can be considered a good example of how to solve the problems  Japan is now facing.    If the government is going to adopt such measures to stop  the  deflation of assets, depression can be avoided, the decline in  land prices will stop, and there will be the possibility of  signs of future recovery.    Faced with the first deep recession since the war, the  common  sense and experience which have held true only within postwar  Japan have lost their validity. Whether we can learn from our  own history and from international experience is the question  now.</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Special Report On Residential Property (7): Devon's cream on sale at a reduced price - From cottage to estate this is a good time to buy in wild and beautiful Devon DEVON is a county that rewards exploration on foot or on horseback; its lanes, fashioned more for cart than for BMW, are ill-suited to cope with the 3.5m tourists who migrate there each year. The county's coastline reflects a relentless, losing battle with the Atlantic and the English Channel; ghostly remains of the fishing village of Hallsands, near Salcombe, are testament to the unequal struggle. Inland, above the fertile and tranquil river valleys, two features dominate the county: Dartmoor, 365 square miles of ancient granite and gentler Exmoor, 265 square miles with three 'turrets', Withypool Common, Winsford Hill and Exmoor Forest. It can be wet on Dartmoor: 100 inches of rain a year, more than three times more than on the south coast. Exmoor usually has a more benign climate, although a freak storm in 1952 caused the devastating flood in Lynmouth, killing 31 people and destroying 100 houses and 28 bridges. Lovers of these great national parks ride or stride across them. The really adventurous journey round the entire boundary, earning the title 'bounders'  -not a task for the faint-hearted. The decline of mining has left tourism and agriculture as the county's main sources of income. Visitors spent Pounds 813m in Devon last year. The journey by road and rail is fast and easy; you really know the holiday has started when the train thunders alongside the beach at Dawlish, 'birthplace' of Nicholas Nickleby and favourite holiday spot of Jane Austen. For many, the call of the west gets louder with each passing holiday; soon local estate agents will be bracing themselves for this year's round of 'agent-baiting' - people, bored with the beach, who are 'thinking of buying a holiday home'. This year they will benefit from prices that have fallen by as much as 45 per cent from the highs of four years ago. There is now something for most pockets but the stuff of dreams does not come cheap. The county has more than its share of retired people, many of whom choose a cob cottage with a thatched roof and a stone plinth - 'a good hat and a good pair of shoes', as the locals would say. At the last count 22.6 per cent of Devon's population was above retirement age, compared with the UK average of 18.4 per cent. The figure would be higher if Plymouth were discounted; a quarter of the population lives there. At the last census in 1981 the number of second homes owned in Devon was 4,647, a rise of about 1,200 on the previous decade; and the number of holiday letting units was 8,171. These figures rose sharply in the boom years of the 1980s but it will be a few months before the exact number is published in the new survey. Devon is the third largest county in the UK. Its property opportunities are many and varied. But all categories have suffered in the recession. Tim Burrage, of Stags, reports a quickening of the market after a quiet winter, although most interest was for town property. 'The country property market does not get into full swing until the early summer; but the market is likely to remain sluggish until we have some encouraging economic news and an end to forced sales and repossessions,' he says. Curiously, falling house prices in counties closer to London have damaged house sellers' prospects of achieving good prices in Devon. James Wilson, of Wilson and Wilson, a company that specialises in finding property, says: 'Buyers who hitherto looked at Devon can now afford to buy in places that were formerly out of reach - counties such as Dorset, Hampshire and Gloucestershire.' However there are signs of life in the Devon housing market. Neil McClintock, of Gribble Booth and Taylor, reports a 'storming start' to the year, particularly at the lower end; and Andrew Viner, of Viner Carew, has also seen an increase in inquiries and viewings, although most sales are still to first-time buyers. Hambro Countrywide also reports an increase in activity. According to West Country House Search, based in Sherborne, the past 12 months alone has a seen a fall in prices of around 25 per cent; it is, says the company, a good time to seek out that holiday or retirement home. For those keen on equestrinism therer are many tempting properties on Dartmoor and Exmoor. Millerson, a new company formed by Geofrey Miller after his own Cornwall company was absorbed into Hambro, specialises in property on Dartmoor and by the Tamar, the river that separates Cornwall from Devon and the rest of England. He showed me a farm house with 19 acres close to Lifton, nine miles from Tavistock, with views that would have been amazing had the previous owner not erected an ugly (and definitely removable) modern barn. There were also some fine traditional stone outbuildings; offers around Pounds 300,000 were sought last year but a more realistic 'over Pounds 200,000' is now suggested. Millerson also handles Marystow Cottage, near Chillaton, a bright modern home built on the site of a cottage that was destroyed by fire. Again the views would make a city stockbroker's heart stop, and equestrians will drool at the traffic-free lanes and bridleways that abound there. The price guide is Pounds 235,000 but, as with all Devon property now, try an offer. Stags, which has a wide range of property from little cottages, such as one for Pounds 45,000 at Halberton, near Tiverton, up to large estates, has several interesting equestrian properties; not least is Weatherham Farm, close to Dulverton, on the Devon/Somerset borders. Again some work is required, but with 13 acres, outbuildings and an annex this house, with its access to Exmoor and unlimited riding, will not stay long on the market. A price guide of Pounds 230,000 is given. Several of the properties had that essential feature - a trout stream. Typical of the Devon house is Lower Northcott Farm, thatched, with 12 acres close to Cullompton. A price of Pounds 320,000 is sought. My choice for star billing was a magnificent 14th century house three miles from Dulverton, perfect except for some rather modern roof tiles; it has 14 acres on the very edge of Exmoor and a price of more than Pounds 400,000 is sought. Strutt and Parker has just sold two cottages, one buyer believing that the market had reached its lowest point; he intends to let the property for two years after which he will retire there. Dunsford Mill, at West Anstey, on the southern fringe of Exmoor, with 29 acres and a barn with planning consent, had a price guide of Pounds 200,000. Cubby Close, a Grade II cottage on a long National Trust lease, in the Culm Valley, had been offered for about Pounds 135,000. There is everything the rider (or walker) could desire at Rudge Farm, at Lustleigh, including direct access to the moor at Lustleigh Cleave. The early 19th century house also has that other essential - a cellar. There are 20 acres, with indoor and outdoor schools, stables, outbuildings, a coach house and thatched bothy. Knight Frank and Rutley suggests Pounds 325,000. If you tire of mucking out and yearn for harbour views, with no garden to worry about, there is Harbour Side, a charming little cottage in Hope Cove, near Kingsbridge. Marchand Petit recently reduced the price of this little two-bedroom bolt-to Pounds 85,000.</p>

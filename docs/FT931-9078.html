			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Shaw rebels win appointments REBEL shareholders won the day at yesterday's EGM of Arthur Shaw, the loss-making West Midlands building materials group. They ousted chairman Mr Gordon Pearson and appointed Mr Ian Tickler and Mr Donald Crammond to the board. Dissident shareholders, led by Mr Tickler, had expressed concern over the management and recent performance of the company, and feared that the business was losing direction. They claimed that high gearing and deteriorating performance were mainly attributable to the costs of acquiring the Jackdaw engineering tools group in 1990. Mr Tickler and his family argued that Jackdaw should be sold to reduce debt of about Pounds 3.35m and that the group should refocus on its core window hardware side. The dissident shareholders requisitioned the EGM to propose Mr Pearson's removal from the board and the reappointment of Mr Tickler. They also called for the reappointment of Mr Crammond, who was ousted at the AGM last August. Following the meeting, Mr Tickler said that he and Mr Crammond were delighted that shareholders had demonstrated support for their future strategy of Arthur Shaw. He said the new board intended to appoint an additional director as non-executive chairman to oversee the implementation of this strategy. A suitable candidate with appropriate experience and expertise had been identified and Mr Tickler anticipated that a further announcement would be made shortly.</p>

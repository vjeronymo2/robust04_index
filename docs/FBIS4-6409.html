			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 17 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata, a front-runner to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, said Sunday [17 April] that he will formally express  his decision after ruling coalition partners fine-tune their  policies and pick him to run in the race for premier.    Hata, head of the coalition's core party Shinseito (Japan  Renewal Party), made the remarks to reporters on a plane while  returning to Japan from Marrakech, Morocco.    Hata was in Morocco to attend a four-day ministerial meeting  of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) member nations  to sign the final agreement of the Uruguay Round of multilateral  trade talks.    Regarding prospects that the coalition parties will endorse  him as a replacement to Hosokawa, Hata, who is also deputy  premier, declined to directly express any intention to be a  candidate, only saying, "I will hear the views of other  (coalition) partners...I'm not in a position to speak about  specific matters."    On changing the framework of the current coalition, Hata  said, "There are many moves within the (primary opposition)  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). A big move has not yet emerged.  It will get clearer from tomorrow on what kind of framework  (we) will establish."    The remark was apparently in reference to former Foreign  Minister Michio Watanabe, an LDP veteran, who is eyeing forming  ties with coalition parties, possibly Shinseito and Komeito, the  alliance's other key party, to achieve his ambition of  succeeding Hosokawa, political sources said.    The present seven-party coalition is made up of parties  ranging from socialists to conservatives.    "In order to employ politics with responsibility, it is  desirable that a force or a framework be formed capable of  rivaling the LDP," Hata said.    Hata hinted at a possible tie-up with Watanabe, who has  expressed his readiness to run for the upcoming Diet vote for  the premiership to replace Hosokawa. Hosokawa announced his  resignation on April 8 over questions regarding his personal  finances.    Watanabe said Sunday he will leave the party to run in the  prime ministerial election.    Hata told reporters at Tokyo's Haneda airport, "I would like  to respect his determination. He is fit to be leader."    Five ruling coalition parties Monday are expected to  fine-tune agreement on such key policies as tax reform and their  stance on North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development  program.    The meeting will precede coalition leaders' talks on  cementing the accords and then picking a successor to Hosokawa.</p>

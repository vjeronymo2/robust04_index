			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with V. Medvedev, president of Rosavtotrans, by </F> M. Yevsyukov, deputy chief editor of AVTOMOBILNYY TRANSPORT;  date and place not given: "Our Task is to Protect the Interests  of the Founders (A conversation with the president of the  Russian motor transport joint-stock company `Rosavtotrans')"]    [Text] At the threshold of the new year the editorial staff  of AVTOMOBILNYY TRANSPORT has applied to the president of the  "Rosavtotrans" company, V. Medvedev, with a request to tell  about its work and its prospects. We report his conversation  with M. Yevsyukov, deputy chief editor.    [Yevsyukov] Vasiliy Dmitriyevich, there is now in principle  no division whatever, at least officially, of motor transport  into general-use and departmental transport, although the tasks  and the work which general-use motor transport performed have  remained. You won't get away from them under any privatization,  setting-up of joint-stock companies, etc. By the way, all this  was intended precisely to improve the work of motor transport in  servicing the top priority needs of society. However, as yet all  has not gone well with this.    The Russian motor transport joint-stock company  "Rosavtotrans" has now been created and is in operation. Please  tell us about its work, functions, and tasks.    [Medvedev] Let's begin with the fact that "Rosavtotrans" has  been created on a strictly voluntary basis. It doesn't perform  any state functions and commissions whatsoever. Territorial  joint-stock companies, which basically all general-use motor  transport enterprises have become members of, have created it.  The tasks and functions of the company are defined by its  charter. What functions would I call the most important?    At the present stage the most important function, in my  opinion, is to protect the interests of the possessors of  general-use motor transport in the structures of state power.  This is against the ministries of transportation, finance,  economics, and defense (many of our enterprises are rather  firmly connected with that ministry) and with other state power  structures where general-use motor transport has interests.    The next basic functions are the questions of the  material-technical support of our enterprises and the  coordination of their work. This is the basic group of questions  on which our company must work.    We don't have at our disposal any official powers whatsoever  with respect to the territorial associations and enterprises  that are the founding members. We perform only that volume of  work and only those functions which the founders have entrusted  to us. That is, both planning and the work itself goes from the  bottom to the top.    What now are the main problems today and what are the ways  of  resolving them? One of the main problems is the presently  inadequately developed system for the realization through our  company of the interests of the founders in the state power  structures. Old approaches frequently prevail in these  structures, including the Russian Federation Ministry of  Transportation. They think there that their decisions are, as it  is said, final and irrevocable and all these decisions must be  unhesitatingly implemented in the localities.    [Yevsyukov] And what, this is wrong? In my opinion that's  the  way it should be. All decisions should be implemented; only then  will there be order.    [Medvedev] All that is true, but I don't want to talk about  that. You see the whole point is how these normative documents  and legislative acts are to be prepared. As I have already said,  our company has not been endowed with any official functions  relative to motor transport structures in the localities but  must protect their interests. But how is this to be done?  Primarily through tracking, monitoring, and participation in the  development of all normative documents. However, we all have  come out of a single power structure--the Russian Ministry of  Motor Vehicle Transport. In its time it was entrusted with both  official functions and protection of the interests of the  enterprises. We're all from there: both the workers of the  Ministry of Transportation, the Department of Motor Vehicle  Transport, and our company. That is why there remains a  psychological inertia among executives and a command style of  work survives. Of course they ought to constantly bring us in  and we should find the time and the opportunities to participate  in the development of all normative documents. However, it  doesn't always turn out that way. Frequently the workers of the  Department and the Ministry of Transportation think that they  know everything without us. This applies to document  elaborations, the distribution of budget resources, and other  questions. And we, probably, don't announce ourselves loudly and  persistently enough. But nevertheless a reciprocal "rubbing"  takes place. I think that not much time will be needed for  mutual recognition and mutual understanding to be established.  Otherwise neither the ministry nor we will be able to operate.    The second main direction of our activity, as I have already  said, is the work regarding the material-technical support of  the company's enterprises. One cannot assume that each of the  company's 2,200 enterprises will be able to completely resolve  independently all the questions of material-technical support.  Today already about 60 percent of these enterprises have been  privatized and the remainder are in the stage of becoming  joint-stock companies. Delays are occurring because there are  complications with the privatization of the numbered vehicle  convoys.    [Yevsyukov] Incidentally, about the privatization of these  convoys. Has the Russian Government's decree on this question  finally been issued?    [Medvedev] As yet there is no such decree. Its draft has  long  since been prepared by the Ministry of Transportation with the  direct participation of the "Rosavtotrans" company and been  endorsed by the Ministry of Defense. However, it hasn't been  signed as yet.    [Yevsyukov] But the fact is that there already was a  decision  of the State Committee on the Administration of State Property  regarding this question, where everything was specified already.  Only a decision of the government was needed. Why is it being  obstructed?    [Medvedev] Both the interests of the state and of our  vehicle  convoys should be provided for in the government's decree. But  the decision of the Russian Federation State Committee on the  Administration of State Property is one-sided. Only what the  vehicle convoy should do and how it should answer to the state  for the performance of mobilization functions is stipulated  there. But what the state should do to ensure the performance of  these functions is not indicated there. And if it is not the  system will not work. The fact is that today, given such  extremely high prices and the size of interest rates on bank  loans (210 percent and more), it is practically impossible to  acquire the motor vehicles needed to perform mobilization  functions.    That is why the state should stipulate its own obligations  to  the vehicle convoys in the decree. These are both preferential  financing and tax abatements and a number of other questions  which would contribute to ensuring the mobilization readiness of  the vehicle convoys. So that the question of the privatization  of numbered vehicle convoys is very difficult and it is  precisely among that group in which the company must protect the  interests of its founders in the state power structures.    However, let's return to material-technical support. Now it  is being implemented on a fundamentally different basis. If  before we shared what the government allotted us, now there is  nothing to share. Go, come to an understanding with the  producers and suppliers, and decide all these questions. Of  course, it's difficult even to assume that every enterprise  could send specialists to solve supply questions to hundreds of  plants located in different points of the former USSR and  especially abroad. Suppose, let's assume, one is to obtain buses  at the Lvov plant or trucks in Belarus and deliver them to a  location? These are already different states. Licenses to export  motor vehicles and fuel and a great deal more of what is needed  are required.    It is precisely these functions that the "Rosavtotrans"  company will undertake. We conclude the appropriate contracts  with our founders and with suppliers and perform this work.    [Yevsyukov] And the company, I mean its staff, has something  to do with this?    [Medvedev] Questions about the upkeep of the company's  executive staff are decided by its founders. In the case in  question they have voted for the transfer to us of 2 percent for  the KamAZ group of motor vehicles and 1.2 percent of the value  of any other motor vehicles delivered. One must say that this  money is not enough even to maintain the staff. In order to make  ends meet we have to engage in other work which is not always  connected with our founding members.    We do work on material-technical support not only in Russia  and the CIS countries, but also, as they say now, with the  countries of the far abroad. In particular, today we are  resolving the question of acquiring second-hand motor buses of  the Mercedes, MAN and Magirus firms which we can operate for  three to six years. The cost of such motor buses and their  service lives correspond with the lives and cost of our new  motor buses.    [Yevsyukov] What number are we talking about?    [Medvedev] For now the number is in the tens. However, we  intend already this year (1993) to acquire 300-400 of them and  to bring the number up to 1000 in the beginning of 1994.    If we can implement these plans, we will deprive the Likino  plant of the privileges it enjoys as the monopoly producer of  urban motor buses in Russia. It constantly dictates its  conditions to us which now and then are not well-founded and  simply impracticable. By this we will force it to enter into a  competitive struggle.    [Yevsyukov] But don't you regret it? You see, when there's  no  demand for Likino motor buses, the plant may go bust and western  firms with their motor vehicles past their best will win the  Russian market. Our automobile industry will find itself in a  great state of neglect in the process and perhaps will, in  general, be overwhelmed by the West.    [Medvedev] I simply don't see other ways of restraining the  overchargings of this plant. No kind of diplomacy and logic  helps. That is why we have come to such a decision. And what  they will come to I don't know. Let them think themselves. The  market is the market. In the end we are, you see, bound to  transporting tens and hundreds of millions of passengers  everyday and we cannot wait while our motor bus producers mature  to an understanding of the necessity and extreme importance of  performing this task. There is, it is true, hope in KamAZ, which  has developed and approved a program for the production of urban  motor buses, their output to begin in 1994 and the volume of  production to be brought up to 10,000 in 1996-1997, which would  supply our needs.    [Yevsyukov] Vasiliy Dmitriyevich, you have said that one of  the main tasks of the company is the coordination of the  activity of its participants, its founders. How is this to be  done?    [Medvedev] First of all, I would like to say what is now to  be understood under the term "coordination." This is not at all  an instruction to someone to carry how much and when, to deliver  how many motor vechicles, to whom, and to where, etc. The most  important thing now is to determine conditions on the  transportation market.    Transport operations in the pure form now frequently become  disadvantageous and unprofitable. The volumes of transport  operations are shrinking rather sharply. What is a motor  transport enterprise, which has motor vehicles, a production  base, and, what is the main thing, people to do under these  conditions? If it is to do nothing and to guess when transport  operations will develop, then it can collapse completely. And  meanwhile during the last two years the volume of transport  operations has shrunk almost in half in connection with the  reduction in the volumes of industrial production and  construction. This means that one has to reorganize one's work.    We have for a long time already and at all levels talked  about the need for a drastic increase in the volumes of  transport and dispatching work. But until now these were  basically appeals and declarations. This work was perceived as  unnecessary trouble by the transport workers on the spot. There  were cargoes, there were orders, and there was no point in  engaging in such turbulent business as dispatching. Now life is  developing so that if one is not closely and seriously engaged  in transport dispatching, then the existence and survival of  general-use motor transport will be under great question.    It needs to be said that this business is indeed profitable  and promising. One needs simply to investigate it carefully as  one should, comprehend, and, finally, to master oneself. One  needs to change priorities. Of course, this is not so simple,  but it must be done. And some, although so far not so many of  them, are beginning to engage in this work in real earnest. It  needs to be said that satisfactory results are being obtained.  For example, in Sergiyev Posad the former Zagorsk vehicle convoy  has built a small terminal and the enterprise has 17 percent of  the total revenue from it. And only 15-17 persons (not counting  the drivers of international hauls) of the more than 1,500  persons employed work at this terminal. Now the decrease in the  volume of transport operations for this motor transport  enterprise is not extreme. It is able to increase the volumes of  transport and dispatching services and to live normally and  develop.    That is why we are thinking of examining questions of the  reorientation of the direction of the work of freight transport  at the company's council of directors at the end of 1993. And  generally speaking, one needs to anticipate by several steps the  implementation of the policy and tactics of the work of the  company's enterprises. Now, as I have already said, the volumes  of transport operations are falling. What's the use if we only  ascertain this? One needs to find, and quickly besides, ways out  of the situation that has been created. We have a powerful  production base. It must be utilized efficiently, precisely in  those directions which are the most effective from the viewpoint  of the organization of the transportation process and the  survival of the motor transport enterprises.    Finally, I want to say that we, in any case very many, have  retained a great deal of inertia both in thought and in actions.  Because of that, under present conditions a great deal of work  and significant efforts and expenditures of resources are to no  purpose and futile and yield only losses. On the other hand,  inertia is manifested in inaction and the anticipation of  edicts, recommendations and help from above. One needs to get  free of this. One needs to understand once and for all that if  we won't take care of ourselves, no one will do it. One can make  a fuss, complain, and appeal to all levels of authority as much  as one wants. But it will be the same as appeals to God. Pray as  much as you want, but in order for there to be some results, one  needs to use one's head, hands, and often even feet, by oneself.  As the saying goes, "God is God, and you're not bad either."    Of course, the government will give us concrete assistance.  It is even now giving it in the area of passenger transport  operations. But such help, I think, will not be increased and  will be reduced or transferred to local budgets in due course.  That is why I emphasize again that all the structures of the  "Rosavtotrans" company, especially the regional ones, need to  foresee events and work with anticipation.    [Yevsyukov] But can the company implement large-scale  regional or interregional projects? Is there some kind of  centralized fund for this?    [Medvedev] We don't have any such funds at our disposal.  Only  the founders themselves can create such a fund. It could be at  the disposal of the company, which the founders constantly  monitor. But as yet we don't have such a fund. This, of course,  does not mean that it is not needed; the financial resources  needed for this simply don't exist. As it is said, who would  give us credit and we, for now, aren't able to give credit to  anybody. Today the financial status of our motor transport  enterprises is such that they find money for wages and fuel with  difficulty. However, such a fund is extremely necessary and, I  think, the company will create it in due course. But we hope  that the state also will not turn its back on our problems. We  will try not to allow this.    It is very fashionable now to allude to foreign experience,  to the achievement of a market economy. But I would like to  emphasize that in all countries the comprehensive transport and  dispatching servicing of the population and of enterprises is  always under the control and protection of the state and the  government. That is why terminal servicing systems are highly  developed there. This enhances a country's economy as a whole,  and reduces enormous losses of state resources for  transportation costs in the national economy.    [Yevsyukov] Vasiliy Dmitriyevich, you talked about the  Zagorsk motor transport enterprise. Incidentally, we also wrote  about it in our magazine (AVTOMOBILNYY TRANSPORT, No 2, 1993.  "`SPAK' Goes Abroad"). Are there many such enterprises in the  company?    [Medvedev] There has been some animation during the past two  years but I regard this as no more than animation. There are  individual enterprises where leaders with initiative have been  engaged in this business, but no more than that.    [Yevsyukov] In short, these are individual episodes and not  an overall trend?    [Medvedev] Yes, one can say that roughly. Of course, one  cannot expect that in the very near future all enterprises may  take such a path. However, in the European part of Russia, in  the Far East, and even in the Urals (for example, Chelyabinsk)  such work is proceeding rather actively. But in many oblasts as  yet a "stirring-up," as they say, is going on.    [Yevsyukov] How do you see the prospects for the development  of general-use motor transport in 1994?    [Medvedev] Unfortunately, I can say nothing about an  increase  in the volumes of freight hauls. Here, as I have already said,  we need to earnestly reorient ourselves to transport dispatching  so as not to lose our production potential and not to allow a  reduction of the specialists and workers we employ.    Our other task is not to lose the ability to manage the  sector (upravlyayemost otrasli). This is not only an important  production factor but also a psychological one. When we talk  about the ability to manage, then right away we recall  collegiums, all kinds of meetings, conferences, aktivs, etc.  However, the fact is that one should not consider the ability to  manage only from the viewpoint of dressing-downs, reprimands,  etc. Under present conditions the ability to manage is necessary  in the interests of realizing the goals both of society as a  whole and of the company and each of its founders. There is a  host of such problems which cannot be resolved one by one. Take  the gathering of the harvest. Society now incurs a great deal of  losses and waste because of the poor ability to manage motor  transport in these operations.    We intend to work on these questions in the coming year.    In the name of the workers of "Rosavtotrans" I would like to  wish all motorists of Russia and all readers of the magazine a  happy New Year and to wish them good health, success and  personal happiness.    [Yevsukov] Thank you, Vasiliy Dmitriyevich. The editorial  staff heartily joins you and on its part sends wishes for health  and success to all workers of the "Rosavtotrans" company.

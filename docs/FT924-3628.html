			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Clarke faces questions on Clinton probe MR TONY BLAIR, shadow home secretary, asked Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, yesterday why officials in Whitehall had made a search to see if files had been kept on US president-elect Mr Bill Clinton when he was a student at Oxford University in the 1960s. It emerged yesterday that officials had checked Home Office archives during this year's US election campaign to see if Mr Clinton had applied for UK citizenship during the Vietnam war. He was accused during the campaign of having tried to avoid military service in Vietnam. Mr David Winnick, Labour MP for Walsall North, said Mr Clarke should state on whose authority the files were searched. 'This may have been carried out by officials, but it can only have been done on the instructions of ministers,' he added. Labour MPs are likely to raise the files issue in parliament today - possibly when Mr Clarke gives evidence to a Commons committee. The Home Office said it does not comment on individual cases, but officials said privately that during the US election there were many inquiries from journalists about whether Mr Clinton had applied for UK citizenship to help him avoid the draft. In order to forestall false accounts in the media, the department had looked at the indexes of files to see if Mr Clinton's name appeared. It did not. Two Conservative officials - Mr John Lacy and Mr Mark Fulbrook - helped in the campaign of Mr Clinton's rival, President George Bush. They were in Mr Major's general-election team in April and gave a seminar to the Bush campaign on how the prime minister overturned Labour's opinion poll lead, largely by negative campaigning. Conservative Central Office said that there was no question of the two acting as advisers. The disclosure about the search brought fresh allegations that the government had mixed party and official duties. It came as 10 Downing Street was forced to deny that Mr John Major had been snubbed by being refused a meeting later this month with Mr Clinton. Officials in London and Washington denied reports of a rift between Mr Major and Mr Clinton. Last night Mr Clinton emphasised in a telexed message to 10 Downing Street the importance of the 'historic and special relationship' with the UK. He said he would be unable to meet Mr Major before his inauguration in January, but would be available for discussions by telephone. Downing Street said Mr Clinton was compiling his administration before taking office in January and was not meeting heads of government. The main purpose of Mr Major's trip to the US in two weeks is for a US-European Community summit, Downing Street said. Mr Major hopes to meet Mr Clinton in the new year.</p>

			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: Inco cuts pay-out to 10 cents THE sliding price of nickel has led Inco, the western world's largest producer, to slash its dividend by more than half, despite reporting higher third-quarter earnings. Inco said yesterday that it had cut its dividend from 25 US cents to 10 cents. The Toronto-based company has already announced production cuts and other austerity measures, and said yesterday that additional steps may be taken. Third-quarter earnings rose to USDollars 10.6m, or 9 cents a share, from Dollars 4.5m, or 3 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues dropped to Dollars 607.4m from Dollars 663.6m. The latest figures include an Dollars 18.8m charge to cover the cost of voluntary retirements at the company's Sudbury operations in Ontario. Nickel prices realised during the third quarter slipped to Dollars 3.47 a pound from Dollars 3.90 a year earlier. But this was offset by a sharp drop in the cost of sales and operating expenses, from Dollars 560m to Dollars 488m, and a slight improvement in copper and cobalt prices. Deliveries of nickel were almost unchanged at 112m lb in the third quarter while shipments of copper rose from 40m to 44m lb. But Inco said part of the improvement in third-quarter earnings was due to higher deliveries of metal produced at its own facilities. Inco blamed a sharp rise in Russian exports and the delayed recovery in major industrial economies for the sinking nickel market. The London Metal Exchange three-month price has tumbled further since the end of the third quarter and is now only slightly above Dollars 2 per lb.</p>

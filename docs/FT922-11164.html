			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Russia faces delay in membership of IFC Early Russian membership of the International Finance Corp (IFC), the World Bank affiliate charged with promoting private-sector investment, has been thrown into doubt by problems in the US administration. Russia and the other 14 former Soviet republics have completed the formalities to become members of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But the US has so far not given the go-ahead to a limited increase in IFC capital that would allow Russia and other republics to join the affiliate. The difficulty lies in the US Congress. Russia and the republics will be able to join the World Bank as it had sufficient unallocated shares to give Russia a 2.92 per cent of World Bank capital and the former Soviet Republics, including Russia, 5.25 per cent. The IFC, however, only had about half the number of unissued shares required to make the former Soviet states into members with the same shareholdings as in the World Bank. A selective capital increase is needed to accommodate the new entrants but it is unclear whether the US, which holds 25 per cent of IFC capital and can therefore block any move to alter the corporation's shareholding, will support such a scheme. Wrangling with Congress over the US budget led to months of delay before Washington agreed last year to a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 571m) increase of IFC capital, to Dollars 2.3bn. There are hopes in Washington that the latest problem over IFC capital can be solved soon. Meanwhile, the IFC is building up its operations in the former Soviet Union by focusing on the provision of know-how. It recently won a contract to help privatise 2,000 shops in Nizhny Novgorod, formerly the Russian city of Gorky.</p>

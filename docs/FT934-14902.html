			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Observer: Change agents While small investors don't normally cause much of a stir in Zurich, a plague of them has lately rocked the city's public transit system by cleaning up profits of about 7,000 per cent on each minuscule outlay. Their bonanza began with the discovery that a Russian one rouble coin, worth about 2p, is the same size as a Swiss five franc piece, representing over Pounds 2.30. Hence by using a rouble to buy a cheap ticket from the system's vending machines, they netted change in francs worth about Pounds 1.40. Transit authority director Rolf Kunzle says the rouble trouble, which began in February, has cost the system nearly Pounds 56,000. But the machines have now been fixed to take neither five franc coins nor roubles pending development of an automatic way of discriminating between them. An added worry initially was whether the change agents were coming in from Russia or local gnomes corrupted by the massive margins. The question was resolved, however, when police arrested three Russians equipped with sacks of rouble coins and a map of the transit network.</p>

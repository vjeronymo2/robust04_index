			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Assessing 1993, Feprinco [Federation for Production,  Industry, and Trade] President Cesar Avalos, who represents  trade, yesterday said: "The state apparatus has not been  rationalized. On the contrary, there is a continuous increase  in the number of public employees while corruption and smuggling  have not been correctly controlled through strong and persistent  measures, so they prevail freely and stronger than ever."    Avalos delivered his year-end message to almost 100  businessmen. He said that since 1989, following the coup d'etat,  the country has been living an eminently political environment  with an almost total absence of an economic policy to guide the  nation. "It seems as if the natural agents -- the politicians  -- were dazed, insensible to the citizens' demands," he said.    Avalos stated, however, that the government cannot be asked  for immediate solutions to all problems affecting the country  because many are subject to factors that are not under its  control.    "We believe the government can achieve many immediate  solutions through simple political decisions that are being  unjustifiably postponed, like the privatization of state  companies, the ban on smuggling, and the eradication of  corruption in public businesses," he said.    He added that state expenditures must be rationalized, that  private economic activity must be deregulated, and that the  government must establish an honest and upright Judicial Branch.  He called for adequate legislation for employer-labor  relations, the eradication of criminal violence so as to allow  investments, a climate of security and the promotion of  industrial, agricultural, and livestock development.    Avalos said: "We must also mention the seriousness of  certain  events which are taking place in the countryside and in the  cities with increasingly frequency, which tend to aggravate and  which require the urgent attention of the national authorities."    He added: "I am talking about criminal and vandalistic  actions in addition to cattle stealing, the clandestine  occupation of land, and recently to robberies from commercial  establishments and from people."    The trade representative added that in addition to  surreptitious and covert actions, "people are being openly  incited to violence by leaders of union organizations which  should operate moderately and with the required prudence to  contribute to our social peace; not with the arrogance and  impudence to weaken it."    He added that facing this situation, Feprinco publicly  assumes the commitment of adjusting its objectives, actions, and  doctrine on norms and procedures that seek to facilitate a  peaceful coexistence among all Paraguayans in the quest for a  more just and worthy society which is more sensible to its  needs. He said he expects this attitude will be endorsed by the  national government.    Another issue that worries Feprinco and which was reflected  in the year-end message is unemployment which at this moment  reaches approximately 12 percent of the economically active  population (those older than 10 years of age who participate in  the labor market or seek employment).    He added that some 300,000 people are underemployed. This is  reflected in the landless peasants, the increase in the number  of poor people, and the massive exodus of workers to neighboring  countries.    One of the aspects considered worrisome is the continuous  increase in the economically active population. Some 50,000 new  workers annually seek work but are not absorbed by the labor  market.    Feprinco also criticized the current labor code, which in  the opinion if its leaders, is inflexible, excessively  regulatory, and contains rigid dispositions regarding the  minimum salary, job security, compensations, and a variety of  social contributions that are "almost alien" to the country's  reality.    It warned that small- and medium-sized companies, which make  up 90 percent of the productive apparatus, will be the hardest  hit and, as a result, will be adversely affected. This  situation will ultimately harm any possibility of modernizing  and restructuring local industries.    Feprinco President Cesar Avalos said: "We once again call on  legislators to consider these aspects objectively and  rationally, and urge them to design a labor code that will  encourage social and economic development instead of slowing it  down."    The Feprinco president stressed that the rate of economic  growth has decreased; during 1992 it only was 1.7 percent. He  stated that the slowdown is not purely accidental -- prompted by  adverse international prices or climatic circumstances -- but  that it is also due to structural difficulties.    He said that prospects for next year, however, look brighter  because of the recovery -- in volume and quality -- of our most  important agricultural products, which alone will not be enough  to totally alleviate the country's great needs. He estimated  that next year the GDP will grow by 3.7 percent.    The report stresses that agriculture, in spite of the low  productivity, continues to be the basic pillar of the country's  economy and is possibly the single element that might encourage  growth.    The Feprinco president believes the increase in the minimum  salary that follows a cost of living increase will not solve the  problem of the purchasing power of the workers.    According to yesterday's Feprinco year-end message: "An  increase based on that variable alone merely increases the  inflationary process, which has an immediate impact on workers'  interests."    The report adds that minimum economic stability is  absolutely  necessary to inject dynamism to the productive apparatus and to  improve productivity.    "Only then we will stop salary increases from being  incorporated into consumer prices and we will increase the  purchasing power of the workers, which is also in the best  interest of the business community" the report adds.    Feprinco recognizes that the economic situation is not good  at this time and that this can be clearly seen in the strong  deterioration of our balance of trade which this year ended with  a deficit of $500 million. The document says that the deficit  is caused by the quantity, volume, and value of our exports and  the increased volume of imported goods.    The report stresses: "Within this social and economic  picture, entrepreneurs warn of the dangers of not defining a  firm and adequate government economic policy."    In another part of the long message, the Feprinco president  warns against revoking the successful anti-inflationary  government policy. The document adds that inflation is  resurging and it is presently estimated at around 20 percent  because of the fiscal deficit.    The indications that inflation might increase in 1994 -- as  a  consequence of Central Bank short-term loans to the Finance  Ministry to cover for delays in collecting Itaipu royalties and  tax collections deficits -- is seen as quite worrisome.    The report mentions that the dollar exchange rate has passed  1,800 guaranies per dollar and continues to rise. The report  says that the reimplementation of the policy of bank discounts  to finance agriculture exports; increases in utility rates,  public transport fares, and salaries; and the imminent increase  in oil-derived gasoline prices will negatively affect the  national economic picture.    The report states that tax revenue will not cover  expenditures and so the budget includes, among its revenues,  resources from abroad in the form of loans and royalties.    The document stresses that the problem with that situation  is  that such resources are reportedly earmarked to finance "very  expensive" current expenditures instead of being used to finance  capital expenditures, when the advisable thing would be to use  that money to finance infrastructure or to promote production.    The report warns that if the Finance Ministry uses Central  Bank short-term financial credits to compensate for the  shortfall arising from uncollected and overdue Itaipu royalties  and did not repay them on time, it could create an inflationary  process.    At one point in the year-end message, the Feprinco president  stated that in spite of all its good intentions, the current  administration is discharging its duties erratically.    He said he believes the appropriate conditions for solving  the problems confronting the country go beyond achieving a mere  macroeconomic balance. He said they should seek to modernize  the agroindustrial sector and thus increase the competitiveness  of our products on the international market.    The Feprinco president contended that agricultural producers  must step up production, but to do so they need to be motivated  by good returns and receive economic and technological support.    He said: "Industrialists need government support to defend  domestic production -- not by raising protectionist barriers  that favor costly or inefficient industries, but by  strengthening nascent industries."    The Feprinco president pointed out that businessmen should  end the preferential tax treatment they receive and reduce costs  by updating their productive techniques.    With regard to the industrial fund, the Feprinco report  states that this is a long-standing demand of the sector made  through the UIP [Paraguayan Industrial Union] and Feprinco.  This project is in the initial stages and $300 million will  reportedly be received in foreign aid to fund investments and to  enlarge, complement, and streamline manufacturing industries.    The Feprinco president stated that the peasants' fund seeks,  among other things, to reduce the cost of credit intermediation  for agricultural producers who currently pay up to 90 percent in  interest rates, to organize producers into cooperatives, and to  create and strengthen intermediate rural organizations.    The Feprinco report states that although there are tax  incentives for foreign investors, risk factors cancel the  financial advantages. These risks include the lack of  macroeconomic credibility and the lack of security with regard  to respect for private property, the eradication of crime, and  an independent and efficient judicial system.</p>

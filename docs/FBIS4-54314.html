			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 26 May commentary: "Servants of Aggressors"] </F>   [Text] As is known, the South Korean puppet navy will  participate in the Rimpac joint operation -- which will be  conducted in the western waters off the Pacific from late May to  the mid-July -- by being assigned to a combined fleet of the  U.S. Navy and the Japanese self-defense navy.    Japan, since 1980, and the South Korean puppets, since 1990,  have participated in the joint military exercise, which has been  conducted every two years in the Pacific Ocean under the baton  of the United States since the early 1970's. This will be,  however, the first time the puppet South Korean Navy will  participate in the joint operation, thus being assigned to the  combined fleet of the United States and Japan.    Regarding this, an official of the Japanese Defense Agency  made it plain that the joint operation in Rimpac will be a  political message to North Korea's nuclear program. This shows  that the joint operations by the United States, Japan, and South  Korea in the Rimpac joint military exercise are a dangerous  military action directed at our Republic.    It is well-known that the Rimpac joint military exercise --  in which the United States' massive armed forces, including the  armed forces of the countries of the Asia-Pacific region that  follow the United States, will participate -- is a product of  the United States' aggressive global strategy and its ambition  to dominate the world, and that it is also the commotion of  nuclear war based on its aggressive plan to strengthen its naval  strategy and to raise the nuclear attack capability in the  Asia-Pacific region.    In particular, the United States has intended to facilitate  the formation of the U.S.-Japan-South Korea triangular military  alliance and, at the same time, to establish a collective  security system involving the whole of the Asian-Pacific region  by inveigling the South Korean puppet army and Japan into the  joint military exercise.    The U.S. hardline conservative forces are now giving impetus  to increasing military buildup and to preparing the nuclear war  under the pretext of the so-called nuclear issue, while talking  about sanctions against us. Taking advantage of this, the  Japanese reactionaries have strengthened their anti-Republic  plots by making an attempt to enact registration in preparation  for the emergency situation on the Korean peninsula.    The South Korean puppets, by being a shock brigade of the  imperialist reactionaries' commotion of nuclear pressure against  us, have babbled about the international cooperative system and  the strong steps against the North and, also, are  indiscriminately running about to commit an act of crushing  [apsal] the same fellow countrymen and to exterminate [myolsal]  the whole nation with the backing of outside forces.    Under these circumstances, the puppet South Korean navy has  planned to participate in the joint operation this time by even  joining the combined fleet of the U.S. and Japanese armed  forces. This clearly shows that the U.S.-Japan-South Korea  triangular military alliance system, which has been formed to  crush the Asian socialist countries including our country, has  entered the stage in which it is being operated practically.    The Korean peninsula is the first target in the new military  strategy of the United States, which seeks a new world order  after the end of the Cold War. Also, it is the invariable goal  pursued by the United States in its aggressive Asia-Pacific  strategy to put the Korean people on the altar of a nuclear war.    The Kim Yong-sam group is actively behaving as a shock  brigade in the execution of this criminal aggressive strategy  and, also, is fully revealing its true color as a faithful war  servant of the United States and a group of traitors trying to  slay the fellow countrymen in collision with outside forces.    We have put forward a proposal for negotiations to establish  a new peace guarantee system [pyonghwa pojang chegye], which  will replace the Military Armistice Commission, in order to  secure durable peace and security on the Korean peninsula and  are making efforts for its realization. At this juncture, the  South Korean puppets are actively participating in the United  States' adventurous military action against us. This is a grave  criminal act of running counter to detente and peace on the  Korean peninsula and of posing a threat to peace on Korea and  Asia, as well as an unforgivable challenge to our people, the  people in the Asian socialist countries, and those ones in the  countries of the Asia-Pacific region.    The Kim Yong-sam group is trying to maintain its unstable  power in return for its service as a servant and a shock brigade  of the U.S. aggression and its war policy and to achieve its  ambition to reunify the country by a Northward invasion with the  arms of force. This is, however, a foolish act.    The South Korean puppets must stop committing a reckless act  of serving the United States' perilous policy of war, clearly  being aware that they have nothing to get from toeing outside  forces' policy of strength.</p>

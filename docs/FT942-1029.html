			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Worst of all worlds as EU leaders fail to agree: FT writers weigh up the two-day summit in Corfu which did not find a new president Choosing a successor to Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission was never going to be easy. But amid chaotic scenes at the European summit in Corfu, the 12 heads of government of the EU ended up with the worst of all worlds, write Lionel Barber, David Gardner and Kerin Hope. The Belgians are furious with the British for exercising a de facto veto against Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, their prime minister and overwhelming favourite. The Dutch remain resentful about the Germans blocking their prime minister, Mr Ruud Lubbers. Everyone agrees that the selection process is flawed; but with the exception of Mr John Major, UK prime minister, no one seems happy with the summit stalemate. Responsibility for solving the crisis over the Delors succession falls, therefore, to Chancellor Helmut Kohl. He intends to call a special summit on July 15 in Brussels, apparently calculating that the incoming German presidency can succeed where the Greeks so palpably failed in Corfu. The choice of a successor to Mr Delors was supposed to be settled during a dinner among the 12 heads of government at the Achilleon, a gaudy 19th-century palace built for the Empress Elisabeth of Austria which later served as a summer retreat for Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany during the first world war. Mr Andreas Papandreou, the 75-year-old Greek premier, whose heart condition is unlikely to have improved during the two-day summit, chaired the first session. Mr Lubbers and Mr Dehaene, both Christian Democrats, retired to the Corfu Hilton to await the outcome. They were replaced by deputies: Dutch finance minister Mr Wim Kok and Belgian foreign minister Mr Willy Claes, both Socialists in their coalition governments. Mr Major opened with a presentation on behalf of Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator and the only other official candidate for the top Commission post. Mr Kok followed with arguments for Mr Lubbers, and Mr Claes for Mr Dehaene. Mr Papandreou then threw everyone off balance by calling for an immediate secret ballot. Eight countries led by France and Germany expressed a preference for Mr Dehaene: Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal. Three  - the Netherlands, Spain, and Italy - voted for Mr Lubbers. Sir Leon received the solitary vote of the UK. Shortly after midnight, Mr Jacques Santer, Luxembourg prime minister, arrived at the Corfu Hilton and declared an impasse. The meeting of the heads of government would reconvene at 10am on Saturday, he said. The Spanish delegation meanwhile encouraged the impression that their prime minister Felipe Gonzalez was negotiating with Mr Lubbers to reach a compromise to salvage Dutch national pride, while paving the way for Mr Dehaene. But within a quarter of an hour, the meeting was reconvened, this time chaired by Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the unpredictable Greek European affairs minister. Mr Papandreou retired to bed at the Imperial hotel, though Greek officials insist that he remained in contact by telephone. The second session was stormy. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign minister, who generally steers clear of hyperbole, called the atmosphere 'poisonous'. Mr Kok demanded that Mr Kohl explain why he was against Mr Lubbers' candidacy, but failed to receive a satisfactory answer. 'Normally the chancellor has a lot to say, but this time he didn't,' said a visibly angry Mr Kok later. Mr Major refused, point blank, to support Mr Dehaene. He told his colleagues: 'This is not going to be sorted out tonight. I won't agree to Mr Dehaene even if it's 11 votes to one.' Mr Pangalos tried to ease the tension. Pointing to Mr Delors, he joked: 'If it continues like this, we will have to ask Jacques to stay on - except he has other plans.' Mr Delors, who is in two minds about entering next year's race for the French presidency, smiled. Perhaps he was savouring the irony of a British veto against Mr Dehaene having the unintended effect of prolonging his 10-year stewardship in Brussels. Later, however, he specifically ruled out staying on for another five years. In an effort to force a conclusion, Mr Pangalos called for a second vote. This time the eight pro-Dehaene member states picked up support from Spain and Italy, who said they were ready to 'join the consensus'. But the British and Dutch held out for their candidates. By 3am on Saturday morning, the British made clear that Mr Dehaene was unacceptable to them, claiming he represented a tradition of big government and interventionism. 'Sir Leon fits the bill. Mr Lubbers fits the bill. Mr Dehaene does not,' said a UK official. Once the heads of government resumed later that morning, Mr Lubbers and Sir Leon withdrew their candidacies. For Sir Leon it was a lost cause, the finale to the first-ever public campaign for the top job in Brussels. Mr Lubbers, whose candidacy ran into an immovable Mr Kohl, had the last word. 'The German Chancellor now has a big problem. Either he has to persuade Mr Major - which I doubt - or we have to find a new candidate,' said the outgoing Dutch premier.</p>

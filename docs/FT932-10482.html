			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Letter: Union and League: a north-south divide in a game with two halves Sir, It is a pity that John Hopkins in his comparison of Rugby League and Union writes on the basis of his knowledge of Union. ('Two codes, one language', May 1.) To say that Jonathan Davies is arguably the most complete footballer of his time is rubbish and could only come from a Union fan. At Wigan several players have outperformed him all season - has he never heard of Edwards, Bell, Botica, and the new rising star Jason Robinson who is still only 18. When talking about support, no Union club exceeds Wigan, where the season's average is 14,752. Other clubs regularly exceeding the 6,000-8,000 gates mentioned by Hopkins, are Leeds, with an average of 11,527 spectators and St Helens, 8,931. If Hopkins thinks he could get consolation at Wembley's Rugby League final for failing to get in to Twickenham he is in cloud-cuckoo land. Since Wigan made it their second home in the mid-1980s, it has been a sell-out. We don't need to be patronised by southern-based Union supporters with a hankering for our highlight.

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Community Hospitals shows healthy recovery to Pounds 2.95m Community Hospitals Group, the private medical care company, recovered from last year's recessionary malaise to report a healthy 58 per cent increase to Pounds 2.95m in interim pre-tax profits. The increase for the six months to December 31 was achieved on turnover ahead 19 per cent to Pounds 27.2m. Mr Alan Dexter, chief executive, said the profits rise was due to margin improvement in the hospitals division and the contribution from new nursing homes. The results had also compared to a particularly depressed first half in 1992, which had been hit by higher interest charges and a fall in hospital revenues. Mr Dexter was optimistic that the group would maintain growth this year, albeit at a slower rate. The interim dividend is increased by 17 per cent to 2.8p, payable from earnings up 53 per cent to 6.6p. The group also offered a 'best view' opinion on full year profits, showing a pre-tax range of Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 7.8m, on sales in the Pounds 55m to Pounds 58m range. Earnings per shares were estimated at between 16p and 17.5p. Operating profits from hospitals were 48 per cent higher at Pounds 3.06m, on turnover 14 per cent up to Pounds 21.6m. Mr Dexter said the division had improved operating margins from 10.9 per cent to 14.2 per cent. Costs had been cut by an estimated Pounds 500,000 on an annualised basis. The hospitals capital investment programme, which totalled about Pounds 65m since the group's flotation in 1989, was now largely complete. The continuing care businesses, including nursing homes, contributed Pounds 1.09m at the operating level, against Pounds 660,000 last year. Some Pounds 300,000 of the improvement was contributed by three new nursing homes. Turnover was 49 per cent higher at Pounds 5.63m, and occupancy rates for the operational homes rose to 91 per cent from the high 80s.</p>

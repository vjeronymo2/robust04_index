			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Maastricht debate 'very soon' THE DEBATE paving the way for the return of the Maastricht Bill to the Commons will be 'very soon', ministers indicated yesterday - which means the bill could be back before MPs in mid-November. In his statement to the Commons today on the European Community summit in Birmingham, Mr John Major will announce the date for the debate - expected next week - and underline his determination to take the legislation through parliament. Discussion of the Maastricht treaty at last week's cabinet meeting came down on balance in favour of pressing ahead with the legislation to ratify. The Foreign Office is keen to proceed, believing that continued delay is debilitating and encourages Tory rebels. While accepting the case for getting on with the bill, government business managers will not commit themselves firmly to any particular timetable until they see how the paving debate goes. The motion for discussion is likely to be no more than a single line approving the return of the bill, first debated by MPs in May. Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip, is said to have made it clear to colleagues that proceeding with the legislation has to be taken seriously and that ministers might have to cancel engagements to protect the government's slim overall majority of 21. The aim is to set aside solid weeks of parliamentary time to deal with the bill - including weekend sittings - to ensure that the Euro-sceptics' tactics of putting down hundreds of amendments does not prevent the bill being passed. An opinion poll of Conservative constituency chairmen has shown strong grassroots support for the government's decision to press ahead with ratifying the Maastricht treaty. But the sample of 147 constituencies - 44 per cent of the 336 returning Tory MPs - condemns Mr Major's administration for its handling of the economy. The poll for ITN's Parliament Programme shows 71 per cent backing Maastricht ratification, with 26 per cent against. Fourteen per cent backed a referendum on the pact, with 86 per cent against. However, when it came to the economy, 58 per cent of those polled expressed dissatisfaction with the government's management against 40 per cent saying they were satisfied.</p>

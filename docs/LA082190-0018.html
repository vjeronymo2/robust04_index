			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON: SEX AND AGING  </P> <P> Question: I am a newly single woman who is getting very close to her 60th  birthday. At a recent party that I attended, I was handed a line that I had not  heard since I was in college many years ago.  </P> <P> During a conversation with one of the men there, he remarked that having sexual  relations is good for a woman's health. When I told him that he reminded me of  a teen-ager I once knew, he insisted he was serious. Is there anything to this?  </P> <P> A: Having sexual relations can help a woman maintain her genital health. It has  been reported that among women 60 to 70 years of age, those who engage in  sexual relations experience less vaginal atrophy and have better lubrication.  It should be apparent, however, that engaging in indiscriminate sexual  relationships is not a prescription for good health, genital or otherwise, for  either men or women.  </P></p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major accused as MPs split over BCCI - Treasury Committee MR JOHN MAJOR is accused of ignoring warning signs about fraud at the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International in a series of Labour additions to a Commons' report to be published next week. Labour MPs on the Treasury committee, who failed to get the amendments included in the main report, are expected to split publicly with Conservative members when it is published on Wednesday. They are concerned that Mr Major, who was chancellor when evidence of deceitful accounting at BCCI emerged, should not escape some responsibility for the affair. The amendments, which almost amount to a 'minority report', were tabled by Mr Brian Sedgemore, Labour MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch. He has received support - although with significant qualifications - from his Labour colleagues Ms Diane Abbott (Hackney North and Stoke Newington), Mr John Garrett (Norwich South) and Mr Giles Radice (Durham North). They failed, however, to out-vote the Conservatives and one Liberal Democrat on the Tory-dominated committee. The main report is highly critical of the Bank of England for delaying action against BCCI. Mr Sedgemore's amendments go on to implicate Mr Major, in the belief that the Bank of England should not be used as simply a 'fall-guy' for Treasury ministers. The Bank is responsible for banking regulation, but the Treasury has a broad role in overseeing its actions. Mr Sedgemore has compiled a diary of 33 warning signs between 1985 and BCCI's closure in July last year, which he says were available to the Bank of England. Of these, 19 occured during the period when Mr Major was chancellor, he says. The colourful language of the amendments clashes with the moderate style of Mr Terence Higgins, Tory chairman of the committee, in the main report. The Labour MPs believe many of Mr Sedgemore's points are valid. The Bank of England received a report on BCCI from accountants Price Waterhouse in April 1990 which said some accounting transactions at the bank had been false or deceitful. The report was followed by a shake-up at BCCI and a restructuring of its balance sheet. According to evidence given by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, Mr Major was told about the restructuring but not the contents of the April 1990 report. Only after a Price Waterhouse report to the Bank in June last year was there sufficient evidence of fraud at BCCI to justify its closure.</p>

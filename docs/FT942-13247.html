			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Leading Article: Bloodspilling at the banks When the problems of large banks in Germany, Spain and France make headlines near the end of a severe recession, that should not come as much of a surprise. Deutsche Bank, Banesto and Credit Lyonnais have run into varying degrees of adversity as a result of under-performing corporate loans and equity investments. One lesson from three disparate setbacks is that bankers should not under-estimate the potential conflicts when they are both shareholders and creditors of companies in difficulties. UK clearing banks have done themselves a favour by resisting sporadic political pressure over the years to take equity stakes in industry. German banks' long-term customer relationships are justifiably regarded as a strength of the German system. However, the banks started some time ago to lower their industrial participations, not least because of the growing belief that over-cloying relationships with industry can harm economic performance. If conditions allow, most of the continent's universal banks would like to become a lot less universal by the end of the 1990s. Deutsche Bank's difficulties are very much less serious than those affecting the other two banks, which have registered large losses. But the mistakes revealed both in the Metallgesellschaft affair last year and in the latest imbroglio over loans to the collapsed Schneider property empire cannot fail to have an impact on the standing of Germany's biggest bank. The French National Assembly will discuss this week setting up an inquiry into state-owned Credit Lyonnais. Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, the former chairman, is suspected of channelling funds towards companies favoured by the Socialist party. Credit Lyonnais' economic failure may, however, have a favourable outcome. It will take time before anyone in Paris will want to emulate Mr Haberer's failed banque - industrie strategy of building up holdings in a mixed group of companies. Banesto, Spain's fourth largest bank, has needed around Dollars 4bn to cover losses stemming from disastrously aggressive lending, including to companies in which it owns equity stakes. Divorcing Spain's banks from industrial portfolios built up during years of corporatist economic management will take years. However, to re-establish sound banking principles, Banesto's new owner will need to disentangle the bank's industrial holdings. Historically, European banks' industry stakes - like those of governments - have largely reflected transactions carried out at times of economic and political distress. These shareholdings can be divested only if alternative investors are available. Over the short term, unfavourable public reaction to revelations of banking mismanagement may set back chances for broadening European equity markets. Longer term, however, the sight of blood spilled on banks' carpets may increase the political priority given to achieving this necessary objective.</p>

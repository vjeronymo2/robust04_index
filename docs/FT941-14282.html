			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Venezuelan bank to re-open for repayments Banco Latino, the big Venezuelan commercial bank that closed its doors a week ago, will re-open on January 28 to start repaying depositors, but initially only up to Dollars 930 (Pounds 628) each, government officials said. The re-opening is the first phase of a government plan to return deposits to small account holders, and to try putting the institution back on its feet. By refunding deposits of up to Dollars 930 the government believes it will cover demands from over 631,000 individual account holders, or about 60 per cent of depositors. The government will later repay larger sums to depositors, but the maximum guarantee for each account - 1m Venezuelan bolivars or about Dollars 9,300 - will not be paid out unless the bank is liquidated. Caracas has been rife with rumours about the health of other financial institutions. Mr Roger Urbina, the superintendent of banks who has taken temporary control of Banco Latino, warned that if the rumours continue, other Venezuelan banks could be endangered.</p>

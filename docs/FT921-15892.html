			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (10): Attacking the tariff barriers - Manufacturing must become a lead sector IF STRUCTURAL adjustment is to succeed, manufacturing industry, and manufacturing exports in particular, must become the lead sectors of the economy for the rest of the century. This was recognised in 1986 when the government's economic policy statement - Sessional Paper No 1  - set a target growth rate of 7.5 per cent a year for the industrial sector during the 1988 to 2000 period. While manufacturing industry has been the lead sector since 1988 with growth of 5.5 per cent a year, it has, in common with the rest of the economy, fallen behind target, in spite of the impressive momentum of reform, especially in trade policy. Kenya's industrial sector ranks as the fourth largest in Africa after South Africa, Nigeria and Zimbabwe. In 1985, it comprised some 560 medium and large-scale companies, more than 700 medium-scale businesses, and an estimated 1,600 micro-enterprises. In 1990, manufacturing value added was estimated at Dollars 440m. Food processing is the largest single activity, accounting for almost 30 per cent of value-added, followed by tobacco and beverages with 11.5 per cent, while chemicals and machinery and transport equipment account for about 10 per cent each. Manufacturing is the second largest employer, providing 334,000 jobs or a quarter of wage employment. In 1987, a World Bank team studied a sample of 45 companies and concluded that the average company enjoyed 90 per cent protection. In spite of this, some import-substitution activities, notably food processing, beverages and tobacco, were relatively efficient. But when they were assessed as potential exports, the bank found that while their ex-factory prices were competitive against those of landed imports, once transport costs to export markets were taken into account, they were too costly to compete. Furthermore, packaging and quality did not measure up to international standards. It concluded that the rest of the sector was inefficient. Highly protected activities - steel, chemicals, transport and electrical equipment - would never be internationally competitive because of scale economies, and the bank was unhappy that so much investment had gone into these industries. Critics of Kenyan economic policy tend to overlook the extent to which these shortcomings have been addressed, primarily by reducing protection and devaluing the shilling. Tax rates have been lowered, most prices decontrolled, imports liberalised and export incentives strengthened. The main thrust of reform has been to force industrialists to seek export-led growth and to improve efficiency as protection is reduced. Quantitative controls on imports have been abolished, tariff rates lowered and tariff dispersion narrowed. There are 12 tariff bands compared with 25 previously, and while maximum tariff rates have been cut and average tariffs reduced, the main reduction in protection was achieved by abolishing import controls. In the mid-1980s, import bans covered most of industrial production, but by the end of 1990, the IMF estimated that only about 5 per cent of imports were restricted. Today, protection is greatest for cars and textiles. Four years ago, the top tariff rate was 170 per cent, and as recently as 1990 there were more than 1,400 items with tariff rates of 80 per cent or more. Today, the top rate of 70 per cent applies to some 1,370 items, with more than half the product categories attracting tariffs of 15-35 per cent. The next stage of tariff reform is to abolish the licensing system and further narrow the range of tariffs which will shift the responsibility for stabilising the balance of payments to demand management by fiscal and monetary means. It is too early to tell how the sector is responding to this shock therapy. There is some evidence of inefficient producers going to the wall and of industrialists responding positively to improved export opportunities brought about by the reduction in protection and currency depreciation. Industrialists support liberalisation, though there have been loud complaints from electronics, vehicle components and razor blade manufacturers that they are being marginalised by import dumping. Statistics on industrial exports differ. According to the government, there has been a 70 per cent rise in the volume of manufactured exports since 1982, but the value of manufactured exports (excluding chemicals) shows a fall from more than Dollars 100m in 1980 to an average of Dollars 96m over 1988-90. Opinions differ about Kenya's capacity to become a significant exporter of manufactures. The optimists believe its geographical location is ideal for exploiting its traditional east African and Preferential Trade Area market and markets in the EC and southern Asia. Pessimists say the market is too small to secure scale economies while quality and packaging is inferior. A worrisome aspect is the apparent reluctance of multinationals to invest or expand in Kenya. Bankers say that most of the new investment in manufacturing has come from smaller and newer investors, often Asians, including Asian businesses based abroad. This has led to increased competition in industries such as edible oils, previously a monopoly, and to improved performance in several sectors where cost-conscious entrepreneurs, using modern equipment, are transforming some of Kenya's industries.</p>

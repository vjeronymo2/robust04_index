			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Pasyakin report featuring interview with Admiral </F> Gromov, commander in chief of the Russian Navy; date not given:  "We Are Dividing Up the Black Sea Fleet Piecemeal. Groups of  Russian and Ukrainian Military Experts Are at Work in  Sevastopol"]    [Text] Sevastopol -- Our correspondent met with Admiral  Feliks Gromov, commander in chief of the Russian Navy, the head  of the Russian experts.    [Gromov] The group of experts is involved in assessing the  status of the fleet's forces, primarily the seagoing hardware  [plavsredstva] which is to be divided up. The parameters for  this division are being determined and a list is being drawn up  of names of the ships and vessels that will go, in time, to the  Russian Fleet and to the Ukrainian Navy. It is a painstaking  job. It is necessary to look into every ship, every piece of  hardware. The groups' experts have different viewpoints on some  issues. And it is by no means simple to find a common language.  But we are acting on the basis of the official accords that  have already been secured during the previous meetings of the  heads of state and defense ministers. No new accords are  envisaged. The status of the ship "pool" is being assessed.    [Pasyakin] Feliks Nikolayevich, there was a report that the  Russian and Ukrainian delegations would be led by Yuriy Dubinin,  Russian Foreign Ministry ambassador at large, and Ukrainian Vice  Premier Valeriy Shmarov. However, they have not come. Why?    [Gromov] There was no full accord to the effect that the  delegations would comprise precisely these members. There was  an accord regarding the work of the groups of experts. I came  in order to direct the Russian group. As for Valeriy  Nikolayevich Shmarov, as a representative of the Ukrainian  government he has expressed a desire to familiarize himself with  certain fleet installations that may go to the Ukrainian side.  We considered this normal and possible. If he comes to the  fleet and wants to familiarize himself with certain facilities,  we will show them to him.    [Pasyakin] The officers, ensigns, and employees of the  Crimean Naval Base sent an open letter to you. It asked you not  to allow it to be handed over to the Ukrainian naval forces.  "If that happens," the letter says, "over 7,000 officers and  ensigns and family members will be left without the means of  existence and will be forced to leave their homes." What do you  think of that?    [Gromov] I understand people's concern and disquiet, the  position in which they find themselves. Where possible we will  take this request into consideration. But I think that this  letter is somewhat premature. Why? Because the division of a  fleet is a lengthy process. And it does not mean that if some  decision is adopted today, say, it will be implemented tomorrow.  But the main thing that we will strive to do is not to harm  people, not to harm the fleet and its combat capability....  [Gromov ends]    Before my meeting with the commander in chief of the Russian  Navy I asked Rear Admiral Aleksey Ryzhenko, first deputy  commander and chief of staff of the Ukrainian Navy, how the  joint work of the Russian and Ukrainian military experts was  going.    "We will follow the list of ships and vessels and divide  them  up fifty-fifty; then the Ukrainian side will sell Russia a  number previously agreed. The groups of experts are expected to  be at work for around a week."    A Ukrainian delegation led by Boris Tarasyuk, who is, as we  know, conducting the talks with the Russian side, arrived in  Sevastopol 3 June. The delegation included Ukrainian Vice  Premier Valeriy Shmarov and Colonel General Ivan Bizhan,  Ukrainian first deputy defense minister. The Ukrainian  delegation had a meeting with Adm. Feliks Gromov, commander in  chief of the Russian Navy. Yuriy Dubinin has not arrived in  Sevastopol. The delegations look unequal. The talks seem to  have become deadlocked.    Needless to say, we should not expect a rapid practical  solution to the question of the division of the Black Sea Fleet.  Ukraine benefits from that, since Russia is effectively  maintaining the entire fleet on its own and thus the Ukrainian  part of it as well. Moreover certain politicians are in no hurry  to close the question of the Black Sea Fleet, since they have by  no means "squeezed" all the possible political "dividends" from  it. The men are being patient. But this patience is not  infinite. Do the politicians realize that?</p>

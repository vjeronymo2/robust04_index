			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> State prisons may be located in two more San Joaquin Valley communities during  the 1990s -- Porterville and Coalinga. Prisons have become the valley's biggest  growth business of late with new men's lockups opening at Avenal and Corcoran  in Kings County, the world's biggest women's prison being built in Madera  County and smaller facilities on the boards in other valley towns. A state  Department of Corrections report to the Legislature says plans are moving ahead  to locate prisons at Coalinga in western Fresno County and at Porterville in  southeastern Tulare County. A preliminary site evaluation under way at Coalinga  should be finished by spring, the report added. And corrections officials hope  to hold community meetings in the Porterville area later in the year before  beginning site evaluations.  </P></p>

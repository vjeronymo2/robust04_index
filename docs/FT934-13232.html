			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Parkland shares surge on enfranchisement proposal SHARES OF Parkland Textile (Holdings) soared yesterday as the woollen yarn and worsted cloth manufacturer accompanied a sharp recovery in interim profits with a proposed enfranchisement of its A shares. The ordinary shares surged 105p to 365p while the A shares jumped 48p to 221p. On the back of a 15 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 27.1m in the half year to August 27, the Bradford-based group swung from losses of Pounds 309,000 to profits of Pounds 970,000 pre-tax. The interim dividend is doubled to 2p, payable from earnings of 12.1p (losses of 4.8p). The directors anticipated that generally stable conditions would prevail in the second half 'provided the threat of increased taxation does not affect consumer confidence.' Following receipt of part of the proceeds of a discontinued business half year gearing was reduced from 43.2 per cent to 26.2 per cent. Interest charges were trimmed from Pounds 464,000 to Pounds 231,000. In the yarn division, volumes remained static but margins improved 'modestly' at Knoll Spinning largely because of increased exports. Volume advances generated by the fabric division in 1992-93 continued throughout the first half with 'considerable growth' achieved in all areas. To compensate for dilution of their voting rights, existing ordinary shareholders will receive a scrip issue on a 4-for-5 basis. The group is to change its name to Parkland Group.</p>

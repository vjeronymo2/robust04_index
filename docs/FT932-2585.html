			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Veil of secrecy on US-EC trade talks US and European Community trade negotiators kept a veil of secrecy around their meeting yesterday at an unknown London location, with officials revealing only that they 'compared notes and positions' on a market access deal to be presented next week at a trade ministers' summit in Tokyo. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC chief negotiator, is understood to have told Mr Mickey Kantor, his US counterpart, that the controversial bilateral US-German peace accord on the EC-US dispute on telecommunications trade 'had complicated matters'. Hopes have been raised that Japan, the EC and the US might provide momentum towards a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation by agreeing a three-way tariff cutting deal across a range of manufacturing and services sectors. At the OECD ministerial meeting in Paris just two weeks ago, Mr Kantor predicted that 'we are at last within striking distance of the largest market access package in history'. The mood yesterday was more cautious. The deal is due to be thrashed out in Tokyo next week when trade ministers from Japan, the US, the EC and Canada meet. A limited number of issues now block settlement: Japan is refusing to bow to pressure to cut to zero its tariffs on imports of spirits, and wood and wood products. The EC in turn is baulking at similar tariff cuts for electronics products, agricultural machinery, and non-ferrous metals. The US is refusing to cut tariff peaks on ceramics, glass, and on textile imports.</p>

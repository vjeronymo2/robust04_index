			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Bravo, Jacques Mr Jacques Delors' decision not to stand for next year's French presidential election was a brave and realistic move. Although he faces criticism from the Socialist party for handing a near-certain victory to the conservatives, it is the right decision for Mr Delors and for France. If it ends up helping to clarify the French debate about widening and deepening European integration, the decision could turn out, too, to be the right one for Europe. The French head of state wields far more power than most European heads of government. Mr Delors' trump card would have been the breadth of his electoral appeal. Nonetheless, the balance in his decision seems to have been tipped by the fragmentation of the Socialist party, combined with his own weariness after 10 years at the European Commission. Mr Delors is probably right to judge that, had he won the presidency, he would have been unable to assemble a working majority in the National Assembly; his role in economic and social reform, as well as foreign and defence policy, would have been shackled. Even assuming a new parliamentary election, Mr Delors would have been forced into an uncomfortable 'cohabitation' both with the Gaullists and with his own party, in which he lacks a strong power base. None of this would have been conducive to decisive government. A President Delors would have had an agenda, but little chance of carrying it through. Mr Delors' step inflames the Socialists' self-inflicted wounds, but it gives the party a better long-term chance of finding a younger leader. As for the right, the benefits need to be weighed against the disadvantages that may ensue from intensified in-fighting between the two main presidential contenders, Mr Edouard Balladur and Mr Jacques Chirac. Both rivals support European integration in co-ordination with Germany. Compared with Mr Delors, however, they ascribe to the nation state a stronger role in European affairs. It is thus almost certain that President Mitterrand's successor will adopt an agenda for reforming the EU's institutions and enlarging its membership that falls well short of the federal ambitions of Mr Delors and Chancellor Helmut Kohl. By vacating France's political middle-ground, Mr Delors' decision could indirectly encourage a regrouping of the French centre-right with more convincing policies for combining national and European decision-making than those at present espoused by the Gaullists alone. By steering through the Single European Act and supporting Mr Kohl over German unification, Mr Delors has already decisively aided European integration. If his withdrawal from the race helps bring about more coherent European policies on the right, Mr Delors' decision may eventually be seen as one more contribution to the European cause.</p>

And that accords with our  peoples' aspirations," stated Kazakhstan President Nursultan  Nazarbayev at a meeting with Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov in which  representatives of business circles and the intelligentsia took  part.    This meeting was a kind of summing up of the results of the  Kazakhstan leader's first official visit to Russia. Nursultan  Nazarbayev shared with those present his thoughts about the  situation in Kazakhstan and Russia and the prospects for the  development of bilateral relations. In particular he noted that  he does not agree with the model of the reforms which have been  implemented in Russia. Privatization from below has not  succeeded and "has merely led to chaos" so Kazakhstan has  decided to create state holding companies. In agriculture they  have rejected the privatization of land and allowed its leasing  for a period of 99 years with the right of inheritance.  Kazakhstan has taken the path of retaining strong collective  and state farms but on new terms. Here those who want to can  always leave and start their own business when they have  received their share.    The president dwelled in detail on the nationalities  problem.  He said that it has arisen as a result of the collapse of "one  state in which we all lived." Then Kazakhstan "was pushed out  of the ruble zone" and that merely created additional  difficulties for people. "If there was the certainty that dual  citizenship would make it possible to resolve the problem, we  would introduce it. But in this case the problem would still  remain at the daily routine level."    Nursultan Nazarbayev stated that as president of a sovereign  state he cannot accept the formation that is the CIS. Of the  270 documents adopted by the CIS one of its members has approved  40, another 140, another 150. By creating independent states  all former republics of the USSR hoped that they would sell  their goods to Europe and receive dollars in exchange. But it  has turned out that we had a common market and our goods were  only necessary to us. "The time has come for a tougher  association," he said. A Eurasian Union based on principles  completely distinct from the present community could be such an  association, the president said.</p>

			<p>930615 FT  15 JUN 93 / British executives in Cuba trade talks A GROUP of British business executives is visiting Cuba for talks on trade and investment opportunities in such fields as tourism, the oil industry and bio-technology, Reuter reports from Havana. 'We are particularly interested in the Hispanic Caribbean. . . we see opportunities for economic development,' Baroness Young, a former Conservative minister and the delegation leader, said in Havana. The 14 executives in the group were to have talks with Cuban trade officials during their three-day stay on the communist-ruled island. Britain's Caribbean trade advisory group organised the visit. Mr Raul Taladrid, a vice-president of Cuba's state committee for economic co-operation, told Lady Young that Cuba was interested in increasing its trade relations with Britain. Asked about Britain's attitude to the US trade embargo against the country, which the Cuban government says hinders trade and investment from other countries, Lady Young said: 'The British government's position is that we have trade relations with Cuba and are interested in building them up'.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Venables regains Tottenham post after court injunction MR TERRY VENABLES, the football manager turned entrepreneur, was reinstated as chief executive of Tottenham Hotspur last night just hours after being sacked in a boardroom battle with Mr Alan Sugar, the self-made electronics millionaire. A High Court judge ordered Mr Venables be reinstated until a further court hearing on May 25. Mr Venables, who played a key role in rescuing Tottenham two years ago, had applied for an emergency injunction on the grounds that his dismissal was not in the football club's best interests. Last night, the club issued a statement saying it had not been given a chance to give evidence to the court but would do so when the hearing reconvened. Earlier, in a day of high drama, Mr Venables, a former Tottenham player, emerged from an hour-long board meeting to announce that he had been sacked as chief executive and would be consulting his solicitor. The meeting was reported to have been dominated by Mr Sugar, chairman of the holding company which owns and runs the north London club. Mr Venables' dismissal, at the hands of the man he brought in to help rescue the club, shocked fans and provoked outbursts from some players. Tottenham has just completed a relatively successful season, finishing eighth in the Premier League and reaching the semi-finals of the FA Cup. Mr Sugar, who is also chairman of Amstrad, the electronics company, has invested more than Pounds 10m in Tottenham and now owns 48 per cent of the equity. After yesterday's board meeting, he told downcast staff at the club's White Hart Lane ground that there had been a difference of opinion between himself and Mr Venables. Only one person could run the club. There was also an unexplained reference to 'a particular group' that was said to be influencing Mr Venables. Mr Sugar praised the former chief executive's football management skills, but was critical of his activities on the commercial side. He described as ludicrous any suggestion that he wanted to be involved in team selection or team management. Mr Venables is reported to have accused Mr Sugar of wanting to run the whole thing. If Mr Venables is removed from his Tottenham post, it could prove a heavy financial blow. He has put about Pounds 3m into the club - much of it borrowed - taking his stake to 22 per cent. At yesterday's closing price of 89p, this was worth Pounds 3.2m - not enough to cover his financing costs. However, Mr Venables could claim the best part of Pounds 1m from the club. According to the rights issue document, he was earning Pounds 225,000 a year on a five-year contract running to July 1996. He was also entitled to about 1.5 per cent of pre-tax profits and a year's notice. Page 7 Soccer's dream ticket falls foul</p>

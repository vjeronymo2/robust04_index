			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LESS FUNDING MAY LEAD TO TEACHER LAYOFFS  </P> <P> Faced with a potential $1.8-million budget shortfall, Ventura Unified School  District administrators have announced that administrators, teachers and  programs in the 25-school district could face cutbacks, including layoffs and  elimination of special programs.  </P> <P> The announcement at Tuesday evening's school board meeting followed Gov. George  Deukmejian's proposal to trim the cost-of-living increase for California's  elementary and secondary schools to 3%, instead of the 4.95% called for by law.  </P> <P> A 3% cost-of-living increase will reduce district revenues by $1.8 million.  </P> <P> District officials have notified principals of potential reassignments for the  1990-91 school year, a proposal that could put some administrators back in the  classroom. The school board will decide whether to notify teachers of potential  layoffs at the next board meeting, March 13.  </P></p>

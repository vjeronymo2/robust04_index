			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'BIG-TICKET' ORDERS UP ONLY A SLIM 0.3%  </P> <P> Orders for "big-ticket" durable goods rebounded a smaller-than-expected 0.3% in  June after a steep fall in May, the Commerce Department said today, providing a  fresh sign that the economy is slowing.  </P> <P> The June rise came after a revised 4.4% fall in May. Economists, figuring that  durable goods orders would rebound from May's depressed level, had projected a  much stronger gain of 1% or more.  </P> <P> The June rate was lifted by orders for machinery and electrical equipment and  offset by falling orders for metals and transportation equipment.  </P> <P> The orders received by factories for long-lasting manufactured goods inched up  $400 million to a seasonally adjusted $124.1 billion in June from the prior  month. The orders were 1% below last year's level.  </P> <P> The slack orders figure adds to the growing list of reports showing a general  slowdown in the economy. Retail sales also have been weak, industrial  production has fallen for two months in a row and the trade deficit jumped 24%  in May, swelled in part by a slowdown in exports.  </P> <P> The modest rebound in durable-goods orders is unlikely to persuade economists  that "big-ticket" sales, one of the most interest-rate-sensitive sectors of the  economy because buyers must usually borrow to purchase them, are breaking out  of their recent sluggish pattern.  </P> <P> The durable-goods report, despite the slight overall rise, contained a number  of signs of weakness. Shipments fell 1.1% in June to $121.6 billion, the fifth  decline this year.  </P> <P> Although unfilled orders were 10.9% higher than in June, 1988, showing that  factories still have plenty of work on hand, the increase in June from the  previous month was only 0.5% and was limited to a few industries.  </P> <P> Excluding orders received by defense contractors, which tend to be erratic from  month to month, orders in June fell 0.7%, the department said.  </P></p>

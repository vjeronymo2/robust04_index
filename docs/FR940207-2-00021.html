Natural states that the Commission approved the abandonment by Moraine and the acquisition by Natural of the Moraine facilities by order issued September 22, 1993 at Docket No. CP93&hyph;351&hyph;000 (September 22nd Order). The September 22nd Order required Natural to establish a separate incremental Part 284 rate and adopt as initial rates Moraine's existing rates for transportation on the acquired facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Natural also states that it previously filed and the Commission accepted rates for the Moraine facilities that did not include the ACA charge sought here. Such earlier filing was without prejudice to the then pending Request for Waiver of Payment of Annual Charges filed by Moraine on August 10, 1993 at Docket No. RM87&hyph;3&hyph;024. Subsequently, on January 6, 1994, the Commission issued an order denying Moraine's requested waiver of payment of ACA charges. Therefore, Natural further states that it should be afforded the opportunity to equitably recoup the entire ACA charges amount that was previously billed by the Commission and paid by Moraine; and as such, it is filing to reinstate effective December 1, 1993, the ACA charge of $.0026 per Mcf which had been previously filed by Moraine and accepted by Commission order to be effective October 1, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Natural states that it requested waiver of the Commission's Regulations to the extent necessary for the sheet to become effective December 1, 1993. Natural also states that the acceptance of the tariff sheet is consistent with the September 22nd Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Natural states that a copy of the filing was mailed to Natural's jurisdictional customers, intervenors in Docket No. CP93&hyph;351&hyph;000 and interested state regulatory agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with sections 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before February 8, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

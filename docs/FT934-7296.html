			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Non-EU trade gap falls sharply THE GOVERNMENT reported yesterday that the UK's visible trade gap with countries outside the European Union fell from a revised figure of Pounds 921m for September to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 293m in October. The deficit last month was the smallest with non-EU countries since January 1988, when the Central Statistical Office first produced such figures. It reflected a jump of nearly 9 per cent in the value of exports to Pounds 5.28bn last month  - a record in value terms. At the same time imports fell 3.5 per cent to Pounds 5.57bn from Pounds 5.77bn. Britain recorded a surplus in trade in manufactures with non-EU countries of Pounds 170m last month, the first such surplus since January 1988. Exports of finished manufactures, food and fuels rose sharply last month in volume terms. Yesterday's figures suggest that UK exporters are taking advantage of stronger growth in the US. The Pounds 138m surplus in north American trade in October was the highest since March 1989. Britain maintained its traditional surplus with the oil exporting countries. Taking three-month figures, which the government says give a better guide to trends, exports in August, September and October were 4.5 per cent higher in value terms than in the May-July period while imports rose 3 per cent. Compared with the same period last year, exports were 28 per cent higher and imports 22 per cent higher. In volume terms, exports were 2 per cent higher in the latest three months compared with the three months to the end of July, while imports were up 4 per cent. Volume exports and imports were up by 14 per cent and 12 per cent respectively compared with August-October 1992. Just under half Britain's visible trade is with non-EU countries. These figures are produced on a more timely basis than those with the UK's European Union partners, which have been plagued by problems with the Intrastat system of gathering trade statistics introduced in January. However, recent large monthly changes in the non-EU figures have made it difficult for the CSO to assess the trend, although the deficit appears to have been falling since January. Its latest estimates of trends suggested that UK exports to non-EU countries were growing in value at 1.5 per cent a month compared with 0.5 per cent growth per month for imports. Figures for trade volumes have also fluctuated. For example exports excluding oil and erratic items such as ships, aircraft, precious stones and silver jumped 11 per cent in October compared with September, while imports excluding oil and erratics rose by 2.5 per cent. The CSO estimated that underlying export growth was about 1.5 per cent between September and October compared with 1 per cent for imports.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           NON-EU TRADE: VALUE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Balance-of-payments basis, seasonally adjusted (Pounds m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                Excl oil and erratics*               Exports   Imports   Balance   Exports   Imports   Balance  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1991           44,477    53,883    -9,406   38,289     45,250   -6,961 1992           46,682    56,431    -9,749   40,624     48,097   -7,473 1992 Q2        11,665    13,856    -2,191   10,128     11,776   -1,648      Q3        11,577    13,675    -2,098   10,069     11,667   -1,598      Q4        12,134    15,295    -3,161   10,574     13,119   -2,545 1993 Q1        13,670    16,765    -3,095   11,762     14,066   -2,304      Q2        14,205    16,421    -2,216   12,026     14,131   -2,105      Q3        14,602    16,995    -2,393   12,606     14,484   -1,878 May             4,665     5,408      -743    3,922      4,746     -824 June            4,863     5,468      -605    4,133      4,660     -527 July            4,847     5,591      -744    4,173      4,848     -675 August          4,905     5,633      -728    4,204      4,744     -540 September       4,850     5,771      -921    4,229      4,892     -663 October         5,276     5,569      -293    4,686      5,016     -330  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Defined as ships, aircraft, precious stones and silver  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

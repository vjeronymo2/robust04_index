			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Kohl moves to dispel fears on farm accord CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday moved to dispel fears that Germany might back French demands for a renegotiation of the Blair House EC-US accord on farm trade when he met Mr Peter Sutherland, general secretary of Gatt in Bonn. 'The German position regarding Blair House is unchanged,' Mr Kohl said in a statement after the meeting. 'Nothing I have heard reflects that there is a repudiation of Blair House from Germany,' Mr Sutherland added. Mr Sutherland stressed clarity was urgently needed in the EC so that trade talks in Geneva would not be stalled and that a successful conclusion could be reached by December 15. In Brussels, the European Commission yesterday repeated its unanimous support for the Blair House agreement. At its first weekly meeting after the summer break, the Commission ruled out any possibility of a renegotiation. Though some commissioners made clear that there could no longer be any ambivalence over the farm trade agreement if a Uruguay Round settlement was to be reached, other officials were more circumspect on France's possible new demands, and Germany's apparent support for them. Mr Sutherland issued his warning as the chancellor reiterated that French resistance to the farm accord had to be overcome in order to reach a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of Gatt trade talks. 'Difficult and complicated negotiations can only be concluded successfully if all participants are fundamentally ready to compromise,' the chancellor's statement said. 'The important thing is that this accord should be in line with the reform of the EC Common Agricultural Policy agreed in May 1992. 'The EC Commission as the leader of the negotiations assumes that this is,' the statement added. Senior government officials said Germany would continue to hear out French objections to Blair House in a process which started yesterday as top officials from the chancellor's office, the Foreign Affairs Ministry and the Agricultural Ministry met their counterparts in Paris. However, they emphasised that they were seeking a compromise which represented a viable solution for the French and did not jeopardise the Blair House agreement. According to officials in the Agriculture Ministry, French proposals for changes to the Blair House agreement, which have circulated since last Friday between Bonn and Paris, could be met without full renegotiation of the accord with the US.</p>

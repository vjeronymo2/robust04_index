			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: London SE expects more emerging market GDRs The London Stock Exchange expects more companies from the emerging markets to list global depositary receipts in London - despite a recent lull in activity. Five companies - four from India and one from Argentina - have listed GDRs on the London exchange since the rules were modified in August. The most recent listing - of India's Bajaj Auto - was in early November. Mr Robert Murdin, head of capital markets at the exchange, said a number of other issues were 'in progress and would become public in the near future.' Potential new issues could come from the Pacific Rim countries, Africa, especially South Africa, Latin America, Russia, China and the Indian sub-continent. The GDR - like the American Depositary Receipt, a proxy for a company's underlying share - allows companies to avoid potential problems linked to settlement, foreign exchange and restrictions on foreign ownership. It is also cheaper to register than a full listing of shares.</p>

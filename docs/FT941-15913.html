			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Dutch PTT upbeat over earnings growth Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the Dutch state-owned telecommunications and postal company which is due to be privatised this year, said profits growth in 1993 was at least equal to the rates of increase seen in recent years. Mr Wim Dik, chairman, gave no absolute figures but his remarks, contained in a new year address to management, suggest that profit rose by several percentage points last year. In 1992, net profit was up 3.4 per cent at Fl 1.66bn (Dollars 850m), following increases of 2.2 per cent in 1991 and 6.4 per cent in 1990. Mr Dik said turnover broke through the Fl 17bn mark for the first time in 1993. This implies a rise of at least 8.8 per cent from net turnover of Fl 15.6bn in 1992. The improvements in sales and profits were recorded in both telecommunications and postal services. The company's postal arm is one of only two postal operations in Europe to record a profit, along with that of the UK. The flotation will probably take place in the spring.</p>

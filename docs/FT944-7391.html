			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Saudi Arabia consider compulsory military service Saudi Arabia, short of the necessary manpower for its ambitious defence programme, is considering the introduction of compulsory military service, diplomats in the kingdom said yesterday, Reuter reports from Dubai. They said the proposal has come in a draft of the country's new five-year development plan due to come into effect in January and which has yet to be approved by King Fahd. Compulsory military service is among necessary conditions to 'develop Saudi society, enhance the country's defence capabilities and deepen citizens' loyalty and sense of belonging,' they quoted the draft as saying. Saudi Arabia, with a population of 17m, of whom 4m are foreigners, has embarked on a Dollars 10bn programme to beef up its defences by the end of the century. Deep doubts about Iraq's intentions despite its defeat after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait and suspicions of the radical Islamic rulers of non-Arab Iran across the Gulf are among reasons given by diplomats for the Saudi arms buildup. But military experts have in the past wondered if the country had manpower to handle the sophisticated arms it is importing. The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies put Saudi Arabia's active armed forces at 158,000 men, both in the regular army and the royal-led National Guard. A 1992 census put the number of Saudi males in the 13-17 age-group, likely candidates for compulsory military service over the next five years, at 556,500.</p>

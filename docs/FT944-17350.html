			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Deng health reports put Shanghai on switchback ride Share prices gained ground thanks to small lot buying by overseas investors and improved confidence on the fall in the yen against the dollar, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 index rose 89.52 to 19,744.75, up 0.9 per cent on the week. The index opened at the day's low of 19,689.84 and rose to a high of 19,753.65 in the afternoon session. The dollar's recovery to a one-month high triggered buying of export oriented stocks, which led other shares. Volume totaled 226m shares against 202m. Most investors were absent from trading ahead of the three day weekend. The Topix index of all first section stocks added 1.78 to 1,578.05 and the Nikkei 300 advanced 0.31 to 289.11. Gainers outnumbered declines 496 to 428, with 232 issues remaining unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index closed 3.32 down at 1,306.56. Traders said that sentiment was supported by a rush of subscribers to Matsushita Electric Industrial's Y200bn convertible bond issue. Many market participants had initially feared that the large lot offering would take funds out of the equity market but favourable terms, including the coupon and low conversion price, helped attract investors. Reports that the Ministry of Finance will not release Japan Tobacco which have not been subscribed for, in conjunction with the stock listing on October 27, also cheered investors. Although the ministry denied that a formal decision had been made, the news helped dissipate some pessimism over the flotation. However Japan Telecom, which is closely followed by investors looking to buy Japan Tobacco shares, declined Y90,000 to Y3.92m. DDI, another telecom operator followed suit, losing Y13,000 to Y865,000. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone shed Y6,000 to Y865,000 and East Japan Railway lost Y2,000 to Y475,000. High-technology stocks, on the other hand, were higher on the weaker yen. Hitachi, the most active issue of the day, rose Y17 to Y990 and Mitsubishi Electric added Y17 to Y722. Steel companies fell on profit taking. Nippon Steel fell Y2 to Y379 and NKK declined Y6 to Y281. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 18.02 to 22,008.11 in volume of 11.7m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, rose Y50 to Y5,400 on the easier yen. Roundup Rumours concerning the health of China's leader and unconfirmed reports of Iraqi troop movements made for a volatile day's trading in parts of the Pacific Rim. SHANGHAI's A share index took a switchback ride, plunging almost 18.0 per cent in the early afternoon on rumours that China's leader, Deng Xiaoping, was ill, before picking up to close 12.4 per cent higher as the rumours subsided. The index finished up 83.32 to 735.86, off an intra-day low of 544.00 and a high of 781.27 minutes before the close. Rumours about Deng's health were one of the the main factors behind a 28.5 per cent fall over the the previous four trading days. The volatility of the day's trade prompted allegations of institutional manipulation of the market while the late surge was said to have been assisted by unconfirmed stories that China would allow pension funds to enter the A market. HONG KONG reversed steep morning losses at the finish, inspired by the Shanghai bourse's sharp rebound. The Hang Seng index closed 8.63 higher at 9,284.88, having picked up from a day's low of 9,194.40. The market was 2.5 per cent down over the week. Investors continued to await US September jobs data and the response to sales of Cheung Kong's Bayshore Towers flats, which were priced below expectations. KUALA LUMPUR was 1.9 per cent lower after an Iraqi opposition group said in London that Iraq was mobilising elite troops towards Kuwait. An Iraqi embassy official in Brussels subsequently denied the allegations, but by then, the damage has been done. The composite index fell 21.10 to 1,122.33, erasing the 18 point advance of the previous two sessions and leaving the index 0.6 per cent per cent higher over the week. SINGAPORE was also lower in choppy dealings in a late reaction to the reports about Iraqi troops movements. The Straits Times Industrials index lost 3.22 to 2,330.09, little changed on the week, with profit-taking ahead of the US jobs data also contributing to the slide. TAIPEI ended a volatile day slightly lower, but brokers said the effects of the share payment default that had dragged the market down by 7 per cent over the previous two days had almost come to an end. The weighted index finished 32.96 lower at 6,620.36, 6.6 per cent down on the week, in active turnover of TDollars 70.8bn. Hualon-related stocks remained weak. Hualon Corp and Chia Hsin Live both fell by the daily 7 per cent limit to TDollars 21.3 and TDollars 22.7 respectively. BANGKOK closed lower but off the day's low on late buying of bank issues, the SET index ending 21.72 lower at 1,459.78, down 1.7 per cent on the week in turnover of Bt6.96bn. SYDNEY eased further on interest rate fears, the All Ordinaries index losing 8.8 at 1,967.5, off 3 per cent on the week. WELLINGTON registered its fifth loss in five days, Fletcher Challenge leading the way down as the NZSE-40 index fell 10.11 to 1,988.05, 3.8 per cent lower on the week, in turnover of NZDollars 62.6m. SEOUL swung to a lower close on late afternoon institutional selling, the composite index finishing 4.09 down at 1,065.84, 1.5 per cent up on the week, after a morning high of 1,081.14. BOMBAY, spurred by active speculative buying in moderate volume trade at the beginning of the new account, saw the BSE index close 70.21 points higher at 4,449.70, 3.9 per cent better over the week. MANILA enjoyed lower September inflation, a new wave of IPOs and strong foreign participation, and the composite index rose 19.67 to 2,997.16, up 3.1 per cent on the week. JAKARTA gained 3.4 per cent on the week as the official index closed another upbeat day, 3.59 higher at 515.05</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 8 Mar (TANJUG) -- Nikola Koljevic, the  vice president of the Srpska republic, and Charles Redman, the  U.S. President's special envoy, today agreed that the Bosnian  Serbs should equitably and actively join the next phase of  negotiations on ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina initiated by an agreement  between the Muslims and Croats in Washington.    Koljevic and Redman today talked for about an hour in  Belgrade. They stated that they had discussed a method of  resuming negotiations so as to bring about an acceptable and  comprehensive solution rather than any concrete proposals.    Their press statements convey their shared view that peace  is  more certain in the wake of the Washington talks, with an  increasing possibility of reaching a global agreement.    Koljevic stressed that "this plan recognizes the Serb people  as being a constituent people with all rights, and that it will  be involved in the further peace process."    According to Koljevic, the Serb side has no political  proposal as yet, whereas whether and how the Bosnian Serbs will  join the Muslim-Croat federal agreement will be decided by the  Srpska republic's parliament.    Asked what the United States would do if the Serbs refused  the Washington plan, Redman said: "We will be working with all  sides to reach something that will be accepted and not refused."    Although the Serbs were not involved in the first stage of  negotiations on the plan, they nevertheless, in Redman's words,  "received some information and were given some documents. We  hope that in the second phase we will maintain close contacts  with the Serbs in the same way we have done with the Bosnian  Government and the Croats," Redman said.    In this context he noted that the aim of the first phase was  to secure an agreement between the Muslims and the Croats,  whereas in the second phase all three sides must be brought  together.    "What we have done so far was focused on speeding up the  process leading to a global agreement. It seems to me that now  we are in a better position to do so. We will continue to be  actively involved; the United States the European Union, the  Russian Federation, all three sides in Bosnia, and all countries  in the region. This will require huge efforts on the part of  all of us," the special U.S. envoy said.    Redman stressed that the peace process must not drag on for  months. "We are trying to do something within the next few  weeks," he said.    The Bosnian Serb vice president said that the first phase of  the Washington agreement was about eliminating flash points of  fighting and establishing a lasting peace.    "If you ask yourself what is the essence of the Washington  agreement between the Muslims and the Croats, the answer is that  it is the elimination of the flash points of fighting. Sarajevo  has been eliminated as a flash point of fighting between the  Serbs and the Muslims. Neum, as a contentious issue between the  Muslims and Croats, has been removed. Central Bosnia, as a  fighting flash point, has been eliminated or is in the process  of being eliminated," Koljevic said.    "All moves that are being made are aimed more at achieving  peace than imposing a solution. We will have to find a  political solution ourselves," he explained and added that the  right of a people to participate in this process and to make  decisions about itself cannot be denied by anyone.    Asked if the issue of the Bosnian Serbs joining the Bosnian  Federation, agreed on by the Croats and Muslims, was discussed,  Koljevic said that this, as well as the maps and other concrete  questions, would be discussed in the second phase of the peace  process.    He noted that the Serbs would raise the issue of the lifting  of sanctions as a precondition for embarking on the second phase  of the peace process. He recalled that the Serbs had accepted  the peace plan in Geneva which implied the lifting of sanctions,  and that everyone but the Muslims agreed to that plan.    Koljevic said the lifting of sanctions was linked to the  peace process and was very important for several reasons, two of  which were most important: "Only the lifting of sanctions can  completely discourage the militant groups in the Muslim  leadership, who are still planning a spring offensive. It would  also be a signal to the Serbs and Russians that the war flash  points are not going to spread, and that no military advantages  are trying to be achieved, but that the intention is really to  reach peace," Koljevic said.    The talks will resume at Sarajevo airport in two days, he  said. Redman has left Belgrade for Zagreb and is also expected  to go to Sarajevo.</p>

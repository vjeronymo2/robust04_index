			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Replacement side helps lift Anglian to Pounds 12.2m Buoyant demand for replacement windows helped Anglian Group, the double glazing company, increase pre-tax profits by 19 per cent to Pounds 12.2m in the six months to October 2. The self-proclaimed market leader said yesterday that a strong performance by its retail division pushed turnover up 18 per cent to Pounds 84m (Pounds 71.4m). The division, however, has come under increasing pressure to sustain the group following the loss of lucrative contracts with the recently privatised Property Services Agency. Turnover in the commercial division, which handled work for the PSA, declined 5 per cent and accounted for just 10 per cent of the half-year total. In the last financial year the value of Anglian's PSA contracts was estimated at Pounds 15m, representing about 75 per cent of the commercial division's business. Mr David Herman, group finance director, admitted yesterday that the privatisation - ending three years in which Anglian had enjoyed 'favoured status' with the PSA - was a blow for the company. 'It has increased the pressure on our retail business to make up the shortfall. If we get any work from the PSA's successors it will be a bonus,' he said. To shore up its commercial division, Anglian has pursued new local authority contracts. The move follows its Pounds 8.5m acquisition in March this year of New England Windows, which already supplies councils. NEW contributed Pounds 6.97m to turnover, but margins on public sector work are expected to shrink because spending cuts have forced councils to opt for low cost products. Mr Bill Hancock, chief executive, said the introduction of new products and a sales drive in Scotland, north west England and the Midlands would help the group 'continue its positive progress'. Mr Hancock also announced he will retire next September to make way for Mr Ron Swift, managing director of the Anglian Windows subsidiary. Earnings per share - restated on a pro-forma basis to take account of last year's flotation - were up from 8.5p to 9.1p and an interim dividend of 4.1p (3.7p) is declared. COMMENT Anglian's shares closed 22p lower at 331p, reflecting concern at the loss of the PSA business. However, the group's move to win local authority business was likely to soften the blow in the long-term. The continuing strength, meanwhile, of the retail division is expected to result in full year pre-tax profits of Pounds 26.6m, putting the shares on a forward multiple of 16.5. The group's ability to rely on its retail side should ensure continued growth, although uncertainty over price cutting by competitors could depress the share price further.</p>

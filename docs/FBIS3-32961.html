			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Relay from Concepcion by Manuela Robles] </F>   [Text] The key points of the speech by President Patricio  Aylwin during a luncheon at the Araucano Hotel, in Concepcion,  following the dedication of the oil pipeline between Neuquen  [Argentina] and Concepcion [Chile] dealt with strengthening the  historic friendship between the two countries and solving  controversies through agreements and the law. The inauguration  of this new project is highly significant from the integration  and economic viewpoint.    On this occasion the Chilean chief of state said:    We may have differences because brothers and friends are not  obliged to always share the same interests or think alike. But  we know how to overcome our disagreements by searching for  agreements or through procedures established by law for peaceful  solutions that will be mutually beneficial.    President Aylwin said that this is the path we have always  taken.    Argentine President Carlos Menem, in turn, thanked God for  allowing him to participate in this event. He praised Aylwin  and said that the Chilean people were marvelous. He also  referred to the Argentine bible, the gaucho bible, saying: As I  was telling Patricio, in Argentina we have another bible, the  gaucho bible entitled Martin Fierro by author Jose Hernandez  that in one of its paragraphs, probably paraphrasing God, says:  one of the first rules is that brothers should remain united  because if they fight among themselves they will be devoured by  others.    President Menem also voiced his hope that this climate of  understanding and unity shared by Chile and Argentina will  continue during the next Chilean administration, which will be  Peaded by Eduardo Frei. He noted that history has been very  generous with the two countries that this is the challenge they  face in the future.</p>

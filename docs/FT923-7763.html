			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: BOC lifts on market optimism REVIVED hope for the near term outlook of the London stock market was reflected in the strong rise of industrial gases group BOC yesterday. The company has no significant exposure to Germany whose better than expected inflation news prompted the rise in the UK market. Neither is it a stock that usually responds to economic optimism as it is perceived to have defensive attractions. However, on a day when the market was short of stock after a fall of seven consecutive days in the FT-SE 100 index there was a general scramble to buy. Tightly-traded BOC was also helped by recent encouraging figures and a subsequent rash of buy notes. Among securities houses recommending the stock Hoare Govett has been discussing its merits with Scottish institutions and Smith New Court has been pointing out recent underperformance. The shares jumped 20 to 620p. Cadbury easier Currency worries knocked Cadbury Schweppes as some observers fretted over the effect of a weak Australian dollar on company earnings. Some 15 per cent of operating profits are earned in Australia. Cadbury edged a penny lower at 441p. Yesterday, Smith New Court changed its stance from a buy to a hold and advised clients with more active funds to take profits. The house also completed its profits downgrades on Cadbury started on Thursday, forecasting Pounds 343m for this year, down Pounds 7m and Pounds 374m for 1993, a reduction of Pounds 14m. SG Warburg trimmed its 1992 estimates to Pounds 347m from Pounds 358m. Food manufacturers again came in for a bout of profit revisions as analysts continued their downgrades amid talk of sluggish sales and falling prices. Dalgety was among yesterday's victims, Credit Lyonnaise Laing reportedly trimming its estimates. The shares shed 6 to 390p. Low-cost food supplier Hillsdown fell 7 to 120p as James Capel was said to have cut its forecast. Talk of more downgrades in United Biscuits failed to materialise but unsettled the shares, which tumbled 7 to 294p. UB has been under pressure following worries over trading at its US subsidiary, Keebler. Magazine publisher Reed International was down as one agency broker pointed out the relative high price of the shares compared with its sector stablemate Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times. James Capel was suggesting that, in the short term, investors might benefit from switching some of their portfolio from Reed, the group having outperformed the All-Share index over the past year. Pearson, on the other hand has underperformed the market over the same period. Both companies are seen as solid pillars in the media sector but a number of analysts feel that the potential benefit of Pearson's stake in satellite TV group BSkyB has been overlooked. Reed was weak all day and closed 4 off at 471p, while Pearson rallied 3 to 325p. Insurers saw a two-way pull with some held back by worries over exposure to mortgage indemnity, while others benefited from recent positive results. Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance are the companies principally exposed to covering lenders against losses on sales of repossessed homes. Royal managed a gain of only a penny to 166p, despite a buy recommendation from County NatWest which says the stock is 36 per cent below a projected end-of-year net asset value of 255p. Sun Alliance fell 5 to 242p following a press report yesterday which said Sun has more than 20 per cent share of the domestic mortgage indemnity market. Meanwhile, General Accident jumped a further 22 to 440p following encouraging results on Tuesday, while Commercial Union recorded a rise of 19 to 477p after good results on Wednesday. Tobacco and insurance group BAT Industries jumped 23 to 723p. International conglomerate BTR experienced a volatile session. The shares shed 5 to 420p early in the day after broker Smith New Court trimmed its current and following year profits forecasts for the group. Smith downgraded the current year figure by Pounds 20m to Pounds 930m, and that of the following year by Pounds 35m to Pounds 1,075m, blaming weakness of the Australian dollar. However, the shares bounced back with the market to end 7 up at 420p, on the day, with turnover reaching 3.5m. English China Clays jumped 25 to 482p with demand boosted late in the session by an announcement that the company is to sell its waste disposal subsidiary. Thursday's buy recommendation from Smith New Court continued to boost Tomkins where the shares gained another 6 to 422p. Selected building stocks, which have been among the hardest hit as the market has fallen, bounced strongly. RMC jumped 11 to 460p, Tarmac 5 to 64p, Barratt 6 to 54p, Mowlem 8 to 62p and Raine, helped by a push from Hoare Govett, 9 to 89p. Glassmaker Pilkington also surged 8 to 87p making it the best performing stock in the FT-SE 100 in percentage terms. Disappointment over the estimated level of oil reserves in the Cusiana field in Colombia held back BP, which is the operator of the field and holds a 40 per cent stake. The shares were down 5 in early trade against a strong market and closed unchanged at 187 1/2 p. News from Bimec Industries, the aerospace, waste products and engineering group, that it will not pay a final dividend, took the market by surprise, sending the shares tumbling. They closed 12 3/4 down at 6 1/4 p, with one analyst commenting: 'Too many questions remain unanswered.' A stock overhang in Hartstone caused a sharp retreat in the shares. They gave up 16 to 129p. Talk that some brokers were about to drop profit estimates for Greenalls upset shares in the regional brewer, which were off 7 at the close at 364p. Grand Met continued its bounce, helped by a renewed push from County NatWest, the shares jumping 8 to 425p. The stock was also helped by consideration of the North American Free Trade Pact, the company having interests in the Mexican market. Also helped were Allied Lyons, up 6 at 603p, and Guinness, ahead 4 at 507p. Chemicals group British Vita rose 7 to 231p, benefiting from a buy recommendation by Kleinwort Benson ahead of interim results on September 7. The securities house pointed to recent underperformance in the shares over the past three months and expects positive acquisitions in the next year. Waste management group Attwood was held back after US investment house Alex. Brown and Sons cut its rating on the company to neutral from buy and lowered its 1992 and 1993 earnings estimates. The shares were unchanged at 109p. US buying of pharmaceuticals group Medeva was said to be behind a rise of 18 to 176p. Smith New Court reiterated its buy stance on the stock saying that currency worries had been overdone. Spurious talk that Forte was close to a deal on catering subsidiary Gardner Merchant were dismissed by sources close to the company. The shares rose 6 to 133p.

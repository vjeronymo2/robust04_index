			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Bossi threatens budget debate fight: The Northern League leader's war of nerves The unity of Italy's fractious right-wing coalition faces a vital test later this week when discussion of the 1995 budget begins in the chamber of deputies. Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League, has been waging a war of nerves with his coalition partners during a month of haggling over budget details at the commission stage. Now Mr Bossi has pledged to raise the stakes by threatening to embarrass the government in the chamber. The League has the largest number of deputies in the coalition, and in commission negotiations sided on several occasions with the opposition against the government. However, the League's much publicised threat to reduce the scope of pension cuts - a central element of the planned saving in public spending - was never carried out. The budget commission approved the final form of the 1995 budget, plus a special accompanying law, on Monday. This respects the government's original broad objective of finding L50,000bn (Pounds 20bn) in fresh revenues and, through spending cuts, to hold the 1995 public sector deficit down to 8 per cent of GDP. Mr Bossi has nevertheless hinted that the skirmishes in the commission were merely a foretaste of what would occur in open parliamentary debate. He is still furious that his candidates for one of the two Italian commissioners to the EU were overlooked last weekend. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, snubbed the League and chose Ms Emma Bonino, pushed by the small Radical grouping of Mr Marco Panella. The League leader's behaviour is conditioned by a growing fear that he is being outmanoeuvred and marginalised within the coalition by Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco Fini. Forza Italia and the MSI/National Alliance are moving increasingly close together. As a result the League risks losing its federalist identity within the coalition, while being dragged too much to the right. The fight to retain the League's identity becomes increasingly important as limited local elections are scheduled for the end of the month. Within the League, Mr Bossi's intemperate behaviour and constant fights with his coalition allies have begun to cause serious strains. Three deputies have already left the League parliamentary group to sit as independents and more are threatening to desert. Mr Roberto Maroni, the interior minister and senior League figure in the government, shows signs of growing impatience with Mr Bossi. Mr Maroni's skilful diplomacy has been largely responsible for not only mediating between Mr Bossi and Mr Berlusconi, but also for keeping the League MPs together. But this week he openly criticised Mr Bossi for making life so difficult for the League ministers by his sniping at the government from outside.</p>

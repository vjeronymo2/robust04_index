			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Wakeham set to head press body Lord Wakeham, the former leader of the House of Lords, has emerged as favourite to succeed Lord McGregor as chairman of the Press Complaints Commission. Lord McGregor, who is 73, is expected to retire from the newspaper and magazine industry's self-regulation body early next year although his contract runs to the end of next year. The exact timing of his departure has not yet been decided. The Press Standards Board of Finance, which has the task of finding a new chairman for the commission, has been using Spencer Stuart, the executive search group. Lord Wakeham, who left the government in the July reshuffle, was top of the list submitted by the headhunters. A formal decision is expected later this week. However, recent tension between the press and the government over allegations of 'sleaze' has raised concern about the wisdom of appointing a former senior Conservative politician to the sensitive post. But those who argue that Lord Wakeham's political connections might be valuable in managing the often turbulent relations between press and politicians - and the possibility of press legislation - are likely to be in the majority. Lord Wakeham is seen as having an open mind on the press and has in the past restrained those most keen on statutory intervention on press standards. If Lord Wakeham is not chosen, or does not want the job, the most likely successor to Lord McGregor would probably be Professor Robert Pinker, the commission's privacy commissioner.</p>

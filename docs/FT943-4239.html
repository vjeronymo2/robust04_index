			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Jardine role in Pakistan telecom deal Jardine Fleming International has been appointed joint global co-ordinator and book-runner, together with Muslim Commercial Bank of Pakistan, of a placing of 5m vouchers, exchangeable into shares, of Pakistan Telecommunications Corp (PTC), the country's monopoly telephone service. A book-building process is now under way and it is believed that the shares could eventually be placed at between Rps4,500 and Rps5,500 each. The issue is expected to raise approximately Dollars 750m for the Pakistan government. The vouchers will be convertible into shares when the PTC is converted into a privatised company sometime in the next two years. The move follows a domestic placing of shares, at Rps3,000 each, which was completed last week. Demand was reported to be strong and the placing is said to have raised about Dollars 100m.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Yeltsin apologises over POWs PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday moved to patch up relations with Japan, on the first day of an official visit that had been expected to produce scant progress. Mr Yeltsin pleasantly surprised his Japanese hosts by making a spontaneous apology for 600,000 prisoners held in Siberia after the second world war and by acknowledging the existence of Japan's claim on four islands annexed by Soviet troops at the end of the war. The apology 'will be extremely significant in building the foundation for the spiritual and psychological reconciliation of our two peoples,' said Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister. Mr Yeltsin's readiness to discuss the islands, through a twice yearly meeting of foreign ministers 'goes beyond what was said before' and is 'the basis for further negotiations,' said a foreign ministry official. The dispute has prevented Russia and Japan from signing a post-war peace treaty. Tokyo has made large-scale economic aid to Russia dependent on progress on the islands, though officials said yesterday no further pledges were envisaged for the moment. The Kurile islands are popular symbols of slighted pride in Japan and the source of Japanese mistrust of Russia, seen as an opportunistic aggressor in the war. Some Japanese officials had expected deadlock over the islands when the Russian leader announced, just before leaving Moscow, that he hoped Tokyo would not spoil the visit by raising the issue. In recognition of this progress yesterday, Mr Hosokawa accepted an invitation to visit Moscow. Mr Hosokawa was the first to raise the territorial problem by telling Mr Yeltsin that it was 'an objective fact' that the islands were 'inherent territories' of Japan. Mr Yeltsin replied that he appreciated the existence of the problem and said Russia took responsibility for treaties between the former Soviet Union and Tokyo. Japanese government officials interpret that to include a 1956 joint declaration in which Moscow offered to return two of the islands and negotiate on the other two. Mr Yeltsin also promised to withdraw the remaining 5,000 Russian troops stationed on the islands. Separately, he agreed to start joint research on Soviet dumping of nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan. Mr Hosokawa gave no clear answer to Mr Yeltsin's request for further rescheduling of Russia's Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1bn) debt to Japan, beyond saying he understood the importance of this, given Russia's own importance to the global economy. Russia and Japan should continue economic co-operation, Mr Hosokawa said, citing as examples a Dollars 200m optical fibre telecom link between Moscow and the Russian far east and oil and gas development in Sakhalin.</p>

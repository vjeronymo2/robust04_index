			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Letter: Energy price pressures Sir, Juliet Sychrava is in danger of raising false hopes when she says ('Election 1992: Outcome crucial for British Coal', April 3) that competition from gas and imported coal would be welcomed in some quarters 'because it will put pressure on British Coal prices and thus on electricity prices'. Imported coal at current prices and exchange rates does indeed put pressure on British Coal prices (but not necessarily on electricity prices; British Coal Corporation's 30 per cent real price reduction over the last six years has hardly been reflected in electricity prices). However, the introduction of gas-based generation on a large scale will not bring the same price pressure for the simple reason that it will be more expensive than the coal alternative. This was one of the points taken up by the Energy Select Committee in its recent report. The 'dash for gas' may result in further price pressure on British Coal as the section of the fuelling market in which we compete is reduced in size. This will not, I fear, necessarily lead to lower prices for electricity consumers. J N Clarke, British Coal Corporation, Hobart House, Grosvenor Place, London SW1X 7AE</p>

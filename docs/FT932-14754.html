			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Recovery hopes lift Steel SHARES IN British Steel consolidated their recent recovery after two securities houses turned more positive and one predicted the company would return to profit this year. Having doubled in value to become the best performer in the FT-SE 100 index over the first quarter, Steel's shares jumped 5 to 91p yesterday on turnover of 8.1m. SG Warburg told clients that steel price increases announced on Tuesday, and the prospect of more to come in October, would prompt a turnaround in the group's figures. Warburg expects a loss for the year to March 1993 but is more optimistic about current-year performance and predicts a Pounds 70m profit against its previous estimate of a Pounds 30m loss. In addition, James Capel reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock. The agency broker expects Steel to report a loss of around Pounds 150m for the year to March 1993 but break even this year. While several other brokers remain cautious, dealers said there was a reluctance to sell the shares.</p>

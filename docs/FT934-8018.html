			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Bangkok Land down in quarter THAILAND'S biggest listed property company, Bangkok Land, reported second quarter consolidated net profits of Bt1.502bn (Dollars 55.9m) yesterday, slightly down on last year's Bt1.575bn. Half-year profits were slightly higher at Bt2.911bn, up from Bt2,275bn in the same period last year. Hoare Govett's Mr Niel Semple said his Bt4.7bn forecast looked achievable. However, with perhaps USDollars 800m in accounts receivable from home buyers yet to move into their homes in the ambitious company's property developments, and who have paid only a fraction of the price, there remains some doubt about the strength of earnings. Tanayong, a rival property company, also controlled by the powerful Sino-Thai Kanjanapas family, reported second quarter consolidated net profits of Bt100m, making Bt150m for the half year. Like Bangkok Land, it seems to have selling problems with its core property venture on the outskirts of Bangkok.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Andrzej Drzycimski, press spokesman for </F> President Lech Walesa, by Andrzej Woyciechowski at the Radio Zet  studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of Radio Zet" program--live]    [Text] [Woyciechowski] Radio Zet's guest today is Minister  Andrzej Drzycimski--good morning to you.    [Drzycimski] Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.    [Woyciechowski] What is new at the Belvedere?    [Drzycimski] I think it is raining outside.    [Woyciechowski] Yes, that is unusual for this time of year.    The press has been writing a lot for the past few  days--actually, for the past few weeks, but, in the past few  days, more has been written about it, as it were, and in a more  nervous manner--about the issue of appointing deputy ministers  in the so-called presidential ministries--that is, the Defense  Ministry [MON], the Internal Affairs Ministry [MSW], and the  Foreign Ministry. The press reports today that Kwasniewski is  supposed to meet Pawlak, who will make a decision on whether to  appoint the deputy ministers. Meanwhile, press commentaries  speak of the president being absolutely opposed to having  coalition candidates appointed as deputy ministers. Would you...    [Drzycimski] If I could just make a minor comment here. The  president has spoken out on the issue many times already, so let  me just remind you of what the president has already said, and  he upholds all that: The president is absolutely against making  the three ministries political. What does it mean? It means  that, as it were ex officio, or that we... [Drzycimski changes  thought] It means that we adopt the principle that coalition  representatives are included in the three ministries [as  heard]--that is, because he says that would lead to absurd  situations, even in the current form, where the coalition has  just two ingredients. What if we were to have....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You mean like six or seven  more  joining in?    [Drzycimski] No, but even if we were to see just two more  ingredients joining the coalition. After all, the coalition can  possibly widen its scope. So, in that case, we would have in  these three ministries, which are key to the state's  functioning, at least four, five, six, or even eight....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Mr. Minister, but is that  opposition by the president absolute? Is this opposition to the  principle or [words indistinct]    [Drzycimski] Yes, it is his opposition to the principle that  the coalition kind of automatically introduces....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Introduces their own men?  Could  one therefore....    [Drzycimski, interrupting] And why is that? It is because  those ministries that determine the state's efficient  functioning would immediately be made political, and even the  most minor type of conflict within the coalition--that has to be  said out loud--would immediately have an impact on those  ministries that must be of a very stable nature. They have to be  characterized by a high level of peacefulness. They have to work  for the long term. We cannot have those ministries working for  immediate goals only. Our experience so far in these three or  four years....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] These are not very good  experiences, especially with regard to MON and the MSW.    [Drzycimski] These are not very good experiences, and that  is  even more reason for the president to.... [pauses] But he also  adds immediately what he always says: That does not mean that we  are against anyone who is in fact an expert or who has this or  that kind of professional expertise or license, or who belongs  to this or that kind of [word indistinct]....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Do I understand it correctly?  Could one understand what you are saying to mean that the  president would not mind having deputy ministers who would just  happen to be members of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] or the  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], as long as the president  approves of their appointments? Is this whole issue about his  approval?    [Drzycimski] No, it is not. This is not about the president  insisting on approving anyone. The president avoids speaking out  on... [Drzycimski changes thought] What he means is the  principle itself. He will be supporting the ministries' chiefs  in their efforts to maintain the principle. That is because it  is a kind of principle that must be clearly defined, or else we  will be constantly having a situation of a very unstable process  of cabinet formation--that is one issue. Another is that  decisions regarding personnel appointments in a ministry are not  made by the president but by the individual ministry's chief....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That is to say the prime  minister--I am sorry, I mean the minister--after consulting the  prime minister?    [Drzycimski] Exactly. The president just means the principle  that he wants to see observed.    [Woyciechowski] Does it mean that the prime minister cannot  make that decision on his own without the consent of [word  indistinct] minister?    [Drzycimski] In theory, he can appoint a minister, but I do  not think that would be an example to be followed. That would  rather tend to indicate some kind of tension occurring.    [Woyciechowski] From what we know at this stage, [Defense]  Minister Kolodziejczyk threatens in definite terms that he will  resign in that situation, but [Internal Affairs] Minister  Milczanowski says he could possibly agree. We all know that the  post of deputy minister responsible for the Fire Guard is vacant  in the MSW.    [Drzycimski] There is also a vacancy in MON, and, as far as  I know, Minister Kolodziejczyk is currently looking for the  right man, who would like to take up this very important  ministry. As far as I can recall, someone there is about to  retire, and there will be a vacancy, except that....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But is he looking for a  candidate within the PSL and the SLD, or in other places?    [Drzycimski] No, he is just looking for the right man, who  would take upon himself issues that are important in terms of  being in charge of MON, and that is an open issue.    [Woyciechowski] And what about [Foreign] Minister  Olechowski?    [Drzycimski] I am not aware of his making any changes  whatsoever. As far as I know, there are more important issues on  the agenda right now....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] In a word--NATO?    [Drzycimski] Yes.    [Woyciechowski] What will happen during the NATO summit on  Monday [10 January]? Is there any chance whatsoever of NATO  changing its position on Poland and of opening itself up more?  Could that possibly happen during these next few days?    [Drzycimski] I think anything could happen, even though I am  sure some fundamental decisions have already been made. Despite  that, there were some measures and statements made by Western  and also U.S. politicians. These are proof of efforts being made  right now to come up with a [hesitating] safety valve of some  kind, for the purpose of possible future solutions. A sudden  trip that is scheduled to take place in the next few days by  some high-ranking representatives of the U.S. administration is  also proof of that, as well as some statements made by German  politicians and also the recent visit by [Foreign] Minister  Olechowski to Germany. After all, that was the first visit to  Germany in the New Year, and it is no accident that the German  foreign minister decided to invite Minister Olechowski and not  someone else. The purpose was to discuss precisely those issues.  The president keeps speaking. Some of his recent statements are  very characteristic here. They are quite widely heard. I think  that also has an effect in terms of providing information. Too  often, we have been examining these issues from the standpoint  of: We do not mean anything. But, in fact, we do. Let us not  hide ourselves. We are a nation of 40 million people or so. We  are a European country of medium size, but we are a very  important stabilizing factor in Europe and the kind of factor  where the Central European transformations are advanced the  furthest and where they resulted in some victories, but also,  naturally, in all kinds of slipups. That is unavoidable. Still,  we are heading down a path where nobody can accuse us of  deviating from the main path even a centimeter--I mean the main  path of striving to achieve democracy, to establish democratic  structures, and to create a complete basis for a democratic  country, and also the fact that we have been trying very  persistently to establish a market economy, which, in the long  run, creates chances for our becoming a country that is capable  of joining Europe's normal economic arrangements--I mean Europe  as a whole. And, on that issue, the president has been saying in  very outright terms that the views that are being voiced by us  from Warsaw are full of anxiety: Let us not allow a repetition  of what happened in the not-very- distant past. Let us not  forget that....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] The president used very  ominous  comparisons in his interview for the BBC yesterday when he made  analogies to 1939. Is that really the situation now? Is it  really dangerous?    [Drzycimski] By the way, the president has spoken out on  this  many times. Let me remind you of the interviews for LA STAMPA  and THE WASHINGTON POST, yesterday's interview for the BBC--I  mean, for BBC Television--and also his talks with politicians.  It is not an issue that occurred this month; it occurred much  earlier than that. That is because he can see that, in the  course of this great revolution that was accomplished  bloodlessly, we managed to break one of the cruelest systems the  human race ever created. It happened without a war and in a way  I would describe as outright marvelous. And the Western world,  which was incredibly interested in the process, the whole world  was watching attentively to what was happening; one could say,  metaphorically speaking, that the Berlin Wall was being  demolished from both sides: On our side and on the West's side.  And then the Wall crumbled. But we failed to create anything new  in its place, except one thing: We built a united Germany. But  there was no structure or vision of the future created or  suggestions made. What is the result of that? There are  established what politicians call gray areas or empty fields. So  we are now, as it were, between two....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Between a united Germany, on  the one hand, and Zhirinovskiy on the other?    [Drzycimski] Not just a united Germany; I would say Europe  as  a whole, which decided to take a standstill position that is  quite comfortable for them, waiting for an outcome of the  battle. It is not the case that the battle will result in an  outcome all by itself, or that it will be fought only at a  roundtable, at which one can conduct debates. In fact, the  battle will be fought through all kinds of choices that will be  made and through decisions that the individual nations will  make. These decisions can vary a great deal; even the Russian  election results are proof of that. And that is why the  president says: Let us not repeat the mistake. Moreover, it is  also a warning addressed to the West against, through its  avoidance of inconvenience, making the same mistake as the  politicians of the period between the two World Wars made, as  well as during World War II--namely, that they were willing to  come to agreement with one another.    [Woyciechowski] In other words, sacrifice Poland, even  though it may sound cruel?    [Drzycimski] That is right. This is why the president uses  such strong words; it is a warning--a warning that cannot be  underestimated. Then no one will be able to tell us that we said  nothing and that we withdrew, as it were. I would like to add  one more thing: Please note that these words of the president  are very easily understood in the West. Now, look at our mass  media; we are now talking about it a few days before the event.  This is not a problem that arose today. Do we see any serious  texts in the Polish press, in the Polish mass media, such as  television or the radio, that are concerned with this problem?  Everyone, as it were.... [pauses] When the president discusses  this, in Poland....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Everyone is silent, whereas  the  West quotes the president. Mr. Minister, why do you think the  West is blocking Poland's access to NATO so strongly? Has the  change of the governing coalition affected this in any way? Or  perhaps it was the election in Russia and Zhirinovskiy? Or was  it something else?    [Drzycimski] No, no. I mean, the Polish elections probably  affected this the least. After these few months we can....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] We can see that nothing has  changed?    [Drzycimski] The world became convinced that we are still  proceeding on this tough road. Incidentally, the president said  that there would be no changes in the two [word indistinct]: The  road to democracy and the road to a market economy. The rest may  be discussed: Should we go more to the right or more to the  left? The Polish elections also convinced the West that we are  on the right road and that it is a normal process: Sometimes you  are closer to this side, sometimes closer to the other side. Of  course, we also have our own peculiarities. However, generally,  when someone is observing Poland from the outside....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Did, then, the Russian  elections and Zhirinovskiy.... [pauses] Did Zhirinovskiy scare  the West?    [Drzycimski] No, the West is simply a little selfish. What  was achieved in Warsaw during the talks between the two  presidents, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Polish President  Lech Walesa, this famous signature under the declaration of both  presidents, whereby Russia stated that it could see no reason  that Poland and other countries should not enter NATO....  [pauses] In other words, the artificial hindrance was taken  away....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] However, Yeltsin changed his  mind later on.    [Drzycimski] Yes, he did. Why did he do that? That is very  simple: Would you not do the same if you felt someone's weak  spot? Just as in the Leninist rule: Push until you meet some  resistance. This is the element that appeared; that is, the West  yielded, as it were, and it decided that Russia could submit its  conditions. Now, we are asking: To whom is it submitting its  conditions? To us? We are not afraid. We realize that, for  Russia, Poland is perhaps one of the elements. The West, being  richer, is definitely more interesting to Russia. There lies the  problem that Russia would have to tackle. Thus, the ball has  been thrown not on our ground but on the ground of the West. It  is the West and NATO that must answer whether they want it or  not. If the West answers that it is ready to listen to Russia's  demands, it means that the 16 states that make up NATO accept  the dictate that is imposed upon them.    Apart from that, if we are talking about partnership, about  the U.S. "Partnership for Peace" project, which is good,  interesting, and important, we are prepared to accept it--on one  condition, however: on the condition that it is followed by  concrete solutions and that it is not a nebula that we are being  offered now. This decision must be made independently by the  NATO states. The decisions, which also seem to be suggested by  statements of NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner....  [pauses] That this pact realizes the historic moment we have  found ourselves in. The future of Europe will be decided here:  whether we will strive to recreate the confrontative system or  attempt to construct a new, open, and uniting Europe. This is  the question: divisions, the bipolar system, a policy of calling  up the demons from the past, even the demons of the various  -isms that Europe has already gone through, such as Stalinism,  Hitlerism--the former, ice-cold Siberian camps, the latter,  crematories. These are certain signs that we must not forget.    We can argue whether history repeats itself. I am a  historian, and I can tell you that there are certain trends.  However, in such moments as the present one, it is a moment that  is a warning, a challenge, and it forces us to answer the  following question: What Europe do we want to have--a bipolar  Europe or a common Europe? We would like a common Europe, a  Europe that is open, not characterized by enmity, not against  Russia, and interested in the future as the greatest challenge.  This is what we are going to bring up in all of the talks, and  what President Walesa will perhaps discuss with President  Clinton in Prague.    [Woyciechowski] Do commentators wonder whether President  Walesa will receive on Friday [7 January] Ms. Albright, a  special envoy of President Clinton, and General Shalikashvili?  Will he receive them?    [Drzycimski] If they arrive in Poland, I believe he....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] If they come to Poland, he  will  receive them. Mr. Minister, can we say now that the most  important issue for Poland today, for the next few months or  maybe longer, is the issue of Poland's admittance to NATO? Is it  a fundamental issue?    [Drzycimski] Well, we must explain a few things fully. We  are  talking about Poland's admission to NATO. This admission will  not be automatic. It will be a certain process. It will consist  of certain stages....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You mean political decisions  that....    [Drzycimski, interrupting] Political decisions. I mean a  decision that we are in Europe, in Western Europe. This is what  we want.    [Woyciechowski] These are fundamental decisions?    [Drzycimski] Yes, these are fundamental decisions.    [Woyciechowski] Let us change the subject for a while. Does  President Walesa know the name of his future rival in the  presidential elections? Can he guess who it will be?    [Drzycimski] President Walesa has not made the decision  yet....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Whether he himself will run?    [Drzycimski] Yes, whether he himself will run. I can say  that  he does not know the name of a possible candidate because he is  not interested in this issue at the moment. He believes that  something else is important: If this functioning democratic  system starts to defend itself, if it begins to be efficient,  then he, as a man of breakthroughs, will complete his mission.    [Woyciechowski] And what will he do? Go fishing?    [Drzycimski] Yes, he will go fishing. However, if it does  not  function, if there appear smaller or greater inefficiencies....  [pauses] We do not lack only a constitution; we also do not have  a fully developed system of the functioning of the state. We  have created two poles: the legislative pole and the executive  pole. The Small Constitution resolves these problems. However,  we still do not have the judiciary pole; this is a basis for  every democratic state. Even the latest presidential bill on the  Constitutional Tribunal--that is, on the superiority of the  tribunal in all decisions.... [pauses] As we know, when both  parties were in opposition, the bill was supported by them  wholeheartedly. Now that they....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What do they want?    [Drzycimski] They want to postpone it. There are many such  elements. These are the fundamental issues, and this is what the  president focuses his attention on: on building a structural  system of the state. He wants to resolve the following problem:  Are we going to build a state of a parliamentary-cabinet nature,  which we have experienced, and the experiences were not always  very pleasant? Or are we going to support the idea of stronger  executive authorities? The president proposes a  presidential-parliamentary system, with full democratic  protection mechanisms. This must be clear. The president  believes that, in such a difficult moment, a difficult moment of  changing the systems, we will need a strong decisionmaking  center for a long time. This center must be able to make  important decisions--not in a peaceful situation. We must look  at constitutional solutions in the following way: If something  bad happens, then what? Who will make the decision?    In the past three years, we have already seen a few  situations that required some decisions. I would like to see the  decisions made in the configuration that we have had so far. I  fear that there would have been enormous difficulties.  Therefore, Poland is seen as a stable country, in the external  sense. Within Poland, we have our own internal misgivings: We  want this or that to be better. This is a very good point; it  means that we have not stopped. However, Poland is seen as a  stable country also because it has a center that makes key  decisions for the state. We may argue, discuss, tackle all  subjects; however, when a decision needs to be made, we are  among those who make it, and we do it courageously.    [Drzycimski] There is always someone, Mr. Minister, who can  recall the prime minister and dissolve the parliament?    [Woyciechowski] Well, but I also meant the present  situation.  I meant the discussion on the future of NATO. It was the  president who started this huge debate for Europe, in August of  this year [as heard]. It was the president who forced the West  to answer the question of what direction we would go in. It is  the president who now forces others to answer the following  question: What kind of Europe do we want to have--a bipolar  Europe or an open Europe? These are the fundamental  controversies that perhaps right now seem quite remote and too  complicated to an ordinary citizen. However, this also entails  another problem: Will foreign capital come to Poland? If we have  those political protection mechanisms provided by NATO, we will  have the guarantee that capital, new technologies, and cultural  goods will come more readily. An entirely new platform would  then open up before us. This is the strategy that the president  has adopted. It is not a strategy for a year or two. Some people  say that the president is losing popularity. It is not  popularity like that of Miss Polonia contests. I apologize to my  colleagues who....    [Drzycimski, interrupting] To your colleague, the prime  minister's spokesperson?    [Woyciechowski] No, that is not what I meant. I meant those  who deal with these problems. Well, now, we do not participate  in any contests. The president looks at a strategy that does not  include just a year or two; it is a long-term strategy. In those  three years that the president has been in office, we could not  find any elements that were evident mistakes of the president.  Even his greatest adversaries could not say that he violated the  law or that he destroyed the state. They are simply not able to  say anything like this. They can speak about other matters but  not these. This proves that, if President Lech Walesa decides to  run for the office of president again, he has some experience,  and he can say: This is what I have done. If you want, you can  accept me. If you do not want to do that, without any apparent  cause, this will be a decision of the people, just like the  September elections were a decision of the people. This is the  ultimate decision. The president, as a man who builds the rules  of democracy, believes that everyone must submit to such a  decision, no matter whether he agrees or not. This is a decision  made in the elections. I only hope that we will all respect such  rules.    [Drzycimski] Thank you, Mr. Minister, for the interview.    [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much.</p>

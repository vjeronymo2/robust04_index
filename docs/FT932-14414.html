			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Company directors accused of greed THE HEAD of Britain's largest organisation representing managers has accused company directors and managers of greed after a survey by the organisation showed that they received higher average pay increases than their employees last year. The survey, to be published today by the Institute of Management, finds that directors' sal-aries rose 5.5 per cent on average, while managers' pay increased 4.5 per cent. Directors' increases exceeded 10 per cent in some sectors. Mr Roger Young, director-general of the institute, said: 'Directors and to a lesser extent managers are still receiving rises well over the rate of inflation, even though up and down the country other employees are being forced to take pay cuts and pay freezes. 'This situation cannot continue. Directors and senior managers must be seen to take a lead when it comes to pay restraint if we are to beat this recession. Employees are being asked to accept pay freezes and cuts - greedy managers and directors should be prepared to swallow the same medicine.' The biggest increase, 15.3 per cent, was for directors in chemicals and allied industries. Other large average rises were 12.4 per cent for directors in the public sector, 11.6 per cent in distribution and 10.9 per cent in energy. This year the government is seeking a 1.5 per cent pay rise limit on workers in the public sector. Managers in mechanical engineering and production received an average 9.6 per cent rise, while those in electrical engineering secured 8.2 per cent and consultants 7.4 per cent. The institute's survey covers 25,180 individuals in 392 companies employing more than 2m people. Details, Page 9</p>

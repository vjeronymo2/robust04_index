			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Beijing official for Taipei China is to despatch its chief Taiwan negotiator to Taipei later this month, making him the most senior mainland official to set foot on the island since the two parts of China split in 1949. In an apparent easing in cross-strait ties, Taipei and Beijing have agreed to resume talks over fishing disputes and repatriation of illegal immigrants and airline hijackers. Mr Chiao Jen-ho, Taiwan's chief China negotiator, yesterday welcomed the planned July 27 visit to Taipei by his Beijing counterpart, Mr Tang Shubei, who notified Taipei late on Tuesday of his intention to accept its invitation. The news came as China responded to a recent Taiwanese white paper, by saying Beijing 'firmly opposed' any moves 'detrimental to China's territorial sovereignty and the cause of peaceful reunification'.</p>

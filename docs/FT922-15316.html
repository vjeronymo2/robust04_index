			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / World Trade News: Brussels warns US over suits against EC steelmakers BRUSSELS yesterday warned the US not to use the end of its quantitative curbs on steel imports to launch anti-dumping and subsidy suits against EC steelmakers. Such action would endanger remaining hopes for the EC, the US and more than 20 other steel-producing countries to conclude a Multilateral Steel Agreement (MSA), disciplining world trade in this commodity. The planned deadline for an MSA - to replace the expiring 'voluntary restraint agreements' (VRAs) on steel exports to the US - ran out on Tuesday, but negotiators have agreed to meet again. Dumping actions had been used by the US in the past to 'bomb' countries into agreeing to VRAs, an EC official said. The dollar's weakness against European currencies has put 'a number of EC steel exporters, particularly those selling into the American market on long-term contracts, in a situation of technical dumping' (selling abroad more cheaply than at home), the official said. But US companies would have great difficulty proving they had been injured by imports from the EC, which had fallen back to 5-6m tonnes a year from their 1989 peak of 7m tonnes, rather than slump in the US, he said. The EC had so cracked down on state aid to European steelmakers that American anti-subsidy action, in the form of countervailing duties, might only succeed in the case of a very few Spanish and Italian companies. For this reason, Italy is the only EC country to say it would prefer the US to continue VRAs on steel imports, if the alternative is to let the Washington trade lawyers loose. By the time the MSA talks ended on Tuesday, EC officials say negotiators had agreed on zero tariffs and on a long list of forbidden non-tariff barriers, with the exception of public procurement restrictions which the US refused to waive. Negotiators had also agreed, in principle, to permit state aid to steel companies for R &amp; D, environment, and plant closure purposes. But the US refused to exempt such aids from possible anti-subsidy action under its national trade law.</p>

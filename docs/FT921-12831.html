			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (1): The early shoot catches the frost - Keynote / Amid election jitters, the prospect of lower inflation and interest rates points to gilts THOSE GREEN shoots of economic recovery never appeared in the autumn, as chancellor of the exchequer Norman Lamont claimed. Will they appear in the spring? And if they do, will they be frostbitten by some chilly pre-election winds? Certainly, the final quarter of 1991 turned out to be disappointing for British investors. As measured by the All-Share Index, the equity market fell by 6 per cent during the October-December period, and sentiment became thoroughly depressed before a freak Christmas and New Year rally to some extent restored the balance. The market jumped by more than 5 per cent in the last week of the year. It was influenced in this by the strength of Wall Street. US equities remained comfortably ahead, with the Dow Jones Average up about 5 per cent during the final quarter, and hitting new highs at the year-end. The disparity in performance on the opposite sides of the Atlantic was all to do with interest rates. While the Americans continued to slash the cost of money in order to stimulate the economy - with the official Discount Rate falling to 3 1/2 per cent, the lowest in a quarter of a century - the European markets were steeped in gloom, emanating mostly from the Frankfurt headquarters of Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank. On December 19, after the Maastricht European summit was safely over, the Bundesbank raised its own discount rate by an unexpectedly large 1/2 per cent to 8 per cent, the highest for many years. The Bundesbank is determined to neutralise the acute inflationary pressures which have resulted from the reunification of the country in 1990 and have pushed inflation above 4 per cent. But this tough medicine is entirely inappropriate for most other countries of the European Community, which are already in recession. This certainly applies to the UK. Bank base rates failed to fall from 10 1/2 per cent throughout the fourth quarter of 1991, despite a fall in UK inflation to 3.7 per cent at one stage and despite disappointing figures from the real economy. The third-quarter GDP statistics indicated that the onshore economy was continuing to shrink, although buoyant North Sea oil production allowed Mr Lamont to claim a 'technical' recovery because overall GDP showed a tiny rise for the quarter. Throughout the final quarter, economic indicators such as new car registrations, house prices and retail sales showed that the economy was very flat. Hopes of a revival in the banking system were dashed as it became clear that bad debts were piling up at least as fast as they had in 1990. The crash of the Robert Maxwell empire, leaving debts of about Pounds 2bn in question, highlighted the risks faced by the financial sector. In the troubled housing sector, repossessions mounted alarmingly, although a special package of measures agreed between the building societies and the government just before Christmas is designed to prevent a disastrous 'meltdown' during 1992. Overstretched borrowers will, in many cases, be helped to stay in their homes, at least for the time being. But house prices have stayed weak. Towards the end of the year, sterling began to come under pressure on the foreign exchanges, and although the British government refused to follow German interest rates upwards, as many other EC member governments did, the clouds were gathering. A sterling crisis could be a serious blow for prime minister John Major as he faces the inevitability of a general election during the next few months. Election jitters seem bound to be an increasing problem for the stock market. In any case, equity prices have been held back by disappointment over the extent of industrial recovery. Early in 1991, there were hopes that a profits revival would be well under way by the end of the year. But earnings per share seem likely to have dropped by at least 12 per cent, with hopes of an upturn postponed well into this year. At least dividends generally remained solid in 1992, increasing on average by a little over 5 per cent. But dividend cover is now historically very low. For investors, the election is the big immediate issue, and they should seek to reduce their vulnerability to high taxation should Labour win. But they must also consider the fundamental changes that are continuing to take place as the British economy slowly adjusts to the commitment of sterling to the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System some 15 months ago. In recent weeks there have been increasingly strident calls from some economists and backbench MPs for devaluation as a way of avoiding the full rigours of the ERM. But devaluation will not happen this side of the election, and perhaps not afterwards, although it will be a risk for several years into the future. Within the ERM, especially while the Bundesbank is so anxious to fight inflation, economic activity is going to be restrained, and companies are going to find it much harder to make profits. Real interest rates will stay high, although there should be scope for nominal rates to ease from the summer onwards as the problems in Germany abate. Investors should note that fixed-income investments proved quite lucrative last year. The total pre-tax return on British government long-dated securities, or gilt-edged, was about 20 per cent if you add capital gains to the interest income. This was very similar to the 20 1/2 per cent pre-tax total return on UK shares. The prospect is for further falls in underlying inflation and interest rates over the course of this year, albeit possibly more sharply in the second half than the first. So there is a case for taking money out of bank and building society deposit accounts, where returns may decline in due course, and putting it into gilts to take advantage of further capital gains as yields ease in this market, too. If gilts perform strongly, equities are likely to show reasonable returns as well. But in an environment of low inflation and slow economic growth it cannot be assumed that equities will continue to outperform during the 1990s on the scale that they did in the 1980s. Investors face a period of possibly erratic sentiment in the near term, and if the election is inconclusive they may need strong nerves for quite a while. Yet nobody ever made much money in the stock market by waiting until all the lights had turned green, let alone the shoots.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / KLM in talks on accord with three European airlines KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is considering launching formal negotiations on strategic co-operation with Swissair, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Austrian Airlines. The partnership talks are the latest example of the growing trend of consolidation in the airline industry with carriers scrambling to forge alliances to position themselves in the newly-liberalised European aviation market. The Dutch carrier, whose merger talks with British Airways ended in failure 11 months ago, confirmed that the four European airlines had already had informal discussions and would now be looking into starting official negotiations. KLM declined to say whether it would be seeking an equity link with the other three airlines, and it refused all further comment on the potential deal. SAS said the four carriers had decided to study 'whether official negotiations on some form of strategic co-operation could lead to a successful result'. Swissair, SAS and Austrian Airlines are already grouped in a loose partnership called the European Quality Alliance, which focuses on co-operation in marketing activities and flight timetables. Although Austrian Airlines is smaller, KLM, Swissair and SAS are roughly the same size and have close similarities in their approach to the airline business. In recent months, there have also been signs that SAS and Swissair are increasingly keen to strengthen their relationship. Before entering into negotiations with BA, KLM had held talks with SAS on joining the partners in the European Quality Alliance. These contacts have now been revived, especially as there appears to be little chance of KLM and BA resurrecting partnership talks. The UK flag-carrier is now concentrating on winning US government approval for its partnership deal and equity investment in USAir, the sixth largest US carrier. In Europe, BA has also acquired large stakes in a German and a French regional airline as well as taking over Dan-Air, the financially troubled UK carrier, since the breakdown of its talks with KLM. It has also bought 25 per cent of Qantas, the Australian carrier.</p>

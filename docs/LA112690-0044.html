			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> SURFBOARDS SHAPE UP AS A SECOND JOB  </P> <P> When a real estate agent sells a house, it is common practice for the agent to  give a small gift to the buyer. For Dave Wallace, an agent with Don L. Carlton  Realtors in Ventura, the gift is often one of his hand-crafted surfboards.  </P> <P> Each week Wallace shapes 15 surfboards that are sold in area surf shops. Under  the brand name Vector Vehicles, the surfboards are popular locally, said Vince  Felix, a salesman at Waveline Ventura, one of the shops that carries the line  of boards.  </P> <P> "I basically have two full-time jobs," Wallace said. "I can go in and shape  surfboards in the morning, be done by 12 p.m. and be in the real estate office  by 1 p.m. It works out well."  </P> <P> The 37-year-old Ventura resident has been shaping surfboards since 1967. "I  think the first one I shaped was for my sister, then I shaped one for myself  and pretty soon I just started shaping boards for all my friends," Wallace  said. "It took off from there."  </P> <P> In 1969, a Ventura surf shop hired Wallace, then a 16-year-old high school  student, to make surfboards. He has been crafting boards ever since, about  10,000 or so to date. His short boards, popular among younger surfers, sell for  about $300. His long-board designs retail at about $400.  </P> <P> For several years, Wallace sold his surfboards from a surf shop he owned in  Oxnard, but he tired of running a retail store. Five years ago, he decided to  take up real estate to supplement his income from Vector Vehicles.  </P> <P> The combination of the two jobs has worked out well for Wallace. For instance,  he recently received an increase in surfboard orders that partially offsets the  slump in real-estate sales. More than just a moneymaker, board-making is  Wallace's passion.  </P> <P> "Real estate is going to be a lot more financially rewarding than shaping surf  boards is ever going to be, but shaping is therapeutic," he said.

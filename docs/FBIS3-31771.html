			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Denar Remains Stable"] </F>   [Text] The 22 percent January inflation rate presents a  deviation from the planned 8 percent one. The National Bank  informs on a 1.5 percent January increase of the primary  emission of cash, and predicts a possible 18 percent further  increase in the first quarter of the year. The Bank will remain  strictly on the planned projection, and this month's inflation  rate is expected to be under the level planned with the  stabilization program.    Owing to the restrictive policies and the increased supply  of  hard currency on the market, the denar can be expected to keep  its stable course in reference to foreign currencies.</p>

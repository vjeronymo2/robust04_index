			<p>BFN     [Text] Helsinki, May 4 (AFP) -- The Finnish Government will  submit to parliament a date for the referendum on European Union  (EU) membership by May 26 at the latest, Finnish Prime Minister  Esko Aho stated Wednesday [4 May].    Aho has previously talked of holding a November referendum,  while Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari has discussed the  possibility of a September or October referendum.    Sweden will hold its referendum November 13 and Austria on  June 12. Norway has yet to announce a date.    Meanwhile, Finnish Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen,  who together with Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto negotiated  Finland's membership agreement in Brussels, said he was pleased  with the European Parliament's decision Wednesday to admit the  four applicant countries.    "This is a fantastic result if one considers that 259 votes  were required for membership, and we were well over that by 100  and there were few opponents," he said.</p>

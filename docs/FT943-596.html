			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: Thai property tycoons take to the rails - A look at two developers switching from satellite cities to skytrains Two rival Sino-Thai brothers known for their grandiose property development schemes are again courting controversy in Bangkok with plans to build Dollars 4bn worth of elevated urban railways across the Thai capital. The move into transport projects by Mr Anant Kanjanapas, 52, president of Bangkok Land, and his brother Mr Keree Kanjanapas, 44, executive chairman of Tanayong, comes at a time when properties in their satellite cities on the outskirts of Bangkok are proving difficult to sell to the public. The brothers say they are business visionaries; their critics claim their business ventures are often too ambitious and poorly executed. The satellite cities - the core of both companies - are being built on land acquired in the 1960s and 1970s by the patriarch of the family, Mr Mongkol Kanjanapas, now 73, a Chiuchou Chinese who immigrated to Thailand in the 1930s. Tanayong and Bangkok Land were listed in March 1991 and February 1992 respectively, after the brothers returned to Thailand from an extended period in Hong Kong. Much of the family business is still in Hong Kong, where the family name is Wong. Inspired by the success of Hong Kong's satellite cities, each brother developed a new town in Bangkok dominated by high-rise buildings, but Thais appear reluctant to move into such complexes. Bangkok Land's 640-hectare Muang Thong Thani city, on the capital's northern outskirts, is planned as a self-contained community with a hotel and a university; Tanayong's 243-hectare Thana City includes a prominent golf course. Mr Anant says: 'By the end of this year there will be more than 10,000 families in Muang Thong Thani . . . there will be tremendous life and 50,000 jobs. It will be the best part of Bangkok in every respect.' But one property analyst for a Bangkok stockbroker recently wrote that Muang Thong Thani is 'a dreadful place lacking character and soul. 'The fact that no one's living there doesn't help.' The largest project - 27 'popular condominium' towers containing 26,000 apartments for low-income earners - is nearly completed, but only about 10 per cent of the units have been occupied. Similar and cheaper homes in more modest schemes are available nearby. Bangkok Land has been giving away a car worth Bt160,000 (Dollars 6,400) with every Bt513,000 apartment to attract buyers. Only two of eight 'industrial condominium' towers have been transferred to the buyers, although the project was completed in June 1993 and subsequently reported by Bangkok Land to be 100 per cent sold. 'They are too good for Thai manufacturers who aren't used to multistorey factories,' says Mr Anant. Two of the industrial buildings are to be converted into commercial complexes 'with a convention centre as big as Singapore's', he said. Bangkok Land, like Tanayong, has previously booked partial payments as complete sales in its accounts, a practice which could punch awkward holes in the companies' cash-flow if large numbers of buyers walk away from their often modest initial payments. Bangkok Land reported a 3 per cent rise in consolidated net profits to Bt5.03bn for the year to end-March 1994, but total sales for the year fell 25 per cent to Bt12.7bn from Bt16.8bn in 1993, while net debt grew to Bt20bn in March from Bt16bn in December. Accounts receivable (money promised by buyers but not yet paid) stood at Bt26.8bn - nearly all on completed property. By one stockbroker's estimate, 45 per cent of Bangkok Land's 1994 gross profit may have come from sales from its extensive land holdings. Tanayong's net debt is a relatively comfortable Bt500m and accounts receivable amount to Bt6.2bn, but Mr Keree admits he was forced to relaunch Thana City, on the eastern side of Bangkok. 'We've had to make them more affordable after the property market's consolidation,' he said. 'Unless and until the traffic situation improves people are going to find it easier to live in more accessible areas.' Tanayong's consolidated profits dropped 53 per cent in the year to March 1994 to Bt257m; there is also still no sign that significant strategic diversification - promised at the time of its flotation - will come about soon. Tanayong and Bangkok Land have both rediscovered the virtues of the city centre: Tanayong's three 'Regent' towers, with a total of nearly 1,200 apartments, have sold quickly. Meanwhile, Bangkok Land has launched 'Grand Metro' - three towers of 2,000 apartments with extensive retail space. Despite their unresolved difficulties with the Bangkok property market, both companies have plunged into the swamp of bureaucratic in-fighting and planning inertia that has delayed the development of mass transit railways in the capital for decades. Mr Keree says the move into transport is 'quite logical. We realised a long time ago that infrastructure problems were hindering our business, hindering the country.' City mass transit systems around the world rarely if ever make a profit. Yet Tanayong's 24km inner-city rail franchise is unsubsidised and has no significant sweeteners in the form of concessions to develop property along the route, unlike some other schemes. Siemens, of Germany, recently replaced the Anglo-French GEC Alsthom consortium as lead contractors for the train system. Tanayong's transport subsidiary said GEC Alsthom could not provide a satisfactory financing package. Mr Anant of Bangkok Land has spoken of plans to build Asia's tallest building - a 90-storey office and residential tower over the depot of Bangkok Land's 20km 'Skytrain' franchise. The two brothers and their companies could profit from rapid flotations of their transport subsidiaries on the Thai stock exchange. 'With BoI (board of investment) tax privileges they can be listed immediately on the stock market without any earnings or a track record,' says Mr Neil Semple, research manager for HG Asia in Bangkok. But both transport projects - designed independently of each other - have been delayed in recent months by demands from environmentalists that the railways go under rather than above ground. Mr Anant remains defiant in the face of criticism of housing and railway schemes. 'Leave me alone. Let me do it,' he says. 'I will deliver. Let me prove it.'</p>

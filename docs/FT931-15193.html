			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tighter rules urged for disclosure of payments THE government spending watchdog called yesterday for much clearer public disclosure of payments such as the Pounds 4,700 made by the Treasury towards Mr Norman Lamont's legal costs in evicting a tenant from his London home. The report from the National Accounts Committee to the cross-party public accounts committee also showed that Sir Peter Middleton, then permanent secretary, suggested that the Treasury should meet more of Mr Lamont's total bill. The view of other senior officials, in favour of more limited assistance, prevailed. Mr Robert Sheldon, the chairman of the PAC, said that the committee would decide on Monday the witnesses it would now call as part of its investigation into the affair. They are set to include Sir Peter and two other senior officials involved in discussing the legal expenses; Sir Terry Burns, his successor, and Sir Robin Butler, the head of the Civil Service. Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor, called for Mr Lamont to repay the money into public funds. The case arose in spring 1991 but came to light only late last year after press reports. The memorandum from Sir John Bourn, head of the NAO, called for tighter rules on departmental help to ministers in matters beyond their official duties. There were, he said, 'dangers' both to ministers and civil servants in leaving so much to the discretion of officials: it was 'unsatisfactory' that much of the existing guidance was not relevant to the case. He clearly favours involving parliament in the review of the rules, which he recommends should be carried out by the cabinet office and the Treasury, in order to recognise the public-interest considerations. While the Treasury rejected suggestions of implied criticism of how it had handled the matter, MPs on the committee were clearly not satisfied by what Sir John found. His report commented that while special payments had to be highlighted only if they exceeded Pounds 100,000, there was provision for noting smaller amounts where there were doubts about the 'propriety' of the payment. On Monday, the cross-party committee on members' interests will publish its report on Mr Lamont's omission to declare that an anonymous Tory donor had settled the rest of his bill.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Fall in sales of commercial vehicles UK NEW commercial vehicle sales were 11.5 per cent lower in March than in the same month last year, the 30th consecutive monthly year-on-year decline. New commercial vehicle registrations fell to 20,103 from 22,706 in the same month a year ago, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. In the first three months of the year, new commercial vehicle sales, at 53,087, were 11.6 per cent lower than a year ago. Sales have fallen by 47.4 per cent in the past three years. Commercial vehicle makers have suffered the steepest decline into recession of the post-1945 period in the past 2 1/2 years and truck sales have fallen to the lowest level since the mid 1950s. The first tentative signs are finally emerging that the recession may have started to bottom out, however, at least in the heavy truck segment of the market, which was first to dip into decline more than 2 1/2 years ago. While new registrations at the light end of the commercial vehicle market, led by sales of small vans, continued to fall heavily in March - matching the continuing decline in the car market - registrations of heavy trucks (above 15 tonnes) in March were 18 per cent higher than a year ago. As a result of the rise last month, heavy truck sales for the first three months, at 4,250, also showed a small year-on-year increase of 2.7 per cent. In March, sales of small vans were 22.3 per cent lower than a year ago, while medium van sales fell by 5.0 per cent year-on-year, and overall truck sales (above 3.5 tonnes) fell by 3.6 per cent. In the truck market, the Iveco group, which includes Iveco Ford and Seddon Atkinson and is a subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, narrowly regained its market leadership, having been ousted by Leyland DAF, the UK subsidiary of DAF of the Netherlands, last year. Iveco captured 24.2 per cent of UK new truck sales in the first three months of the year, while Leyland DAF's share declined to 23.6 per cent. Renault is emerging as the biggest loser in the truck market, with a further decline of 44.3 per cent in its sales in the first three months of the year, compared with an overall fall in the truck market of 11.4 per cent. In the medium van segment (excluding pick-up trucks), Leyland DAF gained a record market share in the first three months at 16.8 per cent compared with 14.4 per cent a year earlier. Its sales volume rose by 2.9 per cent compared with a fall in the market of 11.8 per cent. Volkswagen is showing the strongest performance in the segment, however, with sales 15.4 per cent higher than a year ago, thanks to the launch last year of a new product range. Rover, the subsidiary of British Aerospace, is suffering a rapid decline in sales in the small van segment with a fall of 40.5 per cent in sales volume in the first three months. The company is expected eventually to withdraw from the car-derived van market as part of its move into more exclusive segments of the car market.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS JANUARY-MARCH 1992  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Volume   Volume     Share (%)  Share (%)                              (Units) Change (%)  Jan-Mar 92  Jan-Mar 91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*                 53,087   -11.6        100.0       100.0 Imports                       18,778   -13.5         35.4        36.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes) Total                         16,563   -12.2        100.0       100.0 Imports                        3,508    -7.5         21.2        20.1 Ford                           6,568    -7.9         39.7        37.8 Vauxhall (General Motors)      5,440    -6.2         32.8        30.8 Rover (British Aerospace)      1,429   -40.5          8.6        12.7 Peugeot incl.

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: De Dietrich plans to pay preferential dividend DE DIETRICH, the French engineering group, yesterday confirmed that net profits had fallen sharply from FFr130.6m in 1991 to FFr85m (Dollars 16m) in 1992 and announced plans to pay a preferential dividend to long-term investors. The payment of preferential dividends, which is intended to encourage investors to take long-term holdings in companies, is a topical issue in the French corporate sector following the announcement earlier this week that the finance ministry was forming a working party to assess the subject. De Dietrich is one of the first companies to declare its interest in adopting a preferential dividend scheme since the ministry's announcement. SEB, the industrial group, on Wednesday said it planned to adopt a preferential dividend policy.</p>

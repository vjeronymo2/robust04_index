			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gains reversed in an erratic session A DIFFICULT and confusing session, distorted by heavy falls in Wellcome and in BAT Industries, saw the UK stock market gyrate through a range of more than 33 points on the Footsie scale before closing 8.5 down on the day. In addition to the setback to prospects for Retrovir, Wellcome's HIV treatment product, and to BAT's sales outlook following a statement from Philip Morris of the US, London traders had to cope with an erratic pound and weakness in other European markets and on Wall Street - and all against the backcloth of a UK rail strike which delayed commuters and reduced attendance in the City of London. In the event, around 4.6 per cent of market volume, and all of the net loss in the Footsie, reflected heavy activity in BAT and in Wellcome. The rest of the market was fairly quiet as it moved to the end of the first week of a trading account extended to cover the Easter holiday weekend. After opening cautiously, equities brushed off Wellcome's heavy fall, and moved ahead as a strong futures market set the pace. The success of this week's Pounds 3bn auction of government bonds continued to help gilts, which soon put on three quarters of a point. This encouraged the Bank of England to announce that a further Pounds 500m of conventional gilts and Pounds 150m of index-linked would be available for sale to the market on April 5. Bonds held up well, long dates closing more than  1/2 up and index-linked around  1/4 better. Confidence in equities was further boosted by Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, who said there could be 'little doubt' that over the past month, every economic indicator had pointed to recovery. Better news on the housing market, and an opinion poll report of increased economic optimism in the UK since the Budget of March 16, helped take the Footsie ahead by 19.1 to 2,897.5. But the market refused to challenge the Footsie 2,500 mark and trod water until first reports from the Philip Morris meeting sent BAT plunging. London was also perturbed that poor US jobs data might upset Wall Street. The FT-SE Index continued to slide, showing a fall of 13.9 on the day just before Wall Street opened with a loss of 30 Dow points. The final ninety minutes of trading brought a modest rally, as the Dow also steadied for a time from its initial setback. At its final reading of 2,869.9, the FT-SE was 8.5 down after a highly erratic trading day. Seaq trading volume, although boosted by heavy selling of Wellcome and BAT Industries, fell to 606.6m shares from Thursday's 678m.</p>

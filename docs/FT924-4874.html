			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / International Company News: Brown &amp; Jackson disposal BROWN &amp; Jackson, operator of the Poundstretcher chain of discount stores, has disposed of its remaining 25 per cent stake in Advanced Technology Industries for Pounds 550,000. This ends a particularly painful episode for Brown &amp; Jackson and confirms the new management's policy of concentrating on core retail discount activities. The majority share in Advanced Technology, a security alarm manufacturer, was acquired in 1988. It was transferred back to its original owner, Limelight Group, earlier this year on agreement to drop claims to nearly Pounds 11m of the original purchase price. A review by brokers Henry Ansbacher found that up to 40 per cent of ATI profits between 1988 and 1990 may have been questionable. Renumeration to former owners was based on profits earned in that period.</p>

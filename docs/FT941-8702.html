			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Old car tyres put brakes on noise In a move designed to reduce environmental noise while disposing of used car tyres, the Paris-based company ACIAL has developed an acoustic barrier comprising a metal casing with half-tyres stacked inside. The side of the casing facing the noise is made from perforated sheet metal to focus the noise towards the shells formed by the halved tyres. There it is damped and absorbed. For frequencies between 250 and 2000 Hz - the frequency of heavy traffic noise - up to 85 per cent of the noise is absorbed. ACIAL: France, 1 44 92 18 37.</p>

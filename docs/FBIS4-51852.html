			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Violent War Remarks by the Civilian </F> Warmongers"]    [Text] As you, South Korean youths and students, are well  aware of the fact that whenever it opens its mouth, the Kim  Yong-sam puppet clique under a civilian guise is unhesitatingly  spinning out bellicose gibberish against our Republic.    Not long ago, a man named Yi Pyong-tae, who is said to be  the  puppet minister of national defense of South Korea, talked about  the integration [tonghap] through a northward invasion, babbling  about launching a so-called retaliation through strong  punishment and about making use of this as an opportunity for  reunification when needs arise. He even revealed a plan for a  northward war of aggression called New Operational Plan  5027--which is to be composed of 5-phase operational concepts.    Timed with this, traitor Kim Chong-pil, the so-called  chairman of the Democratic Liberal Party, has said that it is  necessary to cope with [taeung] the North in a cool-headed and  firm manner, saying that dialogues with compatriots as advocated  by many people is a fantasy.    As the saying goes: A crow can make no other voice than a  caw  no matter how much it strains its voice, only bellicose violent  war remarks are being shouted out from the mouth of the  warmaniac Kim Yong-sam treacherous clique.    Last year, a man named Kwon Yong-hae, then puppet national  defense minister, said that he would not hesitate to take the  so- called military countermeasure [taeung], finding fault with  our so-called nuclear development. Babbling about the threat of  a southward invasion by the North, traitor Kim Yong-sam, a  civilian warmonger, loudly stressed the need to work out every  kind of countermeasures.    The remarks against the northern part of the Republic made  by  the treacherous Kim Yong-sam clique are bellicose absurd remarks  deeply reeking of a northward invasion.    Although they had carried out numerous provocative maneuvers  against the northern part of the Republic, the preceding South  Korean ruling cliques dared not to make blustering gibberish of  a northward invasion as the Kim Yong-sam ring is doing.    Either at the scenes of riotous eating at Chongwadae  [presidential office] or during its tour of the frontline area,  the Kim Yong-sam ring is continuously making violent war remarks  aimed at crushing [apsal] the Republic under the poor excuses.    The reality clearly shows that no matter how loud it babbles  about being civilian, the Kim Yong-sam treacherous clique is a  group of cutthroat warmaniacs far exceeding their predecessor  military dictators.    Then, for what is the Kim Yong-sam unhesitatingly making  gunpowder-reeking violent war remarks? The reason lies in  their earnest [otokehana] attempt to (?ignite) the fuse of war  of a northward invasion, inciting the (?atmosphere) of  confrontation and mistrust and artificially straining the  situation while indiscriminately spinning out reckless remarks  against the northern part of the Republic. In other words, this  means that the Kim Yong- sam ring, under the civilian ironclad  helmet, will by any means [kioko] realize its ambition to  reunify the nation by defeating communism.    (?In reality), despite the strong opposition and rejection  from the people at home and abroad, the Kim Yong-sam treacherous  clique is trying to inflict nuclear disasters on its compatriots  in collusion with its master by deploying new-type Patriot  missiles in South Korea and even offering more military bases  for the U.S. Armed Forces.    Because of the reckless maneuvers of the Kim Yong-sam  treacherous clique, a tense situation is being created today on  the Korean peninsula in which no one knows when a nuclear war  might break out.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is bringing the situation to  the brink of a dangerous war while continuously making bellicose  gibberish against the northern part of the Republic. This can  never be tolerated.    It is extremely just for the South Korean youths and  students, who are firmly united around the South Korean  Federation of General Student Councils to forcefully stage the  struggle against the United States, war, nuclear, and the  government.    If the forces of aggression and war servants are left intact  in South Korea, our nation cannot avert the danger of nuclear  disasters.    If the South Korean puppet clique thinks that, under its  master's instigation, it can threaten and bring to the knees the  Republic through the violent war remarks and introduction of  modern weapons of mass destruction, and by playing with fire of  a nuclear war, it is a wild fancy.    Even if the warmongers should play with the fire of Team  Spirit, our people will not be surprised, nor they will be  surprised, even if they should make a threat by introducing  something more formidable than [kuboda tohangosul] Patriot  missiles.    If the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique should put into action the  reckless violent war remarks, then, it will not be able to  escape the fate of a tiger moth enjoying a flame.</p>

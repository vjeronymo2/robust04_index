			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / World Trade News: Taiwan delays bids for N-plant TAIWAN has postponed the deadline for bids on a 2,500MW nuclear power station, the country's fourth. Taipower, the state utility, is understood to have ordered the delay - the deadline was yesterday - because of uncertainty about the bid price mechanism. Nuclear Electric, Britain's state-owned generator of nuclear power, is bidding for the project in partnership with Westinghouse of the US. Their design would be identical to that of Sizewell B, Britain's first pressurised water reactor which the companies have nearly completed.</p>

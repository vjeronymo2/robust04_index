			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Hartstone in Pounds 10m lingerie purchase Hartstone, the hosiery and leather goods distributor, has moved into the lingerie market with the purchase of Spanish company Aznar Industrial for Pounds 10.4m. The purchase price was higher than the Pounds 9m foreshadowed at the time of Hartstone's results in November. However, Mr David Grattan, finance director, said this had been due to the acquisition of slightly more net assets than originally planned, as well as the effect of currency movements since the deal was initially agreed. The price of the goodwill had remained firm at about Pounds 8m. The acquisition will be financed with an initial cash consideration of Pounds 3.6m. There will be a further cash payment of Pounds 5.6m, in addition to the allotment of 596,000 shares. Hartstone's shares closed 7p higher at 237p. Aznar Industrial was a sister company of the hosiery manufacturer, Aznar, acquired by Hartstone in January last year.</p>

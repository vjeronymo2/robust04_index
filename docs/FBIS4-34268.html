			<p>BFN     [Text] The Supreme Court might have to decide between the  reelection of Carlos Menem or Eduardo Duhalde now that disputes  involving both [national and Buenos Aires Province] constituent  assemblies have ended in court.    In the case of the National Constituent Assembly, minority  blocs sought a court injunction to get the Assembly to respect  their right to vote on the 13 agreements of the package closed  by Carlos Menem and Raul Alfonsin item by item. The assembly  had decided the 13 amendments will be voted on as a single  package. Radical [Radical Civic Union, UCR] and Justicialist  [Justicialist Party, PJ] leaders will appeal Judge Raul Dalla  Fontana's decision to allow the complaints of provincial  parties. The Supreme Court will now decide if the courts can  consider Constituent Assembly decisions. The parties that  signed the pact [UCR and PJ] want the court to dismiss the  complaint on the grounds that Constituent Assembly decisions  cannot be considered by the courts.    If the court dismisses the complaint it will hurt Eduardo  Duhalde, whose followers have filed a petition arguing that  regulations approved by the Grand Front, Modin [Movement for  Independence and Dignity], and UCR alliance are  unconstitutional. If the court decides it cannot consider  National Constituent Assembly decisions it will also be unable  to discuss the Buenos Aires Constituent Assembly regulations and  Duhalde will be unable to change the regulation that bans him  from seeking reelection.</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEBABS;  </P> <P> TASTES OF ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS SERVED ON SKEWERS IN ISTANBUL  </P> <P> "Do I have a place for you," my husband said when I arrived in Istanbul. He had  been to this Turkish seaport on business and had already staked out places to  eat.  </P> <P> We drove up the steep cobblestone streets in Etiler, a residential area, to  Hacidan (pronounced haj-i-dan), a new restaurant serving only kebabs. Nothing  but kebabs.  </P> <P> We sat at the 20-foot counter attached to a 20-foot grill and watched the kebab  chef, whose authority is as sacrosanct as a master sushi chef's in Japan, wield  skewers as if they were a Mongolian warrior's swords.  </P> <P> His orchestration, like the sushi chef, is a dance of hands, hopping from one  kebab to another, turning, basting, unthreading skewers with the help of flat  pita bread used as a mitt.  </P> <P> The grill winds across the floor like a snake, with a cap over it made of  hammered copper. Kebabs line the grill in neat rows -- vegetables, chiles,  meats and poultry. The fires spark up, causing flecks of carbon to float over  the grill like a shower of confetti.  </P> <P> It was interesting to me that vegetables were cooked separate from meats and  not together as we often see them in the United States. Masses of long green  chiles threaded crosswise on skewers, look like giant green spiders charring on  the grill.  </P> <P> We ordered according to appetite, but if one left the menu to the chef, he'd  seek to satisfy your wildest whim, lifting eyebrows with delight at the  slightest indication of pleasure from the diner. A smile of satisfaction is his  signal to continue to create, create, create, until you can eat no more. Then  you signal or say, "NO MORE."  </P> <P> There are dozens of kebabs to choose from but among the most popular are, of  course, shish kebab, meaning skewered meat, which was probably brought into the  region by meat-eating civilizations from the northeast thousands of years ago.  </P> <P> Shish kebab is simply a skewer of cubes of meat (usually lamb) marinated in  lemon marinade. Bejti kebab, another popular kebab named after a famous kebab  restaurant in Istanbul by the same name, is ground lamb shaped like a sausage  and threaded on skewers lengthwise. It is served with or without pita bread.  Beyti kebabs are similar to Greek souvlaki or soutzoukakia and Moroccan kefta  kabab, as well as Arabic kofte.  </P> <P> The kebab chef also prepared organ meat kebabs, which are actually a street  food specialty found throughout Turkey and the Balkans. Kukurec or the Greek  kokoretsi is a kebab made of bits and pieces of heart, kidney, sweetbreads and  liver entwined with intestine of young lamb. The kebabs are served nestled in a  French-type loaf with an onion-laden salad.  </P> <P> Then there are chicken kebabs, which are seasoned with an Arabic spice mix  known as baharat, apparently introduced to the region by Arab cooks over the  centuries of trade with countries around the Mediterranean. Baharat is an  intriguing mixture of spices, including coriander, cloves, cumin, cardamom,  nutmeg and cinnamon, which seem to blend remarkably well. Baharat is especially  good with fish and poultry but cooks also use the spice mix with meats.  </P> <P> Tiny lamb chops, or medallions, cut out and encased in grape leaves were a  treat, served over a flat saucer of lavash, a form of pliable giant-size crepe  often used as an edible plate for foods throughout the Middle East.  </P> <P> Vegetables also do well as kebabs, and any group of quick-cooking vegetables  such as squash, tomatoes, onions, sweet peppers (including chiles), mushrooms  and eggplant may be used with great success.  </P> <P> Here are a few of the recipes inspired by our visit to Hacidan, plus another  that seemed appropriate to add for shrimp lovers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LAMB KEBABS  </P> <P> 2 pounds boneless leg of lamb, cut into 1-inch cubes  </P> <P> 1/4 cup olive oil  </P> <P> 1/4 cup red wine vinegar  </P> <P> 2 cloves garlic, minced  </P> <P> 1/4 cup chopped parsley  </P> <P> 1/4 cup chopped mint leaves  </P> <P> Dash red pepper flakes  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Place lamb in bowl.

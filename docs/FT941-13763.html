			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Diplomatic disquiet: The frustrations caused by cuts and savings in the Foreign Office There was almost a whiff of revolution in the air in Whitehall, when it was announced last week that Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, would address the massed ranks of his department - at the request of the staff trade unions. It is an unprecedented event and could attract as many as 1,000 London-based staff, who will gather today in the grandiose surroundings of the Durbar Court, restored to its original Victorian splendour a few years ago. The fact that Mr Hurd has agreed to address such a meeting demonstrates that he recognises diplomats may have genuine cause for anxiety, not only about their career prospects but about the future of the foreign service as a whole. Though the damage done to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's reputation by Mrs Margaret Thatcher's constant sniping and criticism has largely been repaired by the present govern-ment, financial constraints have provoked fresh worries. That does not mean that there is an atmosphere of militancy in King Charles Street. Most of the staff, and even their unions, concede that Mr Hurd is a good boss, as well as a good foreign secretary. One or two have even been heard to say, somewhat rashly, that he is 'the greatest foreign secretary this century'. Others, much less flattering, merely consider that he is very successful at not rocking the boat, but that he has not shown an inordinate amount of imagination in the formulation of policy. One middle-ranking diplomat, who refuses to attend today's meeting, said it would be 'just like a journalist listening to a press release being read out by a Foreign Office spokesman'. Yet almost everyone agrees that Mr Hurd has done his utmost to defend his department against the assaults of the Treasury, and that he was particularly successful in his damage limitation exercise during last autumn's public expenditure survey. Nevertheless, in spite of small increases in money terms during the three-year period covered by the survey, 1993-96, there will be a cut of 11 per cent in real terms in the FCO's overall budget over the period, fuelling fears of reductions in both posts and staff. Though the administration says that it does not 'anticipate' reductions of diplomatic posts 'at the moment', there can be little doubt that this will happen in the longer run, in spite of the opening of 20 new posts since 1990. Undeniably, there has been a steady decline in Britain's overseas representation over the past decade. The FCO's overall manpower fell by 19 per cent between 1980 and 1990, though it has since risen again by some 5 per cent, as a result of the opening of new posts and the introduction of new visa regimes. Comparisons with countries of similar size and importance, such as France and Germany, show that Britain is falling behind. Last year, Britain had 217 posts abroad, compared to France's 291 and Germany's 230. At the same time Britain's overseas staff of 2,500 was much lower than France's 4,600 and Germany's 3,200. Further concern among staff has been caused by the outcome of a recent management study which showed that the hours being worked by many officials were far too long - in some senior cases as much as 70 or even 80 hours a week, instead of the 41 hours for which they are paid. In addition, a market-testing programme covering 12 internal services has raised fears that more jobs will be lost or staff transferred. The services include language training, information technology, research, security, transport and some aspects of communications, and involve about 15 per cent of the Foreign Office's staff. In the first year of its operation, the programme, which opens up these services to competitive bidding by outside companies, has allowed the FCO to achieve savings of Pounds 6m. A blockage of appointments to senior grades, caused by the fact that retirements, usually about 15 to 18 annually, will be much lower over the next two years, has added to the malaise of a service which recruits only about 20 'fast-stream' candidates out of more than 2,000 applicants each year. It is clear that, even if there is unlikely to be any blood on the elegant pavement of the Durbar Court, Mr Hurd will nevertheless be unable to evade answering some delicate nitty-gritty questions. Morale-boosting statements about the status and continued role of the Foreign Office on the world stage, though welcome, will hardly be sufficient.</p>

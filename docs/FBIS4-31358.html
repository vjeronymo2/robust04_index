			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 8 Jun (TANJUG) -- Colonel General Momcilo  Perisic, Yugoslav Army chief of general staff [CGS], held a  working meeting today with representatives of the Yugoslav media  in the central Yugoslav Army Club.    "I am not asking you to depict the situation in the Yugoslav  Army as being better than it really is," General Perisic told  the correspondents. He urged the building of better mutual  trust through various forms of cooperation. General Perisic  recalled that not a single member of the Yugoslav Army is  outside Yugoslav borders, except for diplomatic and consular  missions of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia abroad. He added  that the Yugoslav Army is not causing any incidents on the  border between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. These incidents, he explained,  come as a consequence of an undefined internationally recognized  border between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.    The Yugoslav Army CGS also stressed that the process of  depolitization of the Yugoslav Army has been completed, and  spoke about the Army's high technical and technological level  which has been maintained despite the sanctions.</p>

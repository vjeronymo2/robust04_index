			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (14): Focus on a dynamic present - Hong Kong IN AUGUST this year, the HKDollars 1.93bn (USDollars 247m) lifeboat loan, which had saved Hong Kong's collapsed futures market in October 1987, was repaid. The colony's derivatives markets were finally able to turn from a chequered past and focus on an increasingly dynamic present. Before the 1987 stock market crash, Hong Kong had operated the second most active index futures contract in the world, but the period since then has been one of only gradual recovery. Turnover dwindled sufficiently in 1990 that there were many calls for the closure of the entire Futures Exchange. For the exchange's new management, the first push was to enforce reforms which would prevent any possible repeat of 1987. The second was to encourage nervous former participants to return to the futures market. It has succeeded on both fronts. The recent repayment of this fund has coincided with a growing international investor focus on the Hong Kong stock market, and the result has been a rapid growth in demand for derivative products. In the past 18 months, most of the large US securities houses have either opened up or upgraded Hong Kong offices, and one of their primary aims has been to build up derivatives business, an area which had always been peripheral. A number of the US groups have purchased seats on the Futures Exchange, and along with other leading European and Japanese brokerages, they have helped to promote the market. In the first six months of 1993, turnover in Hang Seng Index futures increased by 151 per cent, compared with the first half of 1992. The strong performance in the Hang Seng Index has been reflected in increased trading in the Futures Exchange's latest derivative product, the Hang Seng Index option, which was introduced in March and saw record trading in October. The derivatives market has become dominated by the leading foreign securities houses, which have the advantages of greater capital resources, overseas expertise and global distribution. They are bringing in a global client base for new investment products. For example, Morgan Stanley claims to have accounted for between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of daily turnover in the futures market in recent months, while Swiss Bank has taken a substantial share of trading in the options market. The arrival of overseas brokerages has also resulted in a broadening of the range of available products to include over-the-counter or listed covered warrants and, recently, convertible loan stock. The US securities houses were primarily responsible for introducing the benefits of convertible bond/preference share issues to conservatively-managed Hong Kong companies. During 1993, Jardine Strategic Holdings, Dairy Farm, Wharf Holdings, Amoy Properties, Sino Land, Guangdong Investment and Henderson China all used convertible issues as a means of capitalising on the performance of Hong Kong stock prices, and the present low interest rate environment. These issues have raised a total of USDollars 929.5m (around HKDollars 7.25bn), which is marginally less than the total capital raised in the stock market from the 18 rights issues announced during the first eight months of the year. Mr Han Ong, managing director of Warburg Asset Management Hong Kong, said: 'This change is inevitable, as the market matures and comes under the international spotlight.' When activity in the futures market peaked in 1987, index futures contracts were regarded as the ultimate speculative tool for retail investors. Trading had soared to 27,000 contracts a day, with an underlying contract value of more than HKDollars 4.8bn (USDollars 615m). During September this year the average daily turnover was only 9,093 contracts. However, this is around 10 times higher than the level when Futures Exchange chief executive Mr Gary Knight joined in January 1991. Mr Knight said: 'The futures market is now doing 150 per cent of the underlying stock market turnover on a daily basis, and that is good by any international standards.' He attributes the growth in turnover to the performance of the underlying stock market, the rapid expansion in the number of members of the futures market, and the increase in sophistication of investors in Hong Kong. 'In 1990, a lot of people said the futures market shouldn't exist. It is now accepted as a meaningful part of the financial scene,' said Mr Knight. During 1992, there has been a substantial increase in the amount of mutual fund money coming into the Hong Kong stock market from the US. Those fund managers have demanded more sophisticated hedging tools, particularly futures contracts and over-the-counter derivative products. The stock exchange is in the final throes of introducing a computerised trading system - automatically matching buyers with sellers - which is a precursor to lifting prohibition on short-selling, and to the launching of traded stock options on the Exchange. These are to be introduced in mid-1994. Derivatives have long been on the speculative periphery of Hong Kong investment portfolios, but with the introduction of more sophisticated tools and a more international market place, their association with the excesses of 1987 has finally faded.</p>

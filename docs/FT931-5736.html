			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Property charges hit BICC FOR THE second year running the profits of BICC, the cables and construction group, were depressed by charges of more than Pounds 40m on its property portfolio and the Channel tunnel contract. The pre-tax figure slipped to Pounds 77m (Pounds 81m) on turnover of Pounds 3.65bn (Pounds 3.79bn). This followed a further Pounds 35m write-down on the UK property portfolio, including the Spitalfields joint venture. Another Pounds 8m (Pounds 12m) was added to BICC's share of Channel tunnel losses. As promised with last year's Pounds 154m rights issue, BICC is paying a final dividend of 13.25p, to make an unchanged total of 19.25p. Most of the Pounds 64m bill was drawn from reserves. Earnings per share, affected by the 1-for-5 issue in June, fell to 6.6p (10.3p) - or 20.2p before exceptional charges. Mr Robin Biggam, chairman, said the Pounds 35m property write-down was against uncompleted property and Spitalfields accounted for over half of that portfolio. Last year's Pounds 30m write-down was against completed properties. Overall profit was flat at Pounds 148m (Pounds 146m) before interest costs of Pounds 28m (Pounds 23m). In BICC Cables, whose business is mainly in Europe, there was a 14 per cent decline to Pounds 78m - on sales of Pounds 946m (Pounds 933m) - because of weakness in the energy and telecoms markets. The group had taken its stake in GGC, of Spain, to 67 per cent and was reducing the number of factories from five to three. The acquisition of KWO, in eastern Germany, had only recently been completed. North America Cables was still making a small loss of Pounds 2m (Pounds 3m). Mr Biggam expressed some optimism for this year, following signs of economic recovery and the further rationalisation opportunities offered by the purchase of Reynold. Australasia had recovered to Pounds 33m (Pounds 26m) after a long period of decline. Competition in the telecoms market had helped to move the business forward. Balfour Beatty, the construction wing, again showed its resilience with profits of Pounds 40m (Pounds 38m) on turnover of Pounds 1.85bn (Pounds 1.9bn). Civil and power contracting had held up well and an increasing amount of work was being won overseas. House building incurred a small loss. Net debt rose to Pounds 59m (Pounds 35m) after nearly Pounds 100m was taken on to the balance sheet from the Spanish subsidiary and after Pounds 80m of acquisition payments. This was offset by the rights issue. About Pounds 37m of cash was generated after interest, dividends, tax and capital spending. Off balance sheet debt came down to Pounds 126m (Pounds 197m).

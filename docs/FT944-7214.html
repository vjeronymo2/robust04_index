			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Strong sales growth lifts CPL Aromas to Pounds 930,000 CPL Aromas, the fragrance and flavour manufacturing company floated in June, boosted interim profits by almost 35 per cent on the back of strong sales growth. Pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of September rose from Pounds 690,000 to Pounds 930,000. Sales, which are split 40/60 between the UK and overseas markets, grew from Pounds 8.43m to Pounds 9.76m. The shares, which were placed at 150p, closed up 1p at 201p yesterday. Mr Terry Pickthall, the founder and chairman whose family still holds 36 per cent of the shares, said the group had experienced organic growth across the board in its markets. 'It's nice to see that our existing operations can achieve this organic growth before our Aromachem operation starts.' The group, which raised Pounds 4m in the flotation, is investing in a new aroma chemicals facility on Teesside. It is expected to start production next summer, and contribute to profits in 1996-97. Margins remained flat at 10 per cent in spite of raw material price increases. Mr Pickthall said the group had been able to find alternative sources of supply to offset some of the rises. Net cash at the period-end was Pounds 1.18m. Interest payable fell from Pounds 148,000 to Pounds 55,000. Earnings per share were 6.6p (5.9p), and the interim dividend is 1.2p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lieutenant General Leonid Ivashov, secretary of the  Council of Defense Ministers of CIS member-states, is in favor  of formation of "a military or a defensive union" of CIS states  which would provide for "the creation of joint or single armed  forces of CIS countries."    Speaking at the sitting of the forum Towards New Accord on  Saturday in Moscow, Ivashov said that "such union will solve the  problem of restoration of the spirit of confidence between the  peoples, will prevent possible threat to CIS states, and, in  case of an aggression, will help to repulse it by joint efforts."    As many as 80 representatives of 17 parties and 30 public  organizations and movements of the former Soviet republics with  the exception of Turkmenistan are participating in the forum.    Ivashov called "creation of a security system in the Asian  region with the participation of the states neighboring CIS  countries" among the necessary "political and legal tasks" to be  solved in the near future.    In Ivashov's words, the Eastern-European system of  collective  security could include the armed forces of Belarus, the group of  the Russian armed forces, and the Kaliningrad grouping which  would subordinate "to a body like Council of Defense" headed by  the Belarussian president.    He proposes "to unite military systems of three  Transcaucasian states in the Caucasian region" with Russian  military presence and command and control center in  Rostov-na-Donu.    Military systems of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and "in  accordance with its readiness" Turkmenistan can be united in the  frameworks of one more military grouping.    The system of collective security in the Urals can include  the armed forces of the Ural military district and the armed  forces of Kazakhstan.    "Now it's time to adopt a political decision," declared  Ivashov. However, as he said, despite the fact that "there exist  different military threats the Russian Foreign Ministry strictly  adheres to the position of a non-allied existence." In  Ivashov's opinion, "when there exists one bloc (NATO - Interfax)  which does not want to be disbanded, there is a real necessity  in our defensive union."</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Nine IRA prisoners to be freed The Irish government is to release nine IRA prisoners - including two who are serving life sentences for murder - in the approach to Christmas as part of its response to the IRA's ceasefire. Those selected do not include Mr Thomas McMahon, who was jailed for life for the murder of Lord Mountbatten in 1979. Irish sources said last night that the releases would begin within days. Yesterday's disclosure came 48 hours after Ms Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, the Irish justice minister, sparked an angry response from unionist politicians by indicating that Dublin intended to release a number of IRA prisoners. The republic has 56 IRA prisoners in its jails compared with about 400 in British jails. Irish sources said last night that the names of the nine prisoners to be released were: Mr Owen Gallagher, Mr Gerard Hamilton, Mr John Harnett, Mr Gerard Burns, Mr Richard Comerford, Mr Patrick Griffin, Mr Aaron O'Connell, Mr Eamon Nolan and Mr Michael Daly. The releases would be staggered over the period leading up to Christmas but would begin in the next few days. Seven of the nine men would have been due for release next year on the expiry of their sentences. The sources said that Mr O'Connell and Mr Nolan were serving life sentences, having been convicted of murder during the course of a bank robbery. One of the men had served 12 years, the other almost 15 years. One man was serving a sentence for robbery, another for attempted robbery. The other five were serving sentences in connection with the possession of firearms, ammunition or explosives. The sources said all nine prisoners had been granted conditional release and that the conditions included their future good behaviour. These conditions would remain in force until the end of their sentences. Breach of them would render any prisoner liable to instant recommittal. They said normal criteria, including the likelihood of the prisoners' reoffending, were applied in reviewing the sentences. The cessation of violence was a 'critical' factor in reviewing the sentences of IRA prisoners. The sources added that the list for early release was circulated in a move to calm 'an almost hysterical response' to the announcement. By leaving out any high-profile IRA figures Dublin showed the gesture was not so dramatic as politicians in London and Belfast had feared. Downing Street said it was informed but not consulted about the Irish government's decision. It said: 'This is a matter for the Irish government. We have no plans for any similar action.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Lazar Tomov: "Poor and Obedient"] </F>   [Text] In the last two or three years, willingly or not,  Bulgaria was dragged into two world-scale embargo operations.  Both were imposed on us by the United Nations. We, as  exemplary schoolgirls, unconditionally agreed to observe the  world order and discipline. For this obedience we have received  so far pats on the back and promises for the future, but not a  single cent of compensation. This was the situation during the  embargo against Iraq, which owes us almost $2 billion, and this  is the situation now with the Yugo-embargo. Despite the fact  that the UN observers accuse us of violating the embargo, it has  already become clear that again we are the most obedient ones.  Our obedience borders on stupidity, because while we export  gasoline with bicycles or get involved in chicken-feed affairs,  the Western states do not waste their time. Let us remember  that time is money, especially in time of war.    Recently it was revealed that during 1992-93 alone the  countries involved in the Yugo-conflict received significant  quantities of weapons. The suppliers were Germany, Austria,  Italy, Switzerland, and a prominent French company that  specializes in the production of arms. Through (un)known ways  "humanitarian" shipments reached the borders of former  Yugoslavia. They contained almost 1,200 Stringer and Armarbrust  anti-aircraft missiles, 120 T-72 tanks, 155-mm. howitzers, tens  of thousands of automatic rifles, hand grenades, ammunition, and  much more. While the Western companies amassed profits, our  native parliament representatives nag each other even over  absolutely unfounded embargo violation accusations. This is  understandable to a certain degree. Since we destroyed our arms  industry, economy, and agriculture, nothing is left to us but  obedience accompanied by requests to compensate the losses  caused by the embargo. According to some calculations those  losses amount to $6-8 billion. Thus, in observing the embargo  Bulgaria is losing real money, which it badly needs, especially  now. It must be remembered that even if we receive a little  something in the future, this will be something we have already  spent in advance, and will have to return anyway to various  pacifists and peacemakers with interest.</p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Italian arrest warrant hits lira and stocks: PM's brother accused of bribery The issuing of an arrest warrant on corruption charges against Mr Paolo Berlusconi, the younger brother of Italy's prime minister, provoked extreme nervousness on financial markets yesterday about the future of the Berlusconi government. The country was swept by rumours that Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, was ready to resign. Although the prime minister's spokesman denied the rumours, the lira fell below its psychological floor of L1,000 against the D-Mark to L1,005 in late trading. The Milan bourse fell 2 per cent, almost the same amount as the previous day, and dealers marked down prices of government bonds as foreign investors continued to reduce their exposure. In parliament, opposition and some government members called for an emergency debate on the growing confrontation between the rightwing coalition and the judiciary, headed by the anti-corruption magistrates in Milan. The prime minister's Fininvest media empire is at the centre of their investigations. Mr Massimo D'Alema, the newly elected leader of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left, the main opposition grouping, claimed the government was at a turning point. He warned there would be a crisis unless Mr Berlusconi was able to separate clearly his role as prime minister from that as owner of Fininvest. After a day of uncertainty over his whereabouts, lawyers for Mr Paolo Berlusconi last night said he would hand himself over to answer charges of paying L330m (Pounds 136,000) in bribes to officials of the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, who have been inspecting the Fininvest company books. Mr Salvatore Sciascia, the head of Fininvest's tax department, admitted on Monday to handling such payments but claimed the money and authority to pay the bribes had come from Mr Paolo Berlusconi. Milan magistrates in signing the arrest warrant said he should be held in detention because there was a risk of tampering with evidence. They cited as significant the meeting held on Sunday by Mr Silvio Berlusconi at his villa near Milan attended by his close government aides, all formerly linked to Fininvest. It also emerged yesterday that Mr Paolo Berlusconi was at this meeting, which has provoked a row over the conflicting roles of Mr Silvio Berlusconi as prime minister and his continued ownership of Fininvest. Mr Berlusconi sought to put a brave face on his difficulties. At one stage he told correspondents who asked him about his brother: 'I don't want to concern myself with these things . . . But I can tell you that if all the companies were run like Fininvest, there wouldn't be any problems of public morality in Italy.' A poll published yesterday, commissioned by the state broadcasting organisation's main radio station, revealed that 70 per cent of those who voted in March for Mr Berlusconi and his Forza Italia movement would still vote the same way today. The one third who had lost confidence in him spread their preferences fairly evenly, with most favouring rightwing coalition partners.

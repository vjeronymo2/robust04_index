			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Arrest warrant for Brazilian A WARRANT has been issued for the arrest of Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, the man allegedly at the centre of a multi-million dollar corrupt fund-raising scheme for Mr Fernando Collor, the disgraced Brazilian president. The Brazilian embassy in London said yesterday that a warrant was issued after the British government agreed to start extradition proceedings against Mr Farias, Britain has no formal extradition treaty with Brazil. The embassy said the case was not linked to that of Mr Ronald Biggs, who escaped from Wandsworth prison in 1965 after being convicted of the August 1963 'great train robbery' and now lives with his son in Rio de Janeiro.</p>

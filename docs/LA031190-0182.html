			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIGUEL ALEMAN HITS THE ROAD, TOUTING MEXICO;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: THE TELEVISION MAGNATE, ONE OF THE NATION'S TOP CAPITALISTS, IS  LEADING A GOVERNMENT DRIVE TO LURE FOREIGN INVESTMENT. HIS NEXT STOP IS L.A.  </P> <P> Mexico's government and business community were very much at odds when the  country's economic crisis began in 1982.  </P> <P> President Jose Lopez Portillo blamed bankers for the flood of capital that  poured out of Mexico as oil prices plummeted. Calling them traitors, he took  over the banks.  </P> <P> That act was the culmination of a long series of government intrusions into the  economy. Price controls, subsidies and the nationalization of businesses from  airlines and steel mills to bottling companies all provoked business criticism.  </P> <P> Now the government is trimming back its economic role, and the current  president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, is asking the business community to help  bring in the investments and the international customers to make a private  enterprise economy work.  </P> <P> The man pressed into service to lead that effort is Miguel Aleman, son of one  of Mexico's best-known political figures and until last year the top operating  officer of Televisa, Mexico's only commercial broadcast television network, in  which he retains an important ownership share.  </P> <P> "Mexico really believes in the new trade and investment policy," the  dark-haired, blue-eyed ambassador without portfolio said in a recent interview.  "I am telling people what we are trying to do in Mexico."  </P> <P> That role is crucial for the Salinas Administration, which is counting on  foreign investment and access to international markets to bring this country  out of the 8-year-old economic crisis.  </P> <P> Salinas could hardly have picked a better link to the business community.  </P> <P> Although the ambassadorship is the 57-year-old Aleman's first government job,  he understands politics well because of his family background.  </P> <P> He also believes strongly in Salinas' free enterprise approach. "We had a  make-believe economy for 20 years," he said. "We had a very paternalistic  government. Everything was rights and no obligations."  </P> <P> Aleman is eager to play a part in helping Salinas succeed. And he has the clout  to do it.  </P> <P> Aleman is chairman of Mexico's major aluminum manufacturing company and sits on  the boards of mining companies, a brokerage, an insurance company and a lumber  company.  </P> <P> In addition, he and one of his two partners in Televisa own a major publishing  house, Novedades Editores. Novedades prints books; daily newspapers, including  one in English; glossy magazines for the Mexican upper classes, and adult comic  books that entertain workers during their long commutes on buses and the  subway.  </P> <P> He is on a nine-day trade mission to Chicago and Los Angeles, and the strength  of his contacts is evident in the makeup of the delegation that he is leading:  the senior executive of Alfa, Mexico's most important industrial conglomerate;  the chairman of Mexico's largest stock brokerage, and one of the country's most  important financiers.  </P> <P> By all accounts, Aleman is among the richest men in Mexico, although he  declines to place a dollar figure on his personal wealth.  </P> <P> "I never cared very much for money unless you use it," he said. "I know how to  produce it and enjoy it." He has homes in Mexico City, Acapulco, his home state  of Veracruz and the art colony of San Miguel de Allende, as well as apartments  in New York and Los Angeles. He patronizes the arts and sponsors rural and  resort development, mainly through a foundation that his father set up.  </P> <P> "Above all," said one Mexico watcher in Washington, "Miguel Aleman is a very  important symbol."  </P> <P> For three generations of Mexicans, the name Miguel Aleman has meant power,  prestige and a preference for personal liberty over the country's traditional  paternalism.  </P> <P> The Alemans have embodied those characteristics so strongly that the word  Alemanista has become a part of Mexico's political lexicon. To be an Alemanista  is to be pro-business, pro-United States and a firm believer in limiting  government's role to building roads, ports and schools -- the foundations that  individuals can use to build a prosperous economy.  </P> <P> Aleman's grandfather, a general and a classical liberal, died in 1929 in  fighting associated with the Mexican revolution. His father became president of  Mexico in 1946, then was dean of the right wing of the Institutional  Revolutionary Party, or PRI, the party that has dominated Mexican politics for  60 years.  </P> <P> But the Miguel Aleman of this generation rejected arms and politics to become  one member of the triumvirate that dominates Mexican television.  </P> <P> With support from Televisa, Aleman launched a new television production company  in 1962. By the end of the decade, broadcasters all over Central and South  America were showing programs from his Teleprogramas Acapulco. Channel 2 in  Lima, Peru, depended on Aleman's company for 90% of its programming.  </P> <P> That success came at a crucial time for Aleman.  </P> <P> Estranged from his powerful family because he had married a French actress,  Christianne Magnani, Miss Universe of 1954, he was trying to build an  independent business career.  </P> <P> "It was a very difficult period, because his mother did not want the marriage,"  his auburn-haired wife, whose eyes still fill with tears at the memory,  recalled recently. Aleman said his mother was so opposed to the match that she  tried to prevent it by arranging a marriage for him with the daughter of a  friend.  </P> <P> But after the birth of the first of their four children, he and his wife were  reconciled with the rest of the family, and his wife and mother eventually  became close friends. However, by that time Aleman had decided to become a  businessman instead of entering politics.  </P> <P> "My husband has worked hard to develop something on his own," Christianne  Aleman said. "Many young men with famous fathers do not even try."  </P> <P> There was a two-year escape from his father's fame while he was in high school.  He attended Peacock Military Academy in San Antonio while his father was  president. Then he returned to Mexico for prep school and subsequently to take  a law degree at the National Autonomous University.  </P> <P> An aviation law specialist, he later worked in Mexico as a lawyer for Lockheed  Corp. What really attracted him, though, was space exploration.  </P> <P> Aleman can tick off, in order, the names of the Mercury astronauts and their  early Soviet counterparts, including the dog, Laika. That's not surprising when  you consider that he saw many of the early U.S. and Soviet launches. He first  became interested in television because of the potential that it presented for  satellite communication.  </P> <P> The possibilities offered by satellites still excite him. "I love doing  simultaneous television," he said. "The landing of a man on the moon . . . when  a game is going on. That's TV."  </P> <P> Soon, however, he saw other potential in television.  </P> <P> By the mid-1970s, Aleman was heading an effort to use soap operas to achieve  social goals. "Ven Conmigo" ("Come With Me") was designed to encourage adults  without basic educational skills to return to school.  </P> <P> Encouraged by the success of the show, Aleman took on a more controversial  topic: family planning. Authorities in Mexico's Catholic Church opposed the  show.  </P> <P> Undaunted, he went to the Vatican and received church approval. "Fortunately,  the church has a very intelligent Pope," he said.  </P> <P> In August, 1977, Televisa began broadcasting "Acompaname" ("Accompany Me"), a  show that centered on family harmony, looking at family planning as a way to  achieve it.  </P> <P> During the show's planned six months on the air, about half a million people  told counselors at family-planning clinics that they went to the clinics  because of the program.  </P> <P> Aleman also explored production technology. With 18,000 hours a year of  production and with limited studio capacity, Televisa has to turn out shows  quickly. By paying attention to set construction, he supported development of  production techniques that allow the company to produce a one-hour soap opera  in 1 1/2 hours, including editing.  </P> <P> Along the way, Aleman acquired an 18% stake in Televisa. Although he had the  smallest share of the three Televisa partners, he became the network's  president in 1985.  </P> <P> "He promised changes, more political opening and more regional television,"  said Raul Trejo Delarbre, a Mexico City researcher who has written and edited  two books on Televisa.  </P> <P> Roderic A. Camp of Central University of Iowa, a researcher on  business-government relations in Mexico, said Aleman wanted to broadcast  "intellectual discussions comparable to public television in the United States.  He wanted to open discussions now taking place at the elite level in Mexico."  </P> <P> That would have been a major change for Mexican television, which is frequently  accused of emphasizing the views of the PRI and the government.  </P> <P> "He could not do it," Trejo Delarbre said. "The company's structure is too  closed to permit change."  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, Aleman disagreed. The political discussions that he promised  air every week on Televisa's Channel 9, one of the network's four channels, he  said in the interview.  </P> <P> Aleman still maintains close ties to Televisa, although his travel schedule as  ambassador leaves no time for more than a limited administrative role.  </P> <P> He has offices at both the Tourism and State departments but prefers to work  from his Televisa office when he is in Mexico City. He was there an average of  four days a month last year.  </P> <P> Here, Aleman keeps his mementos: photographs of him shaking hands with Fidel  Castro, Henry Kissinger, George Bush, Edward M. Kennedy -- and many more with  the titans of Mexican industry and politics.  </P> <P> Just as prominent is a shot of the special ambassador in a Batman suit, holding  grandson Emilio.  </P> <P> Across the office, seated beneath a pencil drawing of his father and dressed in  more ambassadorial navy blue pin stripes, Aleman spoke about Mexico's future.  </P> <P> "Mexico is wed to the U.S. and Canada," he said. "We are geographically married  for the rest of our lives. Mexico . . . (must) become part of a North American  common market with the U.S. and Canada."  </P> <P> The first step, he said, is maquiladoras -- the factories in Mexico near the  U.S. border that assemble foreign-made parts into products for export, mainly  to the U.S. market. Next, he predicted, Mexico must determine what it can do to  complement U.S. and Canadian strengths, allowing all three countries to compete  in a global market.  </P> <P> Pointing out that the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement that went into effect a  little more than a year ago took 15 years of negotiations and phasing in,  Aleman said, "This is going to take time, of course."  </P></p>

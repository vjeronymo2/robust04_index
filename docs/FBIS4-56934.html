			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Simon Wiesenthal Center, which conducts  international searches for Nazi criminals, has asked the German  courts to "reopen the case" involving former German Army Captain  Erich Priebke -- who was recently discovered in Argentina -- in  murders committed during World War II. The request to reopen  the case could lead to his extradition from Argentina.  Priebke's recent statement to the U.S. TV network ABC, in which  he admits his involvement in the German invasion of Rome,  prompted the Simon Wiesenthal Center to file this request.    Priebke, who admitted having had a hand in the killing of  330  Italians while serving in the SS, was discovered by a team of  ABC reporters in San Carlos de Bariloche. A Simon Wiesenthal  Center spokesman for Latin American affairs said Priebke "served  in the German forces in Italy during World War II and  participated in the so-called Rome Massacre." On that occasion  "in response to an attack by Italian partisans, the Germans shot  over 300 people." Priebke told ABC reporters that he  participated in the massacre but did so "under orders." [passage  omitted]    It is up to the German courts to file for the extradition of  the former Nazi. The statement by the war criminal could prompt  the German courts to reopen the case it will also depend on how  likely the extradition will be granted.    Swastikas -- the well-known symbol of the Third Reich which  persecuted Jewish people in European countries invaded by  Germany -- appeared on the walls of stores in Once neighborhood,  Buenos Aires, on 6 May. This neighborhood, some 30 blocs from  downtown Buenos Aires, is where a lot of Jewish people live,  although Asian immigrants like the Chinese, the Taiwanese, and  the Koreans have also been settling there lately. Swastikas  were also painted on the walls of two neighborhood synagogues.</p>

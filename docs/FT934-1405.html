			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / As They Say in Europe: The Liberal Democrat menace Some years ago, when I was in the Basque country, I got talking to a woman whose father had played a large part in the Spanish civil war. He was, of course, on the Republican side which lost. I asked the woman what party her father had belonged to. 'He was a Liberal Democrat,' she said. 'What on earth did that mean?' I asked. 'It meant,' she replied, 'that he shot everybody who wasn't' That seemed to me at the time to be an idiosyncrasy of traditional Spanish politics. But historic Spain and Russia have curious parallels. The two possess the only folk dancers worth a damn, and the best folk music. And in neither is there a tradition of seeing the other chap's point of view. So, today, we see those old Liberal Democrats resurrected, at the other end of Europe and the other end of the political spectrum. Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats seem prepared to embark on the same course as that of his Basque predecessor. In the west, the rise of this unsavoury grouping was greeted with alarm. In Russia, things are different. As I have noted before, the papers there seem to be able to take most developments in their stride. Irony provided one approach: 'Everything possible has been done for Zhirinovsky to achieve a success. All conceivable errors have been made.' It was rare in the west to read of Russia's democratic leaders being at fault, but in Moscow there was little else. Pravda was grimly jubilant, saying that the leader of the Liberal Democrats had reached 'a height unattainable for many of his rivals, above all because the executive branch of state power and its propaganda services were busy inspiring Russophobia intensively, importunately and consciously.' In what I might have called the liberal-democratic press, but cannot any longer for fear of misunderstanding, there was a more sympathetic account of what I might have called Russia's choice but cannot for fear of etc etc. It was noted that the Russian people had a 'predilection for confident leaders who promised a rapid change to be brought about without great difficulties. This time it is the turn of Vladimir Zhirinovsky . . .' The next day, in a nice touch, the same writer argued: 'The electorate got sick and tired of traditional promises by both communists and democrats.' These traditions go all the way back to 1990. Here we must confront an odd fact: Russia has shown itself capable of following in the footsteps of west Europeans. Last Sunday's vote provided a sort of re-run, in an extreme form, of what happened in Italy and, to a lesser extent, Brandenburg the week before. Ruling centre parties cannot win anywhere these days. But Russia possesses newspapers which can be described as expressing the views of far right communists, and their leading light is Sovetskaya Rossiya which clings to its anachronistic appellation for ideological reasons. It noted that one Communist party leader had expressed confidence that his group would achieve 'considerable mutual understanding with an absolute majority of blocs to which peace in the country and well-being in every home are the supreme value.' (That was a blow at President Yeltsin who, in certain circles, has not been seen as an apostle of peace since his forces shelled the Moscow parliament building.) The next day, Pravda announced 'the collapse of the democratic myth and the renunciation of the western Utopia'. The communists prefer the nationalists, or fascists, to the democrats. And many shared the view that the Liberal Democrats now had a right to have their opinions respected and should be reckoned with in the formation of a new cabinet. It all looks curiously like Germany in 1932. Then, the economy was in a total mess. There had been great inflation. Recommended western models were not working. The middle ground was squeezed and the communists did everything possible to ensure Hitler took over in 1933. There is always one comfort: historical parallels always turn out to be wrong. Yet, it is a curious fact that, 60 years ago, the name National Socialists had a rather reassuring ring (better than International Socialists). The original party of that name had been a moderate Czech grouping in the last days of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Will all Liberal Democrats now be imbued with an air of menace? From Tokyo to their British stronghold in Yeovil, there must be many who are wondering if Russia has dealt them an unfortunate card. Russia's Liberal Democrats do seem, however, to have learnt one lesson from western practitioners. The one-time populist governor of Louisiana, Huey Long, said it would be easy to start a fascist party in the United States. 'You would just have to call it an anti-fascist party,' he said.

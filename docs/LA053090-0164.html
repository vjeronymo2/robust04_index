			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: EYEDROPS FOR GLAUCOMA LINKED TO THINNING OF HAIR  </P> <P> Question: This may sound ludicrous but I wonder if the eyedrops I use for  glaucoma could make my hair fall out.  </P> <P> Even after my hair started to turn gray it was thick and beautiful. Now I am  getting worried as it continues to get thinner. I first noticed it several  months after starting on glaucoma medicine.  </P> <P> Answer: At first we doubted that glaucoma eye medicine could cause hair loss  but after searching the medical literature we discovered that beta blocker  drops may be associated with hair thinning. Apparently, enough medicine is  absorbed into the bloodstream to produce side effects similar to those seen  with oral beta blockers used for heart disease or high blood pressure.  Depression, sexual side effects and fatigue may also occur from such eyedrops.  </P> <P> You didn't mention which drug your doctor prescribed but medications such as  Betagan Liquifilm (levobunolol), Betoptic (betaxolol), and Timoptic (timolol)  have been reported to affect hair on scalp, eyebrows and eyelashes.  </P> <P> Your ophthalmologist may be able to teach you how to apply the drops so that  absorption is minimized or he may be able to determine if a different kind of  medicine may be appropriate.  </P> <P> Q: I'm under a lot of stress right now. My teen-age daughter has been acting  up, and my husband and I are fighting about how to handle her. It feels like my  nerves are all on edge, and I'm having trouble sleeping. My sister says I  should get a prescription for Valium, as it helped her through a divorce two  years ago. I hate to take drugs, though. I have read that valerian root is a  natural alternative. Is it safe?  </P> <P> A: Valerian is an herbal remedy that has been used as a sedative for hundreds  of years. Scientific tests have shown that people taking valerian root extract  get to sleep more quickly. Our sources indicate that this herbal remedy is  relatively safe. No addiction has been reported. It should not be combined with  alcohol or other drugs.  </P></p>

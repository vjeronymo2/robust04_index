			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / S Korea 'making progress with economic reforms' South Korea is making progress in its economic reforms, but more may need to be done and at a faster pace, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said in a survey released yesterday. Meanwhile, the South Korean finance ministry said it would study the possibility of Seoul applying for OECD membership this December, which could accelerate the introduction of reform measures. The country had been hoping to join the organisation in 1996. The OECD survey generally gave good marks to a comprehensive package of economic deregulation and financial liberalisation measures proposed last year that would reduce strong government intervention. But it added several caveats to its approval, particularly in the area of financial liberalisation. 'In contrast to false starts in the past, it is important that this (financial deregulation) programme be implemented in full, and at a pace which leaves markets in no doubt that the process is irreversible. 'The reform plan is open to considerable interpretation, but it appears that even if the plan is fully implemented by 1997, the Korean financial system will still have a higher degree of official control than is found in most OECD countries. Further steps would therefore be needed to complete the process of deregulation.' It suggested, for example, that controls on capital inflows should be further loosened despite Korean fears that it could lead to inflationary pressure due to an increase in the money supply. Other recommendations included accelerating interest rate deregulation and allowing financial institutions more freedom to introduce new products. The Korean government has traditionally used its tight control over the financial system to guide industrial policy. The OECD was critical that 'some elements of the old credit allocation will remain at the end of the liberalisation period'. These include a requirement that banks must extend 45 per cent of their loans to small companies to promote their growth, while restricting loans to the 30 largest conglomerates, or chaebol. The OECD suggested the government's efforts to curb the economic power of the chaebol through credit restrictions were misguided.</p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Allied bid talk Bid rumours surrounding Allied-Lyons found some voice again on the market and saw the stock price move up 8 to 628p in a reasonable turnover of 4.1m shares. While many analysts felt there was more speculation than substance in the rumour, Allied is enjoying positive sentiment at present and consensus grows that the stock is cheap and worthy of investment. Smith New Court issued a buy note, saying the shares had emerging value and looked a good bet for long-term growth. One broker was urging caution on the larger brewing stocks, citing one cause for concern as possible tax increases in the November Budget.</p>

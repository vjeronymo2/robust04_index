			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / TSB to pre-notify all fees TSB Group said yesterday that it intended to become the first bank to pre-notify its personal customers of all charges on current accounts, including those for returned cheques and letters written by managers. The bank said it was introducing full pre-notification of charges immediately. Along with National Westminster Bank, it now pre-notifies customers of selected charges including overdraft interest payments and fees. Banks have been moving towards pre-notification of charges on monthly statements, and the voluntary code of practice adhered to by all large banks is expected to be revised shortly to include pre-notification. Mr Ian Hall, TSB's marketing manager for cheque accounts, said that it had been the first large high street bank to introduce partial pre-notification in October 1992, but believed that was an inadequate service. 'We will now be telling them (customers) about unexpected charges which they have no way of calculating,' said Mr Hall. Barclays has said it intends to introduce pre-notication, and Lloyds has said that it will pre-notify charges this year.</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / EC farm stance seen as biggest threat to Gatt talks European Community objections to the draft agreement on farm subsidies reform proposed last month may still wreck the Uruguay Round of trade talks. Countries taking part in the trade liberalisation talks yesterday unanimously agreed to work for successful completion of the talks by Easter. But the EC is still opposed to the draft agreement on farm trade reform - the most crucial of the 26 draft accords concluded last month. The draft was prepared by Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), after the US and the EC failed to reach agreement following weeks of intensive talks. The Community's stance is seen by negotiators as by far the most threatening. The EC was not entirely without support at yesterday's meeting of the top-level Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC) called to decide the future of the five-year-old round. Japan, South Korea, Canada and Switzerland were among participants also expressing serious reservations about proposals in the agriculture text. Mr Dunkel, who is also chairman of the TNC, said he was prepared to serve as 'honest broker' in the resolution of outstanding differences. He warned, however, that any move to adjust the 436-page text 'must be very precise and concentrated entirely on what we all can collectively agree to without unravelling the package'. 'I have no new - or better - solutions to offer on my own,' he added. President Bush of the US said yesterday that he was not pessimistic about the chances of reaching a Gatt agreement, but he vowed to reject any deal on global trading rules which failed to lower farm subsidies in Europe. At a meeting with leaders of the American Farm Bureau Federation in Kansas City, he said he would not take to the Congress a deal that was silent on agriculture or unfavourable to American farmers. In a deliberately low-key statement, Mr Tran van Thinh, head of the EC delegation in Geneva, said the Community had serious difficulties with the agriculture text - which would have to be 'significantly improved'. It was also unhappy about some aspects of the rule-making accords. But the EC was ready to continue negotiations on the basis of Mr Dunkel's proposed timetable. There remain serious doubts over whether other countries will be prepared to reopen the farm subsidy talks as the Community wants. The US and most members of 14-strong Cairns Group of farm exporters are backing the current draft. If anything, they would like tighter disciplines. Mr Rufus Yerxa, US ambassador to Gatt, said the draft final agreement contained the basic ingredients for finalising the round, even though in places it did not go as far as Washington would have liked.

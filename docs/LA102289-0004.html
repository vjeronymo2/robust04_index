			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I am offended by the language and behavior of the cast of "Sister Kate." I find  it incredulous, insensitive and racist to portray children in such a manner.  Let me explain further. On the Sept. 21 episode, Sister Kate tried to place the  little black girl with a white family. The little black boy addressed the girl  as "woman." At some points during the show, one or both of the children told  the other to "shut up"; called the other "stupid"; and referred to the family  as "honky white people." I do not recall that Sister Kate properly corrected  the children. As this is a situation comedy, and the children appear to be  under 10 years of age, their language and demeanor are not acceptable.  </P> <P> Louise Blocker, Santa Monica  </P></p>

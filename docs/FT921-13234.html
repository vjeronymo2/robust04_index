			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Cable and Wireless talks collapse NEGOTIATIONS between American Telephone and Telegraph and Cable and Wireless over forming a global alliance between the two telecommunications groups have broken down because of political concern in the run-up to the UK general election. A central element of the alliance would have involved the US group buying a minority stake in Mercury Communications, C and W's UK subsidiary. AT&amp;T is understood to have been concerned that it could have become a pawn in a much bigger game between the Labour and Conservative parties in the tense pre-election period. Talks between the two groups may start again after the election. This is likely to depend partly on who wins - in particular, whether a Labour government would change telecommunications policy - and partly on what alternative alliances the groups pursue in the interim. C and W's share price closed down 17p at 589p last night as the stock market sensed that a deal had fallen through. Last week, when the market believed an agreement was imminent, the price peaked at 632p. Political worries are not the only reason that a deal, which has been the subject of talks since last September, has not been concluded. C and W, which is chaired by Lord Young, wants to collaborate throughout Europe, not just on Mercury. But it is not clear whether AT&amp;T, which is chaired by Mr Bob Allen, is willing to negotiate such a broad deal or would prefer different partners in different geographical markets. During the past six months, the international telecommunications industry has been in a frenzy of deal-making, as what were once national monopolies try to turn themselves into globally competitive operators. Failure to conclude a deal now between AT&amp;T and C and W may mean that other partners look more attractive to both groups after the election. C and W has in the past considered taking a stake in Sprint, the third largest US long-distance telecommunications carrier. It also planned to develop its own presence in the US market by acquiring TRT/FTC, the fourth largest carrier, but pulled out of this deal last November. AT&amp;T has held talks with a number of European companies, including Germany's Bundespost Telekom and France Telecom. Mr Allen's ambition is that AT&amp;T will earn half its revenue outside the US by the year 2000, compared with less than a quarter today.</p>

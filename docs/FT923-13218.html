			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / People: Next steps at Alexander Proudfoot Alexander Proudfoot, the world's biggest quoted management consultancy, is replacing its chief executive with a committee. Thomas Huhn, the ex-Chicago Bears football player and Proudfoot's group chief executive since 1987, has retired and his responsibilities are being assumed by an expanded management committee. Neil Hamilton (right), the company's 60-year-old finance director, will chair the management committee. Hamilton says that Huhn had decided that after 32 years of 'running for an aeroplane every Monday morning' it was time for someone else to take over. The company says that having undertaken a detailed review of its operations over the past few months, it has now decided to expand the management committee which runs the firm on a day-to-day basis and include those members responsible for the operating performance of its three main geographic regions. Alan Steelman, 46, will be responsible for implementing operational decisions. Proudfoot, a US firm which got a UK stock market listing after it reversed into Lord Stevens' City and Foreign Holdings in 1987, has managed to buck the recession better than many of its rivals. At the same time as it announced Huhn's retirement, the company stated that 'trading conditions have marginally improved and it is anticipated that earnings per share for the second half of the year will be modestly better than the first'. The company confirmed that based on current trading conditions the dividend will be maintained even though it is likely that earnings cover will be reduced. David Forster of Kleinwort Benson Securities estimates that full year profits will fall by around a fifth to Pounds 38m. The 56-year-old Huhn, who joined Proudfoot in 1961, will continue to serve as a consultant and will assist in the hand-over of selected clients. ***** Does a company which has only two customers, both large and both committed to buying its product on multi-year contracts, need a director of commercial development? SCOTTISH NUCLEAR, the state-owned company which runs Scotland's two nuclear power stations, believes it does and has appointed Bill Stockdale (above) to the newly created post. Stockdale, 46, says part of his job is to develop 'commercial awareness' in a company which was carved out of the old South of Scotland Electricity Board and whose market currently consists of ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro-Electric. 'We have to keep improving our performance. We intend to be the very best nuclear generator in the world,' he says. Stockdale will be responsible for new projects, including the implementation of large scale engineering projects at the the Torness and Hunterston B advanced gas cooled reactor (AGR) stations. He will also be in charge of corporate development, which will cover joint ventures and alliances with other companies, as well as expansion of Scottish Nuclear's business in eastern Europe where it is offering its expertise to the operators of the somewhat questionable Soviet-designed nuclear power stations. A Yorkshireman, Stockdale trained as an engineer and worked for Foster Wheeler, the US design engineering company, later joining ScottishPower in Glasgow in 1990 as project group manager. He was briefly managing director of engineering resources where he succeeded Robin Jeffrey, after the latter became ceo of Scottish Nuclear earlier this year. He has now followed Jeffrey to Scottish Nuclear's headquarters in East Kilbride. ***** Sir David Trippier, the former environment minister who lost his seat at the general election, has joined the Manchester law firm Halliwell Landau as a consultant. A former deputy chairman of the Conservative party, he was responsible for piloting the Environmental Protection Act through the House and hopes to 'add an extra dimension to the quality of advice on environmental issues that the firm already gives its clients'. Since leaving parliament, Sir David (below) has accepted non-executive directorships at St Modwen Properties, based in Birmingham, at Dunlop Heywood, consultant surveyors with headquarters in Manchester, and at P&amp;P, a computer services company based in his former constituency, Rossendale.</p>

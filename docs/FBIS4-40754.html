			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Gorlov under the "In the Government" </F> rubric: "Russian Economy Enters Market Although This Did Not  Come Easy to It"]    [Text] The results of the country's economic growth in the  first half of the year were summed up at yesterday's Russian  Federation Government session. The period in question does not  end for another two weeks but, because all manner of rush jobs  have been consigned to oblivion, the Council of Ministers deemed  it necessary to draw conclusions on the basis of preliminary  data from the State Committee for Statistics and the Economy  Ministry. Especially as the situation in the economy has become  more or less predictable.    There were no revelations at the government session. The  steady economic decline, which manifests itself particularly  sharply in machine building and light industry, continues. On  the whole we have "slimmed down" by over one-fourth compared  with the middle of last year. The production of agricultural  produce and electricity and the extraction of fuel and energy  raw materials are decreasing, albeit at a slower rate. The  volume of mutual nonpayments is increasing, and unemployment is  making it presence felt increasingly strongly. The deficit of  the still unapproved federal budget is balancing at a critical  level.    Yet in the government's opinion there are no grounds for  panic. The main encouraging conclusion is that the Russian  economy -- albeit in a bumbling fashion and battered and bruised  -- has entered the market. Certain islets of stabilization,  operating on purely market principles, are appearing. Inflation  has sharply dropped its pace and become practically  controllable. The domestic market is becoming increasingly  saturated and balanced. A steadily positive foreign trade  turnover has developed. The population's real money incomes  increased 11 percent compared with last June, and citizens'  savings are growing at a fast rate.    On the whole the first -- voucher -- stage of privatization  is ending successfully and the program for its second stage,  whose implementation will begin as early as 1 July, has been  promptly worked out. In this context an upswing in investment  activity can be expected. A program to reorganize and bankrupt  unprofitable enterprises, which indicates the beginning of  practical work to structurally reorganize the economy, has been  coordinated with monetary privatization.    Many problems regarding the creation of a normative base for  reforms have been solved. The latest "economic" edicts of the  Russian Federation president have made an important contribution  to this. In general, it was noted at the government session,  the main preconditions enabling the gradual revival of our  economy to begin have been created.    The main problem now is maybe that the ministries and  departments responsible for economic transformations are late in  creating mechanisms for implementing decisions made by the  president and government.    The Council of Ministers session also discussed progress in  implementing the Russian Federation president's edicts on  economic reform questions, questions concerning price formation  in the energy complex and in transport, and questions concerning  the rate of insurance contributions to the social insurance  fund, as well as the draft Russian Federation Law "On Making  Amendments and Additions to Certain Russian Federation  Legislative Acts in Connection with the Adoption of the Russian  Federation Law `On the Status of Servicemen.'"</p>

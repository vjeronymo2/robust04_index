			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Nacional Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The nation's general prosecutor [Gustavo De Grieff]  sent the Foreign Ministry hard evidence confirming a guerrilla  summit was held in Havana at the beginning of 1994. Foreign  Minister Noemi Sanin will ask the Cuban Government for an  explanation.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified Reporter] Madam Minister: A  few days ago, you ruled out this possibility; you said you  trusted the Cuban Government. What made you change your mind?  Why are you asking for an explanation?    [Sanin] Things happen between states the same as between  individuals, and while one does not have evidence,  demonstrations, or proof, the principle of good faith is  maintained. Otherwise, we would be engaged in completely  aggressive international relations. That day, I said that if the  Colombian Government obtained proof or evidence of Cuban or any  other nation's interference in its internal affairs, we would  act accordingly. Yesterday, the prosecutor general visited me  and he gave me the evidence. There are serious signs of a  guerrilla presence at a meeting held in Cuba. We still cannot  label it treason or subversive; this still has to be  investigated. Therefore, in keeping with the offer and our  obligations, we are asking the Cuban Government for an  explanation. Once we have their reply we will proceed. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Spirit of the Blitz recalled as City vows to beat bombers VERA LYNN may have given way to Gordon Gecko years ago, but the spirit of the Blitz returned to the City of London yesterday. There were other reminders: the innocent victims, an unseen enemy, and those with an eye for the main chance. An army of repair contractors' lorries queued at first light down London Wall, waiting for the off. 'It was like the troops waiting to embark on D-Day,' said a Guildhall official. Platoons of glaziers had started out for the City before first light. By 7am, as key holders moved among the rubble and police cordons in the drizzle, about 200 contractors were waiting at the door of the Guildhall. City landlords were on hand offering office space to those displaced by the blast. Two hours later the crowd had swelled to 600. Inside the Lord Mayor was telling the world that while the pictures told a story of devastation the spirit of London would beat the terrorists. Throughout the day he held the line. At St Paul's Cathedral the Dean, the Rev Eric Evans, was moved to draw an historical metaphor: 'This great city has faced plague, pestilence, fire and the blitz and it has won through. It will do so again and the IRA have no more hope of killing the spirit of London and its people than Hitler had.' Many of the victims were cared for at St Bartholomew's. Few could resist reflecting that if its history is abruptly ended by government closure the City may indeed lose a vital amenity which has served it through many wars. In St Botolph's churchyard green spring buds, blown from trees by the blast, mingled with shards of glass in the gutter. Its leaded windows were bowed, and its heavy doors cracked, but the church appeared to have survived. St Botolph's was silent, but a few hundred yards away the bells rang out in defiance for morning service at St Michael Cornhill, one of the City's Wren churches, which suffered damage to some of its stained glass windows. The Rev David Burton Evans, the rector, had guided his choir and congregation under the police tapes. The churchgoers, choir and organist numbered only 19. 'I thought stuff the IRA and we went ahead and did it.' But at St Ethelburga's the bells may never ring again. The church, originally built before the Great Fire of London and which survived the Victorian building boom and the Blitz, was reduced to rubble. The smallest and one of the oldest churches in London's business district had taken the full force of the blast. The weedkiller bomb packed into a tipper truck left a crater nearly 20 feet deep and 30 feet wide. All that was left of the truck were small twisted bits of metal. Among the destruction there was a touch of wartime humour as an office worker from the HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corporation watched paper blowing in the breeze. 'Our computer data is all safe, but our files are spread around the City. If anyone sees a piece of paper with our logo on, could they kindly pick it up and return it to us?' In those early hours of the morning Bishopsgate resembled a sea of glinting blue glass. Two Barclay's bank cash machines sat askew in their housings. The window had caved in on a security shop called Bishopsgate Crime Prevention Centre. A sign on the door said: 'How secure is your home?' Ms Janine Barber, an executive director of IndoSuez Aval in St Helen's Place, just off Bishopsgate and near to the centre of the blast, said: 'We got hit by the last bomb, we've just had a burglary and now we have had this so we've learned to cope by now.'</p>

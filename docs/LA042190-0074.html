			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READERS CONGRATULATE JIM MURRAY  </P> <P> As a woman who loves sports and reads Jim Murray faithfully, the columns I  remember most and have saved have nothing to do with sports.  </P> <P> Christmas Day, 1973, on leaving his home in Malibu tugged at my heart.  </P> <P> Then on April 3, 1984, his lovely tribute to Gerry, "She Took the Magic and  Happy Summer With Her." No one could read it without crying.  </P> <P> Thank you, Mr. Murray, for all the years of reading pleasure you have given to  sports fans.  </P> <P> JOYCE A. HUNT, Los Angeles  </P></p>

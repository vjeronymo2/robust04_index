			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marie Sena Ruiz] </F>   [Excerpt] The threat of all rebel groups has weakened and  the peace process being pushed by government is assured. This  was the assessment made by the National Security Council [NSC]  on the current economic and political situations in the country.    Briefing palace [presidential office] newsmen after the  meeting in Malacanang, national security adviser Jose Almonte  said all rebel groups, including leftist, rightist, and Muslim  rebels, no longer pose a threat to national security. Almonte  reported an overall improved peace and order situation and said  government is completely in control of problems that debilitate  the economy.    The NSC also adopted a resolution endorsing to Congress the  amnesty proclamation announced by President Ramos. The  resolution urged Congress to ratify the proclamation.    Also during the said National Security Council meeting,  Executive Secretary Teofisto Guingona said, the country's now  poised for economic takeoff as economic and political reforms  have been put in place. Guingona said the major economic  reforms were designed to level the playing field to promote  global competitiveness and make opportunities available to  everyone.    On the economic front, acting Trade Secretary Ernesto  Ordonez  assessed the impact of the oil price increase and its subsequent  rollback. The secretary said that the oil price increase hardly  affected the prices of basic commodities because of measures  adopted by government.    For his part, Finance Secretary Roberto De Ocampo  underscored  the importance of tax measures/alternatives to the oil levy,  particularly the (?cost) and tariff program, (?special)  progress, and completion of major projects of the government.    The fourth National Security Council meeting under the Ramos  Administration was convened to address vital internal and  external security concerns.    Meanwhile, President Ramos today ordered the Presidential  Anti-Crime Commission [PACC] headed by Vice President Joseph  Estrada to exert all efforts to stop the new kidnap gangs behind  the latest kidnapping cases in Metro Manila and other parts of  the country.    The chief executive also ordered the Armed Forces of the  Philippines and the Philippine National Police to support the  PACC in tracking down the kidnappers who are believed to be  former members of the dismantled Red Scorpion Group. The  president issued the order after receiving reports that several  new kidnapping cases were reported in Metro Manila and Benguet  province. [passage omitted]</p>

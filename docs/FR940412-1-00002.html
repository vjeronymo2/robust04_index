Consistent with Federal user fee statutes and regulations, the Service has identified services that are currently provided free of charge and for which it would be appropriate to impose a fee. The revenue generated by the collection of fees for these application processing services will enable the Service to improve service to the public at land border POEs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments must be submitted on or before June 13, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Please submit written comments, in triplicate, to the Records Systems Division, Director, Policy Directives and Instructions Branch, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street NW., room 5307, Washington, DC 20536.

During FY 1992, Immigration and Customs inspectors at land border ports completed more than 475 million inspections, representing an increase of over 50 million more inspections than were completed in FY 1991. This growth in transborder traffic has made it increasingly difficult to provide expeditious service to the traveling public. Immigration laws require that all applicants-for-admission at land border POEs undergo a brief interview and preliminary screening in a primary vehicle or pedestrian lane. Those found admissible are allowed to proceed without further delay. Persons who do not appear to be immediately admissible, or who require further processing or documentation, are referred for a secondary inspection. Activities directly related to secondary inspection include, among other duties, examining documents, conducting record checks, and issuing permits for extended stays in the United States. Additionally, those submitting applications for benefits, such as border crossing cards and boating permits, often require extensive interviews, as well as record checks, document production, and other time-consuming paperwork. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, appropriated funds are the major source of funding for the staffing of land border POEs. This funding has not kept pace with the increased workload at land border locations. Despite the increase in traffic affecting inspection services, and resulting new construction needed to expand the capacity of many land border POEs, no substantial increase in appropriated fund has been received for land border positions within the last ten years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has sought to identify those services that are currently provided free of charge for which it would be appropriate to impose a fee. Generation of sufficient revenue to recover the costs of providing specific services, such as document-processing, is consistent with the Federal user fee statute (31 U.S.C. 9701) and regulations which require that recipients of special benefits bear the costs of providing those services. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;25, User Charges, states as a general policy that reasonable charges should be imposed to recover the full cost to the Federal government of rendering such services. The specific application-processing services provided by the Service in secondary inspection at land border POEs result in the issuance of documents that are beneficial to the specific user. Therefore, it is appropriate that fees be charged to these users. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule proposes to permit the Service to impose a fee at land border POEs for the processing of Form I&hyph;94, Arrival/Departure Record, and I&hyph;94W, Nonimmigrant Visa Waiver Arrival/Departure Form; Form I&hyph;444, Mexican Border Visitors Permit; Form I&hyph;68, Canadian Border Boat Landing Permit; Form I&hyph;175, Application for Nonresident Alien Canadian Border Crossing Card for issuance of Form I&hyph;185, Nonresident Alien Canadian Border Crossing Card; and Form I&hyph;190, Application for Nonresident Alien Mexican Border Crossing Card, to replace a lost, stolen, or mutilated Nonresident Alien Border Crossing Card, Form I&hyph;586. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to development of this proposal, the total cost of providing these specific services to the public was included as part of the total Service budget and was not separately identified. The fees proposed in this rule were determined by an analysis of document-processing services and associated costs, and are calculated to recover the direct and indirect costs to the government of providing these special services and benefits. As the Service collects more detailed information related to providing these specific services, refinements to the cost base may be necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Gennadiy Yastrebtsov article under the "Economic Barometer" </F> rubric: "Landfall Still Fog-Bound"]    [Text] More and more sober-minded economists, even among  those formerly opposed to Soviet power, are coming to the sad  conclusion that the monetarists have led the country into the  quagmire of a very severe economic crisis. The authors and  proponents of "shock therapy" continue to claim that everything  is fine and that, although we may be bogged down for the time  being, we will gradually reach terra firma....    So what can we expect in 1994? Even going by the official  Ministry of the Economy forecasts, there will be a further drop  in the population's real income. And the middle class -- the  largest group, on whose shoulders the national economy has  always depended -- will be hit hardest. In the new year  approximately 33 percent of the population will have a per  capita income less than the minimum wage, and the difference in  income levels between our poorest fellow citizens and the new  fat cats will increase 11-fold. Academician S. Shatalin, the  well-known "marketeer," has said the following: "The Russian  Government is pursuing a not very well-conceived or responsible  policy in this area. Governments throughout the civilized world  regulate the population's income, and nobody considers this a  violation of the laws of the development of the market  economy...."    Take the United States, for instance. Business circles there  reacted loyally to the ousting of the right-wing Republican  government by the center-right Democrats. They were hopeful of  tipping the balance between the "market" and "nonmarket" sectors  of society toward a better resolution of the social problems  which have deteriorated even in that prosperous country as a  result of the latest economic crisis. According to information  published in BIRZHEVYYE VEDOMOSTI by Yevgeniy Boshnyakov,  director of the "Issledovateli Rynka" enterprise, America has  its own macroeconomists, whom our "apprentices" imitate. The  U.S. Democrats even involved some of them in their election  campaign. But, once victory was assured, none of them was taken  into the leadership -- electioneering is one thing, while  actually running a state is quite another. That is why in  America the transition did not result in any shocks or general  confrontation between such usually hostile forces as  entrepreneurs, workers, and the nonmarket section of society.    Russia has done the same as America, only...back to front --  power has been handed over to extremists from science and  production. And, naturally, society has suffered a terrible  shock, the economy is in an unprecedented crisis, and the  executive is meeting with opposition and hostility from such  economically different forces as state and private employers,  stockbrokers and bankers, the military and pensioners.    What now? Despite the fact that the mutual offsetting of  debts is anathema to government officials, this will clearly be  unavoidable in the new year, otherwise we will have  hyperinflation again -- but this time because of the wholesale  reduction in commodity supply. In the opinion of the well-known  economist Algimantas Lebedinskas [name as transliterated],  squeezing the money supply in absolute terms after reducing the  supply of goods is a sheer illusion. Moreover, the country can  expect mass unemployment -- requiring state spending that the  state budget will hardly be able to withstand owing to the tax  collection shortfall.    So the Russian economy can look forward not to stabilization  -- as the monetarist reformers stubbornly promise -- but new  upheavals. Perhaps even stronger upheavals than last year.</p>

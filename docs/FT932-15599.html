			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / US jets bomb Iraqi guns US AIRCRAFT patrolling Iraq's northern no-fly zone yesterday bombed an anti-aircraft battery. The US said the Iraqi guns had fired on the aircraft, but the Baghdad regime denied this. The incident is the first US-Iraqi military confrontation since January 20, President Bill Clinton's inauguration day, when US aircraft bombed an Iraqi radar after a series of clashes in the last days of the Bush administration. However, French jets patrolling the no-fly zone were fired on in February. US officials appeared inclined to assume the latest incident was an isolated one, unless a pattern of provocation develops over the next few days, as has often happened in the past. There were no immediate US plans to summon Iraq's ambassador at the United Nations to complain. Pentagon officials said four US aircraft - three F-16s and one F-4G - were on a routine patrol yesterday in the no-fly zone, set up by the UN to protect the region's Kurdish people from air attack by the regime of President Saddam Hussein. After they had been fired on, the aircraft dropped bombs on the anti-aircraft battery, then returned safely to their base at Encirlik in Turkey. Mr Richard Boucher, State Department spokesman, said the US remained committed to enforce both the northern no-fly zone and the similar zone in southern Iraq intended to protect the mainly Shia marsh Arabs. 'Iraq understands clearly what its obligations are in regard to the no-fly zone and will be held solely responsible for the serious consequences of failure to comply with these obligations,' Mr Boucher said. The Iraqi governor of the region said the US aircraft had dropped cluster bombs even though the Iraqi guns - guarding a dam - had not fired.</p>

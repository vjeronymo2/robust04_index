			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow holds its ground in spite of afternoon loss Wall Street AFTER Thursday's 50-point gain, US stock markets settled down yesterday into a holding pattern, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.45 at 3,280.19. Although the index spent most of the day only a few points either side of the previous night's record close, share prices did fall more than 20 points mid-afternoon before a round of buying restored the lost ground. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended down 2.46 at 411.44, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks fell 2.48 to 629.75. Turnover on the NYSE was 263m shares. Although the session opened with prices firmer, there was little conviction behind the buying, and investors appeared to be staying on the sidelines, wary of how the market would react in the afternoon to the expiration of options contracts on derivatives markets. However, the underlying tone in the market was firm, and even further declines in bond prices - the benchmark 30-year bond dropped nearly a half-point, pushing the yield up to 7.94 per cent - failed to unsettle stocks, which remained underpinned by hopes of a recovery in economic growth and corporate earnings. Among individual stocks, Time Warner rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 100 after a delayed opening due to an order imbalance. The rush of demand for the stock came as investors welcomed the surprise news late on Thursday that Mr Nick Nicholas, designated successor to Time Warner chairman Mr Steven Ross, had resigned because of differences with the management of the company. Mr Nicholas' departure ends what appears to have been a fierce power struggle at the top of the big entertainment group. His post as president and co-chief executive was taken by Mr Gerald Levin. Drug stocks were mostly higher, although all ended below their highs for the day. Bristol-Myers Squibb rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 78 5/8 , Schering Plough added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 56 3/4 and Pfizer firmed Dollars 1 to Dollars 72. The exception was Merck, which has outperformed the sector recently, falling Dollars 1 to Dollars 146 1/4 . Motor stocks, favoured by investors in recent days after reports of higher car sales and in anticipation of improved earnings, fell back. General Motors lost Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 38 1/4 , Ford gave up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 37 1/2 , and Chrysler slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 17. Unisys fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 9 5/8 in turnover of 3.8m shares after a leading newspaper columnist reported that some analysts think it is time to sell the stock, which just over a year ago was languishing at Dollars 2. Among over-the-counter stocks, fourth-quarter earnings continued to drive sentiment. Healthdyne climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 26 1/8 after posting net income of 26 cents a share, compared with 5 cents a share a year ago. Zeos International fell Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 17 5/8 in heavy trading on fourth-quarter earnings well up on a year ago but disappointing to analysts. Canada TORONTO stocks closed mixed in moderate trading to cap off a week characterised by declining prices. The TSE 300 eased 0.41 points to 3536.61, bringing the week's fall to about 37 points. Declines outnumbered advances by 330 to 254 on volume of 29.7m shares, valued at CDollars 382.3m. Goodyear Canada soared CDollars 9 to CDollars 48 1/4 as its parent, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber, said it will offer CDollars 48 a share for the common shares of Goodyear Canada it does not already own.</p>

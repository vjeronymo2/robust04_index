			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Waigel foresees more German spending cuts Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, expects the budget deficit to dip below 3 per cent of gross domestic product by 1995, but warns public spending cuts will have to continue. In an article in Handelsblatt, the German economics daily, Mr Waigel yesterday said decreasing the deficit, which accounts for 4 per cent of GDP, or DM70bn (Pounds 27.30bn), would mean limiting growth in public expenditure to 3 per cent of GDP. In line with estimates by the Bundesbank and several economic institutes, the finance minister yesterday said GDP would grow at between 0.5 and 1.0 per cent throughout 1994. It contracted by 2 per cent in 1993. The high budget deficit has been fuelled by the costs of unification, and the government's policy of subsidising consumption in eastern Germany at the expense of creating new jobs. Mr Helmut Kohl, the Chancellor, said this week that the high level of financial transfers to eastern Germany would continue, even though economists believe it will demand even greater public expenditure cuts if Mr Waigel's timetable for reducing the budget deficit is to be met. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, yesterday reinforced the message of further spending cuts ahead. Cuts in social security expenditure, however painful, would have to be part of future wages and fiscal policy, he said, while further tax increases should be ruled out. Mr Tietmeyer said that only a distinct improvement in these policy areas would allow the Bundesbank latitude for further relaxation of German monetary policy.</p>

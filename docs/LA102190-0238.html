			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPARE THE DUMPS  </P> <P> I'll give real estate agents one hint: Don't make a future seller angry by  sending tons of junk mail.  </P> <P> My family has lived in the same house on the Westside since the 1930s. When we  get so many solicitations to sell from one firm, we make a note in our date  book never to offer the house through that firm.  </P> <P> Garbage is garbage is garbage, particularly in Southern California where the  dumps are already full.  </P> <P> MARGARET W.

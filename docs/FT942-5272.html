			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / House conditions 'alarming' One in 13 homes in the UK is unfit for human habitation under official criteria, says a report published today to mark the start of National Housing Week. It says at least Pounds 22bn is needed to deal with urgent repairs. The National Housing Forum, an umbrella organisation representing a range of organisations involved in housing, says the rate of demolition is so slow that properties now being built will need to last 4,000 years - the age of Stonehenge. The forum says one in six homes needs urgent repairs costing more than Pounds 1,000. Urgent repairs are those that would lead to further substantial damage if not tackled, including water leaks, serious dampness or dangerous wiring. The report warns that housing conditions have reached alarming levels, with the majority of homes in poor condition being owner-occupied. It calls for an increase in the rate of demolition of unsound and substandard properties. The rate has fallen from more than 80,000 properties a year at the start of the 1970s to fewer than 5,000 in 1991-92. It recommends that owner-occupiers who cannot afford to repair their homes should be helped with equity-sharing loans and social security payments. Building societies and other lenders should be more active in encouraging borrowers to keep their homes in good condition, it says.

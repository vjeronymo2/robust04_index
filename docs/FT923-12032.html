			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Job cut costs hit profits at Rand Mines RAND MINES has blamed large retrenchment packages at Harmony gold mine, and a weak gold price, for a second-quarter R40.9m (Dollars 15.1m) loss at its gold division. The division made R7.3m after-tax profit in the March quarter. Harmony, by far the largest producer in the group, paid out R35.5m in benefits to 6,200 retrenched employees during the quarter, as the mine took steps to try to ensure continued profitability. Mr John Turner, chairman of the gold division, said other factors which had hurt profits were lower production at Harmony and Blyvooruitzicht, the two largest producers; an inability to lift the grade to compensate for higher costs and a lower price; and rationalisation at Blyvooruitzicht, though the costs will only be felt this quarter. Total gold production in the group dropped 4 per cent to 11,243kg from 11,699kg, while average price received was 2 per cent lower at R32,172 per kg. Total underground costs at the four mines rose to R37,721 per kg from R33,517 per kg. This was due mainly to the high retrenchment costs at Harmony. Mr Turner said he expected Harmony to return to profitability in the September quarter.</p>

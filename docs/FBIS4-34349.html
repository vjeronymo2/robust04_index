			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 17 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Haitian  Chamber of Commerce and Industry today condemned the  international embargo against this Caribbean country and labeled  it "unfair and criminal." In addition, other procoupist sectors  reaffirmed their support for the military.    The Chamber of Commerce criticized the possibility of  military intervention in Haiti and censured U.S. Government  representative William Gray, who said the Haitian private sector  had admitted that the military's permanence in power is harmful  for private sector interests.    Lawyer Mireille Durocher Bertin, who supports the military,  pointed out that "the High Command's resignation, demanded by  the UN Security Council, is equivalent to the destabilization of  the Army and, therefore, of all national institutions."  Conversely, pro-Aristide Deputy Samuel Madistin said "General  Cedras' resignation is the first step toward resolving the  crisis."    In view of the situation, U.S. diplomatic personnel started  to leave the country on Thursday. Unofficial sources, however,  have said that 75 U.S. Embassy officials will stay. According  to Radio Metropole, thousands of U.S. citizens, including  naturalized Haitians, have returned to their home country so far  and that 1,368 Haitians, who obtained political asylum in the  United States, are expected to travel to this country before 25  June.    As for the application of the embargo, banned products keep  entering Haiti through the border with the Dominican Republic  despite the presence of numerous soldiers and international  observers. Gasoline vendors, who work for the military and  their associates, appear to be surprised about the large amount  of fuel available. "The price keeps getting lower. It rose when  the border closure was announced. Shortly thereafter, however,  because it was so easy to obtain it, the price started to drop.  Now, gasoline costs 20 percent less than last week," one of the  vendors said.    The remarks by members of the different sectors occurred  nine  days after Canada stopped flights to Haiti and one week before  the United States applies a similar measure.</p>

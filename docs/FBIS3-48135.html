The government was defeated over the package last  Friday, when it was rejected by the House of Councillors.    The LDP's decision to allow the matter to go before a Diet  panel was reached by party President Yohei Kono and Secretary  General Yoshiro Mori, the officials said.    The crucial package, on which Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa has staked his job, could still be enacted if the panel  of 10 members from each of the two houses worked out a  compromise that then won approval by a majority vote in both  houses. The package rejected Friday had already been approved  by the more powerful House of Representatives.</p>

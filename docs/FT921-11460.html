			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (5): Chips are everywhere  -Semiconductors WEAK economic conditions in the US and Europe cast a shadow over the world semiconductor industry last year. Worldwide revenues grew by only about eight per cent, to Dollars 55bn, a far cry from the industry's traditional double digit growth but nonetheless better than 1990 when sales were flat. However, overall market trends mask a mixed performance by leading manufacturers, as sales of some product categories boom, while others are in a slump. The ubiquitous microprocessor, the 'brains' of computers, for example, continues to be a gold mine for companies such as Intel, now the largest US producer of integrated circuits. Microprocessor sales revenues leaped 60 per cent last year, to Dollars 3.5bn. Intel won the lion's share of this growth. Sales of microcontrollers, the blue-collar cousins of the microprocessor used in a wide variety of industrial equipment, in cars and in consumer electronics products, grew by about 25 per cent to almost Dollars 5bn. The market for commodity memory chips, in contrast, is experiencing severe oversupply and rapidly falling prices that have depressed the semiconductor earnings of some of Japan's giants as well as Texas Instruments in the US. Prices of Dynamic Random Access Memories (DRAMs) are in a nose-dive, with the average selling price of 4 Megabyte DRAMs, the latest generation of memory chips, declining by about 55 per cent over the past 12 months. DRAM sales picked up by 5 per cent last year, to Dollars 7bn, after a disastrous 24 per cent decline in 1990, according to Integrated Circuit Engineering, a US industry consulting group. Even optimistic projections of 28 per cent growth this year would only bring this segment of the industry back to its sales record of 1989, when revenues totalled Dollars 8.75bn. Japan's leading chip makers, with their commanding lead in the DRAM market of over 80 per cent of world sales, have become the latest victims of the most volatile and risk-prone segment of the semiconductor market. Historically, DRAM market slumps have had a profound influence upon the entire semiconductor industry. A 1981 reversal in the DRAM market, when revenues fell by 40 per cent, prompted several US chipmakers, including Intel which invented the DRAM, to leave the market. In 1985, when worldwide sales revenues took a 57 per cent dive, the US accused Japanese producers of 'dumping' and ultimately won a controversial five year trade pact. Similarly, the current problems facing DRAM manufacturers may signal a seachange in the industry. A major expansion of DRAM production during the boom years of 1987-1989 has created excess supply at a time when economic trends are dampening demand. Some of today's DRAM makers seem certain to cut their losses and retrench, leaving only a handful of DRAM 'specialists' to dominate the market. However, the future of the semiconductor industry will also be shaped by the fortunes of its major customers. The computer industry remains by far the biggest user of semiconductor devices, consuming over 40 per cent of products manufactured by 'merchant' chipmakers as well as the bulk of 'captive' production by companies such as International Business Machines. The general malaise in the computer industry has set the tone in the semiconductor industry over the past year, as world computer sales revenues declined for the first time in that industry's history. In most segments of the computer market, however, unit shipments continue to expand, increasing demand for semiconductor chips. For semiconductor manufacturers, therefore, computers remain a growth market. Similarly, the automobile industry, although severely affected by general economic trends, is a growing consumer of semiconductor devices. Today, each car sold is estimated to contain about Dollars 200 worth of semiconductor chips. By 1995 the 'chip content' of the average automobile is expected to double. Other important markets for chips include consumer electronics, telecommunications and defence electronics. The key role of the semiconductor industry as the supplier of 'building blocks' to the entire electronics industry has thrust chipmakers into the debate over international competitiveness. Japanese and North American producers dominate the world semiconductor market, with Japanese semiconductor manufacturers claiming 45 per cent of the world market in 1991, while US producers accounted for about 40 per cent. European producers' share of the world semiconductor market has remained relatively flat, at about 10 per cent, over the past few years. New entrants in Korea and Taiwan have, however, achieved a five per cent world market share last year. The US-Japanese battle over semiconductor trade remains an over-riding concern among chipmakers on both sides of the Pacific. Last year, the two countries reached a new semiconductor trade agreement in which Japan endorsed the US goal that Japan should import 20 per cent of the semiconductor products that it consumes by the end of 1992. Currently, US suppliers hold a 14 per cent share of the Japanese semiconductor market, according to data agreed upon by both countries. Unless the 20 per cent goal is reached, however, there is sentiment in the US for some form of retaliation with serious consequences for all semiconductor makers. While political and economic trends have a significant influence upon the semiconductor industry, it is the creation of new markets for semiconductor chips that drives the industry's growth. The emergence of 'nomadic computing', high definition TV and other new types of consumer products that combine computer technology with multimedia presentations represent vast new opportunities for chipmakers that should ensure growth in the 1990s.</p>

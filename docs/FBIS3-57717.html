Well-known Russian business executive and entrepeneur and  parliament member Aleksandr Titkin is sure that Belarus's  foreign economic policy will remain unchanged as long as the  republic's government is headed by common-sensed Vyacheslav  Kebich.    Although Titkin could not foresee what would happen if  Kebich  were to be forced out of his job, he hopes that common sense  will carry the day in the Belarusian government. Titkin said  Belarus is less subject to nationalist passions than many of its  neighbors.    Titkin expressed the opinion that the merging of the  Belarusian and Russian economies should be carried out  carefully, without haste, in order to shield the Russian economy  from additional problems. In particular, he said it is  essential for Russia to avoid handing out hidden subsidies to  its western neighbor, and to avoid pressure from the  "Belarusian" roubles on the internal Russian market (in case the  two states' monetary systems are merged).    "I even think it would be better if the Belarusian "rabbit"  notes remained in circulation for the initial stage, until we  come to complete agreement on tax, pricing, and tariff policy",  Titkin announced.    45-year old Titkin was head of a financial investment  company, Russian investment technologies, until the December 12  elections. As deputy in the federation council, he has begun to  work on the finances committee, which is responsible for the  budget, financial, currency, credit and tax policy, monetary  emission, and customs regulations.</p>

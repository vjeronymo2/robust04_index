			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 10 May (NOTIMEX) -- Agrarian Reform  Under Secretary Gustavo Gordillo de Anda exchanged information  and experiences on agrarian topics with a Chinese delegation led  by Agriculture Vice Minister Liu Chengguo.    In the meeting, the goal of which was to strengthen  bilateral  relations, they analyzed cooperation for various programs and  projects to help rural producers. Gordillo de Anda stressed  that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has paid special  attention to the rural sector through the reforms of  Constitutional Article 27 and the new agrarian law.    Chengguo said his country is taking several actions to  overcome the crisis in the countryside, including the  elimination of the commune system and the organization of  cooperatives that will permit the development of the Chinese  countryside. He said his country views exchange and cooperation  with Mexico as important because its experience in investment,  support, and autonomy for peasants is valuable and will be  useful for China.    The members of the Chinese delegation met with the heads of  the Agrarian Prosecutor's Office and the National Agrarian  Registry [Registro Agrario Nacional -- RAN], with whom they  exchanged viewpoints on the Procede [expansion unknown] and RAN  programs.    The meeting was also attended by Senior Officer Raul Pineda  Pineda, Agrarian Organization Director Ricardo Chavez Perez, and  Rosalia Enciso of the Foreign Secretariat.</p>

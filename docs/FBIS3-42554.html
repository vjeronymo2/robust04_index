The USSR managed to  get only the crumbs from the German rocket pie, but we had S.  Korolev and V. Glushko and the pride of the victors.    On October 18 of '47, the first Soviet rocket, the R-1, flew  its first 207 km. It launched from the top-secret testing  grounds of Kapustin Yar. Out of 10 proposed sites strewn across  the Union, a piece of the Volga steppe the size of a small  European state was chosen. They say that Lawrence Berry  [Lavrentiy Beriya] himself kept tabs on the project.    They didn't allot much time to hammer out the country's  missile shield, throwing three engineering-construction brigades  from the front to Kapustin Yar. V. Voznyuk, the katyusha  specialist who had rocketed from major to general in one year of  the war, created a super testing ground on the barren spot at  Stalin's command. The railroad to it from Stalingrad didn't go  through a single population center.    The military watch began with the R-2, the absolute favorite  of the testers for the 6 tons of alcohol that went in to make up  the fuel. The R-5 was the first missile with a nuclear warhead  to rush to the east. They say there that, to this day, no one  knows whether it exploded or not, or where it could have  happened. The famous R-12s, which were hauled to Cuba in order  to settle the Caribbean crisis, stood "cocked" for a full 30  years and were regarded as the strongest of the fingers of our  nuclear fist. True, the alcohol in them was long gone, but the  parity with the Yankees wasn't shaken. The RSD-10 (SS-20), which  was born in '73 and shocked all our enemies, had no match for  many years. When the United States got wind of them, it decided  right then and there to make peace with the "evil empire."    The road was carved out for Gagarin by 48 dogs launched from  Kapustin Yar. The first to go aloft, in the summer of '51, were  not Belka and Strelka, who were also prepared here, but Dozik  and Tsygan. Later one pioneer died, and a second lived with S.  Korolev's family. A dog by the name of Otvazhnaya [Brave] went  up four times. But not all of them were drawn to the stars --  one animal decided to run away just before the launch, right  from the launch pad, and they had to send the nearest mongrel up  into space in its place. But it didn't matter, they got the job  done for the party and the government.    At Kapustin Yar, they built the first artificial Earth  satellite, which was put into orbit from Baykonur. At Kapustin  Yar, they worked the bugs out of the space television, radio,  and telephone communications.    The heaviest fog of secrecy had barely lifted in '73, when  we  helped the Poles lift their first, the Copernicus-500, to the  proper altitude. We launched the friendly Indian Ariabata series  in '75, and after that, even the French were allowed to go to  orbit from there.    Buran, which engendered a flurry of enthusiasm when it took  off and landed in Kazakhstan, was painstakingly built in the  Volga region under the supervision of German Titov.    But in the '80s, we got "caught up," as it were, in big  space. The USSR had another space jacket -- Baykonur    Hit over the Urals on the first of May in '60, the American  pilot Powers had been quite [illegible] as he bailed out of the  cozy U-2. His superiors had not warned him that the Russians had  the Volkhov S-75 antiaircraft missile complex, which laughed at  the high-altitude jet capabilities of the reconnaissance plane  from the States. They didn't warn him because they didn't know  the Russian had it.    The antiaircraft testing grounds had broken away from its  strategic missile brother in '51, and within less than two  months, it roared with the first vertical-launch surface-to-air  missile. The multichannel creation was outfitted to protect the  motherland's capital. Within three years, the surface-to-air  missile complex was firing at 20 targets at once. In May of '55,  first Moscow, and then other important centers and borders were  bristling with the arrows of SAMs.    The first mobile SAM unit, the Dvina, was combat ready in  late '57, near Brest. A version of it, the Volkhov, not only  interrupted the spy flight over the center of the Soviet  military-industrial complex, but also let the United States know  that the USSR was ahead of everyone else on the planet in air  defense, which meant that it was hazardous to flit about  perniciously over one-sixth of the land surface.    The Volkhov, and later the Pechora, made their way to 40  countries and didn't do badly in the confrontation with Phantoms  in Viet Nam and Mirages in the Near East.    In just two years at Kapustin Yar, they "rolled out" the  first automatic system for controlling SAMs. The mid-60s saw the  appearance of radar systems for detecting enemy aircraft.  Finally, unique simulator systems were created in the '70s. That  is, by turning on a computer, but without launching aircraft or  rockets, they were able to work out the bugs there in combat  with any air attack that might happen. The Americans were  gnashing their teeth with envy. And in February of '93, all they  could do was hold on to a pillar in Abu Dabi: in the Arabian  sky, Russian-made S-300s on the fly knocked out two cruise  missiles. The sheiks gave a standing ovation.    Do you remember the story about the "submarine in the  Ukrainian steppes?" It's not altogether a myth. In Kapustin Yar,  in an immense basin, is a sub in which they used to test  sea-launched missiles. Generally speaking, Kapustin Yar is  replete with legends. The burst of myth-making began between '88  and '91, when 654 intermediate-range SS-20 missiles were being  destroyed here.    Legend No. 1: nuclear explosions occur in the Volga steppes.  In fact, the warheads have been removed in other places, and  here they've only exploded batches of airframes.    Legend No. 2: as a result of the explosions in Kapustin Yar,  windows have shattered, walls have cracked, and, in Volgograd,  homes have been demolished. On August 30 of '90, Academician Ye.  Velikhov reported in an analysis that the seismic vibrations 5  kilometers from the explosion site do not exceed 3 on the scale.  It's 28 kilometers to Kapustin Yar, the windows in the local  department store shattered only once, when a fighter plane broke  the sound barrier over the city.    Legend No. 3: a massive die-off of sheep was associated with  the missiles. A commission of the main directorate,  veterinarians, and a scientific research institute found sulfur  and arsenic in the wool and livers of the sheep that died. The  lab head from the All-Union Scientific Research Institute, G.  Kashfutdinov, suggested that "the main reason for the deaths  was, apparently, the rocket-fuel combustion products of unknown  composition." We could brand the fleecing missile-people, but  the "rocket fuel products" of the SS-20 contain neither sulfur,  nor arsenic; the emissions of the Astrakhan Gas-Condensate  Combine, however, does contain those products.    The keys to the Kapustin Yar, a city of 32,000 closed off by  three checkpoints, are held in two hands -- that of the garrison  leadership and that of the city government. And although the  small Astrakhan Oblast Council pointed out on May 17 of this  year that, according to current law, the civilian executive body  is supposed to reign in Kapustin Yar, the real boss of that  settlement is Gen. V. Tonkikh.    But that doesn't mean that the missile arm of authority and  the civilian arm of authority are locked in battle under the  carpet. Last April, the local police, together with the  military, averted a massive action of youth that was meant to  "run out of town" Kavkaz people who had been attracted to  Kapustin Yar to revive trade. It was averted without any  injuries. Over all of '93, there was only one murder.    The initial impression that it's mainly sports figures and  top models who live there was confirmed in a visit I made to the  sports complex, which has a pool, a shooting range, and a  stadium.    Today, the leasing of launch pads in Kazakhstan, which may  be  seeing their last winter, costs billions, and their equipment  and people can and should be transferred to a re-outfitted  Kapustin Yar, where products and fuel don't have to be brought  in by plane.    And if Plesetsk, planted in the northern bogs, can be  regarded as the Russian equivalent to the Kapustin Yar missile  testing grounds, then the air-defense testing grounds in  Zavolzhye is the only one in Russia. We no other sites where we  can do a professional job of testing antiaircraft systems that  tomorrow would protect both the country and its interests in  local conflicts. Where else is it possible to be demonstrating  to hard-currency buyers, on a permanent basis, new SAM complexes  in all their glory (China has already bought a batch of S-300s,  Kuwait is thing about it, although what's there to think about  -- the Patriots are more expensive and not as good)? In the  opinion of V. Korolev, the deputy chief for science of the  air-defense testing grounds, any and all kinds of weapons from  any of the combat arms could be tested in Kapustin Yar.    Whatever the military doctrine, it would be stupid to not  preserve the Kapustin Yar testing grounds after having made them  into a base for the country's armed forces and having abandoned  expensive foreign launch pads.</p>

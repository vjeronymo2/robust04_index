			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Letter: Cadbury: divisions over ownership and accountability (5) Sir, The eagerness with which the president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants sets out the five actions which his institute intends to take as a result of the Cadbury report (Letters, June 8) may have something to do with the fact that four of them will no doubt lead directly to increased fees for his members. Your columns are remarkably empty of comments from shareholders, who will pay for the additional auditing, as to what action they might take. This is not surprising. First because Cadbury seems largely to have turned a blind eye to the tiresome fact that somebody has to perform the ownership role and second because action which shareholders take has to be paid for by themselves. This is not the case for the other actors in this drama. Private shareholders do intend to act. Some are in the process of forming the UK Private Shareholders' Association.

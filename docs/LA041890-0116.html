			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OAKLAND SCORES TWICE IN 12TH TO BEAT ANGELS  </P> <P> The Angels knew for whom the rally bells tolled Tuesday night.  </P> <P> With 34,370 fans at Anaheim Stadium ringing the souvenir bells they had  received upon arrival, the Angels rallied from a three-run deficit in the sixth  inning on Dante Bichette's third home run of the season to pull even with the  Oakland A's at 5-5.  </P> <P> But Oakland scored two runs in the 12th to win, 7-5.  </P> <P> Angel starter Mark Langston, who pitched seven hitless innings against Seattle  last Wednesday in his previous start, did not approach that form Tuesday. He  gave up seven hits, including home runs to Carney Lansford and Mark McGwire in  the third inning, and left after six innings. The Angels rallied in the bottom  of that inning to tie the score, ensuring that Langston would not be the loser.  </P> <P> Langston was charged with four earned runs and made a throwing error on a  pickoff play to set up the fifth Oakland run. He struck out six and walked two  while making 105 pitches, a hefty total for so short a stint. He made 98 over  seven innings last Wednesday.  </P> <P> A victory by the Angels would have given them a 6-2 record and equaled their  best starts. They had 6-2 records after eight games in 1970 and '74.  </P> <P> A's starter Mike Moore, once a teammate of Langston's in Seattle, gave up three  runs Tuesday. Reliever Todd Burns gave up the three-run home run to Bichette,  who leads the Angels in home runs with three.  </P> <P> The question of what Langston would do for an encore was answered quickly. As  during his no-hitter, he walked the leadoff hitter, Rickey Henderson. But the  pattern was broken when the second hitter, Carney Lansford, rapped a single to  right. Langston got out of the inning with the help of an excellent pickoff  throw to second that caught Rickey Henderson leaning, but he couldn't escape  the third inning unscathed.  </P> <P> The A's did their damage with two outs. Third baseman Carney Lansford powered a  1-and-0 pitch a few rows into the left-field seats, and Jose Canseco followed  with a shot up the middle that blew past Langston's upreached glove and into  center field. McGwire followed by reaching down for Langston's first pitch and  slamming a home run deep to left field. It was his third home run of the  season.  </P> <P> Langston did recover his poise, striking out two in the fourth inning for a  total of five. He had struck out three Mariners in his seven hitless innings.  </P> <P> The Angels could do little against Moore until the fourth inning. Wally Joyner  walked and scored when Chili Davis blasted a 2-and-0 pitch 420 feet to center  field that pulled the Angels to 3-2.  </P> <P> Langston seemed to settle into a groove in the middle innings. He struck out  the last two batters of the fourth and first man in the fifth for a total of  six strikeouts before Rickey Henderson bounced a ground-rule double down the  left-field line. Canseco followed with a double off the wall in left, scoring  Henderson for a 4-2 lead.  </P> <P> The A's padded that to 5-2 in the sixth, without benefit of a hit. Dave  Henderson drew a leadoff walk and went to third when Langston threw away an  intended pickoff throw to first. Henderson held at third on Terry Steinbach's  grounder to third, but with the squeeze play on, Lance Blankenship laid down a  perfect bunt up the first-base line that allowed Henderson to score.  </P> <P> The Angels then tied the score with one swing of Bichette's bat. Johnny Ray  beat out a grounder to third for an infield hit and Joyner barely missed a home  run, sending center fielder Dave Henderson crashing into the wall to make the  catch. That was all for Moore, who was relieved by right-hander Todd Burns.  </P> <P> Burns threw four straight balls to Davis, who had switched to the left side of  the plate. That brought up Bichette, a right-handed hitter, who slammed a  3-and-1 pitch over the center field fence. The drive was measured at 422 feet.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> A's Manager Tony La Russa said his club wasn't taking this series against the  Angels lightly. "You can't waste a golden opportunity to take your best shot,"  he said. "It's kind of unusual because we play them two and then don't see them  for three months (July 23-26 at Oakland). We can't waste these games."  </P> <P> His team didn't waste any games in the first week of the season, winning five  of six. "The truth is, we had a solid first week," he said. "The starting  pitching, relief pitching, hitting. The only problem is that it was last week,  not this week."  </P> <P> La Russa also said his team is aware of the defensive exploits of Angel  outfielder Dante Bichette, who had five assists last week, but isn't about to  change its strategy. "We know he throws well. We knew that last season," he  said. "Still, our style is to push. If there's a guy on second base and there's  a single to left field, unless the ball is in the guy's hand, we're going to  send him. You don't take foolish chances, though."  </P> <P> Rickey Henderson's first-inning walk was the 1,000th of his career, fifth among  active players. Dwight Evans, Willie Randolph, Keith Hernandez and Brian  Downing are ahead of him.  </P> <P> Despite being on the disabled list, Bob McClure, Dick Schofield and Bill  Schroeder will make the upcoming road trip. Trainer Ned Bergert said Schroeder  (sore right elbow) is throwing again and is feeling better. However, Schroeder  will still see Dr. Paul Jacobs, who surgically repaired his elbow in 1985,  Friday. Schofield (strained right hamstring) is running and hitting but not  taking grounders. McClure (inflamed left elbow) is undergoing therapy to  strengthen.  </P> <P> The Angels set a club record with sacrifice hits in five consecutive games  before Tuesday. . . . Every player on the 27-man roster except Sherman Corbett  had played before Tuesday night.  </P></p>

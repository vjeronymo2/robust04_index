			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROCK 'N' ROIL: DEBATES ON WHO'S NO. 1, RACISM, SEXISM AND CRITICISM  </P> <P> A "Showdown at the Coliseum"? As a 20-year veteran of Rolling Stones concerts  who has seen the Stones on the same bill with many fine artists, I can attest  to the fact that there are few feelings comparable to the letdown that occurs  the moment the Stones themselves hit the stage.  </P> <P> Let's drop this talk about "upstaging" -- I don't believe the Stones have  played with much passion, or even in tune, for decades -- and tip our hats to  these master entertainers, canny (and secure) enough to bring us a better show  than they can put on themselves.  </P> <P> JEFF M. ROSS  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

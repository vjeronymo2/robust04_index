			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jonathan Eyal, director of studies at the Royal </F> United Services Institute in London: "Another Walk-on Part for  Moscow"]    [Text] With this week's meetings in London, international  efforts to tackle the Yugoslav war have come full circle.  Originally, the European Union asserted a leading role in the  Balkans. After failing comprehensively, it passed the problem  to the UN, which in turn handed it to NATO. The involvement of  NATO brought in the Americans and that, predictably, drew in the  Russians. Three years after the Yugoslav crisis started, the  governments concerned decided on a measure they could have  implemented from the start: they established a "contact group"  of officials to co-ordinate policies in Yugoslavia.    Ostensibly, a contact group makes sense. The positions of  the NATO governments and the Kremlin appear to be drawing  closer. NATO's failure to stop the Serbs destroying Gorazde was  followed by the failure of the Russian envoy in the Balkans,  deputy foreign minister Vitaliy Churkin, to achieve the same end  through persuasion.    The U.S. Administration has been pushing for stronger NATO  action in Yugoslavia precisely because it assumes that this time  the Russians are unlikely to object. Yet appearances can be  deceptive: the contact group is a device intended to take a  middle course between engaging Moscow in the Balkans and keeping  the Russians away. And, despite the current efforts, the West  is almost guaranteed to continue misreading the message from the  Kremlin.    We have persuaded ourselves that the Russians have a  historic  friendship with the Serbs. But although history plays a part in  the Balkans, it tends to provide only justification, not the  reason, for the Serbs' current policies. True, many Russians  feel some affinity with them. Historically, though,  Russian-Serb relations were dominated more by confrontation than  co-operation.    Nationalist politicians in Moscow today may have an interest  in reviving a historic pan-Slav alliance. But this is not  necessarily the same as friendship with the Serbs; Slovenia,  Croatia, Macedonia and Bulgaria are also Slav nations. It is  often forgotten, moreover, that Serbia's political elite was  educated at a time when Moscow was viewed as Yugoslavia's mortal  enemy. All Serb generals now fighting in Bosnia were trained  for a possible Soviet invasion. In short, the "traditional"  Russian-Serb friendship is nothing more than a temporary  marriage of convenience and is unlikely to last.    Isolated from the world, Serbs see Moscow as their only  protector against military action from the West. But they are  also determined to show that they will not allow the Kremlin to  interfere with their war plans. Hence they ignored Russia's  demands for a halt to the carnage around Gorazde.    Having the limits of their influence exposed has been  frustrating for Russia's diplomats. But this does not mean that  Boris Yeltsin is now ready to give the West a free hand in the  Balkans. From the Russian perspective, the most important  consideration is not the ultimate arrangements in Yugoslavia,  but the lessons that the Balkan war may have for future European  security structures and the precedents Western action may set.    Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian politicians  kept the notion of a "strategic partnership" with the West. It  is easy to see what they had in mind: although weakened, Russia  should continue to occupy a place at the top table and be  involved in important decisions. The West understood this need,  and paid lip service to the concept. But events in Yugoslavia  exposed how insubstantial it was.    Russia's every demand for a new UN mandate in the Balkans  has  been rejected. Instead, the West has insisted on reinterpreting  resolutions already adopted by the Security Council. Often, as  far as Moscow was concerned, they did this without consulting  the Kremlin. The decision to nominate NATO to implement UN  policies in Bosnia was taken without consulting the Russians; so  was the decision to issue an ultimatum on Sarajevo, the shooting  down of four Serb planes over Bosnia and the launch of air  strikes on Gorazde on 10 April. At each stage, the West  promised the Russians would be involved, but this happened  after, not before, a decision was taken.    The tactic was familiar to the Russians, for it was the same  as the one used by the United States before the Gulf war.  Moscow was also excluded from the Arab-Israeli peace  negotiations: the Russian foreign minister was invited only to  the signing ceremony in Washington, just an actor in a vast  Western-sponsored photo-opportunity.    So, when NATO issued its ultimatum on Sarajevo this  February,  Mr Yeltsin was determined not to be surprised again: instead of  relying on Western promises, he deployed troops around the  Bosnian capital, so ensuring that his country could no longer be  ignored.    Russia's main interest in Yugoslavia is to uphold a single  idea: that NATO should not be allowed to do as it pleases in  what Moscow still considers a Russian sphere of influence. The  West may be right to challenge this view. But to annoy the  Russians and fail to achieve any purpose in Yugoslavia is the  worst of both worlds.    Mr Yeltsin has recently revived his call for a summit on  Yugoslavia. The American administration has no interest in a  new conference that could force it to take on unwelcome  commitments. So, instead of a summit, this contact group will  now attempt to devise a joint East-West strategy that will allow  the Russians to claim they remain involved, while upholding  NATO's leading role in the Balkans. The creation of the group,  without prior consultation with either Spain or Canada, has  already infuriated both of these serious contributors to the  Yugloslav peace-keeping force. And the chances are that this  entire exercise will do little to change the situation on the  ground.    The contact group may restrict the Serbs' ability to play  off  one power against another. But realities do not change: the  Americans would like the Bosnians to accept that their republic  is irrevocably divided, but cannot say so publicly; the Russians  would like to limit NATO's involvement in the region, but do not  wish to pick a fight with the West over Yugoslavia.    The truth that the creation of the contact group seeks to  hide is simple. The interests of the West and those of Russia  do not coincide in the Balkans. For the Russians, the status  quo, created by Serb aggression, is acceptable; for the West, it  is not. The Balkans require a genuine commitment from  governments that believe strife in the area actually matters for  European security. The creation of the contact group sends  exactly the opposite message: bereft of new ideas, all  governments have agreed that their main purpose is to shelve  further disputes between themselves -- the very same lowest  common denominator that has failed every time in Yugoslavia.</p>

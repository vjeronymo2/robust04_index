			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / International Company News: CS Holding wants to buy stake in Austrian bank CS Holding, the Swiss financial group that owns Credit Suisse, confirmed yesterday that it wanted to buy a substantial stake in Creditanstalt-Bankverein, the second largest Austrian bank, from the Austrian ministry of finance. Mr Rainer Gut, chairman, said that CS Holding wanted to establish Austria as one of its 'domestic bases' after Switzerland and the US, and had contacted the Austrian finance ministry to express its interest. Mr Gut said he believed the ministry would sell 28 per cent of Creditanstalt's ordin-ary voting shares, or 20 per cent of total equity. The ministry has undertaken to dispose of part of its 69.6 per cent voting equity stake this year. He said that if it was successful in buying a stake, CS Holding would probably want to raise it in time. Mr Gut added that CS Holding was particularly interested in Creditanstalt because its traditional links with businesses in central and eastern Europe would give the group a significant edge in building earnings there. Mr Gut spoke at CS Holding's annual results presentation in London at which the group announced a 20 per cent rise in its dividend to SFr18 per share, plus the issue of a shareholder warrant with a theoretical value of SFr12. CS Holding's interest is unlikely to please Creditanstalt's board of management, which does not want a significant minority holder to emerge. Both Credit Suisse and Union Bank of Switzerland reported earnings declines in the first quarter of the year, as a result of volatility in bond and equity markets in contrast to the extremely good trading conditions of 1993. However, the two top Swiss banking groups both expressed confidence in the outturn for the year as a whole, pointing to the recovery in the Swiss economy and the declining trend in provisions for bad and doubtful loans. Total group assets of Credit Suisse at the end of March were 1 per cent higher than at the end of 1993, at SFr233.9bn (Dollars 162.4bn). Lendings were flat at SFr123.4bn and customer deposits rose 2 per cent to SFr157.9bn. UBS said total assets of the parent company, at SFr240.3bn, were 4.1 per cent higher at the end of March than at the end of December. Lendings were up 1.8 per cent to SFr148.6bn and customer deposits gained 2.6 per cent to SFr130.6bn. Following a surprisingly lifeless debate, the annual meeting of Union Bank of Switzerland yesterday rejected a motion by BK Vision, its largest shareholder, to reduce the maximum size of the board of directors from 25 to nine.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Unionists to propose new deal for Northern Ireland The Ulster Unionist party plans to publish within three weeks proposals for a new political settlement in Northern Ireland in a move likely to put pressure on London to keep the talks process moving. The plan emerged yesterday as Mr John Major, the prime minister, underlined the government's determination to press ahead with talks in an effort to wrest back the initiative from Sinn Fein after Mr Gerry Adams' highly publicised visit to the US this week. Mr Major told MPs at question time that progress in the province 'cannot and will not wait for Sinn Fein'. The government would 'actively carry forward the political talks with the constitutional parties and with the Irish government'. The delicacy of the task was highlighted when Dublin reacted frostily to a suggestion by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, in a Financial Times interview that London would bring forward its proposals for a political settlement in the next two weeks. Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, said in a terse statement that it was 'important' the British paper be 'directed to the achievement of the objective which the two governments have jointly set themselves, namely a comprehensive political settlement which addresses all the main relationships'. Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, said he would not accept any variation from the so-called 'three-stranded' format, covering relationships in the province, between north and south, and between London and Dublin. According to Sir Patrick, London's fresh ideas will cover devolved government in Northern Ireland and formal mechanisms for enhancing cross-border co-operation. 'Strand Three,' he said, 'is for the two governments'. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline Democratic Unionists, who are boycotting the talks, said yesterday that the party would not participate in talks 'either under the aegis of the Anglo-Irish agreement or the Downing Street Declaration'. The UUP paper, which the party is aiming to publish before Sinn Fein holds its party conference on February 26 and 27, is expected to argue that a blueprint for devolved government in the province - agreed between the constitutional parties - is needed before progress can be made on cross-border co-operation. Drawn up after consultation with grassroots unionists, it is expected to flesh out the 'blueprint for stability' proposed by Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, in March. It is likely to suggest that an Ulster assembly should start life with few if any legislative powers. Meanwhile, Mr Adams was heckled and jostled yesterday by victims of IRA violence when he arrived in Dublin. Political notebook, Page 9</p>

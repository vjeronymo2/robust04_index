			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Untac under fire over human rights failure ASIAWATCH, the US-based human rights group, yesterday accused the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) of failing to deal effectively with human rights abuses and said it had thereby left the way open for further abuses in the future. 'Hundreds of serious abuses have been documented by Untac, but few have been publicly exposed or redressed,' Asiawatch said in a report. Untac's failure was serious because its mandate emphasised measures to assure human rights in view of Cambodia's tragic history, the report said. Abuses had been committed by all the main factions: the UN had continued to court the Khmer Rouge after the guerrillas had slaughtered Vietnamese and Cambodian civilians, and it had failed to dismiss or prosecute government officials who condoned the murder and intimidation of opponents. Asiawatch urged Untac to appoint an independent tribunal to ensure that suspects in Untac investigations were properly tried, and suggested the government to emerge from next week's election should give priority to creating an independent judiciary. Asiawatch also said Thailand should be pressed to arrest Pol Pot, the extreme left-wing Khmer Rouge leader, for crimes committed during the organisation's reign of terror in Cambodia from 1975 to 1978, 'rather than providing him shelter and protection'. Pol Pot and his associates are blamed for the deaths of an estimated 1m Cambodians. He now has a house in eastern Thailand near to the Cambodian border and has close relations with Thai military officers. The report recommended that the UN should improve its monitoring of the border to ensure that timber and gems do not go into Thailand in violation of sanctions and provide foreign exchange for the Khmer Rouge. Consumers and traders - including those from Japan, Vietnam and Thailand - should be punished if they broke the embargoes. Cambodia: human rights before and after the elections. Asiawatch, 485 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10017-6104, USA.</p>

F. K. Hu, a member of the Eighth National Committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], said  the SAR should adhere to Hong Kong's existing system and  encourage local citizens to work hard and build "capitalism with  Hong Kong characteristics" under the guidance of the  Sino-British Joint Declaration and the SAR Basic Law.    Economically, it is necessary to carry out a laissez-fair  trade policy and consolidate the open market economic system to  ensure fair and free competition among investors and  industrialists, said Hu, chairman of the Hong Kong Ryoden  Electric Engineering Co., Ltd.    In terms of law, the SAR should uphold the spirit of lofty  fair legislation to boost the confidence of investors, and the  most important thing in this regard is to protect private  properties and human rights, he said.    The future Hong Kong should also maintain political and  economic stability, adopt a simple taxation system and build  infrastructural projects to attract investors, he said.    It is imperative to follow the duty-free policy to  facilitate  free flow of funds and goods, free investors and businessmen of  unnecessary worries, and avoid procedures and overheads caused  by various control measures such as foreign exchange control, he  said.    He suggested that the SAR maintain the existing civil  service  system, build housing whose prices are lined with costs and sell  units to low-income residents; and strengthen education, medical  care and social security services.    Hong Kong and the mainland should expand exchanges, trade  and  cooperation, he said.</p>

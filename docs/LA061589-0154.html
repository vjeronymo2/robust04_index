			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ALL-VALLEY BASEBALL TEAM;  </P> <P> COACH OF THE YEAR  </P> <P> Manny Alvarado  </P> <P> KENNEDY  </P> <P> As an assistant at San Fernando last year, Alvarado made a trip to the City  Section 4-A Division championship baseball game at Dodger Stadium with the  Tigers. When he was hired at Kennedy a month later, he said he hoped his wait  for a return visit would be a short one. How about one season? In his first  year as a varsity coach, Alvarado, 35, won a City title, leading the Golden  Cougars to the 4-A crown with a 4-3 win over Palisades. Not bad for a guy who  didn't coach at a high school for eight years until he returned to San Fernando  in 1988. This year he led Kennedy to a 22-7 record and the North Valley League  title.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PLAYER OF THE YEAR  </P> <P> Gino Tagliaferri  </P> <P> KENNEDY  </P> <P> Tagliaferri, 5-11, 190-pound shortstop, is a three-time All-Valley selection  who capped a spectacular career with a record-setting season. He cracked 13  home runs to lead the state and set a single-season City Section record. His  three-year career total of 23 is also a City record and places him in a tie for  fifth on the state list. In leading the Golden Cougars to City and North Valley  League titles, he batted .365 and had a slugging percentage of .875. Of his 35  hits, 25 went for extra bases. He was selected in the third round by the  Detroit Tigers in baseball's amateur draft and has signed a letter of intent  with Fresno State.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PITCHER OF THE YEAR  </P> <P> Roger Salkeld  </P> <P> SAUGUS  </P> <P> Salkeld's career was capped when the Seattle Mariners made him the No. 3 pick  in the nation in baseball's amateur draft. The 6-foot-5, 210-pound,  hard-throwing right-hander was 13-1 with an 0.57 earned-run average and had 178  strikeouts in 108 1/3 innings. His three-year totals: A 30-7 record with 404  strikeouts and a 1.31 ERA in 266 1/3 innings. Salkeld hurled his only no-hitter  last month against Canyon and led the Centurions to their fifth Golden League  title and the Southern Section 3-A Division championship game. Saugus was  defeated by La Palma Kennedy, 1-0, when Salkeld uncorked a ninth-inning wild  pitch. But two days later, draft day gave Salkeld reason to celebrate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FIRST TEAM  </P> <P> Javier Delahoya P  </P> <P> GRANT  </P> <P> 6-2, 170  </P> <P> Sr.  </P> <P> The East Valley League MVP became the first Valley-area high school player to  sign a professional contract when he accepted a $40,000 offer from the Dodgers  last week. He was selected in the fourth round in baseball's amateur draft.  Delahoya was 9-1 with a 1.93 ERA and struck out 99 in 76 innings. He also  batted .379 with five home runs and 27 RBIs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Derek Wallace P  </P> <P> CHATSWORTH  </P> <P> 6-3, 170  </P> <P> Sr.  </P> <P> The right-hander is a repeat selection from last season and one of four  Chancellors selected in the amateur draft. He likely will pass up an offer from  the Pittsburgh Pirates to play at Pepperdine next season. The West Valley  League MVP posted a 9-3 record with a 1.92 ERA. He batted .344 with four home  runs, 22 RBIs and stole 10 bases.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Casey Burrill C  </P> <P> HART  </P> <P> 6-3, 210  </P> <P> Sr.  </P> <P> In the year of the catcher, the All-Valley team carries two of the top high  school catchers in the state with Burrill and Bobby Hughes. Burrill led Hart's  drive to the Southern Section 4-A title game with a .453 average and also hit  six home runs. He had 39 RBIs to tie for most in the Valley area. Drafted by  the Pirates, Burrill will likely attend USC in the fall.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bobby Hughes C  </P> <P> NOTRE DAME  </P> <P> 6-3, 210  </P> <P> Sr.  </P> <P> Hughes nearly matched Burrill's statistics. He batted .400 with eight doubles,  three triples, three home runs and 38 RBIs. Hughes, who has signed with Loyola  Marymount, had an even bigger impact on defense. In the playoffs, he threw out  Cerritos shortstop Robert Hinds, who is headed to UCLA, and was three for three  against Lakewood baserunners.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rich Aude INF  </P> <P> CHATSWORTH  </P> <P> 6-5, 185  </P> <P> Sr.  </P> <P> Next to Tagliaferri, Aude was the most devastating hitter in the Valley area.  He batted .454 and led the area with 45 hits. He slugged six home runs, scored  31 runs and tied Burrill for the lead in RBIs with 39. Aude, who has signed  with UC Santa Barbara, was drafted by Pittsburgh in the second round to become  the highest selection in school history.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bobby Corrales INF  </P> <P> SAN FERNANDO  </P> <P> 5-8, 165  </P> <P> Sr.  </P> <P> Corrales set a school record for RBIs with 34 and batted .385. He also set an  unofficial record in a new category instituted by Coach Steve Marden: hitting  in the clutch. In 51 at-bats with runners in scoring position, Corrales had 23  hits -- a .451 average. Corrales struck out only twice in 91 at-bats. Corrales  was not drafted and may sign with Cal Lutheran.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jason Evans INF  </P> <P> CHATSWORTH  </P> <P> 5-11, 183  </P> <P> Sr.  </P> <P> Evans, who batted under .200 last season at Loyola, exploded after transferring  to Chatsworth. He batted .391, scored a Valley-area high 44 runs, hit three  home runs and had 28 RBIs. His 27 stolen bases led City Section Valley players.  He also posted a 3-1 record with a 2.92 ERA. He has signed with Cal and was  drafted in the fourth round by the Cubs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mike Murray INF  </P> <P> KENNEDY  </P> <P> 5-10, 150  </P> <P> Sr.  </P> <P> Kennedy averaged more than eight runs a game en route to the City 4-A title and  the switch-hitting Murray got the offense rolling from his leadoff spot. He  batted .411 and walked 32 times for an on-base percentage of .566. He scored 36  runs, drove in 29 and also showed some power with three home runs. He likely  will play at Valley College next season.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pat Bryant OF  </P> <P> CLEVELAND  </P> <P> 5-11, 180  </P> <P> Jr.  </P> <P> One of only two juniors on the All-Valley team, Bryant was the only player from  a team that failed to make the playoffs to earn All-City 4-A honors. The  quick-footed center fielder batted .464 with five doubles, two triples and four  home runs. He knocked in only 14 runs as the leadoff hitter but stole 21 bases.  His father, Derek, played for Oakland in 1979.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Eddie Chavez OF  </P> <P> POLY  </P> <P> 5-11, 175  </P> <P> Sr.  </P> <P> It may have been a down year by Poly's lofty standards -- the Parrots lost in  the first round of the 4-A playoffs -- but no one can blame Chavez. He batted  .397 and set a school record with six home runs, good for second place among  Valley City players. He also had four saves to share the lead among Valley City  players. He will play at Canyons next season.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Chris Lohman OF  </P> <P> NOTRE DAME  </P> <P> 6-0, 170  </P> <P> Sr.  </P> <P> Notre Dame averaged nearly 10 runs a game and Lohman led the attack with a .472  average. He hit four triples, four home runs, had 35 RBIs and stole 15 bases.  He was 3-1 as a pitcher and was co-MVP of the San Fernando Valley League.  Lohman, drafted by Oakland in the 56th round, is considering offers from UCLA,  UC Santa Barbara and Gonzaga.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lance Migita OF  </P> <P> HART  </P> <P> 5-6, 150  </P> <P> Jr.  </P> <P> Although he hit only one home run, Migita accounted for 70 runs in a 30-game  season. He was one of only three Valley-area players to score at least 40 runs,  and he drove in 31. He was second in the area with 13 doubles, hit three  triples and stole 12 bases. Together with a .435 batting average, Migita has a  tough act to follow next season -- his own.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Glenn Nahmias OF  </P> <P> TAFT  </P> <P> 5-10, 155  </P> <P> Sr.  </P> <P> Taft reached the City 4-A playoffs for the first time since 1980 and Nahmias  was one of the key ingredients. He batted .424 with nine doubles, two triples  and three home runs. He also knocked in 26 runs and was an All-City selection.  A solid student, he has gained admission to Cal on academic merit and has been  invited to try out as a walk-on.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nino Romo UTIL  </P> <P> SYLMAR  </P> <P> 5-10, 175  </P> <P> Sr.  </P> <P> Previously known as Chris Romo's younger brother, Nino ended his career as this  season's leading hitter among Valley City players with a .471 average. He had  four doubles and 15 RBIs. He also led Sylmar to the East Valley League title as  the team's top pitcher with a 9-3 record and 2.86 ERA. He plans to join his  brother Chris at Mission College in the fall.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ALL-VALLEY SECOND TEAM  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.77IN:2.66IN:2.22IN:1.45IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE>

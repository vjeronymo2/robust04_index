			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLANT OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> Pelargoniums, various species  </P> <P> Scented-leaf geraniums  </P> <P> Evergreen perennials, usually with insignificant flowers  </P> <P> Crush a fuzzy leaf of peppermint geranium (Pelargonium tomentosum), and the  scent will clear your sinuses and refresh your spirit. Rub a handful of lacy,  gray-green rose geranium leaves (P. graveolens) and enjoy a heady whiff of  potpourri right in the garden. Other scented geraniums, such as lime (P.  nervosum), lemon (P. crispum) and apple (P. odoratissimum), enhance drinks and  food such as sherbets, puddings and muffins.  </P> <P> All scented-leaf geraniums are useful in potpourris and sachets, and some make  excellent jellies.  </P> <P> There is now a bewildering array of scented-leaf geraniums, including some  combinations (mint rose, cinnamon rose, lemon rose) and a few very rare  varieties (strawberry and peach).  </P> <P> The scents are divided into general categories, such as citrus, rose, spice,  fruit and pungent, but many of the more unusual scents are in the nose of the  beholder -- arguably chocolate, for instance, but intriguing by any name.  </P> <P> In Southern California, all pelargoniums, including the scented-leaf varieties,  thrive in the balmy areas. They won't tolerate freezing temperatures, but most  of them endure heat and drought with impunity.  </P> <P> A few, such as apple, may be grown from seed, but most of these plants must be  propagated by cuttings.  </P> <P> Scented-leaf types can be small shrubs, lanky vine-like bushes or tiny mounds.  Equally at home in pots or the ground, scented-leaf geraniums should be readily  accessible for pinching, squeezing and sniffing. The plants do not release  their delicious scents without some help.  </P> <P> The flowers range from rosy pink through lavender to white, but they are small  and not very exciting. Besides, with such great leaves, who needs flowers?  </P> <P> The only problem with scented-leaf geraniums is finding them. Most Los  Angeles-area nurseries carry only a few (rose and lime are the most widely  available); Burkhard Nurseries, 690 N. Orange Grove Blvd., Pasadena, is an  exception, regularly stocking about 40 varieties. A reliable mail-order source  (also a retail operation) is Young's Mesa Nursery, 2755 Fowler Lane, Arroyo  Grande, Calif. 93420 (near San Luis Obispo); proprietor Kay Young carries from  40 to 50 varieties of scented geraniums; her catalogue costs $2, refundable  with first purchase.  </P> <P> The best opportunity to view and buy unusual geraniums is the annual Southern  California geranium show and sale, held this year on May 13 and 14 at the Los  Angeles State and County Arboretum in Arcadia and sponsored by the Los Angeles  branch of the International Geranium Society.  </P> <P> Society members get first crack at all plants before the sale even opens, so  non-members should plan to arrive early for best selection. Society membership  costs $12.50 per year; write to 4610 Druid St., Los Angeles 90032 for more  information. JUDITH SIMS  </P></p>

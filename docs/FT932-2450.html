			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Net assets show 14.7% improvement at Electra Investment Trust ELECTRA Investment Trust yesterday announced a 4.5 per cent increase in interim dividend and a 14.7 per cent rise in net assets over the six months to March 31. The trust mainly invests in unquoted equities, which have suffered badly in the recession. The end-March net assets per share, at 318.65p, were still below their September 1989 level. However, Mr Michael Stoddart, chairman, said in his statement to shareholders that 'I believe that the worst is over. The majority of companies in our portfolio look to be set for better times and we should start to see a gradual increase in the underlying values. 'All in all, while maintaining a cautious approach to the US and UK economies, I do believe that the outlook for your company is more encouraging than it has been for some time.' Mr Hugh Mumford, a director of Electra, said that the asset increase was prompted by three factors: an increase in smaller company share prices since Black Wednes-day; an increase in the valuation of the UK port-folio, as unquoted com-panies gained listings; and a revival in the fortunes of some of the UK unquoted holdings, as lower interest rates helped their operating profits. The trust's portfolio is now split as to one-third listed and two-thirds unlisted companies. Of the quoted portfolio, 75 per cent is in the UK. Of the unquoted, 40 per cent is in the US and 60 per cent in the UK. The total net assets of the trust at end-March were Pounds 551.4m. The trust's pre-tax profits were Pounds 9.43m, up from Pounds 8.78m in the first half of last year. The interim dividend is raised to 3.45p (3.3p), payable from earnings per share of 3.5p (4.23p).</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FRUSTACIS SETTLE SUIT AGAINST INFERTILITY  CLINIC  </P> <P> Against the wishes of the doctor accused of malpractice, Patti Frustaci, a  Riverside woman who gave birth to the nation's first septuplets in 1985, and  her husband, Sam, have agreed to settle their suit against the infertility  clinic that treated her, representatives for both sides said Monday.  </P> <P> Terms of the settlement will not be revealed until it is made final and  recorded in Santa Monica Superior Court today.  </P> <P> The Frustacis allege infertility specialist Dr. Jaroslav Marik did not properly  monitor a powerful fertility drug, leading to physical and developmental  impairment of the septuplets. Only three survive.  </P> <P> Marik denies the allegations and has strenuously objected to any settlement  discussions, which went on without his consent, a highly unusual occurrence in  malpractice cases. Browne Greene, the Frustacis' attorney, said Marik will be  dismissed as a defendant, the only way Tyler Medical Clinic could settle the  case.  </P></p>

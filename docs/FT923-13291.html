			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Regalian Anyone seeking fresh evidence of the desperate state of the London property market need look no further than Regalian's Pounds 38m disposal of Red Lion Court. It is a forced sale, to be sure, but then there is scarcely a deal these days which does not fall into that category. What is striking even in today's depressed markets is the meagre residual value placed on the site. The total sale proceeds compare miserably with the Pounds 35m which the company itself reckons it might have been able to raise on the back of a fully amortised 23-year mortgage. In this way, the interest and capital on the mortgage would have been met by the remaining rents from the long lease signed by Lloyds Bank at a princely Pounds 38 per square foot in distinctly happier times. The implication is that the German investment company purchasing Red Lion Court is assuming a residual value when the lease expires of just Pounds 3m. Even if the building remains over-rented for the rest of the term, and even if the City is still awash with unlet space in a quarter of a century, that seems like a reasonable bargain. All the more so given that the 8 per cent which a borrower might pay for a D-Mark loan of the same maturity compares with a yield of 11.2 per cent at yesterday's price. While the cash infusion should substantially reduce Regalian's borrowings, it would take a brave investor to bet on the shares even at 7.5p. There is certainly room to doubt whether the company deserves to be put in the penny stocks along with the likes of Rosehaugh and Speyhawk. From the market's point of view, though, Regalian is just another company trying to prove that its assets exceed its liabilities.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 2 (TANJUG) -- It was much easier to  sign than implement the Washington agreement on a Croat-Muslim  federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, according to Radio Free  Europe. The radio said in a commentary that Bosnian Muslim  President Alija Izetbegovic had sent two letters to Croatian  President Franjo Tudjman urging him to salvage the Washington  agreement.    A letter of a similarly dramatic contents has been sent to  Tudjman by Izetbegovic's adviser Slobodan Lang, who warned on  returning to Sarajevo from Herzegovina that Muslim-Croat  relations were near a breaking point and the Washington  agreement would cave in unless something was done, according to  Radio Free Europe. The Bosnian Croats and Muslims, who have  been engaged in fierce mutual clashes since the beginning of the  year, fighting for territories in Herzegovina and central  Bosnia, have signed the agreement on a common federation under  strong pressure from the United States.    So far, none of the dates set in the Washington agreement  have been met, according to the Radio Free Europe commentary,  which specified that major disagreements existed over personnel  issues, primarily the office of president. The Bosnian Croats  request that the first president of the federation be a Croat,  but are ready to accept as a compromise that the post go to  Bosnian Muslim Prime Minister Haris Siljadzic but under no  condition to Izetbegovic, whose candidacy has already been put  up by the Muslim side.    The Radio Free Europe commentary said that Croatian media  were again presenting the Bosnian Croat state Herzeg-Bosna as a  legal political formation of the rank of a state. The  commentary said a reflection of the volatile relations between  the Croats and Muslims was the recent blowing up of a mosque in  the centre of Livno. It quoted the Zagreb weekly GLOBUS as  saying that the Muslims in Livno, a town in western Herzegovina,  insist that they have been living far worse since the Washington  agreement has been signed, that the Croat troops are forcing  Muslims to perform various degrading jobs, and are stealing  cattle, money and tractors in the nearby villages. The Muslims  were also quoted as saying that they were subjected to greater  harassment now and that they wanted an integral Bosnia.    The Radio Free Europe commentary said that representatives  of  the local Croat authorities in Sarajevo, which are loyal to  Izetbegovic, had visited a number of foreign embassies in Zagreb  to warn that the Washington agreement was definitively being  torpedoed. According to the commentary, the local Croatian  authorities in Sarajevo have warned that attempts are being made  at introducing an internal order different from that defined in  the adopted constitution, that no steps are being taken  whatsoever for the return of the displaced persons, and that war  crimes are being denied or minimized.</p>

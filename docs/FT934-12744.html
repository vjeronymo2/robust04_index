			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (7): Slow awakening / A look at east German democracy IN eastern Germany, the emergence of new, indigenous political elites has been painfully slow in contrast to the rise of a small entrepreneurial class. But if eastern Germany is to be politically, psychologically, and socially integrated into the concept of Standort Deutschland - Germany as an investment centre - it will require local political elites in eastern Germany to achieve this. Throughout the five eastern states, a two-tier system of the organisation of power at the highest level has emerged. With the exception of Mr Manfred Stolpe in Brandenburg, the only Social Democratic prime minister in the region, and Mr Berndt Seite from Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the prime ministers are all from west Germany. Admittedly, the premiers are flanked by ministers, many of whom are easterners. However, the state secretaries are westerners. The case can be easily made that the cooperation between easterners and westerners on the state level in eastern Germany has been crucial for politically integrating the country, and for training a new administration. But it is not as simple as that. Easterners have been wary about becoming involved in politics at the state level because of the past - a past dominated by the Stasi, the state security system. It was an extraordinarily sophisticated and insidious system. In its final days, as Fritz Stern pointed out in a recent article in the Washington-based Foreign Affairs, the Stasi consisted of 97,000 full-time employees, and perhaps as many as 140,000 unofficial collaborators. Moreover, about 2m out of a population of 17m were members of the SED (Socialist Unity, or communist party), thus ensuring some connection - however slight - with the Stasi. The 100 miles of Stasi files are testament enough to its hold over the society: the system was designed to implicate as many people as possible. Because of the ubiquity of the Stasi system, an emotional debate has been taking place in Germany about the way the files have been used. The law opening the files, which went into effect on January 2, 1992, allows government agencies to request background checks on their employees. Thousands have since been dismisssed. But precisely because the files are still open, the easterners have been placed in a position where they have been inhibited about speaking out about the process of unification, or about being actively involved in the political process. They are never sure if they will ever be deemed 'clean'. For example, every civil servant has to take an oath of loyalty to the constitution. If an easterner is regarded as 'clean' in the sense that no incriminating evidence has emerged from the Stasi files, he or she can join the civil service. But the files are not closed. A person is still under suspicion for a further three years - just in case a separate file implicates them with some connection with the Stasi. The shadow of the past hangs over them. Paradoxically, the newly-found freedom has had the bizarre and disturbing effect of silencing them. The voice which speaks on behalf of the eastern Germans is the voice of the western German official. Yet in a strange way some easterners are perpetuating this unequal relationship by insisting that the files be kept open. Some of the loudest proponents include Mr Steffen Heitmann, the presidential candidate of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democratic Union party. Yet this entire process is having a debilitating effect on political life in eastern Germany. The eastern Germans have been made to believe that the past 40 years have been worthless. Prominent west German politicians and intellectuals, including Egon Bahr, the former Social Democratic federal minister, believe 'enough is enough' and support an amnesty for those waiting trial, or already charged. They argue that the constant judging - if not hounding - of a cross section of east German society will not only perpetuate the paralysis of political life in eastern Germany; it will deepen the sense of mistrust between eastern and western Germans. The case of Mr Gerhard Riege, an east German deputy in the federal parliament in Bonn explains why. Mr Riege committed suicide in early 1992 after it had been reported that he had been a Stasi informer during the 1950s. His death provoked a passionate response from Mr Hermann Scheer, a west German, and Social Democratic party deputy. 'We are living through a public witch-hunt that is unworthy of a democratic state. A country that allowed former SA members and Hitler Youth graduates to rise to high government positions has no right to condemn a man like Gerhard Riege because he had contact with the Stasi from the age of 24 to 30.' President Richard Von Weizsacker has frequently added his weight to the debate. 'The (Stasi) files always reflect the view of their masters. They do not lie in this, but they are one-sided and must be evaluated. They are not an objective or moral authority.' The elections next year could well convey the sense of disappointment and disorientation among eastern Germans, perhaps through a low turn out and a swing from the established political parties. The disappointment is caused not just by high unemployment, or failed expectations raised by Chancellor Helmut Kohl when he said in 1990 that eastern Germany would be a 'blossoming landscape in a few years', and that 'no one would be worse off after unification'. It is a sense of powerlessness fuelled by the feeling of imposed shame; the loss of the Voice because its words are not believed; the loss of the spontaneity and civic courage which helped to break down the Berlin Wall. If Standort Deutschland is to have any political meaning, it must help break the silence in the east.</p>

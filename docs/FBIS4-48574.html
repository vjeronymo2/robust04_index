			<p>BFN     [Text] In Rwanda a possible cease-fire has been announced  by sources close to the United Nations. The government army  reportedly accepted this 60-hour truce planned to start at 0600  GMT tomorrow. The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] has clearly  stated that it does not intend to respect this cease-fire.  Let's listen to Jacques Bihozagara, a member of the RPF  executive committee who was appointed deputy president in the  Arusha agreement:    [Begin recording] [Bihozagara] For us it is unacceptable to  sign a cease-fire; however, if they want to surrender we are  ready to consider the proposal. If they want a cease-fire they  must first stop the massacre of civilians.    [Unidentified correspondent] What about the neutrality of  the  airport which the UN Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] has attempted to  negotiate for several days? What will your answer be, now that  you are in control of the airport?    [Bihozagara] Now that we control the airport, it is out of  the question to negotiate its neutrality; it is rather a matter  of asking how planes can land and take off, that's all.    [Correspondent] Will you differentiate between planes flying  in humanitarian aid and those flying in UN soldiers?    [Bihozagara] Obviously, because we expressed our support for  humanitarian aid and we are ready to consider the UNAMIR request  concerning humanitarian issues.    [Correspondent] What about the arrival of UN reinforcements?    [Bihozagara] Concerning the arrival of reinforcements, I say  that if we have accepted the principle of the UN resolution we  have not yet discussed their deployment. We are expecting the  United Nations to give us details concerning their mission,  their composition and the deployment of these forces before they  arrive. [end recording]</p>

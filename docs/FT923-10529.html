			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Expanded David S Smith declines to Pounds 15m - Acquisitions shift balance towards Continent and specialisation DAVID S Smith, the UK's largest paper maker which has expanded its packaging interests, suffered a 36 per cent drop in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 23.9m to Pounds 15.4m, in the year to May 2. However, the fall was only 5 per cent to Pounds 24.1m (Pounds 25.3m) before exceptional costs of Pounds 8.7m (Pounds 1.4m). These related mainly to redundancies and other reorganisation expenses related to rationalisation of a number of production facilities. The figures were slightly better than the market had expected and the shares rose 4p to 264p. The company acquired Kaysersberg Packaging of France on April 1. The total consideration for this and some other smaller acquisitions during the year totalled Pounds 177.3m. They contributed Pounds 17.5m to sales of Pounds 361.5m (Pounds 363.5m) and about Pounds 1.5m to operating profits of Pounds 22m (Pounds 31.3m). Mr Peter Williams, who became chief executive in May 1991, said the acquisitions had shifted the balance of Smith's business to continental Europe and specialist packaging, rather than commodity product areas. The acquisitions, financed largely by a Pounds 50.7m rights issue at 295p in May last year and a Pounds 97.4m placing at 283p in January this year, greatly increased the company's size - thus reducing its dependence on the future of its Kemsley mill. Kemsley, acquired in 1989, has absorbed considerable capital expenditure. It will not be fully on stream until autumn 1993. Kemsley was a 'tremendous opportunity,' Mr Williams said, but had been a drag on the company, costing about Pounds 6m at the operating level as well as requiring heavy spending. Mr Williams said he was reasonably satisfied with the results, considering the difficult trading conditions. Prices for corrugated packaging had fallen and volumes were weak. He hoped there might be some recovery coming, partly because some competitors had announced capacity closures. Capital expenditure during the year was Pounds 21.7m (Pounds 15m). But Mr Williams said the figure would probably more than double this year as spending on Kemsley peaked. Shareholders' funds had risen from Pounds 118.2m to Pounds 204.2m, mainly because of the share issues, and net debt had increased from Pounds 25.5m to Pounds 46.1m. Interest receivable of Pounds 2.1m compared with Pounds 6m payable. Earnings per share were 11.5p (23.3p) and the promise of a 6.75p final dividend made with the placing is being kept, to give an unchanged total of 9.5p. COMMENT Under new management, Smith is continuing some of its past characteristics - rapid expansion through acquisition and plenty of share issues. Fortunately the story the management has to tell has, if anything, improved. Hopes for Kemsley are high, especially as on current progress it should be ready to enjoy the economic upturn when it finally comes. Meanwhile, the Kaysersberg deal should provide a boost to profits and earnings this year, although there will be an interest charge too. Profits should jump to Pounds 33m, giving a p/e of 13, and leap again the following year, with the multiple coming down to about 10. The company's amazingly loyal shareholders can now see their reward on the horizon, although even they may get a little restless when the price rises to the rights issue level.</p>

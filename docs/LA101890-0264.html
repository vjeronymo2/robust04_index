			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> BROWNING ADDS A ROOTER FOR BIG START  </P> <P> Cincinnati Reds pitcher Tom Browning, scheduled to start Game 3 of the World  Series on Friday in Oakland, is the father of his third child, born half an  hour after the Reds' Series victory Wednesday night.  </P> <P> Browning left Riverfront Stadium with his wife, Debbie, during the game. She  gave birth at St. Elizabeth Medical Center South in Edgewood, Ky., at 12:27  a.m. EDT to Tucker Thomas, a 6-pound, 10-ounce boy. Browning, 30, also has a  daughter, Tiffany, 6, and son, Tanner, 3.  </P> <P> Browning left the ballpark still wearing his Reds uniform. Clubhouse attendant  Rick Stowe informed Browning that his wife was ready to leave the stadium for  the hospital.  </P> <P> Manager Lou Piniella said he and pitching Coach Stan Williams were surprised by  Browning's sudden departure.  </P> <P> "I didn't even know he was gone," Piniella said. "When I saw we were starting  to eat up pitchers in the middle innings, I said, 'This game is close. Make  sure Browning doesn't go anywhere.' And Stan said, 'He won't go anywhere.'  About the eighth inning I said, 'Where is he? I don't see him.' "  </P> <P> Stowe finally tracked Browning through the family's baby-sitter. By then, the  game was nearly over.  </P> <P> "I told Stan, 'Just know where the pitchers are from now on, please,' "  Piniella said.  </P> <P> Jose Canseco started out Game 2 in fine fashion, but it's how he finished that  has Oakland Manager Tony La Russa concerned.  </P> <P> Canseco hit an RBI grounder and a solo home run in his first two at-bats, but  then struck out twice and grounded into a double play.  </P> <P> In the eighth inning, he let Billy Hatcher's drive to right field skip off his  glove for a triple, setting up the tying run, and then made an off-line throw  to the plate after catching a fly ball.  </P> <P> "It's a play that if you want to win the game, you have to make," La Russa said  of Hatcher's hit. "I don't think he got a very good jump."  </P> <P> Canseco missed 31 games because of back problems this season. Recently, he  jammed the middle finger of his index finger in a refrigerator. Both injuries  have been bothering him.  </P> <P> La Russa thought a lineup switch might help the offense, so he put National  League batting champion Willie McGee on the bench and started Dave Henderson in  center field.  </P> <P> Henderson, one of the most productive postseason players in history, again came  through. He singled twice in four at-bats and walked.  </P> <P> McGee is more accustomed to playing on artificial turf than Henderson because  of all his years in St. Louis. La Russa has not said who will start when the  Series moves to Oakland's grass field.  </P></p>

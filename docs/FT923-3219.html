			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (10): Dreams still unrealised - Julian Ozanne reports on the agricultural diversification effort THREE YEARS after an investment of MR8m in a fully mechanised fruit line, Mr Berty Malabar has been unable to realise his dream of a sophisticated and high quality export business of fresh fruits to Europe. The Mauritian Government's incentive package to exporters, including a 50 per cent freight rebate scheme, has stimulated competition and dramatically increased producer prices of pineapples, bananas and lychees. Mr Malabar has been unable to secure a sufficient supply of fruit to keep his machines, which wash, wax and pack, working more than a few days a year. He complains of the entry into the unregulated market of a number of cowboys who do not observe the minimum standards necessary to protect Mauritius' brand name in an increasingly competitive European consumer market. Mr Malabar's problems are typical of the lack of clear government direction in agricultural diversification which - with the prospect of a much less favourable environment for sugar (as discussed in the article above) - has become even more pressing than before. Furthermore, experts say Mauritius is wasting a vital competitive advantage over other African horticultural exporters such as Kenya and Zimbabwe: the huge excess capacity in air cargo for perishables, which has been created alongside the tourist boom of the past seven years. Last year, about 80 per cent of the air capacity to Europe was unused - a total of almost 4,800 tonnes, against exports of 880 tonnes airlifted. Opportunities for greater use of sea containerisation in Mauritius' expanding port have also yet to be developed. Critical policy options now have to be confronted. These include, particularly, the balance between import substitution and export orientation, efficient use of scarce land resources, the type of products which to receive attention, and shifting away from what Mauritians describe as the 'sugar mentality' to more active and skilled husbandry techniques. The picture is far from bleak, however. Significant successes have been achieved in import-substituting vegetable production for the local market, particularly potatoes and ginger, and in the export of anthurium flowers. Further opportunities exist in fruits and vegetables, sugar by-product utilisation and deer farming. Experts in the sector say the need now is for a carefully considered government approach to the entire agricultural diversification industry, to map out a coherent strategy of research and support for a sector which, with the right policy environment, could expand dramatically in the coming years. Recognition of the increasing problems facing the sugar industry is adding impetus to the diversification drive. The Mauritian Government has given considerable incentives to non-sugar agriculture, and significant results have been achieved through crop rotation, interline cultivation, and more effective use of by-products by sugar farmers. An important project is under way to increase exploitation of bagasse, the fibrous material separated during cane crushing, for the production of energy. Two new power stations are scheduled to start up in 1994 and 1995, which will burn bagasse during the crop and coal in the intercrop period. Two other existing power stations will be rehabilitated. The project is intended to save foreign exchange by reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels, increase the sector's value-added, and have a favourable impact on the environment by using a local renewablesource of energy. Experts say further work needs to be done to investigate how to upgrade the value of other byproducts, such as cane straw, scums and molasses. A whole range of products - rum, power alcohol, vinegar and perfumes - are being manufactured, but most of them on a small scale. However, the general declining profitability of sugar land, together with increased mechanisation, is likely to release land for alternative uses, with prospects for higher returns. Fruit, vegetable and anthurium production has already more than doubled since 1985. Further increases in horticultural production will depend on: eliminating the 'sugar mentality' for a sub sector which needs much more careful husbandry, irrigation and more appropriate use of fertiliser and pesticides; research into the potential profitability and market opportunities of different crops; better land use - particularly of sugar lands, which will become impossible to bring under mechanisation because they are too rocky or hilly; development of strategies to protect horticulture from cyclones, such as establishing windbreaks; radication of fruit fly; development of cheaper sea transportation to Europe. According to Mr Malabar, the creation of high standards in post-harvest handling procedures, such as selection, packing and temperature control, will be vital to winning markets and may therefore require some licensing of the industry. Another interesting area of agricultural diversification is deer farming and ranching. Already, nine farms with about 10,000 head are producing about 450 tonnes a year. Export markets have already been found for live animals in Malaysia, and whole carcasses to the island of Reunion, and choice cuts and delicatessen are being sold locally. Deer farmers say an important overhaul of the national abbatoir, to bring it up to EC standards, is the constraint on growth at present. Mauritius has already demonstrated considerable progress in agricultural diversification. But serious consideration by both the government and the private sector of the many constraints is urgently requiredif substantial growth is going to take place over the next five years.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- AGRICULTURE (000s of tonnes)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                              1989        1990        1991 Sugar cane                   5436.1      5548.3      5621.1 Sugar                        568.3       624.3       611.3 Green tea                    29.2        29.9        30.6 Black tea                    5.5         5.7         5.9 Tobacco                      1.0         0.9         0.8 Foodcrops                    62.3        65.8        63.3 Fish                         15.3        13.1        17.9  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Central Statistical Office, Ministry of Economic Planning  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

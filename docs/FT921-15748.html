			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Ignorance of personal assets seen MANY BRITONS are feckless managers of their personal finances and do not bother to keep track of the amount of money in their bank accounts, according to Mercantile Credit, the personal-loan company owned by Barclays Bank. A survey commissioned by Mercantile Credit indicates that 51 per cent of adults do not keep track of their bank balances and that 29 per cent admit to spending money regardless of whether they have enough in their accounts. 'Despite the financial problems caused by the recession, many people are still failing to gather the information needed to control their finances properly,' Ms Olivia Rossiter, communications manager of Mercantile Credit, said yesterday. The survey suggests that only 49 per cent of Scots always budget carefully against 67 per cent in the east Midlands. Southerners have the most easy-going attitude, with only 46 per cent always knowing how much money is in their bank accounts.</p>

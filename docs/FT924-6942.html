			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y asks to postpone meetings over debt OLYMPIA &amp; York has asked to postpone a series of meetings scheduled to begin next week at which the ailing property developer's creditors were due to vote on its debt-restructuring proposals. Representatives of two of the 34 creditor groups, who asked not to be identified, said the company made the request after running into stiff opposition to the 250-page plan it distributed last month. O&amp;Y is now expected to propose to its most secured creditors that they can seize the properties against which their debt is secured. It is also expected to propose giving unsecured creditors an immediate 90% equity stake in O&amp;Y. Opposition to last month's plan has come mainly from Canadian banks and from bondholders whose claims are secured by specific buildings, including First Canadian Place, O&amp;Y's 72-storey flagship in Toronto. Some of these groups are confident that they would be better off seizing their collateral than agreeing to the concessions proposed by O&amp;Y. The creditors have demanded a number of concessions in return for agreeing to delay the votes. The two sides were meeting yesterday afternoon to hammer out details. Mr Gerald Greenwald, O&amp;Y president, indicated earlier that the plan might be modified prior to the votes. An O&amp;Y spokesman said yesterday that discussions with the creditors were continuing but that 'there has been no resolution on any amendments to the plan'. The Ontario court, under whose protection O&amp;Y has been operating since last May, ordered the meetings to take place between November 25 and 30 in response to unease among creditors over the mounting costs of the restructuring effort. O&amp;Y and the creditors are expected to ask the court within the next few days to postpone the meetings by about a month. The restructuring plan covers CDollars 8.6bn (USDollars 6.7bn) of O&amp;Y's CDollars 13.5bn debt. It excludes Canary Wharf, the London project which is now under the control of administrators, and negotiations with lenders to specific O&amp;Y buildings in the US. The plan proposed the creation of a number of new companies in which unsecured and under-secured creditors would ultimately be substantial shareholders.</p>

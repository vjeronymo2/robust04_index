			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Caribbean fights to keep cholera at bay CARIBBEAN countries are preparing to combat cholera which is threatening to reach the islands after sweeping through Latin America. Officials say fighting an epidemic would be costly for the financially-strapped governments, and could severely damage the region's tourist industry, on which many island economies depend heavily. Three confirmed cases in Belize in Central America have increased concern in the islands. Although there have been no deaths from the disease in the islands, the Caribbean Epidemiology Centre, which operates in 19 countries, has said preparations are being made to contain it. The infiltration of cholera is 'inevitable,' according to Dr Franklin White, director of the centre. However, 'the potential for transmission of the disease would be limited in most of the Caribbean countries because of a more favourable environmental health situation compared with Latin American nations'. The appearance of the disease in Venezuela has caused the government of Trinidad and Tobago to declare a health alert. 'The latest report on cases in Venezuela means that cholera is now in our backyard, a mere seven miles away,' said Mr John Eckstein, Trinidad and Tobago's health minister. He said cholera could not be kept out, given the movement of people between Trinidad and the mainland.</p>

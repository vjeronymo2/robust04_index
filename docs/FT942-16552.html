			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News: Triplex Lloyd warns of loss - Likely impact of exceptional charges leaves shares down 13p Shares in Triplex Lloyd fell by 13p to 133p yesterday after the Midlands industrial components group warned of sizeable losses for the year to March 31. The company, which has embarked on a wide-ranging restructuring programme, said pre-tax losses could reach Pounds 3m, compared with profits of Pounds 7.08m last time. It blamed the likely deficit on exceptional charges totalling Pounds 8m  - dominated by a Pounds 4.7m provision to cover trading losses and disposal costs at ED Hinchliffe, the curtain-walling business which was sold in February to Norcros, the building and consumer products group. It also made further provisions for asset write-downs, redundancies and potential costs arising out of legal action on previous disposals. The announcement surprised analysts, who had been predicting profits of about Pounds 8m. Mr John Foley, group managing director, said the profits warning signalled the company's determination to scale back the engineering division, and focus on its core automotive and power components businesses. As part of the restructuring, Mr Norman Price, the board director responsible for the division, has left the company and new managing directors have been appointed to most of the nine remaining engineering subsidiaries. 'We've restructured the division through asset write-downs and management changes, and we're now out of building products,' Mr Foley added. The action resulted in a 10 per cent cut in the workforce to 900. Profits at the power division, meanwhile, have also been dented by disruption caused by the installation of new plant and machinery. Mr Foley admitted that income lost on deferred orders - taken together with the restructuring costs and trading losses - meant the company would not be able to meet its year-end target of reducing gearing below 40 per cent. 'Borrowing is where expected at Pounds 25m, but because of the action we've taken gearing remains at 55 per cent,' Mr Foley said. He predicted gearing would fall as the company generated profits from expansion of its automotive and power divisions, where a large investment programme is under way. That programme has been funded with the proceeds of last year's Pounds 17.3m rights issue, of which Pounds 11m has been spent so far on new fabrication facilities and vacuum furnaces. Those facilities are understood to have sustained a strong underlying performance in the company's two main divisions, where order books were described as 'generally healthy'. Triplex is also expecting to make exceptional profits on property disposals, which should net Pounds 1m in the 12 months to March 31 and further sizeable sums later this year. Encouraged by the group's prospects, Mr Foley said the board expected to recommend an unchanged final dividend of 4.5p, to maintain the total at 7p. 'We've been bloodied but we're coming through,' he said. 'We're not cutting the dividend because the underlying business is fine.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 11 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- In Montevideo,  Mexican Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello Macias has said that  Mexico is willing to meet the obligations imposed by NAFTA, but  it also wants to remain a member of the Latin American  Integration Association [Aladi]. "Mexico is, and desires to  remain, an Aladi member country. Nevertheless, the commercial  agreement with the United States and Canada is a new reality. We  want to find a political solution to this situation," Tello told  NOTIMEX.    Interviewed during the 8th Aladi Ministers Summit held in  the  Paraguayan capital, Tello Macias said Mexico's request to  postpone its commercial obligations with its Latin American  partners "will open new possibilities for other countries in the  region."    This afternoon, the ministers to the 8th Aladi Summit will  vote on Mexico's request to waive Article 44 of the Montevideo  Treaty establishing commercially privileged obligations toward  treaty country members. According to Article 44, countries that  give special treatment to another country's products "shall  extend such treatment, immediately and unconditionally, to the  rest of Aladi member countries."    According to the agreement reached during the 10 February  technical meeting, Mexico, in bilateral negotiations, must  compensate its partners for the eventual damage NAFTA might  cause as the result of either commercial misrepresentations or  investment losses. "When we speak of seeking a solution to this  apparent problem, we are not thinking about Mexico alone, but  other countries' eventual merger with NAFTA. We are seeking the  best possible mechanism to facilitate this merger, which should  not be hampered," Tello said.    Tello said he trusts the summit will result in a decision  "that will permit Mexico to participate in NAFTA and remain an  Aladi member country, and make it possible for other countries  to join NAFTA. We are demonstrating Mexico's interest in  contributing to the integration of regional countries' economies  to a greater extent. We did it with Chile, with whom we have an  complementary economic agreement. We are about to conclude one  such treaty with the Group of Three (Colombia, Venezuela, and  Mexico), and negotiations with Bolivia and Central America are  well under way. We are showing that we want to expand the field  so the economies of other countries in the continent can join.  This is reasonable if those instruments' final objective is to  increase the volume of trade." Tello said.    He ruled out the possibility that the conflict, which broke  out in the southeastern state of Chiapas on 1 January, will have  any effect on the country's commercial or political relations.  "The situation in four Chiapas towns is on its way to a  political solution. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has  taken measures to make sure the conflict will be resolved  peacefully through dialogue and negotiation," he said. The  foreign secretary finally said, "We are about to initiate a  dialogue to restore social peace in Chiapas and meet the Indian  communities' just demands, which were harmed by the self-styled  Zapatist National Liberation Army."</p>

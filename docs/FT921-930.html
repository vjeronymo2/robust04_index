			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Lloyd's Names find recovery of stop-loss claims difficult people whose assets back underwriting at the insurance market - are running into difficulties in obtaining recoveries from stop-loss policies, which provide them with reinsurance against excessive losses. Their problems have further highlighted the difficulties of a particularly troubled area of the Lloyd's insurance market. Syndicates underwriting stop-loss insurance are expected to post some of their worst losses in Lloyd's recent history when Lloyd's reports its 1989 results in June this year. Last week brokers warned that the reluctance of many insurers to offer stop-loss insurance for the 1992 underwriting year was undermining the confidence of Names in the market. The latest troubles concern policies sold by the specialist broker Carritt &amp; Partners, which cover losses from the 1990 underwriting year. The Names affected, who it is understood are members of catastrophe reinsurance syndicates, have made claims to cover the cost of cash calls but some underwriters are understood to have quibbled about payments. A leading members' agent said yesterday: 'There is certainly a dispute which is leading to non-payment of claims.' Mr Michael Wade, of broker Holman Wade, which has since taken over the Carritt company, said yesterday: 'Of course I'm concerned but due to the circumstances I'm unable to comment at the moment.' Separately, a change in Lloyd's procedure in dealing with stop-loss recoveries has also led to difficulties. Earlier this month Lloyd's instructed brokers and agents to pay all recoveries under stop-loss policies directly to the premium trust fund - a reserve containing the proceeds from insurance premiums earned by syndicates. In cases where Names have cash calls outstanding, the recoveries would be offset against money owed by the Name. However, advisers acting for one Name, a member of loss-making Poland syndicate 105 who has paid about Pounds 15,000 in cash calls stemming from losses made in 1985, say Lloyd's is preventing recoveries due to him under the policies. London Wall Holdings, the Lloyd's agency group, has offered to take over the management of two syndicates ordered by Lloyd's last week to stop accepting new business. Syndicates 65 and 640 were formerly managed by the HG Chester agency. A third agency, Hayter Brockbank, which has supported the management of the Chester syndicates since October, said on Friday it was seeking a new agency to take over.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Russia tells Asian states to decide on allegiance RUSSIA yesterday told the central Asian states of the former Soviet Union to 'choose between north and south' for their economic and political orientation. The warning was the clearest yet that Russia is not prepared to tolerate the indiscipline and indecisiveness within the Commonwealth of Independent States that marked its first 18 months of existence. Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister, said yesterday that the recent agreement by Russia, Ukraine and Belarus to form a close economic union was partly a reaction to the participation by Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and other states in the meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation convened by Turkey in Istanbul 10 days ago. Mr Shokhin said that conference decisions to create a customs union and common market and declare that Armenia was the aggressor in the struggle with Azerbaijan for control of Nagorno Karabakh were incompatible with membership of the CIS. The three Slav states of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus comprise about 80 per cent of the commonwealth's population. 'If our friends in the CIS, in their search for a better life, are looking towards the south, then they will have to choose between integration with Russia or with their southern neighbours,' Mr Shokhin said. He said Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, the Kazakh president, had given a 'very weak reason' for participation in the conference, in which he cited Russia's reluctance to advance credits to Kazakhstan. Mr Shokhin said that Russia had put aside Rbs800bn in inter-state credits to the CIS members in 1993, including Rbs150bn for Kazakhstan, but that no agreement had yet been reached on the use of these funds. The idea for the agreement between the three Slav states, Mr Shokhin said, had been worked out largely between Russia and Belarus. However, Ukraine decided to join because of its concern over the apparent defection of Kazakhstan. However, Mr Tulegen Zhukeyev, the state adviser to Kazakhstan, yesterday told the Interfax news agency that the decision to participate in the conference did not exclude continued participation in the CIS. 'The markets of these countries are quite comparable and could supplement each other,' he said. Mr Zhukeyev said that the idea of forming a closer economic union within the CIS had been long advocated by Mr Nazarbayev.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carlos Ramos] </F>   [Text] Supreme Electoral Tribunal President Luis Arturo  Zaldivar has noted that the initial results of Sunday's  elections indicate a runoff election for president and vice  president likely will be held within a month:    [Begin Zaldivar recording] There is an undeniable trend and  everything seems to indicate there will be a presidential runoff  election. The other elections will stand because it is [word  indistinct] constitutional. At this time, current trends lead  us to think there will be a runoff. I insist (?we do) what the  law states -- namely, hold a runoff election. [end recording]    Zaldivar admitted that there were shortcomings in the  balloting process, but he added that these will be corrected in  the future to guarantee and improve similar electoral events:    [Begin Zaldivar recording] For example, the voting did not  start at the time mandated by law. Many polling stations opened  after 0700. This happened because this was the first time in  the nation's history that the entire political spectrum was  involved in one general election. Everyone wanted to serve as  either president or secretary of the voting table boards.  Delays were prompted by discussions along these lines among  people who, according to the law, represented the various  political parties. In some places, voting started after the  scheduled time; nevertheless, everything settled down later, and  I think everyone who wanted to vote did vote. [end recording]    Dr. Zaldivar pointed out that if there is indeed a runoff,  steps will be taken to avert the same logistical problems  encountered in Sunday's elections.</p>

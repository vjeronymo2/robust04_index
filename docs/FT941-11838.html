			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Leading Article: The politics of local government After the debacle over the poll tax, the government might have been wise to proceed with caution on further changes in local government. Caution appears to have been abandoned, however, with plans to replace the two-tier structure of county and district councils in most of England with single-tier unitary authorities. Local government reorganisation threatens to create another political disaster for the Conservatives. Already, there has been an embarrassing legal setback for the government's plans. Last week, the High Court ruled that Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, had acted unlawfully by changing the remit of the Local Government Commission which is in charge of the process. Mr Gummer had told Sir John Banham, the commission's chairman, that the two-tier structure should be abandoned in all but exceptional circumstances. Sir John had become increasingly prone to recommending the status quo after finding little popular support for reorganisation in many counties. Now there is the danger of political setbacks. Most Conservative backbenchers supported the idea of sweeping away the new counties such as Avon, Cleveland and Humberside. Introduced in the 1974 local government reorganisation, the newcomers have failed to win popular support. Yet abolishing even these artificial counties has proved more difficult than expected. There has been a heated debate among business leaders, MPs and other local interests over the commission's proposals. Greater heat Much greater heat is likely to be generated over the abolition of traditional shire counties such as Kent and Hampshire. If unitary authorities are to be introduced across the country, these counties will disappear in all but name. Abolishing them will be resisted by the Conservative councillors who have run them - usually moderately efficiently  -for much of the last 100 years. Grassroots Conservatives are beginning to lobby against the whole idea. And it will take only a handful of Conservative rebel MPs to derail the creation of unitary authorities. The reorganisation plans for each county must be placed before Parliament, where the government's majority is small and fractious. The probability is that the votes will become increasingly acrimonious and unpredictable. Even where reorganisation goes ahead, the political repercussions will continue. There will be substantial costs incurred in the transition, with some staff made redundant or taking early retirement. New offices will be needed, along with logos, identities, vehicle liveries and all the paraphernalia of modern organisations. Estimates of the cost vary, but the bill is likely to be about Pounds 1bn overall - one reason why business support for reorganisation is ebbing away. Voters' revenge Much of the cost, however, will be passed on to the local taxpayer. And since most of the new local authorities open for business in April 1996, the higher council tax bills will arrive in the run-up to the next general election. Voters might blame councils for the higher bills  - but with the poll tax, they took their revenge on the government. Small wonder, therefore, that Downing Street is considering a retreat. The government is already reeling over its tax plans, accusations of public fraud and corruption and a series of sexual scandals. Ahead lie likely drubbings for the Conservatives in local authority elections and elections for the European parliament. The latter also threaten to reopen the gulf over Europe inside the Tory party. There is no stomach for a long battle over local government reorganisation, with the likelihood of parliamentary defeats. The government missed an opportunity last summer to scale down the extent of reorganisation. Mr Gummer suggested that the commission should restrict its efforts to local authorities where there was demonstrable support for it. Such a solution now offers the best exit route without complete loss of face. The abolition of Cleveland, Avon and Humberside could then proceed, preferably without creating unviably small replacements. In the rest of the country, where some large cities might want unitary status, a petition signed by a substantial proportion of the population would be needed to call in the commission.</p>

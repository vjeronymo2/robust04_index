			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON / SOCIETY: THINGS GOT GURGLING AT ART MUSEUM  </P> <P> Unseen hands, hidden in the second-floor gallery, gently tugged at the ropes  attached to the circular curtain that dominated the rotunda of the San Diego  Museum of Art.  </P> <P> The blue cloth cocoon resisted for a moment before floating upward to reveal  the triple-tiered fountain that is the centerpiece of the newly named John M.  and Sally B. Thornton Rotunda.  </P> <P> This event actually occurred twice last week, at Thursday's formal dedication  of the fountain and rotunda and at the lavish gala given Saturday by the  Thorntons for 340 guests. On both occasions, the guests uncorked an  appreciative murmur that gave some participants the sensation that they had  been plunged into a vat of champagne. The feeling was reinforced by the flutes  of champagne that the crowd raised in a double toast to the Thorntons and the  fountain.  </P> <P> At Thursday's dedication, museum President Joseph Hibben told the 90 in  attendance that "some of you may find this fountain similar to that at the  Metropolitan Museum of Art (in New York). We would like to be more and more  like the Met."  </P> <P> Sally Thornton took a lighthearted tone as she threw the switch that sent water  bubbling up through the fountain's pipes. "I threatened to put goldfish in the  basins -- and maybe I will," she teased.  </P> <P> Guests at both events hurriedly searched trouser pockets and handbags for coins  to toss into the fountain's brightly tiled pool; Dolly Maw got there first with  a newly minted penny. At the gala, bits of unusual lore and surprising  observations made the rounds. It seems, for example, that the Chinese hold  that, if a borrowed coin is deposited in a fountain, the good luck goes to the  person who lent it. And then there is the case of the martini-glass-shaped  tiles in the pool's floor; Charles Melville counted them and noted that it  takes exactly 10 to describe a 90-degree arc in the pool's circumference.  </P> <P> The Thorntons gave the gala as another highlight in a relationship with the  museum that dates back to John's membership on the board of trustees in the  early 1970s and which has become more pronounced in recent years with their  sponsorship of such exhibits as "American Masters: The Thyssen-Bornemisza  Collection" in 1985 and the 1987 presentation of "American Women Artists,  1830-1930." Sally serves as vice president of the board of trustees.  </P> <P> Presumably in deference to the fountain, the Thorntons took pains to ensure  that Saturday's gala was one of the splashiest in the museum's history. Because  of the rotunda's Spanish-Italian architecture, the evening took on a  predominantly Spanish theme in such details as the tableau vivant of Spanish  dancers who posed, with a guitarist, on the grand staircase. Later, flamenco  dancers made the rounds between sets by the party's two bands. Women dressed to  the eyebrows; Vicki Rogers assessed the situation neatly by stating, "When  you're invited to one of Sally's parties, you know you'd better gussie up."  </P> <P> The museum itself was dressed up for the occasion, with dinner tables centered  by fountain-like floral arrangements that overflowed with red and pink blooms.  The sheer size of the crowd dictated that dinner seating be spread through the  American Gallery, the Asian Court, Gallery 12 and Copley Auditorium; guests in  each room dined on an elaborate menu of wild mushroom ravioli and roast rack of  lamb.  </P> <P> The menu was accompanied by three types of champagne from Temecula's Culbertson  Winery, in which the Thorntons hold an interest. The same champagne will be  poured at the gala that will follow the presidential inauguration of George  Bush, an event at which a number of the guests at Saturday's event will be  present. Among them will be banker (and former museum President) Gordon Luce  and his wife, Karon; Ruth Carpenter; and Dorene and John Whitney.  </P> <P> Museum director Steven Brezzo found himself hard-pressed to describe the gala.  "The scale of the evening is unprecedented," he said. He had high praise for  the hosts. "The fountain is a fitting testimony to the Thorntons' magnificent  enthusiasm and generosity, not only for the museum, but for the arts in San  Diego in general."  </P></p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Not divorce but a partial separation: John Griffiths talks to Honda about its European strategy after BMW bought Rover In the immediate aftermath of the decision by British Aerospace to sell Rover Group to BMW, Honda appeared bent on filing for a bitter divorce from the UK car company which had been its partner for 14 years. Tempers have now cooled; pragmatism has set in. Honda and Rover have still undergone a partial separation, in that their cross-shareholdings have just been unwound. But their collaboration on specific projects will continue, and possibly be renewed, for as long as there is considered to be mutual advantage. Honda meanwhile considers itself free to form as many liaisons with other European partners as it might choose, according to the Japanese carmaker's president, Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto. And while mention of BAe still provokes frowns of disapproval among Honda executives - who maintain that BAe should have let Rover remain independent and British - it is a measure of how much the atmosphere has lightened that even BMW is not excluded as a potential project partner. This flexibility in attitude towards partners present and potential is one of several key elements in a long-term strategy for Europe just drawn up by Honda, and which has what Mr Kawamoto describes as a 'mid-term' goal of almost doubling Honda's car sales in the region by the year 2000. What the long-term goal might be, Mr Kawamoto is not yet willing to say. But it almost certainly will involve a further expansion of Honda's car making facilities at Swindon in south-west England beyond even the 50 per cent increases in capacity, to 150,000 cars a year, announced in Tokyo last week and to come on stream in 1998. The capacity increases, together with the installation of a Pounds 30m body pressings plant, form another element in the strategy. They will provide Swindon with stand-alone capability and viability, says Mr Kazue Ito, currently executive vice-president of Honda Motor Europe, and who is to succeed Mr Miyake as president of UK-based HME on June 29. They would allow Honda to 'strongly accelerate the self-reliant strategy which we have been pursuing' since the Rover takeover, says Mr Kawamoto. The unspoken message was clear: Honda may form other project partnerships in Europe, but never again will it willingly make itself vulnerable within a long-term, strategic alliance. Even ignoring the reasonable assumption that Honda's long-term goal is to lift its European sales higher than the 300,000 (2 per cent of the total market) projected for the year 2000, the expanded Swindon capacity is inadequate on the basis of Honda's own numbers. According to Honda's strategy presentation last week, 150,000 of those sales will be provided by cars built at Swindon. Yet Swindon is also to supply cars to the Middle East and Africa, regions for which HME and Mr Ito are also taking over responsibility. Honda already sells 50,000 cars in these markets and in the longer term they could take up to 10,000 from Swindon, according to Mr Ito. Other elements in the new European strategy should help Honda achieve its goals, most notably the addition of more than 500 dealers to the European network, bringing the total to 2,300, by the end of the decade. The strategy needs to work. The new investment at Swindon, including a new model to be developed for the end of the 1990s at a cost of Pounds 240m, will total Pounds 330m. Given that the spending will be phased over several years, it is a relatively small amount for a group with consolidated net sales and other revenues last year of Y3,862.7bn (Pounds 24.6bn). Even so, Honda's profits have come under increasing pressure. Three weeks ago it disclosed a further 36 per cent fall in net profits for its financial year to March 31, to Y23.6bn, following four straight years of profits decline from nearly Y100bn in 1989-90. Mr Kawamoto insists, however, that Honda has turned the corner and that efficiency improvements and market recovery in North America and Europe should see profits more than double in the current year. The new European strategy is not confined to cars, and itself forms only part of a wider set of policies through which Honda will try to ensure its long-term presence in a globalised auto industry. Honda also produces motorcycles, car engines for itself and Rover, lawn mowers, generators and a variety of other power products in Europe. From now on the development, manufacture and sales of all of these are to be integrated and co-ordinated by HME. Altogether, says Mr Ito: 'Honda has 800,000 customers a year in Europe.' Many car buyers, he points out, are also natural purchasers of other Honda products like lawn-mowers and there is a logic in multi-product showrooms. The same integration will go on throughout the four global regions into which Honda has split its operating activities: the Americas, Asia/ Oceania, Japan and the new Europe/Middle East/Africa grouping.</p>

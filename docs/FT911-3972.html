			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): BR hopes to avert disruption BRITISH RAIL is to make fresh attempts to reform the bargaining machinery covering about 115,000 employees to bring it more closely into line with reorganisation of the railways into separate businesses. BR's last efforts in 1989 to implement widespread reforms resulted in a series of one-day rail strikes: trade unions feared that BR wanted to end all centralised pay bargaining. Unions and BR management will meet for talks under the auspices of the conciliation service Acas. BR hopes that, by taking negotiations at a measured pace through Acas, it can avoid a repeat of the industrial action of two years ago. Talks are due to start at Acas in May and could continue for the rest of this year. The announcement came as rail unions and BR management prepared to resume this year's pay negotiations. The unions have rejected a 6.5 per cent pay offer and warned of possible industrial action if their claim for a 'substantial increase' was not met. Both sides are due to meet again tomorrow and it is unlikely that BR will make any significant increase in the offer. On the reform of the bargaining machinery, the RMT rail union said yesterday that it acknowledged the need for changes but had objected in 1989 to the way BR had tried to impose a new structure. However, it warned that as a 'minimum requirement' it would want the continuation of a national forum for pay discussions.</p>

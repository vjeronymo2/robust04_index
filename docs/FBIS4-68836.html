			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniya Mikhalevskaya: "Custodian of the </F> Press: Why Do We Not Like Him?"]    [Text] Approximately a month ago Boris Sergeyevich  Mironov, the new leader of the Russian press, made the Russkaya  Kniga Publishers an offer they could not refuse. He insistently  recommended that the publishers accept for production Shulgin's  work "Why Do We Not Like Them?"    THEY are the Jews. WE are Russians with a capital "R," who  recognize our national affiliation as a most valuable Christmas  present of fate. Thus dear Boris Sergeyevich and the Russkaya  Kniga Publishers (against their wishes to some extent) are  intending to present reading Russia with the advocacy work of a  most dazzling national Black Hundred figure, who contrived in  postrevolution exile to admire Stalin for his imperial labors,  return to the Union, serve the obligatory 10-year stretch, and  remain true to his love and his hatred.    It should be mentioned immediately that Boris Mironov was  for  the past two years (until his appointment) director of Russkaya  Kniga and that he continues to exert a particular influence on  the business prospects and future of this establishment.  Nonetheless, not one regular employee of the publishing house  agreed to edit this urgent work and append his name to the  publication particulars. Some suggested that the following be  set up on the title page: "Publication recommended by the  Committee of the Russian Federation for the Press."    A statement of fact--the chairman of the Committee of the  Russian Federation for the Press is, in fact, involved in the  publication of literature sowing national discord--is  inevitable. And he is doing this, what is more, while remaining  beyond the reach of incensed cosmopolitans since there is not a  single written document recording his direct participation in  the publication of the said work. There is only the verbal  evidence of people dependent on him. And, as indirect proof, the  trifling matter of Shulgin's piece of research, so important for  the fate of Russia, having arrived at the printer's (Book  Factory No. 1, city of Elektrostal) in circumvention of the  usual publishing cycle. The client, as we were informed in the  production department of the book factory, is Russkaya Kniga.    Boris Sergeyevich Mironov is undoubtedly a politician of the  new wave. He pronounces the word "Russian" emotionally and,  judging by his numerous radio and television appearances, is  thinking seriously about how to reconstitute Great Russia. He is  a particular traditionalist, if account is taken of the  exclusive Russian tradition of official functionaries of the  highest rank reckoning their appointment as nothing other than  an inscribed pass into high politics. Simultaneously considering  it possible for himself to adhere to exclusively personal and  intimate political views. The opinion, which is approved  throughout the world, that a public servant should be a  proponent of the official ideology is considered an anachronism  fit for satisfied European countries. In the mercantile language  of the payroll, pay is computed for Boris Sergeyevich Mironov in  order that a state which customarily calls itself democratic  ensure "freedom of speech and the independence of the press...,"  but Boris Sergeyevich, appearing on television, has the  following interesting words to say: "Such concepts as democratic  principles, democratic canons--they are incomprehensible to me.  I believe that they are once again trinkets and toys which are  being used unscrupulously today in democratic and other  political games. I believe that we should be guided not by some  democratic reaction; we should be guided by common sense aimed  at just one thing--the same thing for which I like Stolypin.  Aimed at a strengthening of the state, a strengthening of  Russia. And Russia can be strengthened only via the authorities.  Strong authorities mean a strong state."    Russia, as we all know, can be strengthened in various  ways--the choice of pit-prop facilities is broad enough. But if  account is taken of the passion of the chairman of the Committee  of the Russian Federation for the Press for strong authoritarian  power, the press will soon be having to be guided by his common  sense. In this case, we are simply compelled to analyze the  personal attributes and level of practical potential of the  committee chairman.    So, then, Mr. Mironov negotiated the illustrious path from  trainee at KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA to correspondent of PRAVDA. He  has preserved his commitment to his paper--he named it as being  among the papers constituting the "national information field  which we are accustomed to calling central...." It is to these  papers--PRAVDA, TRUD, and so forth--"whose name has become a  symbol of Russia"---that Boris Sergeyevich intends giving budget  monies first and foremost. He was, as we have already mentioned,  director of the Russkaya Kniga Publishers (the former SOVETSKAYA  ROSSIYA Publishers). In 1993 he published the novel "The  Madman," as the principal practical hero of which he portrayed  one Mikhail Nikiforovich Poltoraivanov, the correspondent of a  central newspaper. Boris Sergeyevich scrupulously delineated his  practical hero in rich, lively, and evocative manner. With vivid  touches and Tolstoyan periods. He did not employ camouflage  inasmuch as the recognizability of the prototype was obligatory.  It is rumored that Poltoranin was made fun of somewhat after the  novel's appearance. Of Boris Sergeyevich, no. Because if a  person does such a thing, he has, consequently, good reason to.    Boris Sergeyevich had the novel published in the friendly  Respublika Publishing House. It is not that important, of  course, that the composition was supervised in the P.F. Anokhin  Petrozavodsk Printer's by an employee of the Russkaya Kniga  Publishers, that the publication particulars contain the name of  no editor at all, that the technical editor was an employee of  Russkaya Kniga also, and that the novel was printed from slides  at Book Factory No. 1 in the city of Elektrostal. In which the  product of Russkaya Kniga is usually printed, but by no means  that of the Respublika Publishers, which has its own Krasnyy  Proletariy Printer's. It is an absolutely trifling matter that  the paper also was allocated from Russkaya Kniga stocks. We do  not doubt, of course, that everything was paid for punctually  and that an agreement with Respublika was signed and drawn up  properly. It is foolish and trivial even to demand that a book  by the director of a publishing house travel the customary route  of a manuscript submitted for publication and that someone there  decide whether it has a right to be published or not. Following  this skewed logic, it could be demanded that vendors of the meat  department stand in line for meat.    The next step in the career of Boris Sergeyevich is the  office of chairman of the Committee of the Russian Federation  for the Press, which was formed on the hallowed ground of the  Ministry of Press and Information and the sporadically  rebellious Federal Information Center.    B. Mironov set forth his exclusively professional (and in no  way political) principles at a news conference in Moscow, which  caused quite a sensation. Boris Sergeyevich gave the appearance  there of being an energetic and fair individual, but,  unfortunately, contradicted himself somewhat: "I do not get into  political banalities," Mr. Mironov said, "and this is our  purpose, we pursue a sectoral policy, purely professional...."  That is, Boris Sergeyevich announced that the committee would be  objective, like the Moon, which simultaneously illuminates the  road and the victim and the robber. But he observed immediately  here that he would with pleasure impose moral censorship, and to  the question as to whether "...the Committee of the Russian  Federation for the Press intends monitoring observance of  publications' political trustworthiness and subsequently  dictating what should be written and how," he announced that  "...of course, we will recommend, heeding our  recommendations--that is your business...." We would recall that  Boris Sergeyevich's first recommendation--to OBSHCHAYA  GAZETA--took the form of an official caution, not heeding which  was quite difficult. Would have been, had it not been for the  verdict of the Appellate Court for Information Litigation, which  sets aside the caution.    But the biggest discrepancies occurred not at the level of  the word but of the level of the view. Of Boris Sergeyevich's  view of life. Boris Sergeyevich spoke at length, for example,  about Alla Yaroshinskaya, calling her for some reason or other  an ordinary Zhitomir journalist (in our age of democracy,  evidently, ordinary Zhitomir journalists can win an alternative  Nobel Prize and become a member of the Presidential Council),  and juggled, to put it mildly, facts connected with the "Atomic  Encyclopedia" which she is publishing--initially in a public  interview, then at the news conference. But this is not the  point. Mironov's conflict with Yaroshinskaya and its clear  political underpinnings (Boris Sergeyevich is afraid of  competition since there is in the Office of the President a plan  for the creation of an official structure for assistance to the  press, which was to have been headed by Aleksandr Yakovlev and  Alla Yaroshinskaya) were illustrated in detail by IZVESTIYA of  31 March 1994. Exposing Yaroshinskaya as a publisher and  accusing her of theft, Mr. Mironov observed that he himself had  attended the school of director of a publishing house and had  been accustomed in this field to earn everything down to the  last kopek independently. The trouble is that this is not  entirely the case. The Russkaya Kniga Publishers, which Mironov  left, not only has not prospered since his directorship but  finds itself, according to the workers of the publishing house,  in an extremely difficult financial situation. Each employee of  the publishing house has been issued a list of books whose print  run has not in practice sold out--so that the employees might  take part in the distribution as best they can.    The list contains approximately 30 titles, and, according to  employees of the publishing house, this is 60 percent of the  entire print product on which Russkaya Kniga has been working  these past two years. The books are filling up warehouse  premises, and the publishing house, lest it pay money for  storage, has been forced to undertake acts of charity and to  give them out free of charge. Since it was made clearly  understood to us that the decision on the publication of this  book or the other would always be made by Mr. Mironov himself,  it is, naturally, he who bears the responsibility for all these  problems of the structure he has left. In addition, during Boris  Sergeyevich's directorship there were several further odd  episodes at the publishing house permitting doubts as to  Mironov's theory concerning honestly earned kopeks. The business  of the calendar published by Russkaya Kniga for a large Siberian  plant acquired a certain notoriety even in publishing circles.  The large industrial enterprise, which has trade relations with  foreign partners, decided to conclude with the publishing house  a contract for the publication of the "Old Russian Book  Miniature" in order that 3,000 copies of the calendar might be  published bearing the plant's proprietary symbols. During the  negotiations, which took place in March of last year, Mr.  Mironov informed his clients that the publishing house was in a  difficult material situation. In this connection the plant  undertook to pay for the entire print run of 20,000 copies. And  not simply to pay, what is more, but to prepay. The calendars  (so that they could be sold) were to have been delivered to the  enterprise absolutely no later than August. But on Mr. Mironov's  initiative the documents did not specify a precise deadline. "We  are civilized people," Mironov said, "you will get the calender,  I will not say on time, but sooner...."    "Mironov was full of enthusiasm," plant representative  Yelena  D. told us. "We were shown a calculation with regard to all the  types of taxation--the production cost of each calendar amounted  to R800. The contract was signed in April--No. 20 of 12 April  1993. Some 16 million were paid into the publishers' account  within a week, and--total silence ensued...."    Subsequently the situation unfolded in most villainous  fashion. The calendar was not ready either in July or in August  or in September. To all questions there was just one answer--it  is being printed. Then... it dries up. At the start of October  the representative of the plant was issued 15 copies of the  calendar and told that, considering the inflationary processes,  the prime cost of a copy would be R3,600. And this meant that  the plant could expect merely its own 3,000 calendars with the  symbols, while the rest would remain at the publisher's. "I then  demanded a new calculation," Yelena D. told us, "I wanted to  know where this increase in the price had come from. It was  brought me--for `our' 3,000 copies. It said that the paper had  been purchased in mid-April--why, then, was it so expensive? The  chief accountant was summoned. She said: No, this is the wrong  paper, it is not intended for this calendar. The appropriate  people were hastily assembled, and I was given another set of  figures--based on a cost of one copy of R2,700.    "To make a long story short, I realized that we had simply  been cheated. At that time, in the month of April, Mr. Mironov  probably needed money. He had, evidently, wasted it on something  or other. In actual fact, the plant lost this money. We were  unable to sell the part of the print run that came to us,  arriving too late. I was told in the publishing house's accounts  department: `You cannot imagine even how you were  cheated....'"    It may be observed that the Siberian plant business was an  isolated instance. But the paper knows of several other episodes  of the less than ethical attitude of Mr. Mironov toward his  authors and clients and his financial records. Describing them  would take too long, showing the records is difficult. But are  there witnesses? In two years Russkaya Kniga has had three chief  accountants and as many commercial directors. Not one, according  to people in the know, surrendered his files on leaving. And  each of them will remember Mr. Mironov's methods of conducting  business for a long time, if not forever.    We were told in the publishing house: "We still freeze with  fear merely at the mention of his name...."    The appointment of PRAVDA man Mironov to the position of  chairman of the Committee of the Russian Federation for the  Press has been seen by many journalists as evidence of an  obvious cooling on the part of the official authorities toward  the news media. But, we are convinced, a less atypical person  than Boris Sergeyevich Mironov also could have coped with the  organization of the dubious game going by the name of  "straighten out the journalist." It is obvious, for that matter,  that the appointment of Mr. Mironov is the result of the  materialization of quite narrow group interests. Boris  Sergeyevich is in his position very convenient for a whole  number of quite influential politicians. He will never, for  example, fall out with the Committee for Information and  Communications of the State Duma. And he will hardly abolish the  at least 15 small state-owned (?) enterprises established on the  basis of practically all the economic subdivisions of the  Ministry of Press and Information and the Federal Information  Center, whose successor the committee is (the newspaper has a  list of all these small state-owned enterprises).    It is perfectly obvious that fighting the very institution  of  group (large or small, it is immaterial) political intrigue in  our society is just as useless as trying to influence the  weather by means of a collective campaign. Nonetheless, many of  us formerly paid quite dearly for our democratic toys and  trinkets for us now to be parting with them overnight. We  realize, for that matter, that we have taken up too much paper  and too much of the reader's time with individual traits and  singularities of the new custodian of the press. The problem is  not, of course, the character of Mr. Mironov--he does not,  ultimately, eat children. The problem is that politicians of his  ilk are again needed and are once again being brought into  power. Meanwhile, time is passing. Journalists, like the  peasants and miners, are sitting and waiting for government  subsidies. The distribution of subsidies is the first and most  telling manifestation of power. Today power is being manifested  by the chairman of the Committee of the Russian Federation for  the Press. We will see who gets the money.</p>

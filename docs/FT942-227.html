			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Thailand railway decision The Thai cabinet has decided that the Hongkong group Hopewell Holdings will not have to run any of its 60km road and railway scheme underground in the centre of Bangkok, William Barnes reports from Bangkok. But the cabinet would still like nearly half of Tanayong's 22km elevated railway to go underground following vigorous protests by local environmentalists; the Land Traffic Management Committee has a fortnight to try to negotiate with the Bangkok-based developer. Bangkok Land, which unlike Hopewell and Tanayong has yet to sign a franchise agreement, has agreed to take much of its 20km Skytrain project underground; receiving a maximum subsidy of Dollars 660m on top the estimated original Dollars 2bn cost.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Standards tightened for auditors Accountants must be able to show that they have met adequate auditing standards if their fees are questioned by a client under ethical rules approved yesterday by their professional body. The rules place the onus on auditors to demonstrate that they have met audit regulations, especially those governing quality control. The details were approved by the three councils controlling the ethical committees for the chartered accountancy bodies for England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland. The rulings fall substantially short of more radical options considered by the committee, including placing a lower limit on the level of fees that can be charged. The widespread practice of 'low-balling' or predatory, intensely competitive pricing for audits has raised concerns among smaller practitioners that the quality of auditing was impaired. The committee said it found no evidence of this happening. 'There is nothing inherently wrong with keen pricing, but that doesn't change the requirement to do an effective audit,' said Mr Jock Worsley, chairman of the committee. The new ethical rules call for transparency in fee levels before a contract begins, and forbid accountants from using contingency fees in audit work or other reporting assignment with professional opinions. A separate ruling, to strengthen independence, states that any partner must not work on the same audit for more than seven years at a time, and then have a five-year 'quarantine' before taking charge again.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>   [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  inspection team departed Pyongyang at 1000 [0100 GMT] on 15  March by air after completing its 12-day inspection of North  Korean nuclear facilities.    The IAEA inspection team was scheduled to stay one day in  Beijing; however, it will proceed directly to IAEA headquarters  in Vienna.    Mr. Kyd, IAEA information director, revealed that the  inspection team was to stay one day in Beijing, but the team  will arrive in Vienna on 16 March after changing its original  plan in response to an emergency directive from the IAEA  Secretariat.    The IAEA will decide if it will convene a special Board of  Governors meeting this weekend after hearing the inspection  team's report on detailed results of the inspection activities.    The major board members stated that the inspection for  examination of conversion of nuclear materials was insufficient,  including difficulties the team experienced in extracting test  material of nuclear materials due to North Korea's lack of  cooperation. As a result, it seems that convocation of a  special Board of Governors meeting next week is inevitable.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: CE Heath shares rise 15p despite profits tumble LOSSES IN aviation insurance and on the disposal of investments depressed the group pre-tax outcome at CE Heath, the insurance broker. Profits fell from Pounds 19m to Pounds 1.48m over the year to March 31. However, the core brokerage and computer services operations performed ahead of expectations, prompting a positive response from the market which pushed the shares up 15p to 338p. Before exceptional items pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 25.1m, compared with Pounds 31.5m. After tax, dividends and minority interests, Heath had a reatined loss of Pounds 24.6m (profit of Pounds 11.2m). The loss per sahre was 22.5p (earnings 46.4p). As anticipated the final dividend is 11p, cutting the total to 16p (25.875p). The group provided Pounds 18.4m against claims from aviation reinsurance contracts underwritten by its Australian subsidiary between 1987 and 1991. Losses on sale of investments came to Pounds 5.58m (Pounds 113,000). Direct comparison of the two years' results is also complicated by the sale in November 1991 of the former Bermudian reinsurance subsidiary, Pinnacle Re, and the flotation in June 1992 of a majority stake in CE Heath International Holdings, the Australian insurance subsidiary. In addition 1991-92 results were restated in line with the provisions of FRS 3. Brokerage income rose 13 per cent to Pounds 114.8m (Pounds 101.6m), with rises in premium rates, especially in the London and catastrophe reinsurance markets, helping to offset a recession-inducted drop in demand. 'There has been a very significant contraction in the overall size and capacity of the market, leading to increased self-insurance and retention of risk,' said Mr Michael Kier, chairman. Against this background UK wholesale and corporate risks operations performed well and the recently established Latin American operations also reported profits. Heath's expense ratio was cut from 110.2 per cent to 98.8 per cent. Computer services income rose to Pounds 42.9m (Pounds 39.2m). Investment and other income fell to Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 16.3m), as a result of lower interest rates in both the UK and US. Overall brokerage profits fell to Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 16.7m) because of lower investment returns, underwriting profits fell to Pounds 6.98m (Pounds 12.7m) and computer services profits to Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 5.04m).</p>

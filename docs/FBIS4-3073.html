			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Overseas  correspondents are free to report on China but will be punished  if they violate Chinese law, the PEOPLE'S DAILY [RENMIN RIBAO]  says in a short commentary to be published in tomorrow's edition.    The Chinese Communist Party's newspaper makes these remarks  in commenting on today's rejection of the appeal by Xi Yang, a  correspondent of the Hong Kong-based newspaper MING PAO, against  a 12-year sentence for spying.    Xi was arrested last October and charged with espionage on  state banking secrets. His accomplice, Tian Ye, an official of  the People's Bank of China, was sentenced to 15 years behind  bars.    The PEOPLE'S DAILY says: "The punishment of criminals and  the  protection of the freedom of news coverage are two totally  different things," adding: "whoever steals state secrets will  get punished."    "The Chinese Government protects the freedom of news  coverage  but not the freedom of stealing state secrets," the newspaper  says.    If criminals in such cases are not punished severely  according to the law, it says, China will suffer great damage in  its reform and opening to the outside and in its economic  construction.    In the past decade, China had always welcomed correspondents  from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan as well as from foreign  countries to do news coverage in China, and offered help for  their legitimate reporting, it says.    Most correspondents from overseas abide by Chinese law, and  only one case, i.e. Xi Yang's case, of spying on state secrets  was discovered last year, it says. More than 1,000 Hong Kong  reporters came to the mainland to do news reporting last year.    The paper labels Tian as "a thief in the family," saying  that  he cannot be tolerated as he revealed state secrets and caused  great damage to the country and the Chinese people.    It warns other officials that China's reform and opening to  the outside world poses a severe test to their loyalty.</p>

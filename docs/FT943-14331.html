			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Pressure on Bolger as MP resigns New Zealand faces a month of political uncertainty after the surprise resignation from parliament of Ms Ruth Richardson, former finance minister. The National government would lose its slender majority if it lost Ms Richardson's marginal seat in the resultant by- election. Mr Jim Bolger, prime minister, said on television last night he had been tempted to call a general election to ensure a stable government. 'However, I was elected to lead for a full three-year term,' he added. The leader of the two-seat opposition Alliance party said he would vote to ensure the National party continued in government if it lost the Selwyn seat, 'provided it does nothing controversial'. The government is riding high in the opinion polls after recent economic successes, and Mr Bolger acknowledged he was under pressure from his party to hold a snap election. This would be held under the Westminster first-past-the-post system; a referendum last year voted in favour of a switch to the West German system of proportional representation, but the necessary legislative procedures are not yet in place. Ms Richardson is one of the most powerful and outspoken right-wing MPs, and from 1991 was widely credited with being the principal architect of a series of sweeping government economic reforms. Her strong views made her politically unpopular, however, and she was sacked after the last general election when the National party won 50 seats against the 49 held by opposition parties. She said yesterday that one of her chief accomplishments came this month when as a backbencher she steered through parliament a Fiscal Responsibility Bill which forces future governments to disclose budgetary information on a quarterly basis. Ms Richardson said she was resigning to follow family and business interests, and did not want to be carried out of parliament 'in a box'. She said the resignation had nothing to do with being sacked as finance minister, and she would not be joining another political party. Financial markets reacted sharply to the news, with the New Zealand dollar losing nearly a cent against the US currency, and interest rates rising strongly.</p>

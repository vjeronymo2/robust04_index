			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA;  </P> <P> COMMUNITY CENTER FLOOR PLAN OKD  </P> <P> A proposed floor plan for a community center at the corner of Imperial Highway  and Casa Loma Avenue was approved unanimously Tuesday by the City Council.  </P> <P> The plan for the 26,000-square-foot building includes a room for the Yorba  Linda Women's Club, a 6,000-square-foot senior citizens' area, an assembly room  with a stage, a multipurpose room and two other activity areas intended for  children and teen-agers.  </P> <P> "It's a beautiful, beautiful plan," said council member Roland E. Bigonger.  </P> <P> Steve Rudometkin, director of parks and recreation for the city, said  construction of the center is expected to begin in about a year.  </P> <P> Plans for the community center had been delayed because the city's first  intended location, on grounds owned by the Placentia Unified School District,  met with opposition by district representatives who wanted schools to receive a  higher priority than other groups for use of the center.  </P> <P> The council approved the new site April 17.  </P> <P> Rudometkin said the matter now will be referred to the Planning Commission for  hearings.  </P></p>

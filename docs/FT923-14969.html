			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Markets: Grunts don't just afflict Wimbledon - London Markets WEEPING skies and a regular low moan, traditional features of Wimbledon when Monica Seles is playing, have been equally appropriate in London EC1 this week. The precipitation has been as much economic as celestial; the moaning has come from investors watching the FT-SE index slide to pre-election levels. Big-business economists have told the Treasury that the pickup in manufacturing output seen in the first quarter has halted. House sales have faltered in the last six weeks, after showing signs of recovery in the spring. Consumers are spending less of their income than at any time in nearly a decade. Companies are headhunting 12 per cent fewer executives than a year ago. And Conservative MPs are starting to shift nervously on their green leather benches, mumbling that it is time for the government to do something to get the economy moving again. All that leads to two questions: is Britain trapped in a seemingly endless recession? And if it is, will the government make a big change in policy to escape from it? City economists mostly answer 'no' to the first question, though they do not necessarily expect the upturn to amount to much when it comes. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, for example, one of the first forecasting teams to predict zero growth for 1992, expects 1993 to bring a 1 1/2 per cent rise in GDP - not much of a recovery, but not a continued recession. Economists, who do their calculations on the basis of unchanged government policies, are not the best people to ask for an answer to the second question. Political journalists, who spend their time sniffing the wind for the scent of a U-turn, are probably a better guide. So here is what the FT political team thinks: At the moment, Tory MPs are looking for signs of action, rather than a real change of course. Pressure could mount by the autumn, though, especially if the party conference looks like proving difficult as anti-EC sentiment among some constituency associations spills over into the debate about the impact of the ERM on the UK. Still, John Major will not shift. He and his team don't think a small devaluation would do any good, since the loss of credibility it would involve would push interest rates up rather than down. A big devaluation is out of the question - not least because the ERM, in the prime minister's view, provides the essential framework for anti-inflationary policy which was missing in the 1980s. That leaves one other possible escape route: a big shift in thinking among other EC governments, especially France. So far, only Labour is pushing that idea: John Smith raised the possibility of a concerted EC growth strategy involving lower interest rates and an ERM realignment in the Commons on Thursday night. If pressures continue to grow in France and elsewhere, that may become a talking point among Conservatives, too, by the autumn. In the meantime, the markets are clutching at straws. On Friday, after US interest rates dropped to levels not seen since the Beach Boys were thin, the stock market jumped to the conclusion that a cut in UK interest rates was also on the way. Traders were over-reacting to some not-very-exciting moves by the Bank of England in the money market; but the hope of lower rates was enough to take the FT-SE index back up again towards the 2,500 mark. The FT-SE closed on Friday at 2,497.1, up 21 points on the day but down 37 points on the week. The economy was not the only cause of that decline, however. Just as important, in institutional investors' minds, was the flow of bad news about share issues. After the GPA float was pulled last month, almost nothing has gone right. The Daily Telegraph issue met with a resounding lack of enthusiasm among private investors. MFI, the furniture business, and Anglian Group, the double-glazing supplier, both found underwriters, but at prices much lower than had been hoped for. Del Monte Foods International followed 3i in postponing its planned float until times were better. Al though the sale of Wellcome shares shows every sign of going ahead, there are plenty of white knuckles visible. Two results this week provided contrasting pictures of how to deal with recession. British Steel announced a Pounds 55m pre-tax loss for the year, and cut its dividend by three quarters. The share price dropped to half its privatisation level. GEC, by contrast, announced profits up 1 per cent and a dividend up 5 per cent. Cash reserves rose from Pounds 528m to Pounds 876m, and the company's net cash (including that held by its joint-venture subsidiaries) is Pounds 1.46bn. British Steel shares ended the week at 64p, down 6p; GEC closed at 237p, up 9p. The first half of the year, which ended on Monday, saw a 2 per cent rise in the FT-Actuaries All-Share index. Among big companies the best performer was Midland Bank, up 113 per cent thanks to the successful takeover bid by Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation. Other rises were less remarkable, but three big companies managed to increase in value by a third or more: Siebe, Thames Water and Guardian Royal Exchange. At the bottom end of the scale, British Petroleum was down by just over 30 per cent, hit by concerns about the dividend and British Aerospace dropped 23 per cent. Given the outlook for oil companies and defence contractors, those figures were perhaps not surprising. But the drop in the shares of Glaxo and Wellcome, both down by 20 per cent, reflected the fading glamour of the big drugs stocks. SmithKline Beecham, which did not benefit quite so much from last year's over-enthusiasm, did much better: it ended the half year down less than one per cent.</p>

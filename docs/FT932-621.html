			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Management: Coping with double trouble - How foreign postings can affect dual-income couples Brooke is a dance therapist. Until recently she had a thriving practice in New York teaching people how to reduce their stress levels through dance. Then her husband, a high-flyer with an international oil company was offered a posting in London. For him it meant promotion, more money, excitement. For her it meant closing down her business, losing income and status. Despite the unpromising beginning, the story has a happy ending: Brooke is now enthusiastically teaching dance therapy to an unaccustomed British audience. But most 'dual-career' couples are not so lucky. If they move, one suffers, if they do not, the other does. And in either case employers may lose out because their best people are refusing to move or because the 'trailing spouse' is so unhappy that the posting is a failure. Companies are increasingly recognising the problem. According to recent research, 65 per cent of big employers say the careers of the spouse are a problem in international staff transfers, and 90 per cent of companies expect them to become one in the future. Of foreign assignments that fail, a third are due to problems relating to the spouse's job - or lack of one - abroad. Yet despite this concern, only 35 per cent of companies do anything to help the trailing spouse. These figures were presented last week at a seminar on dual careers, organised by Employment Conditions Abroad, a non-profit making body that advises companies on international relocations. The problem is not just for wives. Increasingly, it is the husband that trails. Career Relocations, a specialist company that helps find jobs for the spouse, reports that 5-10 per cent of its clients are male and that the proportion is rising. Indeed, the fact that some men are now sloping unhappily around the world after their wives may be partly responsible for the new seriousness with which senior management is taking the issue. Most companies have no policies to compensate for loss of the spouse's income as they fear it would be too expensive, especially as the trailing spouse may earn more than the employee. Neither are they prepared to do much to help the spouse find a job. Many will offer language training and perhaps provide some information about conditions in the foreign job market, but the help stops there. Many of the big international employers that attended last week's seminar, which was co-sponsored by career consultants GHN, admitted that they made up the rules as they went along. However, some forward-thinking policies are starting to emerge when both parties work for the same organisation. Then, companies try to find jobs for both together, or at least promise a leave of absence and maintained benefits to the spouse. Matters are more complex when the spouse works somewhere else. Some employers said they would in certain circumstances get together with the spouse's employer to see if he or she could be posted to the same place, with both companies perhaps dividing the relocation costs between them. Alternatively, the employer might offer the spouse a job themselves, or try to find one through informal networks or relocation companies. Many companies are starting to interview both employee and spouse before deciding upon an international assignment. One big retail company said that if the wife seemed unhappy about it they would think very carefully about giving the husband the job, no matter how suitable he was. The lessons that emerged from last week's seminar were that all sides - the company, employee and spouse - should make their positions clear to each other from the outset. If companies set a high value on on international experience - and 80 per cent of multinational companies do so, according to a recent survey  - then it is best if they let the employees know it from the start. Equally, employees should work out in advance with their spouse whether and in which cases they are prepared to travel.</p>

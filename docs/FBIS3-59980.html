When the officials reached  their target, they found more than 45 rai of marijuana. The  officials cut down the plants, which weighed a total of  approximately 30 tons.    A report stated that the officials also found mines in the  marijuana fields and so they had to be very careful. During the  time that they were destroying the marijuana plants, they could  periodically hear explosions set off to harass them. Thus, a  team of officials went to arrest those who were planting the  mines. But they all managed to escape. None of the officials was  injured. It was later learned that these marijuana plants had  been planted by Hmong tribesmen.    In Khao Chok Subdistrict, Sisawat District, Kanchanaburi  Province, BPP officials destroyed a field of marijuana plants in  their area of responsibility. And in Dan Chang District,  Suphanburi Province, officials destroyed 30 tons of marijuana  valued at approximately 9 million baht.</p>

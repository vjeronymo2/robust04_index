			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Luis M. Saez] </F>   [Text] Among the measures discussed by the Cuban parliament  on 1 May to reverse the country's difficult financial situation  is the possibility of changing the currency.    Deputy Lazaro Barredo presented the above measure to the  parliament, which is in special session to find a solution to  end the excess of currency in circulation, estimated at some 11  billion pesos (official exchange rate is one peso per dollar).    Barredo told PRENSA LATINA that a change of currency would  be  one of the most effective, pivotal methods to cleanse and  improve the economy.    He added that the measure, within the framework of others to  be adopted later, would allow the country to expedite the  economic recovery and would represent an improvement of the  economic model the country is implementing.    The deputy pointed out that price policies alone will not  solve the problem. He added that among other issues being  analyzed it was found that a shortage of cigarettes on the  official market has driven prices up to 30 pesos per pack on the  so-called black market.    A consistent change of currency would be less disturbing to  the lower-income population and for those who have managed to  save some money.    When asked if the legalization of the possession of freely  convertible currency (summer of 1993) was one of the causes of  the current imbalance, he said that in all cases, a strong  currency (foreign exchange) acts to the detriment of a weak  currency, as is the case with the national currency.    Barredo underscored that this economic distortion is  primarily caused by the lack of demand for goods and services in  terms of Cuban pesos.    This special session of parliament is being held with the  sole objective of analyzing the nation's financial situation and  making a number of decisions to end that problem.</p>

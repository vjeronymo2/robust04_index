			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: Further sharp fall from Mannesmann as sales rise MANNESMANN, the German engineering conglomerate, suffered a further sharp fall in profits last year, in spite of a 15 per cent increase in sales to DM28bn (Dollars 17bn). The company, which is expected to produce full figures in May, yesterday blamed the decline on recession, launch costs for its mobile telephone network, and heavy extraordinary costs for restructuring. Net profits in 1991 were DM625m, down from DM1bn a year earlier. The steel tubes, trading and vehicle components divisions all incurred losses, while the engineering and plant businesses produced 'clearly positive returns'. The Brazilian subsidiary returned to profit after two years of deficit, and earnings from electrical and electronic engineering were unchanged. Overall order intake rose 9 per cent to DM27.7bn thanks to the consolidation of newly-acquired businesses.</p>

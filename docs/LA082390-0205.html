			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> TASK FORCE TO STUDY CAMPAIGN SIGN LAW  </P> <P> With less than three months until the Nov. 6 election, the City Council this  week decided against loosening restrictions on where candidates can place  campaign signs. Instead, the council sent the politically charged issue back to  the drawing board.  </P> <P> The council agreed to form a task force that will include council members Don  Griffin and Donna L. Chessen and representatives of the city's legal staff to  take another look at the issue. The committee is expected to make public its  findings next month.  </P> <P> Griffin objected to provisions allowing signs to be placed in city-owned  parkways without adjacent property owners' consent. The loosened restrictions  also would allow candidates to put up their placards more than 30 days prior to  the election.  </P> <P> Griffin said that the changes would be a "disgrace" because signs would be  going up all over the city.  </P> <P> However, Assistant City Atty. Andrew Arczynsky told the council that the  current restrictions are unconstitutional because political signs are the  purest form of freedom of speech. Both political and non-political signs must  be treated the same, he said.  </P> <P> Along with political signs, the task force also will review proposed  restrictions on real estate signs.  </P> <P> Members of the Buena Park/Cypress/La Palma Board of Realtors, who helped the  Planning Commission draft the revisions, came to the meeting Monday to show  their support of a proposed ordinance that would restrict the number of  open-house signs that can be placed on a property while it is being sold. It  also limits the number of hours and days that the signs can be put up.  </P> <P> The task force is expected to make its recommendations at the Sept. 17 council  meeting. LYNDA NATALI  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOLATILE KOSOVO LOOKS TO ALBANIA;  </P> <P> YUGOSLAVIA: PROMISE OF DEMOCRACY ACROSS THE BORDER COULD BE A STRONGER LURE  THAN ETHNIC TIES.  </P> <P> For decades the Serbs of Yugoslavia have warily eyed cloistered Albania,  accusing their Stalinist neighbor of sending spies and infiltrators to incite  separatism among ethnic Albanians in the border province of Kosovo.  </P> <P> Now, Albania may be unleashing a more powerful force that could attract the  support of Kosovo Albanians: democracy.  </P> <P> Albania's tentative steps toward reform have sparked new hope in the West that  the last hard-line holdout of Eastern Europe may be softening. But for  Yugoslavia, the prospect of a more liberal Albania strikes another match near  the ethnic tinderbox of Kosovo.  </P> <P> The Serbian Communist Party leader, Slobodan Milosevic, rose to power by  stirring fear among fellow Serbs that Albanians were plotting to join Kosovo to  a greater Albania. More than 1.7 million ethnic Albanians live in Kosovo, and  they far outnumber the 200,000 Serbs in the province, the poorest part of  Serbia.  </P> <P> Kosovo Albanians used to dismiss the accusations of separatism as ludicrous,  arguing that many of them are in Yugoslavia because their parents sought to  escape repressive rule at home.  </P> <P> But if Albania follows through on its promises of freer travel, respect for  human rights and new ties with Western governments, Milosevic's purported fears  of Albanian unity could become a prophecy.  </P> <P> "If Albania advances and we stay in the same place, if there continues to be no  democracy in Kosovo, the chances are that people will choose to go elsewhere,"  said Ibrahim Rugova, leader of the Democratic Alliance, the opposition party  widely supported by Kosovo Albanians. "The Serbian government refuses to see  reality."  </P> <P> Kosovo has been the scene of recurring violence since March, 1989, when Serbia  stripped it of the autonomy provided by the 1974 constitution. Milosevic  engineered the change to assure fellow Serbs that the historic province would  never be lost to Albania.  </P> <P> Kosovo was the site of a heroic battle fought by Serbian warriors in 1389.  Serbia lost but slowed the Ottoman Turks' advance into Europe. To Serbs, Kosovo  symbolizes the greatness of the medieval kingdom they were never able to  restore after 500 years of Turkish occupation.  </P> <P> By flexing Serbia's muscle in Kosovo, Milosevic elevated Serbian national pride  and won the loyalty of his fellow Serbs, who account for 9 million of  Yugoslavia's 23 million people.  </P> <P> The price has been continual ethnic confrontation and repeated states of  emergency and martial law.  </P> <P> With the new allure of a more acceptable Albanian homeland, some Kosovo leaders  and Western political attaches worry that continued repression of the majority  Albanians could drive them toward a secession movement never seriously  entertained before.  </P> <P> Kosovo Albanians are agitating for republic status within Yugoslavia, arguing  that the nation of six republics and two provinces has been defined by ethnic  differences since its formation in 1918. Albanians are the third-largest  Yugoslav ethnic group after Serbs and Croats, and they believe they should not  be deprived of the status afforded smaller national minorities in Slovenia,  Macedonia, Bosnia and Montenegro.  </P> <P> Serbia, Rugova said, has relegated Kosovo to colonial status and misused  federal funds earmarked for provincial improvements.  </P> <P> Rugova lives on the seventh floor of a 12-story building in which the elevators  have been broken for years, the entryway reeks of urine and broken lighting has  resulted in total darkness in the stairwell.  </P> <P> Prefabricated concrete tenements are scattered randomly among this provincial  capital's ramshackle cottages, strung together by lines of faded laundry, the  signal flags of poverty.  </P> <P> The streets teem with idle youths, the result of a burgeoning birthrate twice  as high as the rest of Yugoslavia, compounded by unemployment that Serbian  officials peg at 36% but that Albanians contend is much higher. Squads of  Serbian police patrol the sidewalks day and night, moving loiterers along to  prevent spontaneous demonstrations.  </P> <P> Rugova, a respected writer and intellectual, said the Serbian police are trying  to bait Albanians into confrontation in order to postpone  </P> <P> multi-party elections.  </P> <P> Serbia is the only Yugoslav republic that has not had or scheduled free  elections this year. By all accounts, Serbia would lose control of Kosovo to  the Albanian majority in a fair and open ballot.  </P> <P> Western pressure has been applied on the capital of Belgrade to lift the state  of siege in Kosovo and to end the one-party rule that persists in Serbia and on  the national level.  </P> <P> Yugoslav Prime Minister Ante Markovic promised nationwide elections this year,  and this will force Serbia to hold a multi-party republic ballot before the  national election. This has turned the Kosovo confrontation into a volatile  waiting game, with both sides holding back from setting off the looming clash.  </P> <P> An uneasy calm has been maintained for the past three months amid alleged  atrocities that testify to the backwardness and brutality of the impoverished  region.  </P> <P> Vladimir Stambuk, a leader of Milosevic's Serbian Socialist Alliance, said  Albanians are trying to drive the remaining Serbs out of Kosovo by means of  intimidation ranging from rape to house-burning.  </P> <P> Jashar Kabashi, an Albanian professor of English at Kosovo University, accused  the Serbian police of beating Albanian protesters, jailing activists without  charge and segregating schools in order to arrange "accidents" that affect only  Albanian children, including a mysterious poisoning incident in March.  </P> <P> In Belgrade, officials see the Kosovo strife as the result of foreign  interference.  </P> <P> Stambuk said the reduction of Kosovo's status was necessary to stop  infiltration of Albanian government agents sent to incite a secessionist drive.  </P> <P> Serbia reacted with indignation when two American politicians, one of them Rep.  Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), told a cheering crowd of 10,000 Albanians in Pristina  in late May that the U.S. Congress is behind them. An official protest was made  to the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade, and the Serbian press accused the United  States of meddling.  </P> <P> Diplomatic sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said Serbia has lately  whipped up an anti-American campaign in an attempt to create a foreign  scapegoat for domestic failures. They cited the attempt to assert Serbian will  over Kosovo, and said it will collapse with free elections.  </P> <P> "We are not afraid of elections, but constitutional reforms are needed first,"  Stambuk said.  </P> <P> Those changes, which would subjugate Kosovo to Serbian rule, are embodied in a  draft constitution the Serbian leadership plans to present within weeks.  </P> <P> Under the restrictions invoked last year, Kosovo no longer has veto power over  constitutional changes. Their presentation is likely to be taken by Albanians  as a declaration of war.  </P> <P> Albanian political leaders like Rugova and local newspaper editor Veton Surroi  have appealed to Kosovo's majority to stay calm and wait out the Serbian  standoff on elections.  </P> <P> "We have in the past been very brave and very emotional; now we are learning  how to be patient," said Surroi, who nevertheless fears an explosion of  violence when Serbia moves to protect its control over Kosovo.  </P> <P> "There will be more confrontation," Surroi said, adding that he can see no  willingness to compromise by the Serbian leadership.  </P> <P> Tony Selmni, an ethnic Albanian who emigrated to Canada 14 years ago, was in  Kosovo recently to visit relatives. He and his Canadian-born wife, Miliana,  said Albanian friends and relatives are fearful of an explosion of violence  once the gauntlet of constitutional change is thrown down.  </P> <P> Selmni said he was told that Serbian secret police have been burning files in  fear of an imminent uprising.  </P> <P> "It's going to be a bloody battle," his wife predicted, "but eventually these  people (the Albanians) are going to win."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Carol J. Williams, based in Hungary, was recently on  assignment in Yugoslavia.  </P></p>

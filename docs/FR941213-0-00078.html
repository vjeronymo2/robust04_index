			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In determining high or low theft lines, pursuant to 49 CFR part 542,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Procedure for Selecting Lines to be Covered by the Theft Prevention Standard,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA proposed to apply the 1990/91 median theft rate to passenger motor vehicle lines to be introduced for model year (MY) 1996 and thereafter. However, as explained below, since this final rule does not begin to apply to affected vehicle lines until MY 1997, NHTSA will continue to apply the 1983/84 median theft rate to passenger car lines introduced before MY 1997.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that the changes described in the NPRM, if made final, would take effect beginning with model year 1996. With the possible exception of Honda, all commenters requested a longer leadtime than the April 25, 1995 proposed in the NPRM. The longer leadtimes requested ranged from a year after publication of the final rule (Mazda and Nissan) to September 1, 1996, almost two years after publication of the final rule (Chrysler and General Motors).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As reasons for requesting the longer leadtime, the commenters stated that extra time was needed to buy new equipment or to change manufacturing processes. In particular, Chrysler stated that production of its ``pull-ahead'' MY 1996 Chrysler Town and Country MPVs (already selected by NHTSA as a high theft line) will begin in January 1995, only two months after publication of the final rule. Since the changes prescribed in this final rule take effect ``at least 6 months after the date the standard is prescribed'' (49 U.S.C. 33103(e)), if the final rule were to take effect on April 25, 1995, NHTSA could not require marking of the Town and Country line.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering the comments, NHTSA has decided the new parts marking procedures for LDTs, MPVs, and vehicle lines listed in appendix B will take effect with MY 1997. NHTSA decided the extra lead time is necessary because manufacturers are being required to mark new vehicle types (MPVs and LDTs) and to mark low theft lines never before subject to parts marking. Extra time is needed for manufacturers to buy equipment, determine vehicles' target areas for parts marking, and to decide whether to submit a petition for exemption from parts marking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA also believes that all manufacturers should begin the new procedures in the same model year. MY 1997 is the earliest model year for which all manufacturers can ensure that their lines comply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Regulatory Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice has not been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action and has determined the action not to be ``significant'' under the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. This action defines ``light-duty truck'' (LDT) and ``multipurpose passenger vehicle'' (MPV) and specifies LDT and MPV parts that should be considered ``major parts.'' As a result of defining LDT and MPV, those lines are now included as ``passenger motor vehicle'' lines subject to the Theft Prevention Standard. In this final rule, the definition of LDT affects low theft lines that are selected for parts marking, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. section 33103. Since section 33103(a) excludes LDTs from its coverage, any passenger motor vehicle with a low theft rate (other than an LDT) would be subject to parts marking. The definition clarifies which vehicles Congress intended to be subject, as LDTs, to the marking of high theft passenger motor vehicle lines, but excluded from the potential rules for marking of low theft passenger motor vehicle lines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, the selection of the MPV and LDT parts to be marked is already, in large part, decided by Congress in 49 U.S.C. 33101, since the term ``major parts'' is defined at 49 U.S.C. 33101(6). However, the agency has authority under section 33101(6)(L) to make modifications to the statutory list, and for major parts of LDTs and MPVs, has exercised this authority. The overall cost of marking the MPVs and LDTs would, in any event, be limited to the $15 (in 1984 dollars), or $20.86 (in 1993 dollars, based on the U.S. Department of Labor's United States City Average All Items Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (See 59 FR 8021, February 17, 1994)) per vehicle maximum specified in section 33105(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Of this amount,  the return of the Bundeswehr unit cost about DM15 million, Ruehe  said in Bonn this morning. Personnel, training, materiel,  operations, and transport cost DM295.3 million.    A refund of DM70 million was expected from the United  Nations, thus reducing the cost of the whole mission from May  1993 to March 1994 to about DM240 million. The procurement  costs for materiel of almost DM60 million also have to be  deducted from this sum as "long-term investment." The Bundeswehr  could use the additional improved equipment in future  humanitarian missions, in case of disaster or as "crisis  reaction forces."    Ruehe described the resources spent in Somalia as  "investment  in humanity and in the future of the Bundeswehr." The  Bundeswehr's mission to Somalia saved tens of thousands of  people from dying of starvation and from disease. The  Bundeswehr also "gained unique experience."    The German support unit's camp at Beledwynne was cleared  this  morning. The commander, Colonel Holger Kammerhoff, was the last  soldier to leave Beledwynne at 0936 local time. The whole  German unit is to have returned to Germany by the end of March.</p>

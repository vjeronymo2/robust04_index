			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Takeover activity features steady session - Market Report Speculative activity in the television and brewery sectors bore witness yesterday to the positive mood of the UK stock market. Across the broad range of leading stocks, profit-takers were comfortably balanced by new buyers and share prices closed firmly. The pace was erratic, with the stock index futures leading the activity. Firmness in UK government bonds ahead of tomorrow's auction of Pounds 3bn of 10-year gilts, in the last bond sale of the year, encouraged equities, offsetting suggestions in some quarters that base rate cuts might be delayed. A good start by US Federal bonds, accompanied by an early advance of 11 Dow points on Wall Street, encouraged London. The FT-SE 100 Index finished 3.1 up at a new closing peak of 3,237.3, having moved between 3,243.6 and 3,224.3 during the session. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which took in activity in the television stocks in the wake of Granada's Pounds 600m bid for LWT Holdings, shaded down by 0.7 to 3,565.8. The Granada bid, while not unexpected, set the Television sector alight. Analysts quickly divided into those believing a rival bidder might appear and those convinced that Granada could be induced to pay a slightly higher price for LWT. Elsewhere, it was mostly company trading statements that provided the highlights. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, Scottish and Newcastle, Airtours and National Home Loans all stood out under this heading. Seaq volume remained high at 601.9m shares against 749.2m on Friday when retail business of Pounds 1.88bn indicated the continued vigour of the UK stock market's reponse to last week's Budget from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer. With little data on the domestic economy due this month, attention has turned again to the US, where reports on producer and consumer prices will be published this week. Nervousness regarding the Japanese stock market also resurfaced, with equities opening lower in London yesterday after the setback in Tokyo. The best performances came again from the banks, where the clearers continued to see benefits ahead for their bad debt lists from further falls in UK base rates, while the merchant banks counted the profits made in such active securities markets. Towards the close, the stock market have regained its confidence that base rates rates will be cut again in the new year, encouraged by the announcement of lower mortgage rates by one of Britain's leading home loan groups. But insurance stocks gave back some of the gains achieved following an unexpectedly benign Budget. There were ready buyers across the range of consumer issues, with food retailers, stores and hotels firm. Dividend prospects spurred strong gains among the utilities. The clouds hanging over crude oil prices kept the big oil stocks subdued throughout the session, and signs of renewed pressure from New York left the sector looking weaker in the final minutes of the trading session. The blue chip manufacturing issues moved narrowly around overnight levels, the pharmaceuticals lacking a lead from New York and many other big names shying away from the firmness in sterling which offers little help to export prospects. Overall, however, market strategists were confident that the stock market has retained the confidence with which the Budget was greeted last week.</p>

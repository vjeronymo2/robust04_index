			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Italian insurance sell-off pledge Privatisation of Istituto Nazionale delle Assicurazioni (Ina), Italy's state-owned insurance company, is still on schedule in spite of the fact that Rome prosecutors are investigating the group's chairman, Ina advisers said yesterday. Magistrates revealed on Wednesday night that they had warned Mr Lorenzo Pallesi that they were conducting inquiries into alleged falsifying of accounts and fraud, following up their earlier inquiries into the operations of the Rome branch of the company's Assitalia subsidiary between 1990 and 1992. Ina has played down the significance of the inquiry. The company pointed out that Mr Pallesi had only been targeted by the magistrates because he was formally responsible for the group at the time, though not directly involved in management of the Rome branch. Four other Ina-Assitalia executives were warned about the inquiry in March. Even before Wednesday's events, delays in the formation of a new Italian government had begun to cast doubt on the timetable for the Ina privatisation. The sell-off is scheduled for the end of June, but most of the important political decisions about privatising Ina have still to be taken.</p>

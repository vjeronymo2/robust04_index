			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: A basis for Russian and Nato accord Sir, I refer to your two articles, 'Russia and west split on Europe's security' and 'Baltics struggle to muster a credible defence' (October 10). Russia is rightly concerned about the stability and security of the southern members of the Commonwealth of Independent States and is sufficiently respectful of Nato to seek its endorsement before deploying Russian peacemaking troops. An exact parallel is Nato's concern for the stability and security of the countries immediately to Nato's east. . .the three Baltic States, the Visegrad four, Romania and Bulgaria. There would now seem to be an opportunity for the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to reach a mutually acceptable and beneficial agreement - acknowledging that Russia should assume the lead role and deploy peacemaking troops within the CIS, and acknowledging that Nato can similarly deploy peacekeeping troops throughout those European countries above, to Nato's east, and up to the CIS borders.

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Dalgety Thanks mainly to its consumer products division, there is a solidity about Dalgety these days which belies its recent history. That the group is now firmly back in the dependable but dull category was exemplified by yesterday's 7 per cent increase in interim earnings. Gearing is a comfortable 35 per cent; the interest bill is more than 10 times covered. But profits growth this year will probably be not much more than 5 per cent. Consumer products, mainly potato crisps and pot noodles, now account for nearly half the group's profits and are receiving the lion's share of new investment. That should keep Dalgety's progress in the right direction. Long-term investors will recall how the shares accurately charted the company's decline after the mid-1970s and are doubtless hoping for a return trip. In the meantime, the 7 per cent yield on the shares is sufficient compensation for the patience required of them.</p>

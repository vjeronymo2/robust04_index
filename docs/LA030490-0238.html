			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A GOOD COS  </P> <P> "The Cosby Show" on Feb. 12 featuring outtakes from the series was the funniest  30 minutes we have ever seen on TV. We can't imagine why all TV shows couldn't  do one yearly show of outtakes instead of one rerun. Come on, everyone --  follow Bill Cosby's lead.  </P> <P> Linda and Doug Delaney, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Riverside County joined four other counties in implementing state Proposition  90, which gives homeowners 55 or older a tax break by allowing them to transfer  the assessed value of a home they are selling to a new home in another county.  The county Board of Supervisors voted 4 to 1 for implementation after hearing  testimony from the California Assn. of Realtors, the American Assn. of Retired  Persons and other supporters. San Diego, Orange, Kern and San Mateo counties  have already voted to implement the measure, which was passed by 69% of the  voters statewide last November.  </P></p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Japan's ruling coalition fails to win backing for reforms Japan was plunged into political uncertainty yesterday when government plans to reform the electoral system and curb corruption failed to win a majority in the upper house of parliament. The setback, after an unexpectedly large number of defections from the ruling coalition, means Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, may now have little option but to agree to the less radical alternative to his four bills proposed by the opposition Liberal Democratic party. Mr Tsutumo Hata, the foreign minister and leader of the coalition's second-largest party, said: 'We're going to have to accept the opposition's plan. We can't let this run and run.' Failure to enact political reform would heighten public distrust of the political process and damage Japan's international image, said Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Nikkeiren employers' federation. Turmoil is expected next week on the Tokyo stock market, which had risen recently on hopes of government steps to boost the economy. Mr Hosokawa said he would do his utmost to push a version of the four bills through parliament by the end of the present session, January 29. He plans to convene, early next week, a joint committee of the upper and lower houses of parliament to negotiate a deal. 'I think there is room for compromise,' he said. But the chances of meeting the end of the month deadline are slim, meaning that Mr Hosokawa will face pressure to resign should his reforms fall. The vote is likely to provoke another realignment of political groups and delay economic measures urgently needed to pull Japan out of recession. Until yesterday, the government was planning to announce the measures early next week. Business leaders voiced dismay in spite of Mr Hosokawa's promise to publish the pump-priming measures 'as quickly as possible.' The upper house vote was to have been the final stage before the bills became law after their adoption by the lower house. However, 17 members of the Social Democratic party, the coalition's largest but least dependable partner, defied their leaders' instructions and voted against the government, driven by fears that the party would do worse under the proposed electoral system than under present rules. As a result, the government fell 12 votes short of a majority, by 130 votes to 118. Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the Socialist chairman, has hinted he will resign. The bills would scrap the present system of multi-seat constituencies for the lower house and establish a mixture of proportional representation and single-seat electoral districts. Donations to politicians would be banned. Political reform has been under discussion since the 1988 Recruit scandal, in which politicians received shares for favours.

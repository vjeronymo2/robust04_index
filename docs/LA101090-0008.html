			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAWYER IN LYNWOOD CASE ACCUSES BLOCK OF  SLANDER  </P> <P> A lawyer who filed a federal class-action lawsuit charging Lynwood deputies  with racially motivated brutality demanded Tuesday that Los Angeles County  Sheriff Sherman Block and one of his captains retract statements about the case  that he alleges were "bald-faced lies."  </P> <P> Attorney George Denny III filed an administrative claim with the county Board  of Supervisors against the county, Block and and Sheriff's Capt. Doug McClure  alleging personal injuries -- slander and defamation of character -- as a  result of statements the two lawmen allegedly made to the news media.  </P> <P> Denny is the lead attorney in a lawsuit filed in September in which 70  plaintiffs allege that the Sheriff's Department engaged in a wave of wanton  shootings, beatings and excessive force while working out of the Lynwood  station.  </P> <P> Denny alleges that Block said during  </P> <P> a news conference last month that only a single citizen's complaint had been  filed with the Sheriff's Department. However, Denny said that on April 30 he  sent the sheriff a six-page letter outlining problems at the Lynwood substation  and making complaints on behalf of six named and six unnamed people who appear  as plaintiffs. In a news conference Tuesday, Denny distributed copies of a May  23 letter from Block acknowledging receipt of the lawyer's correspondence.  </P> <P> Denny is also demanding that similar remarks made by McClure on a radio talk  show be retracted. He said that if retractions are made, he will drop the  county administrative claim.  </P> <P> A sheriff's spokesman said the department will issue a statement later this  week.

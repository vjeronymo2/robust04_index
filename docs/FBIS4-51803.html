			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 30 (YONHAP) -- Daewoo Shipbuilding and  Heavy Machinery, Ltd. delivered the nation's first submarine  "Ichon" to the Navy in a ceremony held at the company's Okpo  Shipyard near Pusan over the weekend, with chief of naval  operations Adm. Kim Hong-yol, Daewoo Vice Chairman Yun Yong-sok  and many other Navy and company officials attending, the company  announced.    The diesel engine-powered T-209-class submarine is armed  with  torpedoes and depth charges and can conduct independent  operations for two months with a crew of 30.    It can cruise at a maximum speed of 22 knots (40 kilometers  per hour), compared with North Korea's Whiskey- and Romeo-class  submarines cruising at 12 to 14 knots, the announcement said.    Daewoo started construction of the warship in November 1989,  using designs and technology of Germany's HDW, and completed it  in October 1992. The ship had been successfully test-operated  before the delivery to the Navy.</p>

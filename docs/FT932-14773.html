			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Three-month COPPER moved below Dollars 2,000 a tonne on the LME yesterday morning, stimulating waves of liquidation and putting other prices under pressure. Late bouts of bargain hunting and short covering cushioned the earlier sharp fall. Dealers said that further losses towards recent 5 1/2  year lows of Dollars 1,965 were likely, but should be punctuated by short covering rallies. Copper ended the kerb at Dollars 1,979, just above the low of Dollars 1,975. Three-month NICKEL fell below Dollars 6,000 a tonne, triggering sell-stops. The market drifted lower on sprees of commission house and merchant selling, before late short covering stemmed the fall. Three-month ZINC showed some resilience in the wake of copper's decline and looks poised to test levels above Dollars 1,030 a tonne. Three-month ALUMINIUM clawed back some of its earlier losses after encountering solid support near Dollars 1,130. On the London bullion market GOLD, SILVER and PLATINUM were softer across the board, but further gains could arise today as traders cover short positions ahead of any weekend developments in South Africa following the murder of black leader Chris Hani.

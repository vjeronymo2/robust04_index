			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Arts: Innovation, but only for the minority - Ten years on, Christopher Dunkley assesses the achievement of Channel 4 Channel 4 is 10 years old this week and the plaudits are pouring in from the mediacracy. 'It undoubtedly' (a give-away word meaning, I suspect this is an overstatement) 'changed the face of broadcasting', according to independent producer Sophie Balhetchet who made The Manageress and The Camomile Lawn for C4. Can you imagine any other British channel showing such drama? You can? All of them? Well, yes, perhaps so. 'Channel 4 has admirably fulfilled every hope we had for it', enthuses Anthony Smith, once editor of the BBC's 24 Hours and more responsible than anyone for shaping Channel 4's 'publisher' concept. Smith praises C4 for 'allowing all sorts of communities to have a greater stake in television . . . creating a following for things like American football'. Few of us in the TV4 Campaign in the 1970s would have guessed that one of the aims of our co-agitator was to bring American football to British screens, but you live and learn. Independent producer Michael Darlow maintains that the channel has done quite well: 'Things have been freed up and new people have got in'. Darlow, of course, worked for the BBC and ITV before working for C4. In the view of John Wyver, another independent, C4 'has immeasurably' - a bit like undoubtedly - 'enriched British broadcasting'. Mr Channel 4 himself, Jeremy Isaacs, who was Chief Executive for the first eight years, claims that 'Channel 4 made the case for hour-long news'. Of his successor, Michael Grade, he says 'I give him high marks for the position the channel is in. I wouldn't want to be doing his job now. I've done what I could there and I'm now doing what I can elsewhere. And I'm learning to garden', a reference, presumably, to Covent Garden, the opera house of which Mr Isaacs is now General Director. And Grade himself? What does he think about C4? 'Why should we change when things are going so well for us? We have a winning formula'. Since convention requires that for major anniversaries, as for funerals, we set aside our true feelings and offer only soft soap and bouquets, it might be argued that these panegyrics, all culled from recent broadsheet newspapers, are merely showpiece civilities for public consumption. Yet anybody who has followed the mediacracy's pronouncements about C4 over the years must doubt this. There has been widespread support for the claims made by C4's own personnel that the channel triumphantly fulfils its famous remit to encourage innovation and experiment and cater for tastes and interests not generally catered for by other channels, and that it wins about 10 per cent of the national audience. Both claims are true, but the implication that C4 wins its 10 per cent share by screening experimental or minority programmes is eyewash. Anyone who actually likes television and watches lots of it knows this. Channel 4 is where we turn for the best contemporary American comedies (Cheers, The Golden Girls), for serious news if we want it early in the evening, and for vintage series (TV Heaven, The Avengers, The Twilight Zone). The current BARB ratings show that The Top 20 programmes on C4 comprise five American comedies, five editions of a game show, three episodes of soap opera, three British sitcoms, one old American drama series, one repeat from a popular ITV drama series, one old movie, and one documentary (Animal Squad Undercover) which achieves an unexpectedly high place because it has a repeat within the week. Those, of course, are not the programmes which the mediacrats are talking about when they praise C4; there is not one which would look out of place on other channels. You do begin to wonder whether these people really watch television like ordinary viewers, or whether their ideas about C4 are formed more by the occasional whiz through a cassette and a lot of industry talk about the latest independent contracts. In the bar of the Groucho Club it is the programme description that really counts, not the fact that it will be transmitted to an uncaring world at lunchtime on a Saturday. It is worth remembering that one of Jeremy Isaacs' pet phrases when things became fraught at C4 was 'Come on, it's only television', which brought mock-wry smiles from the book-bred, cinema oriented mediacracy. Consider this evening's offerings from Channel 4: The Magic Roundabout: A French series brought to Britain 27 years ago by the BBC (repeat). Treasure Hunt: Copy of a French game show featuring frequent rear views of Anneka Rice in tight trousers (repeat). Channel 4 News: 50-minute early evening news copied (like every British TV news innovation for 30 years) from the US; sometimes nearly as good as BBC2's Newsnight. Comment: A real innovation; five minutes of personal opinion straight to camera. Brookside: Soap opera with an audience smaller than that for BBC1's much derided Eldorado. Anton Mosimann - Naturally: Old fashioned kitchen-bound cookery programme (repeat). Dispatches: Good current affairs series much like those on other channels. Short And Curlies: Worthy series of 10-minute films by new directors. The Golden Girls: American sitcom. Packing Them In: Embarrassingly poor variety show not saved by attempts to disguise an ancient format with backstage frolics. The Prisoner: Over-rated ITV 'cult' series made by Lew Grade in 1967 (repeat). The Steve Allen Show: Cheap black and white 1950s American variety show. The Best Of The Worst: Clips from American shows. Azaad: Hindi film, starting at 1.10 in the morning. Innovative? Experimental? Catering for minorities? Here and there, perhaps, in the nooks and crannies, for five or ten minutes in a six hour stretch. There is, however, one thing that should be said in defence of Michael Grade. The repeated suggestion that he is taking C4 down market and that this is shown by the large number of American imports merely proves again how little the mediacrats actually watch. It was under Isaacs that C4 pushed its American content up to a level above that of any channel in Europe; more than 30 per cent. My impression is that there are now rather fewer American programmes in prime time, though the over all proportion may remain much the same. So is there nothing good to be said about Channel 4? Several things. It had enormous influence in creating a British independent programme sector which now numbers 700 to 800 companies; historically this may prove to be C4's most significant achievement. It showed that you can put opinion straight on the screen. While others were looking iffy, it championed freedom of expression (Isaacs and Grade both showed personal courage and deserve our gratitude). Above all its occasionally inspiring, occasionally irritating policies have been powerfully influential in the development of BBC2 into the most impressive channel for the demanding viewer in this country and perhaps the world. No doubt this will be considered not merely a back-handed compliment but an insult, yet the point is a perfectly serious one. For 35 years Britain's broadcasting 'duopoly' has proved a remarkably benevolent structure with the commercial side frightening and inspiring the public service side to greater efforts at popularity, and the public service side shaming and challenging the commercial side to greater efforts at prestige. The highly beneficial effects of C4 on BBC2 may be the final chapter in that story. Come January 1993, with C4 selling its own advertising and the new ITV franchises in force, British commercial television could disappear into the market enterprise vortex just as the BBC turns its back to begin the trek to the Himalayan uplands of quality and worthiness. The old fight in the centre for popularity with quality may well be abandoned, to the detriment of good popular television.</p>

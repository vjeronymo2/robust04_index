			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Japanese output falls again JAPAN'S industrial output fell 1.3 per cent last month, the fourth decline in the past five months and the largest fall since July 1989, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said yesterday. The index, against the 1985 base of 100, stood at a seasonally adjusted 127.4 in March, while the inventory index rose 0.8 per cent to 113.2, the fifth monthly rise in succession. At the same time, the inflation rate rose to 3.3 per cent in the financial year to end March from 2.9 per cent in 1989. However, there was a fall in consumer prices in Tokyo. The capital's consumer price index, a leading indicator, rose an annual 3.3 per cent for April, down from 3.7 per cent in March and lower than had been expected. The Japanese government indicated yesterday it was determined to maintain a tight monetary policy, despite suggestions from Washington that lower interest rates would help the international economy. Japan's Finance Ministry said US pressure would make no difference to the country's monetary policy, which remains tight despite slower growth and signs that inflation has begun to fall. The Bank of Japan has been determined to cut money supply growth in an attempt to ease pressures arising from the speculative stock and land binges that were fuelled by easy credit in past years. The bank has also been concerned that the labour shortage would add to inflationary pressures. Mr Russell Jones, of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said the industrial production figures were very weak, while the decline in Tokyo's inflation rate should offer some comfort to government officials who feared a sharp increase in service sector costs. Japanese financial markets have expected that the Bank of Japan would lower the Official Discount Rate (ODR) from 6 per cent, but bank officials indicate that they want further heat removed from the economy before a rate cut. The central bank fears that a cut in the near future could prompt a return to speculative stock purchases and a more general overheating of the economy. Mr Masami Kogayu, the vice-minister of finance, said yesterday that hints from US President George Bush about the benefits of an ODR cut would not influence monetary policy. US and Japanese trade officials yesterday suspended negotiations on foreign access to Japan's semiconductor market after they failed to settle a dispute over the wording on a market share target. Tokyo has agreed to a target of 20 per cent for foreign chips, but does not want the figure to set a precedent for market share targets in other areas, and so wants vague wording. The US wants more precise wording.</p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Director disqualification cases almost double The number of disqualification proceedings against company directors almost doubled between the second quarter of last year and the same period this year, official statistics showed yesterday. However the number of disqualification orders made by the courts against directors almost halved over the same period. The Insolvency Service, an agency in the Department of Trade and Industry, launched proceedings against 170 directors between April and June this year, compared with 91 in the same period last year. The number of disqualification orders fell from 126 to 66. The DTI said it had no control over the decisions taken by the courts. 'We can take prosecutions to court but we can't make the judge convict them,' it said last night. It said the increase in the number of reports and proceedings reflected the response to a report from the National Audit Office, the Whitehall watchdog, last year, which criticised the failure to pursue more directors. Since then the Insolvency Service has hired temporary staff, arranged special procedures to clear a backlog of reports, and started to put more pressure on insolvency practitioners to file reports. In the second quarter of this year 75 proceedings were launched based on reports from official receivers in companies ordered to be wound up by the courts, compared with 20 in the same period last year.</p>

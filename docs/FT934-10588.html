			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: Molson edges ahead in second quarter MOLSON, the international brewing, special chemicals and hardware retailing group, saw profits edge ahead in the second quarter. The group saw its domestic market share slip as a result of aggressive pricing in the discount beer sector. The group's first half results were flat. It said, however, that Molson Breweries remained the market leader in Canada and was fighting back with new products and expansion in the US. Profit for the September quarter was CDollars 37.2m (USDollars 28.5m), or 63 cents a share, against CDollars 36.4m, or 60 cents, a year earlier on revenues which fell to CDollars 769m from CDollars 811m. First half profit was CDollars 74m, or CDollars 1.25, against CDollars 74.8m, or CDollars 1.26, on revenues which slipped to CDollars 1.54bn from CDollars 1.6bnTotal domestic beer sales rose just under 1 per cent in the first half, but Molson's market share slipped to 48.6 per cent from 50 per cent. The company retaliated with new low-price plans and says it has more new products on the way. The group's share of brewing profits in the first half was CDollars 74m, down 24 per cent, mainly due to the deal with Miller Brewing of the US which this year took a stake in Molson Breweries. Molson's chemical businesses improved and retailing performed well. In specialty chemicals, Diversey's operating profit rose 12 per cent to CDollars 43.2m in the first half on sales of CDollars 681m, up 3 per cent. European operations were strong, except in Spain. US cleaning chemicals were marginally profitable, against a loss last year, but Canadian operations improved significantly and Latin America and Asia Pacific also strengthened. Malsham, the retailing group, posted sales up 15 per cent, and operating profits of CDollars 19.3m against CDollars 92m. The new megastores were performing well.</p>

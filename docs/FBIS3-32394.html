When referring to the presence of U.S. troops in Juan Chaco,  Ernesto Samper Pizano said President Cesar Gaviria allowed the  U.S. Government to pull a fast one on him. During a visit to  Buenaventura in Valle del Cauca Department, Samper said the  gringos are better tourists than builders of schools, and he  added that, if elected president of Colombia, he would not allow  the nation's sovereignty to be violated in this way.    [Begin Samper recording] We do not need foreign soldiers to  build schools or roads, much less in this region where we have  twice as much unemployment as the rest of the country. What we  need are public works projects that put our own people to work.  I believe the U.S. Government or the Defense Ministry has  pulled a fast one on President Gaviria. [end recording]    Samper also said there is a need to integrate the Pacific  region into the nation's development plans.</p>

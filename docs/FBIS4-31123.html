			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, June 2 -- The government of the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia on Thursday instructed its Foreign  Ministry to renew proposals to Albania for dialogue at the level  of foreign ministers, the Foreign Ministry in Belgrade  announced. So far Albania has rejected both dialogue at the  ministerial level and bilateral contacts of the two countries'  experts, even in spheres such as environmental issues.    Albania supports the separatist ethnic Albanian movement in  Serbia's Kosovo province whose leaders have illegally proclaimed  the "Kosovo Republic" and advocate its secession from Serbia and  Yugoslavia and annexation with Albania. Albania is the only  country to recognize the "Kosovo Republic."</p>

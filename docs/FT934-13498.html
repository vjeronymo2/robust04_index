			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / UK Company News: WH Smith may alter share structure WH SMITH, the retail and distribution group, is considering the introduction of a single class of ordinary share. Sir Simon Hornby, chairman, told the annual meeting that the board was 'aware of recent moves by companies with differential voting capital to enfranchise such capital into one class of shares'. Smith has 139m B shares, each with a nominal value of 10p and a single vote, and 244m A shares, which have a nominal value of 50p and one vote. The effect is that holders of the B shares have 36 per cent of the company votes, but only 10 per cent of the equity. This structure has been in place since the company was incorporated in 1949, when it gave Smith family members effective control of the company. The B shares would normally be expected to trade at a premium to reflect their voting power. Smith B shares reached a 20 per cent premium in the mid 1980s, but in recent years have traded at a discount to the A shares. Some observers suggest that the reason for this could be that no-one expected enfranchisement to come under serious consideration. Two-tier voting is increasingly being seen as anachronistic. Other companies that had similar structures, including Great Universal Stores and Austin Reed, have recently been enfranchising their shareholders. On Tuesday Hammerson, the international property group, unveiled details of its reforms, while earlier this month Whitbread announced plans to reform its 45-year-old share structure to give equal rights to all shareholders. Smith A shares closed yesterday at 479p, up 9p on the day. The B shares rose 6p to 98p, giving them a 2.3 per cent premium over the A shares. See People</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Chalker coy of making aid commitment MRS Lynda Chalker, the UK's minister for overseas development, refused yesterday to give a timetable for increasing Britain's overseas aid to levels in line with other European Community countries. British overseas aid in 1990 was 0.27 per cent of gross domestic product, against an average of 0.5 per cent of EC countries, and a United Nations target of 0.7 per cent agreed by the UK in 1974. Mrs Chalker told a press conference that any increase in aid 'depends upon growth in this country (the UK)', but added that current British aid was of a higher quality than that of many donor nations. Mrs Chalker urged the EC to work the criteria of good government - sound economic policies, competent and accountable management, and respect for human rights - into its dialogue with developing countries.</p>

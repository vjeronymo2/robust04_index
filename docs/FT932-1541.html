			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / ACT creates leading software group with BIS purchase ACT, the Birmingham-based computing services company, yesterday agreed to pay Pounds 93.5m for BIS Group, a UK subsidiary of the Nynex Worldwide Services Group. The deal will create the largest UK-owned computing services and software company with annual sales of more than Pounds 250m and one of the world's largest suppliers of financial software. BIS is a software and services company best known for the 'Midas' software package used by several hundred banks worldwide. Nynex, a US telecommunications company with revenues last year of Dollars 13.2bn (Pounds 8.8bn), acquired BIS for Pounds 75m in 1987. It said yesterday that it expected to recognise a book gain on the transaction. The disposal reflects Nynex's decision to concentrate on its telecommunications interests. Mr Fred Salemo, president of the Worldwide Services Group, said the ACT deal was: 'Good for BIS and good for Nynex.' Mr Roger Foster, BIS chairman, said the negotiations had been tough, but he was satisfied with the price. The cash payment will be partly funded by a 4-for-13 rights issue, at 123p a share, to raise Pounds 50.9m. The issue is fully underwritten by Barclays de Zoete Wedd. The rest will come from ACT's own resources. The group - formerly Apricot Computers - had net cash of about Pounds 25m at its year-end in March. About Pounds 25m of the payment will be deferred. It will be handed over in two equal tranches six and 12 months after completion. The deal reverses the trend of recent years where UK computing services companies have been sold to buyers either in the US or mainland Europe. EDS of the US, for example, bought SD-Scicon, while Cap Gemini Sogeti of France bought Hoskyns. ACT has been growing rapidly through acquisition, chiefly of financial services companies. ACT and BIS are rare among European computer companies in successfully selling packaged software internationally. The deal and rights issue will be put to ACT's shareholders on July 8. ACT's share price shed 2p to close at 153p yesterday. Details, Page 27</p>

			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BATTERYMATES TRY TO SPARK 1 MORE WIN;  </P> <P> PREP BASEBALL: CHATSWORTH'S MCMACKIN AND MANCUSO LEAD WEST TEAM INTO ALL-STAR  GAME.  </P> <P> Some would call it a love-hate relationship. One inning, the two are at each  other's throat, arguing about everything from pitch selection to mound  mechanics. A few minutes later, the thunderclouds part and dispositions are  sunny.  </P> <P> Chatsworth High pitcher Reed McMackin and catcher Mike Mancuso, who steered the  team to the City Section 4-A Division championship two weeks ago, are sometimes  at their best when they are at their worst.  </P> <P> "They remind me of brothers," Chatsworth Coach Tom Meusborn said. "But I think  they help fire each other up."  </P> <P> The two will try to light a fire under their West teammates in today's Daily  News all-star baseball game at Cal State Northridge at 4:15 p.m.  </P> <P> Preceding the baseball game is the Daily News all-star softball game, scheduled  for a 2:15 p.m. start at Northridge.  </P> <P> McMackin, selected the City 4-A co-Player of the Year along with Pat Treend of  El Camino Real, is part of a formidable West pitching staff that includes Mike  Eby of Westlake, Pat Bennett of Crespi, and Ryan McGuire and Treend of El  Camino Real. The five were a combined 51-5 this season.  </P> <P> The West outfield features three players -- Garret Anderson of Kennedy, Pat  Bryant of Cleveland and Danny Larson of Birmingham -- who were selected in the  first four rounds of the recent baseball amateur draft.  </P> <P> The East boasts seven players who were selected to The Times' All-Valley team.  Stanford-bound Andrew Lorraine (9-0 with an earned-run average of 0.79) and San  Fernando's John Najar (5-2, 2.05) lead the pitching corps.  </P> <P> The East also will be solid up the middle behind shortstop Robby Davis (.451  average, 26 runs batted in) and second baseman Lance Migita (.434, 30 RBIs) of  Hart and Saugus catcher J. B. Johnson (.425, 30 RBIs), all of whom were Times  All-Valley selections.  </P> <P> Keyaan Cook of Montclair Prep, the Southern Section 1-A Division Player of the  Year and an All-Valley pick, batted .551 with 33 RBIs and can play today at  first base, shortstop or in the outfield. Third baseman Kendial Armstrong of  Quartz Hill, who batted .420 with 32 RBIs, is another Times All-Valley  selection.  </P> <P> The East team is coached by Jerry Cord of Poly and Tom Moran of St. Francis.  </P> <P> West coaches are Rich Herrera of Westlake and Mike Maio of El Camino Real.  </P></p>

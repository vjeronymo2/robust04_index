			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Boiler shutdown 'led to Braer disaster' A BOILER shutdown on the tanker Braer for 'routine adjustment' led to the ship breaking down and going aground in violent seas in the Shetland islands earlier this month. In his first detailed public statement on the disaster, Mr Michael Hudner, chief executive of B&amp;H Ship Management, the US operator of the Liberian-registered vessel, defends the competence of the tanker's Greek captain and his largely Filipino crew. The ship had been passed as sound in a number of outside inspections. He also defends the choice of route taking the Braer through the 25-mile channel between Shetland and Fair Isle on its voyage from Norway to Canada. Other routes were 'less attractive from the standpoint of safety and navigation'. Mr Hudner says the boiler, shut down before midnight on January 4, more than 12 hours before the stranding at 11.20am on January 5, could not be re-ignited and therefore ceased to warm the heavy fuel oil used in the main engine. This made a switch to diesel oil necessary just after midnight. Although the diesel oil used by the main engine was automatically purified, the diesel required to fuel the boiler and power the ship's generators was found to be contaminated with seawater. This had apparently entered through the diesel tank's air vents, which may have been damaged by some steel pipes being carried on board, Mr Hudner says. After further efforts to remove the water and reignite the boiler failed, the master decided to seek shelter and at 4.36am the Braer, now 10 miles south of Sumburgh Head, changed course for the Moray Firth. The ship then lost propulsion from the main engine and the generators failed. He says the Braer contacted the coastguard at about 5am but did not request the assistance of a tug, the master calculating that it would slowly drift clear of land. The captain was later advised by the RAF and the coastguards to allow the evacuation of the crew by helicopter because the ship was in danger of going aground and causing an explosion.</p>

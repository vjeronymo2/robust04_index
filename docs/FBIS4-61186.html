			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Riga Radio Riga Network in Latvian at  0900 GMT on 3 May carries a live interview with Prime Minister  Valdis Birkavs by an unnamed correspondent from the Riga Radio  studio.    [Correspondent] "I will ask you several questions. First of  all, on the agreements that were recently signed in Moscow, on  the agreements between Latvia and Russia that are linked to the  withdrawal of the Russian Army, perhaps such a general issue  and then more specific ones will follow.    "At a news conference immediately after returning from  Moscow, you and [President] Mr. Ulmanis stressed that Latvian  representatives had signed agreements with a new democratic  Russia. However, that Russia is only one small part of Russia,  which currently can influence the policy of neighboring  countries only to a certain extent. Everything may change and  turn upside down there. Not all the Latvian people support the  agreements signed by the government and the state president.  With this there is a feeling that the weight of these  agreements is not very great and there is certain instability in  the two states and perhaps one should not fully take them into  account as particularly important documents. How do you respond  this?"    [Birkavs] "The idea that the situation is not stable in  Russia is included in the question quite correctly. That is  exactly why the agreements give me the guarantee of stable  relations with Russia, irrespective of what events follow in  Russia. That gives the guarantee that under control of the  world public, the Army will be withdrawn, the Skrunda radar  station will be dismantled, and it will be possible with the  help of foreign money and under international control to  repatriate the military pensioners. This is where the meaning  and significance of the agreements lies.    "I think there is not and has not been an unequivocal  attitude toward the agreements in Latvia. I understand very  well and support this activity of the people. Sociological  studies show that approximately 15 percent of all the people in  Latvia are completely and categorically against the agreements.  These people also have their own considerations; it is  necessary to talk to them, to explain to them. However, history  will evidently give the fairest assessment of the significance  of these agreements."    [Correspondent] "Yes, that is an international aspect and  that is also your responsibility, which you already stressed at  the news conference on 1 May. That is your responsibility.    "So then, can you explain -- I do not know in how much  detail  you can do it now -- but what will be the control mechanism over  the Army withdrawal? How will the repatriation of the military  take place? What controls will there be so that we, reporters  and representatives of the press, will also be able to follow  closely these processes? Who will be responsible for that? I  understand that the control mechanism and the range of people  involved in it should be rather wide."    [Birkavs] "The most significant control mechanisms are  provided by the agreements themselves. You stressed very  correctly that, in order for reporters to be able to follow the  progress of the withdrawal, and to tell the truth, it is  necessary to give all the people the opportunity to follow the  progress of the withdrawal. First of all, we will publish the  withdrawal timetable. We are currently working so that  ministries and local governments are instructed to follow the  progress of withdrawal at a local level. We will also provide  the assistance necessary for the army to be withdrawn from here  possibly quicker.    "As far as repatriation is concerned, money collection is  currently under way for this purpose. At a government session  today, we will approve the board of the repatriation fund and a  corresponding mechanism. Mechanisms have to be created here.  You very correctly understood that the idea of repatriation has  not perhaps been completely worked out legally. However, this  is the first time that Russia at last has agreed to call its  sons and daughters back home. Before, they had only been  speaking of people of Russian nationality being in the near  abroad and other countries and that they would protect their  human rights. The situation has changed and the Russian side  will also actively promote repatriation."    After this the correspondent suggests that the Russian  military personnel will be withdrawn, but their families will be  left behind and then the former military will come back to  reunite with their families. She asks whether it will be really  possible to control this process and whose responsibility it  will be. Birkavs says:    [Birkavs] "The repatriation will be together with families  and when we begin to divide the money -- there is already real  money in the repatriation fund -- then we will give priority,  and I have stressed it everywhere and such is my agreement with  Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar, that discharged officers  under the age of 50 and under the age of 60 [as heard] have to  be repatriated first. Then they will need entry visas to be  able to return to Latvia. That is a very simple,  internationally recognized, and well regulated control  mechanism. Therefore, one should not be afraid of it, but it is  very necessary to exercise strict control."    The correspondent then asks Prime Minister Birkavs about the  possibility of monitoring what goes on inside the Skrunda radar  station, which has been impossible even for the Bureau for  Monitoring the Withdrawal of the Russian Army.    [Birkavs] "Well, 599 military personnel, and 199 service  personnel: That is the amount that can be located at Skrunda.  That can be monitored simply and easily enough. Besides,  considering that the guarding and monitoring is up to us, these  we can monitor, and anyway, if any discussions or differences  arise, a mechanism has also been created for taking up these  discussions and differences."    Birkavs adds he is satisfied no new troops could be brought  in.    [Correspondent] "About the treaty, I think the listeners  too will be perhaps asking more detailed questions, but I am  still interested in the government's current stability. Last  week the Saeima, the Saeima deputies voted, you could say, for  confidence in the government, although among the voters were the  ministers themselves. Of course, they would not vote against  confidence in themselves, so this vote can be viewed variously.  And, as far as the nationalist forces have announced, they are  forming, quite seriously forming recently, alternative  government structures. How does that affect the current work of  the government?"    [Birkavs] "Firstly I would like to say that the vote of  confidence in the government was requested by me personally,  because it is very difficult to work in circumstances where  there is no confidence in the government. If all the deputies  of the Latvian Way and the Peasants' Union had been at the  plenary session, then in fact, the result of the vote would have  been 60 or 61 votes. Let me remind you that when this  government was accepted, we had only 54 supporters. So in fact,  the number of supporters of the government in parliament has  grown. The ministers voted for themselves, yes. If they had  abstained, then only deputies who have claims to ministerial  posts would have to abstain, as they become interested in taking  on these posts, so ethically they would not vote for them."    Birkavs adds that he challenges this shadow cabinet to come  out more openly, and he welcomes its formation.</p>

Fujimori, in brief statements to the press, said his  country could no longer tolerate attacks by the fundamentalist  Maoist group; therefore he implemented severe measures, like the  so-called "self-coup" in April 1992, when he dissolved Congress  and assumed extraordinary powers.    "What country in the world would accept 25,000 deaths  (number  of victims caused by political violence in Peru since 1980)? No  developed country would have allowed this. That is why we took  the appropriate measures; some of them were tough, but  effective," the president said.    The Peruvian president, who arrived in Santa Fe de Bogota  this morning and met at noon with his Colombian colleague Cesar  Gaviria, said his visit shows the good relations between the two  countries.    According to Narino House sources, Gaviria and Fujimori  discussed basic topics like the fight against the  drug-trafficking mafia and communist guerrilla groups, as well  as the results of the Peruvian-Colombian Joint Commission to  protect the Amazon jungle at their first meeting.    After speaking with Gaviria, Fujimori met for a few minutes  with Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin and laid a wreath at the  statue of Liberator Simon Bolivar, located in the historic  central plaza surrounded by the Congress and Bogota's main  Cathedral.    Tomorrow, Fujimori will explain to Colombian businessmen the  measures he has adopted to internationalize the Peruvian economy  to attract foreign capital.    Fujimori arrived in Colombia accompanied by Prime Minister  Alfonso Bustamante, Foreign Minister Efrain Goldenberg, Health  Minister Jaime Freundt-Thurne, Fisheries Minister Jaime Sobero,  and several ruling party congressmen and businessmen.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>   [Excerpt] Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich, head of the  Israeli delegation to the talks with Syria, has been holding  secret talks with Walid al-Mu'allim, Syria's ambassador in  Washington, with the aim of furthering the peace negotiations  between the two states. The meetings between the two ambassadors  were held parallel to the official rounds of talks between the  two states in Washington and in between rounds.    The meetings were attended by senior officials from the U.S.  State Department dealing with the peace process. Some of the  meetings were held at the home of Edward Djerejian when he was  assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs. Dennis  Ross, head of the American peace team, participated in some of  the meetings.    When Rabinovich took up his post as ambassador in Washington  in early 1993, Jerusalem hoped he would maintain a secret track  with his counterpart, Ambassador Mu'allim, who was seen as more  flexible and possessing more contacts with the Syrian top  echelon than Muwaffaq al-'Allaf, head of the Syrian delegation  to the bilateral peace talks.    Political sources in Jerusalem said yesterday that they  believe that the Rabinovich-Mu'allim talks did not make much  progress since neither received sufficient room to maneuver from  their masters -- Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Syrian  President Hafiz al-Asad. Nevertheless, the secret track is used  to transmit messages between Jerusalem and Damascus and to  assist in clarifying matters in the formal talks. [passage  omitted]</p>

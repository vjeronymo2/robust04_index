			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: UK bank chief aims for pound target BRITAIN may need to institute some measure of targeting for the pound, even while the currency is outside the European exchange rate mechanism, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, hinted yesterday. Speaking in London, he also warned that countries such as the UK with large budget deficits would have little room to speed growth through looser fiscal policies. He indicated that much of the world was looking to Germany to cut interest rates in the coming months as a way of helping international recovery. Mr Leigh-Pemberton said that while Britain no longer needed to keep the pound within set limits of other European currencies, it remained dependent on the economies of other developed nations. The pound's suspension from the ERM 'does not mean that the exchange rate does not have a profound impact on (Britain's) economic fortunes'. As a result, the continuing need to bear down on inflation meant the UK 'cannot afford to ignore' the sterling's level against important currencies. However, Mr Leigh-Pemberton gave no details about what, if any, form of targeting of the exchange rate the bank would like to see Britain adopt. His speech was seen as repeating the broad line set by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that the UK would continue to monitor sterling. With much of the world in economic slowdown, there were many demands for a fiscal loosening in specific countries to bolster demand. But in many nations the 'room for manoeuvre is limited' because of large public sector borrowing requirements built up during economic expansion in the 1980s. The governor warned: 'Those countries with severe deficits need to pursue budgetary consolidation vigorously.' That passage was taken as having specific reference to Britain which is likely this financial year to have a PSBR of more than Pounds 30bn, or roughly 5 per cent of gross domestic product. Mr Leigh-Pemberton also indicated that a cut in German interest rates would help the prospects of world growth. He said: '(Monetary) relaxation by countries with strong currencies and a satisfactory prices performance, such as Germany, is most likely to have positive international spillover effects.'</p>

He would "fight" for this, Kohl said today during an  interview with the private television station SAT1. He intended  to conduct and win an "intensive and highly committed election  campaign." Kohl added he was "not particularly impressed" by  poor opinion poll results. "The election will be decided on  polling day," he said.</p>

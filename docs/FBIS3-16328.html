			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Chisinau, 14 Mar -- The Agrarian Democratic Party of  Moldova, headed by Petru Lucinschi, won a convincing victory in  the first parliamentary elections held in the country on a  multiparty basis. Lucinschi's party received 43.18 percent of  the votes, Nicolae Timofti, the chairman of the Central  Electoral Commission, told a news conference here today.    After the Agrarian Democratic Party comes the Socialist  Party  and the Yedinstvo Intermovement bloc supported by the Russian  speaking- population, which received the votes of 22 percent of  the electorate.    Parties calling for unification with Romania -- the  Christian  Democratic People's Front [7.5 percent of the votes] and the  Intelligentsia and Peasants bloc, headed by Former Parliamentary  Speaker Aleksandru Mosanu, that broke away from it [9.21  percent] were defeated. The remaining nine parties and 20  independent candidates were unable to cross the four percent  barrier and did not get into the new parliament. Their votes  will be divided up among the winners.    Thus, the Agrarian Democratic party receives 56 of the 104  seats in the new parliament and can form the new government  independently.    There will be two political camps poles apart: Those who  favor independence and Moldova's participation in the CIS (84  mandates) and the unionist minority (20 mandates).    It is expected that Petru Lucinschi will be the new speaker,  and current Prime Minister Andrey Sangheli will be instructed to  form the government. It is also likely that deputies will  ratify the CIS agreements signed by Mircea Snegur, and will  begin talks on settling the conflicts with Komrat and Tiraspol  [breakaway Gagauz and Dniester Republics respectively].    In the opinion of observers from the UN, the CSCE, NATO, and  a number of states, the elections in Moldova were well-organized  and democratic.</p>

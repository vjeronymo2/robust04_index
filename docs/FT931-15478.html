			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Geevor's future in balance as benefactor fails GEEVOR, the UK mining company with an 85-year history, has seen its main hopes of survival collapse with AF Budge, the privately-owned civil engineering group which was forced into re- ceivership by its banks last month. Budge provided Pounds 330,000 with no strings attached during the past year to keep Geevor afloat. The companies were working on a scheme to inject Budge's North American gold, silver and coal mining assets into Geevor, which began as a Cornish tin mining company. Geevor was nearly killed off in 1991 when the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce withdrew banking facilities in controversial circum- stances. Some Geevor shareholders took up Pounds 1.25m of loan notes shortly afterwards, partly so the company could pursue the bank through the courts. Geevor's Stock Exchange quotation was suspended in January last year and its advisers, Smith New Court, still hope that another company will be interested in it as 'a relatively clean shell'. Mr Richard Osmond of SNC said yesterday two companies were showing interest. 'Geevor has some very supportive shareholders - they have put up money three times in the past two years with very little to show for it - and it has some tax losses to offer.' He said it would be preferable if a company with mining-related interests took over because many of Geevor's institutional shareholders held the equity in mining funds. Geevor disposed of its Cornish tin mine some time ago and it had been closed down previously. Its present assets, gold interests in Costa Rica and the Mainband colliery in the UK, are not being operated. Mr Mark Wellesley-Wood, the former chairman, said yesterday Geevor still owed money to its advisers and auditors, but all trade creditors had been paid.</p>

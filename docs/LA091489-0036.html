			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  BACK TO BASICS: GETTING THAT CAKE DONE RIGHT  </P> <P> Temperature, pan placement and timing are all-important factors when baking  cakes. Unless you are certain the oven you are using is calibrated correctly,  use a supplementary oven thermometer. A temperature of 375 degrees is typically  used when baking shortened cakes.  </P> <P> Place cake pans on the center rack in a preheated oven. They should not touch  each other and there should be at least one inch between the pans and oven  walls to allow for even heat circulation (Step 1).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Positioning for Small Ovens  </P> <P> In very small ovens it may be necessary to place the pans on two racks. These  racks should be placed in the middle third of the oven with enough space in  between for the cake on the lower rack to rise.  </P> <P> Position the cake pans so they are not directly over each other (Step 2). In  this configuration, the pans may need to be turned a few times to promote even  baking.  </P> <P> Begin testing for doneness five minutes before the specified baking time has  elapsed, or when the lower time of a baking range (such as 25 to 30 minutes)  has been reached. There are two tests for doneness:  </P> <P> Insert a wood pick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean and dry  (Step 3) -- with no batter or crumbs clinging to it -- the cake is done.  </P> <P> You may also lightly touch the top of the cake with your finger (Step 4). If  properly baked, the cake should spring back, leaving no imprint.  </P> <P> Once baked, remove cakes from the oven and cool in the pans on wire racks that  allow air to circulate underneath. Cakes are ready to be removed from the pans  when the bottoms feel just warm to the touch.  </P> <P> Run a spatula around the sides of the cake to release it from the pan, then  invert the cake onto a plate or wire rack covered with a kitchen towel. Peel  the parchment or wax paper away from the bottom of the layer.  </P> <P> Place another wire rack over the bottom of the cake and invert the rack and  cake again so that the bottom of the cake is resting on the rack. Let the cake  cool completely in this position.  </P> <P> Properly prepared shortened cakes should have a fine texture, pleasing flavor  and good volume. The texture should be uniform, with no "tunneling" through the  body of the cake. The crust should be gently rounded and, in the case of a  white or yellow cake, golden brown.  </P></p>

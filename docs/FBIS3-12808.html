			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following review of the 1 March  issue of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Writers React to Ibrahimi Mosque Massacre    2. Enlightenment Convoy Discusses Hebron Massacre,  Satellite    Dish    3. Al-Azhar Students Denounce Hebron Massacre, Demand  Israeli    Ambassador's Expulsion    4. Grand Imam Urges Youth To Seek Knowledge    5. Seminar Discusses Extremism, Conflict With West  <H5>  WRITERS REACT TO IBRAHIMI MOSQUE MASSACRE </H5>   The 1 March edition of the state-owned religious weekly  'AQIDATI features several articles, commentaries, and reports  that react to the "Ibrahimi Mosque massacre" and its  repercussions.    In his 350-word column on page 1, Chairman of the Board  Samir  Rajab says he refuses to believe that the Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre was committed by an individual or group of individuals.  "It is an entangled conspiracy that involves several powers,  including Israel's Army in its entirety as well as its  government, because, unfortunately, they do not want this nation  to advance or flourish," he argues.    Noting that U.S. and NATO threats were heard only after  everything was lost in Muslim Bosnia-Herzegovina, Rajab affirms  that the same thing will happen to the Palestinians, "unless  positive international protection is provided for them through  firm, effective, and rigid measures." He suggests that the lack  of Arab and Islamic solidarity will further aggravate things  and, admitting that "peace is essential," emphasizes that this  peace must be based on justice. He warns that "any aggression  against Islam will lead to a very severe and violent reaction."    Basyuni al-Halwani's 400-word column on page 6 contends that  the massacre proves to the world that "God's chosen people are  the most deceptive and treacherous and they break promises." He  hopes the states that defend Israeli terrorism and back their  crimes would "review their biased policy, abandon their support  for injustice and aggression, and turn over a new leaf on Muslim  issues" by dealing fairly with them.    Al-Halwani believes it is unlikely that the culprits will  get  their fair share of punishment, despite the growing world anger.  Citing the Bosnian example in this context, he remarks: "The  world tolerates and encourages Jews to commit their crimes, as  long as these crimes are being committed against Muslims."    He wonders whether Muslims will suffice themselves with  condemnation and denunciation after the massacre or will "wake  up, quit their differences and imaginative battles," and adopt  firmer decisions. He appeals to Muslims to "wake up before it  is too late," contending that Muslim blood has become "the  cheapest on earth."    Majdi Salim's 400-word article on page 10 views the issue in  another perspective, picturing the world as a "chessboard"  controlled by "a single, very skillful player"--the United  States.    Simplifying his idea, Salim writes: The "first act of the  world farce" opened with the "Serbian barbarians'" bombardment  of the market place in Sarajevo. The West threatened, the  Islamic world denounced and condemned, and NATO addressed an  ultimatum to the Serbs, he says.    The "second act" was opened by Russia, "which is now begging  from America." Redeploying the Serbian troops, Russia compelled  the West not to launch an air strike against Serbs, he says.    Still in the second act, Salim writes that a Jewish  terrorist  committed a heinous crime in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. The  writer states: "The chess player who moves the pieces wants to  close the second act of the farce without harming genuine world  terrorism and its architect, the state with the six-sided star,"  he writes.    "The skillful player begins the third act of the farce by  offering a toy to Muslims to play with, forget the Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre, and hail the civilized West, which carried out  its threat and shot down four Serbian planes as they were  bombarding Muslims in Sarajevo," Salim concludes.    In a 150-word commentary on page 20, 'Adil Dayf writes that  the massacre came as no surprise to those who follow "the  Israelis' criminal history." Emphasizing that "these criminals  must be isolated completely, surrounded, abandoned, and punished  severely," he stresses that "sanctions must involve the Israeli  Government, which encourages such crimes against Muslims." He  warns that failure to punish the criminals will encourage the  recurrence of crimes.    Ashraf Abu-al-Hawl's 300-word article on page 20 contends  that "no matter how many decisions are taken to disarm the  extremist settlers, the Israeli Government will be unable to  stop Zionist massacres, since it is very easy for the crazy  murderers who believe in the supremacy of the Jewish race to  conceal weapons."    Recalling that the intifadah ensued following a similar  massacre by the settlers in Gaza in December 1987, Abu-al-Hawl  states: "There will be no peace between the Palestinians and  Israelis unless the Zionist settlements are totally removed."    A 250-word commentary by Ibrahim Nasr on page 23 claims the  Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is only "a link in the chain of  notorious massacres committed once in a while--after accurate  calculations and at set times--to determine the extent to which  the cold parts of the Arab nation's body will heat up."    He remarks that it is "no longer acceptable to hear the  phrase `land for peace' with Israel, since Israel owns the land  through occupation and controls its people." What war does  Israel fear now that it has made real peace with the heart of  the Arab nation and its long arm?, he asks.    Doubting that the intifadah can shake Israel, he notes that  Israeli media try to present the issue in this light to justify  the criminal acts.    Al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf opens his 500-word column on page 24  with the remark: "How cheap Muslim blood has become." Claiming  inaction by the "new world order" over the killing of dozens of  Muslims in Sarajevo by "the Serbian pigs," he refers to a "new  crime in the long chain of Zionist crimes against Arabs in  general and Palestinians in particular."    He contends that the principles and strategies that govern  the Israeli mentality have not changed since the state of Israel  was established almost 50 ago.    "Unless this mentality is changed, the reality will not  change, the bloody incidents will not stop, the file of violence  and terrorism will not be closed, and real peace will not be  established for either Arabs or Israelis," he says. He adds  that the Israeli mentality will not change unless Arabs develop  the ability to refuse and to act. "Until this happens, Muslim  blood will remain cheap," he concludes.  <H3>  ENLIGHTENMENT CONVOY DISCUSSES HEBRON MASSACRE, SATELLITE  DISH </H3>   Muhammad al-Abnudi reports on the "enlightenment convoy"  that  the Awqaf minister leads around the Republic. In a 700-word  report on page 2, al-Abnudi writes that scholars and lecturers  affirmed in their meeting with the masses in al-Sharqiyah  Governorate that the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is "a mark of  disgrace on the forehead of the Islamic nation and proof to  everyone that terrorist operations are not launched by Muslims  as the West claims."    The report adds that the masses denounced this vicious  aggression and stressed the need to support Jerusalem's Muslims  and give top priority to finding solutions for the problems.    The report adds that the meeting discussed other issues,  including Egypt's stance on the massacres to which Bosnian  Muslims are being subjected. Asked about Egypt's role in this  connection, Cairo University President Dr. Mufid Shihab  highlights that "Egypt needs domestic stability to play its role  best."    The meeting raised the issue of the Western media and  receiving programs by satellite dish. Asked about this, Amin  Basyuni, Radio and Television Union chairman, remarks: "The  problem does not lie in the dish but in how we handle it, since  we cannot isolate ourselves from the world." He believes that  there is no alternative for building "a strong, Muslim, Egyptian  man" who can distinguish right from wrong.  <H5>  AL-AZHAR STUDENTS DENOUNCE MASSACRE, DEMAND ISRAELI </H5>   AMBASSADOR'S EXPULSION    A 100-word report on page 3 says that over 10,000 students  in  al- Azhar University staged "a peaceful demonstration" on 27  February to denounce the Hebron massacre.    The report adds that "a statement by the student union  condemned the incident and demanded the expulsion of the Israeli  ambassador."  <H5>  GRAND IMAM URGES YOUTH TO SEEK KNOWLEDGE </H5>   In the 3d of a series of articles, al-Azhar Grand Imam  Shaykh  Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq urges youth to seek knowledge and  use it to enhance their nation's strength and lead it to  progress. In his 1,000-word article on page 3, he cites  examples from Islamic history to show that the Islamic nation  has always respected its knowledgeable and pious youth.  <H5>  SEMINAR DISCUSSES EXTREMISM, CONFLICT WITH THE WEST </H5>   A 3,000-word report on page 4 gives an account of a seminar  'AQIDATI organized in the Flying Institute in al-Sharqiyah under  the banner "Ramadan, the Month of Mercy and Sympathy."    Speaking at the seminar, Chief Editor al-Sayyid  'Abd-al-Ra'uf  is cited affirming that Egypt is "in good shape" and that  "extremism is an exception."    Al-Azhar Professor Dr. Muhammad Fayid Haykal replied to a  question on "how to restore the Islamic nation's lost glory amid  imported currents." He is quoted as saying that this can only  be achieved by "raising our children according to sound Islamic  principles." Noting that the conflict between the Islamic  nation and the West is a cultural and intellectual one, he  called for "directing the youth to the intellectual and cultural  sides of Islam" so that they can read and understand Islam  properly and help their nation to assume its rightful place in  the world.    The seminar also discusses fasting and its effect on  Muslims.</p>

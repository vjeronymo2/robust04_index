			<p>BFN     [Text] Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde is  threatening to appoint a prime minister if President-in-exile  Jean-Bertrand Aristide persists in refusing to do so. According  to the president of the lower chamber, it is a constitutional  duty, and we must think of endowing the country with a  government within the next few days, with or without President  Aristide's approval. We are two months away from elections in  the Dominican Republic. These threaten to be stormy. Various  political sectors demand that the institutional vacuum be  filled. The Chamger of Deputies president said it is necessary  to consider the measures to be taken so this vacuum can be  filled by President Aristide as soon as possible. In case  President Aristide's refuses, we have prepared a parliamentary  plan to solve the crisis and we are sticking to it, he pointed  out, adding that patience has its limits.    It should be noted, however, that the president of the lower  chamber has remained aloof from the resolution bill submitted on  29 March by a coalition of political parties calling for the  formation of an ad hoc government. Edner Jean filed a report:    [Begin recording] [Jean] President Aristide's categorical  refusal to appoint a new prime minister is putting Frantz Robert  Monde's nerves to the test. My patience has limits, he said  angrily in the presence of the journalists who were questioning  him on the future of the parliamentary plan in comparison with  new steps proposed by Washington. It should be noted that until  now, Frantz Robert Monde had developed and maintained a  consensus around him, with the result of a more-or-less normal  running of the Chamber of Deputies. In the face of the political  caprices of the president of the Republic, however, the deputy  from Anse-a-Veau is threatening to give up his role as  arbitrator to return to his camp, which is opposed to Aristide's.    We must think of endowing the country with a government  within the next few days, with or without President Aristide's  approval, stated the president of the lower chamber. The  upcoming elections in the Dominican Republic can only reinforce  concerns, but also the determination of President Monde.    [Monde] We are two months away from elections in the  Dominican Republic, which threaten to be very stormy. The  institutional vacuum is tempting to the political sectors. Those  sectors on the political scene are demanding that this  institutional vacuum be filled, that measures must be considered  as soon as possible so this institutional vacuum can be filled  by President Aristide. It is a constitutional duty not linked to  any conditions. We must make him understand that patience has  its limits. We have prepared a plan. We will stick to it. This  plan was inspired in its conception and was not influenced by  either Aristide or the Army. This plan must be executed or what  must be done will be done.    [Jean] Frantz Robert Monde is losing patience. He refuses to  be tempted, however, by new political adventures. Since the  beginning of his mandate, the president of the lower chamber has  known how to cleverly avoid efforts of the Group of Citizens of  the Greater North with its Government of Public Safety; the ad  hoc government of CARENA [Action Committee for National  Reconciliation]; as well as the application of Article 149 of  the Constitution, advocated by MDN [Mobilization for National  Development] and FRAPH [Front for Haitian Advancement and  Progress]. These political formations, rallying within the  Coordination Committee for National Mobilization, are renewing  their attack, and have submitted a resolution integrating their  various proposals to parliament. Here again, President Monde is  very cautious and expresses reservations.    [Monde] Having a new government is not going to relieve the  misery of the people. It is not going to reverse the instability  of our institutions, the degradation of the social level of the  Haitian people. What I am primarily interested in now is any  solution that can contribute to the improvement of the living  conditions of the people and defend my country's interests.    [Unidentified reporter] You gave a deadline of next  Wednesday.    [Monde] I do not receive deadlines from anyone. Any solution  that is not aimed at lifting the sanctions has no viable chance  of defending this country's interests.    [Jean] To this, one can add that Frantz Robert Monde has  always stated that he would be the last to leave his office if  parliament is attacked. This obviously remains to be proven.

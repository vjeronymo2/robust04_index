			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Accountancy Column: Eastman Kodak tight-lipped on derivatives use At the end of last year, Eastman Kodak was sitting on paper losses of Dollars 492m on derivatives contracts. It is a big user of interest exchange rate derivatives, but gives little information about how these instruments are used. Some of the paper losses could be realised in the near future. The company plans to pay off part of its Dollars 7bn debt by selling three of its businesses. The cost of liquidating interest rate swaps associated with this debt could amount to between Dollars 250m and Dollars 350m, according to Mr Alex Henderson, an analyst at Prudential Securities. The swaps have kept down the interest charges reported by Kodak in the past. A one-off charge now would beg the question why the swap losses weren't offset by a matching gain from pre-paying the debt. Like many big US companies, Kodak refuses to discuss its hedging policies beyond what appears in its accounts. The Securities and Exchange Commission has written to several big companies putting pressure on them to say more about their use of derivatives. Kodak said it was not aware of reciving a letter.</p>

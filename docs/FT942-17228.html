			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Identity to cling on to: In a world of dissolving states, nations matter more than ever Is the nation-state obsolete? This seemingly academic question is in fact highly topical. Many of the arguments for regional integration, in north America as well as in Europe, start from the observation that economic life can no longer be organised effectively within the borders of a single state. If citizens are to have any chance of regulating economic behaviour successfully, they need transnational rules and supra-national institutions to do it. Yet the nation-state remains the only form of political authority that most people can relate to emotively. In recent years some 20 new nation-states have emerged, as the former multinational states of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union broke up. Obviously the people founding these new states, often at a terrible price in human suffering, do not believe the model is obsolete. I have a theory to explain this paradox: the nation-state does still have a vital role to play in the world, but no longer the same role that it had in the past. For 200 years, from the 18th to the mid-20th century, the nation-state was an engine of modernisation. Around the time of the French Revolution it became obvious that states could be more successful and powerful if they mobilised the energies of their subjects by treating them as citizens. People began to believe that the state was there to serve them, not the other way round. The state should be the expression of common interests, and a common identity, shared by all its inhabitants: together they formed the nation, to which the state belonged. Clearly this idea has a lot to do with democracy. It also has a lot to do with mass education, and with various other phenomena which we associate, rightly or wrongly, with progress and modernity - notably the formation of an effective, highly-motivated fighting force. In schools and armies and other mainly state-run institutions people from different parts of a country got to know and understand each other, to speak and read a generally intelligible version of their national language instead of local dialects, to think of themselves as a nation with common interests to defend. Political parties, trade unions, lobbies: all developed with the main goal of steering the nation in one direction or another, through control of or influence over the state. In response, the state intervened in more areas of life, acquiring control, even ownership, of larger shares of the nation's wealth. People who didn't belong to such a nation, or who felt that they belonged to a nation that lacked its own state, or to a nation whose state did not include them, seemed to be missing out on modernity and its benefits. They were easily persuaded to follow nationalist leaders who offered them membership of a nation-state as the ticket to participation in the modern world. Thus for 200 years or so the nation-state was one of the main agents of modernisation, and modernisation strengthened the nation-state. But sometime between 1945 and 1980 the nation-state peaked. Modernity became global. Today all the processes of modernisation cut across state frontiers, and tend to erode rather than reinforce the state's grip on the lives of its citizens: The instantaneous transmission of images and information around the world has resulted in capital movements of such speed and volume that the notion of a national economy has become virtually meaningless. The information revolution has also created a global mass culture, and has made political debate harder to contain within state frontiers. Industrialisation has reached a point where it creates environmental problems that have equally little respect for frontiers. In the industrial world the state became overloaded. It is no longer able to fulfil all the demands its citizens make on it without taxing them more. And it can no longer guarantee employment to unskilled workers at the wages they expect, given the growing competition from capital-intensive technology at home and low-cost labour abroad. It has begun to retreat. In parts of the ex-colonial world - Africa, especially - and now in much of the ex-communist world as well, statehood has simply failed to deliver the goods. First it failed economically, by applying controls which stifled free enterprise, and now it is failing politically too. Even where states still physically control their national territory, in the sense of eliminating armed rebellion, they often cannot provide basic social services, or even the physical security which is their primary raison d'etre. The more successful members of the human race can now participate directly in the global economy and culture, through multinationals and other non-governmental organisations, without needing a nation-state to represent them; and the less successful find the states which purport to represent and defend them are increasingly less able to do so in practice. Even war, which used to be seen as the quintessential monopoly of the state, has become both sub-national and supra-national. In this bewildering new world the nation-state is no longer the engine of modernisation. Instead it has become the 'Jesus rail' - the handle that a white-knuckled passenger clings onto shouting 'Jesus', as the car he is travelling in hurtles round a blind corner. The world is hurtling into the third millennium at terrifying speed, and we all feel the need for something familiar to hold on to: a community, a group with which we share language, culture and collective memory; a nation, in fact.</p>

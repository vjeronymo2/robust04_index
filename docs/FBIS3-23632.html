			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Petr Pavlyuk, reviewer, Ukrainian Navy Press </F> Center: "On the Matter of Financing the Black Sea Fleet: When  Half-Truth is Offered as Truth"]    [Text] A number of  articles on the financing of the Black Sea Fleet have recently  appeared in the mass media. A number of serious complaints were  expressed in them, as well as in Ostankino broadcasts, addressed  to Ukraine and its Ministry of Defense. Accusations were made  that joint Ukrainian-Russian agreements on the fleet's financing  were being violated. A number of figures are cited in this  regard. For example, of the total credit of 96,977,700  karbovantsy allocated to the fleet as of 29 October 1993,  Ukraine's share is only 22.6 percent, while in recent times it  has grown even smaller.    These and other data are cited with the blessing of the  chief  of the financial service of the Black Sea Fleet. Strange as it  may seem, for some reason not one of the authors of the articles  tried to discover the opinion of the other  side--Ukraine--regarding these truly painful issues, and  acquaint readers with it.    To correct this omission I turned to the chief of the  financial service of the Ukrainian Navy, Colonel Viktor  Kobernik, who had participated as an expert in drafting and  adopting the joint Ukrainian-Russian agreement on financing the  Black Sea Fleet.    "All numerical computations and financial data need to be  meticulously checked in order to confirm or refute them," he  emphasized. "Yet there are complaints against Ukraine that its  Ministry of Defense should be allowed the possibility to carry  out a documentary financial audit of the Black Sea Fleet jointly  with representatives of the Russian Federation Ministry of  Defense, in order to determine where money for the fleet is  coming from, in what amounts, and where and for what needs it is  being spent, who is overpaying, who is underpaying, and so on."    However, initiatives undertaken on this account by the  Ukrainian Ministry of Defense in February, and then in July of  last year, were rejected for some reason by the Russian side.  This is despite the fact that according to statute the military  districts (fleets) must undergo documentary financial audits not  less than once every two years. And the last audit in the Black  Sea Fleet was in July 1991. Had it occurred as required, in  1993, there probably would not have been any need for law  enforcement agencies to investigate criminal cases associated  with major material and financial abuses in the mine and torpedo  arsenal base, and in the Black Sea Fleet fuel service.    The joint agreement on financing the Black Sea Fleet in the  transitional period (to 1995), drawn up and initialed in  February of last year, foresees participation of Ukraine and  Russia in equal shares of 50 percent. This agreement was  subsequently confirmed in April 1993.    When the chief of the financial service of the Black Sea  Fleet announces that Ukraine's share in fleet financing was only  22.6 percent as of the end of October, and even lower after  that, the personnel and the blue and white collar workers of the  fleet develop a negative attitude toward the Ukrainian side. It  is obviously this goal that the articles recently published on  these issues pursue.    However, the sad thing is that lies are being offered as  truth, and many things are deliberately not being said, with the  blessing of Colonel A. Zhukov. In particular, the chief of the  financial service of the Black Sea Fleet has to know that  Ukraine provided for 100 percent of the Black Sea Fleet's  financing throughout practically all of 1992 and from 1 January  1993 to May 1993. Mutual settlements regarding these expenses  have still not been carried out.    Now about how the financial service of the Black Sea Fleet  is  manipulating the figures.    Yes, according to agreements Ukraine's share should be 50  percent. By Colonel A. Zhukov's calculations this share is  presently something else. But once again he is holding back a  great deal of information. For example, about the amounts upon  which his computations are based. The agreement does not allow  unilateral financial actions. Even so, Russia unilaterally  decided to introduce payment for the difference between the  karbovanets and the ruble into the Black Sea Fleet. The Russian  Federation Ministry of Defense also unilaterally assumed the  responsibility of paying the expenses for this item. Thus, these  expenses should not be included in Ukraine's percent share.    Nor can the Ukrainian side assume responsibility for half of  the expenses of maintaining those vessels and ships that raised  the flag of St. Andrew. It would be wrong, after all, for any  self-respecting power to pay those who insult its national worth!    Some other nuances of this complex problem could be brought  up as well.    As they say, money likes to be counted. And it is precisely  such an accounting that the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense  proposes. It is completely incomprehensible why the RF Ministry  of Defense and the Black Sea Fleet are opposed to this. You  would think that they should be the ones who are most interested  in clarifying and resolving the arising misunderstandings.    I would like to pass along another extremely interesting  fact.    In early December 1993 the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense  appropriated 21 billion karbovantsy in payment of the Black Sea  Fleet's debt to ship repair plants. It wanted to be sure that  the enterprise collectives would receive their wages in time.  The financing was carried out according to established procedure  by the financial service of the Ukrainian Navy. However, on 8  December the chief of the financial service of the Black Sea  Fleet returned the money to us with the following explanation:  "The indicated amount will be credited to the budget account of  the financial service of the Black Sea Fleet by decision of the  Black Sea Fleet commander only if the transfer is made directly  by the financial directorate of the Ukrainian Ministry of  Defense, and not through the Ukrainian Navy."    It is incomprehensible why the Black Sea Fleet took the  Ukrainian Defense Ministry's attempt to finance the ship repair  plants through the financial and economic directorate of the  Russian Navy as such an insult. And the latter grossly violated  the February agreement, which prescribes transfer of money to  the Black Sea Fleet through the Ukrainian National Bank, by  using the services of commercial structures; for example, to the  Omtek-Biznes firm through the Mosbiznesbank. This choice was  made by the Russian side. As for why, who knows?    On the other hand, throughout all of 1993 Ukraine  insistently  offered to continue 100 percent financing of the Black Sea Fleet  through centralized mutual settlements with the RF Ministry of  Defense through the National Bank (50 by 50 percent), as is  foreseen by the joint February agreement. In this case any  interruptions in issuing pay and other payments to the personnel  would have been excluded.    There is one other tactical maneuver of the Black Sea Fleet  command I would like to discuss. It's no secret to us that many  Black Sea Fleet admirals and officers capitalize on various  loopholes to get their pay in rubles much more often than once a  year (when departing on leave). Subsequently converting them  into karbovantsy in various ways, they acquire a good "nest  egg." This is hardly to the liking of the officers, shore-based  and seagoing warrant officers, and employees of the Black Sea  Fleet whose position does not allow them to do this.    In short, there are many financial nuances in the Black Sea  Fleet, ones which the command has no intention of discussing  fully. And as a distracting maneuver, various insinuations are  being made and a purposeful effort is being conducted to  influence public opinion and arouse negative emotions. It is  obviously precisely for these reasons that the Black Sea Fleet  will never agree to such inspections, and all the more so to a  documentary financial audit. Even though this would be the best  way to shed some light on the real state of affairs.</p>

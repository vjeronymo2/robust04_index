			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Economics Ministry Criticizes </F> Bundesbank"]    [Text] Bonn, 6 April -- The Bundesbank is playing down the  losses of German enterprises in the price contest in order to  "take the wind out of the sails" of the debate on an excessive  revaluation of the German mark, says the Federal Economics  Ministry in an internal paper on the subject of the  competitiveness of German industry. The remarks of the  Bundesbank on the subject of price competitiveness are  "inconsistent," complains the document. In its December report,  the bank still spoke of a 10-percent deterioration in the  competitiveness of German enterprises since the middle of 1992  vis-a-vis enterprises from 15 European countries and of  difficulties for German exporters on account of the revaluation  of the mark. But in its February report, the bank claimed that  there were no more problems with competitiveness. The reason  for the inconsistency of the Bundesbank's statements is that the  bank based its calculations of exchange rate variations on  different time periods. But the question remains whether the  Bundesbank is merely performing a political task and attempting  to prevent attacks.    What is conspicuous is that the European Union Commission  has  also given the competitiveness of German exporters a worse  assessment than the Bundesbank. In an internal report published  in January, the commission underlined "a significant reduction"  in Germany's competitiveness by 12 percent against the remaining  European Union countries since September 1992. The Economics  Ministry thinks the Bundesbank is playing down this fact. The  ministry itself reckons that the revaluation of the mark has hit  German exports "hard," a situation made even worse by seasonal  weaknesses of trade partners. Last year (January to October  1993), German exports fell by 23 percent against the same period  in 1992, a decrease of over 70 billion marks vis-a-vis the  European Union countries. Vis-a-vis Italy and Spain, which had  devalued their currencies, the decrease was even more than 30  percent. The latest positive developments in export figures are  pleasing, but one must bear in mind the low starting position.  In any case, the improved figures appear positive mainly  vis-a-vis those countries where the latest currency exchange  operations (devaluations vis-a-vis the dollar and yen) are  considered to have played an important part. According to the  ministry, there is "much to indicate" that the German export  business has not yet fully digested the revaluation vis-a-vis  European currencies. Therefore, the improvement to the  situation will not be enough to make good the export losses. In  order to contain the consequences of the revaluation, a forced  devaluation strategy must be avoided at al costs. The document  agrees with the Bundesbank on this last point.</p>

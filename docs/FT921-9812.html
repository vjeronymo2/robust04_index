			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Estate agents take 75% pay cuts in big shake-out BRITAIN'S estate agents, a symbol of the 1980s boom, are having to accept cuts in pay of up to 75 per cent and huge job losses as the recession in the housing market continues. Regional directors who would have been earning up to Pounds 100,000 a year during the property boom are accepting Pounds 30,000 jobs as branch managers, according to Mr Anthony Hesse, managing director of Property Personnel, one of the industry's main employment agencies. Few, least of all the tens of thousands of families whose homes face repossession, will have tears to shed for one of the least popular occupational groups in the country. But, true to their Thatcherite image, estate agents are behaving as workers are meant to in a free market, taking large pay cuts when business turns down. Typical jobs being advertised by the National Association of Estate Agents appointments service include a negotiator job in Avon at Pounds 10,000 a year without commission, and another negotiator post at Pounds 5,000-Pounds 6,000 a year in south-east London with commission. It is understood within the industry that, even with commission, the south-east London job would probably pay only a little over Pounds 10,000. Before the property downturn that figure would have been twice as high in a less successful firm and four times higher in a more successful one, according to Mr Hesse. At the height of the property boom, many negotiators were working for commission only. According to Mr Hesse there has been a 'huge shake-out' in the industry since 1988. He estimated 'very provisionally' that the number of people employed in the industry has fallen from 75,000 to 50,000. He speculates that among those to have left the industry are the dealers who were making Pounds 30,000 a year at the age of 18 and contributed to the industry's bad image. Last week Estate Agency News, a trade magazine, estimated that the total of estate agency branches has fallen from a peak of 6,500 in 1988 to just over 5,000 at the end of last year. Most large estate agency chains are continuing to incur heavy losses and the industry is still contracting.</p>

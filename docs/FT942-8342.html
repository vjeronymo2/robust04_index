			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Decision delayed on new bid for Chilean copper Codelco, Chile's state copper company, has postponed for one week a decision on the troubled El Abra copper project pending fresh information from Cyprus-Amax, the US company whose recalculated bid it is considering. A consortium of Cyprus and Lac Minerals of Canada had last year offered Dollars 555m for 51 per cent of El Abra, one of the world's biggest undeveloped copper deposits. Last month, however, Lac pulled out after preliminary tests showed that El Abra, which the consortium had estimated at an annual capacity of 225,000 tonnes, might be smaller than originally believed. Mr Juan Villarzu, president of Codelco, denied a newspaper report that Cyprus had resubmitted a bid of Dollars 350m, compared with the Dollars 240m offered by the underbidder, a consortium of Magma Copper of the US and Australia's Broken Hill Proprietary. A Cyprus official refused to deny or confirm the Dollars 350m figure.</p>

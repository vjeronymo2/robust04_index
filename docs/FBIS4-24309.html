			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tim Cohen] </F>   [Text] Cape Town -- National Intelligence Service (NIS)  director-general Mike Louw make an unprecedented appearance at a  public forum yesterday to argue for the continuation of his  service, because of a huge increase in spying in SA [South  Africa].    Appearing before Parliament's joint standing committee on  finance, Louw confessed to being nervous, acknowledging that  some of the committee's members had been "intelligence targets"  not too long ago.    One of the new parliamentarians, former trade unionist and  ANC MP Phillip Dexter, asked whether "greater transparency" was  not needed to reduce hostility to NIS because then "many of us  wouldn't be so hostile to the idea of you getting any money at  all."    Louw said: "I suppose that many of the people in this room  have been intelligence targets of our organisation in the past."    But he recalled sitting in Parliament listening to an attack  on the intelligence services by the leader of the opposition,  who said NIS was spying on his party which was law abiding and  had nothing to be ashamed of. Just a few weeks later it became  known that members of that party had planted bombs.    It was wrong to think that there was no longer any political  threat to the country. The right wing was "vociferous" and,  although it seemed to be "a bit downtrodden and shocked by the  election results," there were indications that it was  regrouping. On the left of the political spectrum, many had  great expectations and what their reaction would be when these  expectations were not met was uncertain.    Louw said the number of foreign missions had grown by 160  percent since 1990 and foreign intelligence personnel had  increased 182 percent.    The CIA had indicated it intended closing 13 of its missions  in Africa. "I can only surmise that those 13 missions will be  run from SA. I have very little doubt about that. It is just  another thing to take cognisance of."    He said no decision had been taken on how NIS, the  intelligence arms of the liberation movements and those of the  former homelands, might be integrated. A special Cabinet  committee was currently considering the matter.    Louw also said organised crime was increasingly the terrain  of intelligence services because of the link between crime,  terrorism and drugs.    Asked about the future of NIS, he said the organisation had  tried for many years to recruit people from communities other  than the Afrikaaner community with very little success. Despite  a drive to recruit from many universities, including black  campuses, NIS had found that many people did not want to join  "simply because of the bad image we had as an instrument of  state."    Rather than looking at NIS's past activities, the focus  should be on the future and the need to ensure a "common  intelligence" in a country which could look forward to an  intelligence service "at peace with itself."</p>

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Monday Interview: Tycoon who's not in the red - Sally Aw Sian, chairman of Hong Kong media group Sing Tao, talks to Simon Holberton One of the claims William Shawcross makes for Mr Rupert Murdoch in his recent biography of the media tycoon is that Mr Murdoch was the first to see, and exploit, the potential of the extra-terrestrial satellite for global media operations. Mr Murdoch has his difficulties in Hong Kong, where he is attempting to acquire control of Television Broadcasts, Hong Kong's top local television station. And, although it is probably true that he was the first English language media proprietor to use satellite technology, the accolade 'first' is more appropriately applied to a tough-minded woman in Hong Kong. Since the late 1960s she has been in international newspaper publishing and, in 1978, her company was the first to transmit made-up newspaper pages to printing plants in North America, Europe, and Australasia via satellite. The language was Chinese and the title of the newspaper Sing Tao. Miss Sally Aw Sian, 62, then as now, chairman of Sing Tao, one of Hong Kong's leading listed media groups, is not, however, a person to crow about her achievements. 'Yes, we were the first to use satellites,' she says; and that is that. Miss Aw's venture into the world of transnational publishing was inspired by an encounter while on holiday in San Francisco in 1968. She was asked on the streets of the city's Chinatown for news from Hong Kong and China. The question became the germ of an idea: 'I thought it would be a good idea to start a paper . . . I was sure that, if we could publish a paper in San Francisco, there would be a lot of people interested in buying it,' she says. Bringing the project to fruition was made easier through her friendships with the owner of a local grocery chain, who offered to display any paper she chose to produce, and a publisher with the capacity to print a newspaper. Initially, the paper was produced in Hong Kong and flongs - made-up stencils ready for printing - were air freighted to San Francisco. This continued until 1978, when she moved to satellite transmission. Today Miss Aw's newspaper is published in nine cities - - six in north America, plus London, Sydney and Wellington. Global circulation is 160,000 a day and, in some centres, notably Toronto, on a good day the paper can run to 70 broadsheet pages. She has also tailored the content of the newspapers to suit local market conditions and reader interest. Advertising is local, as is some news. Reports about Hong Kong and China are transmitted daily from Sing Tao's headquarters in Hong Kong. 'We made money only after a few years and today it is a profitable paper,' she says. In 1992, the entire Sing Tao group made a net profit of HKDollars 119.5m (Pounds 10.4m). For the scatterlings of the Chinese diaspora who want to read daily news in Chinese, the choice is limited to the overseas edition of the People's Daily, the Chinese Communist party's main mouthpiece, an assortment of Taiwan-funded newspapers, and her own. It is little wonder, then, that when Miss Aw made her first visit to China last November and met Mr Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Chinese Communist party, he was most interested in her overseas publishing. The Chinese government cares passionately about what the overseas Chinese think. It puts a lot of effort in to winning their hearts and minds and in to encouraging them to return to China to invest. So did she not think, last November, that she was merely being courted by the Chinese leadership for her support? 'Well, of course,' she says. 'That it is the main point. Otherwise, why should they welcome me?' Miss Aw thought she would never go to China. The mainland government had denounced her late father, Aw Boon Haw - inventor of Tiger Balm ointment and owner of several newspapers, mainly in Singapore and southern China, before the 1949 revolution - for his support of the Kuomingtang, the Communists' rivals for political legitimacy on the mainland. His newspapers supported the Kuomingtang and so had Miss Aw's. Then, two years ago, he was 'rehabilitated' and the mainland government redefined him as 'patriotic'. It also offered to return to Miss Aw all the property it had confiscated in 1949 from her father, who was one of the wealthiest overseas Chinese entrepreneurs of that time. This included prime holdings in Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen and Fuzhou - among south China's fastest-growing cities - plus a half-completed mansion which her father had started building in the family's ancestral village of Zhongchuan, in Fujian. Her father's rehabilitation and the return of his property set the scene for Miss Aw's visit to Beijing last autumn. The government housed her in the Diaoyutai state guest house, usually reserved for important foreign visitors. In a rare honour, she met both Mr Jiang Zemin and Mr Li Peng, China's prime minister. Significantly, the meetings were publicised on national television. Her visit was designed not only for reconciliation but also for deal-making. While in Beijing, she signed a HKDollars 3m 50-50 joint venture agreement with the People's Daily to publish jointly a colour magazine, the Singguang Monthly. Miss Aw says both parties will share editorial control. It will publish economic and social articles on China and Chinese communities abroad. Given the involvement of the People's Daily, it is unlikely the editorial content will challenge Communist party orthodoxies. Her meetings with top government leaders amounted to an 'official blessing' for the venture. She is clearly keen on more, and to boost Sing Tao's media assets on the mainland, an enormous market hungry for information. One of her subsidiaries, Jademan, owner ofthe Tin Tin Daily, one of Hong Kong's top three Chinese language newspapers, has just launched the Nanhwa Jinji Ribao, or South China Economic Daily. It will focus on business in China and the country's economic development. Initially, it will sell in Hong Kong and south-east Asia. But, says Miss Aw: 'When the opportunity arises, we hope we can sell it in China - when, that is, it is acceptable to them.' So far, she has committed about HKDollars 250m to business ventures on the mainland, which underlines her confidence in China's future. Echoing sentiments often heard in Hong Kong and on the mainland, she observes about China's economic reforms: 'They are heading in the right direction as long as they don't go too fast. Russia had political change before economic change - that's why they have such problems. China has done it the other way around. 'I don't think they will, or can, return to the past,' she adds. With the pragmatism typical of the Hong Kong Chinese business community, she adds: 'The government is changing and they realise that they have to change their economic thinking. I think there is a great future in China, and I have every confidence that we can do business there, especially now that a lot of western people are going to China to do business.' For Miss Aw, her return to China also meant a chance to finish business left incomplete in 1949. Before the Communists assumed power in that year, her father had donated enough money to the Kuomingtang government to build 100 schools and 100 hospitals. 'The money was given, but nothing came of it because of the civil war,' she says. She plans to incorporate a foundation in China into which she will place all property assets the Communist government has returned to her. The foundation will fund projects in the arts, education and medicine. For her ancestral village, she plans to complete the mansion her father started before 1949 and turn it over for use as a cultural centre. Why? 'Well, because my father was a staunch Chinese and very supportive of China. He felt that, if he earned money from business in China, he might as well do things to benefit the Chinese people. Now I will just have to do what I can with the money we have.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1931 Born in Rangoon, Burma. 1952 Joined Sing Tao. 1957 Chairman of Sing Tao. 1969 Published overseas edition of Sing Tao in San Francisco. 1978 Transmits Sing Tao newspaper via satellite to offshore printing      sites. 1992 Signed deal with the People's Daily. 1993 Launched South China Economic Daily.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

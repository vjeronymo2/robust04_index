			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Contending that his clients want a "level playing field," a lawyer representing  seven white San Francisco police officers filed a "reverse discrimination" suit  to obtain "a colorblind and sex-blind opportunity to advance." In the Superior  Court complaint, attorney Robert E. Gyemant claimed that less-qualified  minority officers have been promoted in order to meet "racial quotas" set a  decade ago by a court-ordered affirmative action plan. The suit contended that  California has violated state civil rights laws forbidding the use of race or  sex as a basis in hiring and promotion. City Atty. Louise Renne said the suit  is "plowing old ground." The suit may be the first test case for a landmark  U.S. Supreme Court decision that reversed 20 years of affirmative action gains.  That decision permitted a legal challenge to a court-ordered affirmative action  plan, or consent decree, which previously could not be challenged in court.  </P></p>

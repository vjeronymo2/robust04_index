			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Zholdak, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA: "Ukraine Is </F> Bankrupt, but There Is a Ray of Hope. A Change of Power in the  Supreme Council--the Socialist Oleksandr Moroz Has Been Elected  Chairman. UKRAYINSKA HAZETA Predicts: Out of Seven Candidates  for the Post of President of Ukraine, the Democrat-Centrist Ivan  Plyushch Will Win"]    [Text] We might say that the election of a new chairman of  the Supreme Council has become the first stage of the logical  completion of a well-known and extremely important decision of  the old membership of parliament, namely:    1) to hold an early election of people's deputies;    2) to hold an early election of the president of  Ukraine.    So the first point has been "carried out," and thank God,  quite successfully. For anyone who thinks normally "early  elections" mean a radical change in the personalities in power  both in the parliament and in presidential structures, which  have shown their inability to govern the state and ensure at the  very least the regular physiological existence for their nation.  The membership of the parliament has been changed perceptibly. A  new chairman also appeared promptly.    By now, Ukraine has been driven into the ground. At present,  Ukraine is bankrupt. I had heard this before, but prior to the  publication of this article, I decided to ascertain this with my  own eyes. My good friend Volodymyr Nykonenko, chairman of the  Druzhba kolkhoz, who is boundlessly devoted to the land and the  people who work it, succeeded in "shaking loose" 800 million  karbovantsy to finish the construction of gas mains in the  villages of his farm. The poor Nykonenko has been working on  that gas for many years. He suddenly called me and asked me to  find out when the money had "gone" to Poltava, to the oblast  agricultural administration (incidentally, his kolkhoz in this  oblast, in Chernukhinskiy Rayon, subscribes to 10 copies of  UKRAYINSKA HAZETA--therefore, it is a collective activist of our  Subscriber Club). I went to the Ministry of Agriculture and  Foodstuffs of Ukraine. I found the Administration for Investment  Management, and their executives told me:    "You are going to wait for a long time. The quota assigned  for capital construction in Poltava Oblast is 106 billion  karbovantsy, whereas only 2 percent has been received by the  oblast. That is it! The Ministry of Finance does not have the  money."    "When will they remit the rest?"    "We do not know. At any rate, not soon."    "Are they withholding it solely from Poltava Oblast?"    ""All oblasts are in this condition. In total, rural areas  are supposed to receive 5.8 trillion karbovantsy for capital  construction. The Ministry of Finance has allocated 2.8 percent."    "That is it?"    "Besides, the shortfall for last year is 1 trillion."    I was indignant: "This is how the Ministry of Finance  operates--Pyatachenko is hoarding it."    "For a long time now, he has not had things to hoard. There  are no withholdings for the budget. There are no sources of  revenue. Production is at a standstill. Ukraine is bankrupt."    I had heard the terrible official word. Ukraine is bankrupt!  Later, I met Minister of Finance Hryhoriy Pyatachenko in the  Supreme Council and told him this. He silently threw up his  hands.    "Write down your considerations about everything as it is,  Hryhoriy Oleksandrovych. Let us raise the alarm. Let us tell the  people the truth about who has driven Ukraine into the ground."    "I will try to write this, but not now--in a couple of  weeks."    I did not ask him again, because I understood that he would  have no time two weeks later, either. In today's issue of our  newspaper, we print an article by Volodymyr Chernyak--a  diagnosis of disease or perhaps.... No, I will not write the  word "death." Ukraine is bankrupt, but it is alive. It should be  rescued immediately. We should look for those who can do  it--soon, as soon as possible!    One change of power, in the Supreme Council, has already  occurred. I believe that Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch acted wisely  in refusing to take part in the election of the new chairman of  the Supreme Council. I will repeat that the revolutionary  decision on early elections is not a doorbell but an entire  gong, telling all the current "leaders" that they should vacate  their long-held seats of power for other "leaders" and deputies.  UKRAYINSKA HAZETA has already written this, but I will repeat  again that more reasonable and sober figures have come together  in the current parliament. It is true.    The new chairman was elected on Thursday, 18 May, in the  first round. Oleksandr Moroz, a well-known and quite active  modern politician, the chief of the political council of the  Socialist Party, became chairman (perhaps out of fear, HOLOS  UKRAYINY immediately used "political council" with the capital  letters, as was once the case with the Politburo. To be sure,  there was a basis for that, because in his speech, Mr. Moroz  frightened the newspaper-organ of the Supreme Council, stating,  to my mind incorrectly, that HOLOS UKRAYINY should offer  information about the positions of the deputies rather than give  the thoughts of a journalist concerning the position of a  deputy. This was a great mistake by the chairman, because if a  newspaper does not evaluate the positions of deputies and the  chairman, it will be bathroom tissue rather than a newspaper).    This is why I was doubly concerned when Mr. Moroz was  elected  chairman: I did not like his communist-censorship leanings;  second, more than his "socialist affiliation," I was worried  about the people milling around him and surrounding him because,  now his most authoritative comrades in arms and like-minded  people will want to receive leadership portfolios from him. God  forbid, Mr. Chairman may yield to the pressure of "the kin and  relations" without distinction. This is generally dangerous in  politics. It is good if the contenders have a place for God in  their hearts--for Love for our poor people, who have suffered in  the darkness of communism, and will intelligently search for  ways other than the well-known way of Lenin. Even now my hands  tremble at the very thought that we might be governed by, say,  these two so-called Ukrainians, one of whom, with the last name  ending in "enko," courageously demonstrates his disregard for  the native tongue of our people and for their statehood.    Terror overcomes us also because many people from among the  new deputies, apparently highly educated and intelligent people,  deliberately and impudently "speak only the foreign language"  [the phrase in quotation marks is given in Russian in the  original]. Indeed, Russian is a foreign language in Ukraine  because it is not the state language. This is why it is  considered foreign, just as French, Polish, German, or English  are. I mean the official language in state institutions, to say  nothing of the chamber of the Supreme Council.    To be sure, I have some expectations that the new chairman,  who, incidentally, knows Ukrainian and has a "B-plus" command of  it, will tactfully and unceremoniously force each deputy to  respect the Language Law (anti-Ukrainian figures specifically  have to be forced). For its part, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA will provide  lessons in the state language with assistance from the language  commentator Oleksandr Ponomariv, a professor of the imeni Taras  Shevchenko Kiev University and one of the best experts on the  Ukrainian language; the newspaper will also name the names of  those who spit upon this language in the supreme premises of  power.    So it would be greatly disturbing if the closest comrade in  arms of the new chairman, the October Socialist Mr. Marchenko (a  Ukrainian in form, an alien in content) "ends up among the  engineers on the steam locomotive" [the phrase in quotation  marks given in Russian in the original], which is pulling  Ukraine to the "station" [the phrase in quotation marks given in  Russian in the original] of Independence. We are only afraid  about this station turning out to be the "commune-station." [the  phrase in quotation marks given in Russian in the original], or  that the former people's deputy Mr. Kotsyuba (in the past, a  comrade in arms of the Rukh people and now one of the leaders of  the Communist Party of Ukraine) can claim a "supreme post." He  can say: "Oleksandr Oleksandrovych, we, the Communists, have  pushed you through to become chairman; give me the portfolio of  a minister or deputy minister, or say an ambassador to Europe,  to Paris!" The gentleman Communist Marmazov does not bring us  spiritual peace and joy. So far, the behavior of Petro Symonenko  (number one in the Communist Party of Ukraine) has been changing  the previous negative attitude toward him because it turns out  that he has a good and easy command of the state language  (meanwhile, the notion was advertised that the "leader"  recognizes only Russian); nor is he an enemy of privatization,  of precisely the kind that does not rob the people; he is also  in favor of a market economy; he is supposedly altogether not in  favor of the former USSR (a few days ago, he stated in the press  in a quite human manner that "we are in favor of a Union of  states with equal rights, although we understand that this is a  protracted process, too").    It is possible that Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Moroz will not  act as, for example, Mr. Shcherbytskyy in his time; the latter  is no longer known to young people but is greatly respected by  our current president of Ukraine as a "prominent politician"  [the phrase in quotation marks given in Russian in the original]  (see and read the so-called sensational interview on 21 May in  KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI)--he dragged along to Kiev his "great"  fellow natives from his Dnepropetrovsk. Why do I say "possible"  with regard to Mr. Moroz? Because on the first day of his reign  he showed himself not to be stubborn and, as he stated in his  "throne" speech, truly capable of looking for ways to  consolidate various forces rather than fanning the flames of  confrontation and sicking some people on others.    The issue of electing the first deputy of the chairman of  the  Supreme Council became the first test of his wisdom. Mr. Moroz  and apparently the forces that stood behind him proposed  Chairman of the Peasant Party Oleksandr Tkachenko as candidate.  He is an undisguised Communist, just as the staunch prominent  poet of Ukraine Borys Oliynyk. Naturally, Tkachenko has  contributed greatly to the victory of Oleksandr Moroz. In  general, Oleksandr Tkachenko, 54, is an uncomplicated person (he  is undoubtedly a committed and wholehearted Ukrainian) and a  somewhat tragic one (he was minister of agriculture and deputy  prime minister; at the same time, certain highly placed persons  in power used him--they tossed him, as a camouflage outfit, to  be a candidate for the post of president of Ukraine in order to  attract votes away from Rukh and Republican candidates, and  later forced him to pull out for the benefit of another "party  comrade"; however, this ended up in his dismissal from his job  altogether, and for a period of time he looked for a vacant  position on his own). Now he is a figure of some consequence  among the agrarians. So the rightist forces in the parliament  (there are fewer of them than there are Communists) lodged a  resolute protest against Mr. Tkachenko. This was right. The  chairman is a Socialist, and his right-hand man would have also  been from the legions of the left. This turns out to be somewhat  disproportionate. The meeting of the Supreme Council was  frustrated, and the chairman went on to further consider the  situation with the factions and parties.    Naturally, only the deputies know this "nitty-gritty"  better.  I called our political commentator and co-chairman of the  Statehood faction, Academician Ihor Yukhnovskyy, to find out  whether power had been ultimately transferred to  Socialist-Communists and if we could announce "a silent  Communist coup."    The good friend of UKRAYINSKA HAZETA told us: "Do not worry.  Ukraine will continue to be reborn as an independent,  self-reliant, democratic state."    "So has Moroz not been stubborn? Is he keeping his word  about  consolidation?"    "We will see."    "Whose candidacy have they settled on now?"    "Perhaps it will be Yuriy Ivanovych Kostenko. However, let  us  survive till Tuesday."    Our conversation took place on Friday, 20 May. We survived  until Tuesday. Oleksandr Tkachenko, the leader of the Peasant  Party, was elected first deputy chairman, and Oleh Dyomin, a  nonparty member, was elected deputy. They were members of an  alternative pair, which got the greatest number of votes from  among those proposed by all factions of the Supreme Council. It  was as a result of the victory of these candidates that a  stormy, even hostile debate was held last Wednesday. The  rightist forces justifiably attacked the leftists, and the  latter justifiably accused the rightists. The chairman spoke to  make a comment. Who was right? Both. Understandably, squabbles  in the parliament will, unfortunately, continue until all  leaders understand that now we should fight for the immediate  resolution of the most acute economic problems rather than for  political victories. Ukraine is in danger now.    It is being pushed toward this at the last moment by  imperial  forces, in particular those of Russia. UKRAYINSKA HAZETA will  discuss Oleksandr Tkachenko and Oleh Dyomin separately.    Who is who? Oleksandr Moroz has just turned 50. This is a  golden age for a politician. He was born in the village of Buda,  Tarashchanskiy Rayon, Kiev Oblast. He grew up in a family with  many children. Moroz received a higher education at the  Ukrainian Agricultural Academy. He is a mechanical engineer.  Moroz also graduated from the Higher Party School of the Central  Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine. He worked in his  profession for 12 years. Later, he was on the staff of the Kiev  Oblast Committee of the party. He has been a people's deputy  since 18 March 1990. Moroz was elected and reelected in the  Tarashchanskiy Election District. He is married and has two  daughters and four grandchildren. According to my observations,  none other than Ivan Plyushch discovered him as a politician, or  more precisely, promoted him in the Supreme Soviet, while at the  same time breaking through to the supreme level of power  himself. Actually, previously they had worked in the same Kiev  Oblast and in the same area, that of agriculture, as leaders:  Ivan Plyushch as chairman of the oblast executive committee, and  Oleksandr Moroz as chief of the agrarian department of the  oblast committee of the party. In the past, both were  Communists, leaders of the Communist Party. The spirit of these  times of building the "bright future" [the phrase in quotation  marks given in Russian in the original] has faded. At present,  based on their words and deeds, both wish to build an  independent Ukraine, the Ukrainian state.    One of them, the younger one, has risen to the top of  supreme  power in Ukraine. The other, who is three years older, has  already been there. It is not feasible to blame him for the  mistakes of the Supreme Council, because this was the first  parliament that, in its Communist vestments, proclaimed to the  entire world the Ukrainian state, which was finally independent  of all unions and the "great Soviet family" [the phrase in  quotation marks given in Russian in the original]. So the  Supreme Council deserved the early election, and, together with  it, its chairman during this period of transition, and I would  say, an unsteady period in which all of us got a breath of the  air of freedom which it appeared would never break through the  misanthropic Communist regime (in a matter of speaking,  everything was being done for the people, and in reality the  people felt like prisoners both in run-of-the mill jobs and in  high positions). Both Moroz and Plyushch, as well as all  nomenklatura apparatchiks, know full well how they had to be  servile rather than serve, fake sincerity, and pretend to be  zealots of the great bright ideas. As a personality, one could  not come into his own self. Even those who occupied the apex of  power (I mean on the scale of Ukraine) were in awe of Moscow,  feared dismissal, and spoke the "truth" correctly, as Moscow  wanted it. Then what can we say about the practices within the  republic? They were as Shevchenko wrote--the large beats up on  the small.    Everything that happened in the Supreme Council is for the  better. For example, I like the fact that Mr. Moroz knows by  heart and quotes from Taras Shevchenko. The bad people, the  foes, the nonpatriots of Ukraine do not know and do not wish to  know our Great Poet.    I like the fact that Mr. Moroz wants himself, us, and his  grandchildren (I hope, Ukrainians) to live in their independent  state. He put it well after his election as chairman: The people  should feel themselves free in a free state. However, to this  end a truly free state should be built up so that the people  will not live as they do now, anxious and alarmed day and night  and contemptuous of work, their way of life, and their highly  placed bosses.    Could our past and present leaders be loved and respected,  given that they have brought the Ukrainian people to the point  where-- 78 percent of the people are below the poverty  line;    20 percent of the people barely make ends meet;    and only 2 percent live so as not to deny themselves  anything?    These terrifying facts (this may not exist in any country of  the world) were given in his presentation by a new people's  deputy of Ukraine, Professor Mykhaylo Pavlovskyy, a candidate  for the position of chairman of the Supreme Council (he later  withdrew his candidacy). His professional profound discourse  about the critical economic position of Ukraine and at the same  time realistic proposals for its breaking through toward the  light will be published by UKRAYINSKA HAZETA in the next issue.  In conjunction with this, we would like to quote the words of  the new chairman of the Supreme Council to the effect that "we  should urgently engage in forming the government.... We should  not be geared toward the election of the president." If these  are not words but rather a serious plan of action, there is no  need to look far and wide for a real prime minister (rather than  an "acting" one, which has suited the president of Ukraine for  such a long time). He is Mykhaylo Pavlovskyy, 55. There should  be no fears about his belonging to the Ukrainian Republican  Party. If he agrees to become a member of the government, he  will suspend his party affiliation. This is what Ukraine needs.  New, fresh forces are needed, which are competent, reasonable,  and businesslike. There are rumors that Vitaliy Masol is  "wanted" for prime minister. He is from yesterday. He is a  Shcherbytskyy cadre from the times of the Soviet period of  stagnation. His command of Ukrainian is poor. Besides, he is  retired.    In the next issue we will discuss the potential and chances  of some of the registered candidates for the post of president  of Ukraine. Out of 11 contenders, the four random and minor ones  were left out. Those are instructors at two colleges in  Kiev--the notorious Larisa Skoryk, and Mykola Rud, who is known  only at work and at home, as well as the former people's deputy  and engineer from Kharkov Ivan Valenya, and Viktor Pynzenyk (the  most intelligent one among them, a quite prominent economist).  What did they count on? Do they really not have a feeling that  they will become a laughingstock among their acquaintances  rather than chiefs of state?    Even among the ultimately designated seven, only two stand  on  really solid ground.    Leonid KRAVCHUK. He has already had an opportunity  to prove that he was capable of changing the life of the people  for the better. He has not changed it. On the contrary,  everybody has been getting worse off all the time. It is  doubtful that he will win. It is better for him to live  gracefully on his own.    Leonid KUCHMA. He has already had an opportunity  (an even greater one than Leonid Kravchuk) to show that he is  capable of bettering the life of the Ukrainian people. On the  contrary, he has tried to scare the Ukrainian people that it  would get worse if we do not unite with Russia. He could not  stand the strain and submitted his resignation. He stood at the  helm of the government for 11 months. He now desires a higher  seat.... It is not any easier there. Besides, he does not know  the Ukrainian language properly, and that language does not  enjoy his particular sympathy.    Volodymyr LANOVYY. As a deputy prime minister, he  has already had an opportunity to prove that he is capable of  developing and introducing an effective economic program.  However, he talks much and promises a lot. Prior to his coming  to politics, his working language in the Institute of Economics  was Russian only, and it is now difficult for him to speak  Ukrainian. However, his main drawback lies in the fact that by  nature he is not an energetic, persistent politician. He  represents the type of an experienced scientist who feels best  in the reading room among his scientist colleagues.    Oleksandr MOROZ. Now he already has the rank of  Supreme Council chairman. However, he still remains a candidate  for the post of president--for now. It appears to me that Mr.  Moroz will withdraw his candidacy, because there are several  substantive reasons to do so. First, real politicians do not  grasp all to lose all, and do not hold the two highest positions  in the country. This is the greater scheme of things. The  Socialist Moroz won in a chamber in which more than one-half out  of 336 voters were his supporters, whereas in the "chamber" of  Ukraine, with millions of voters opposed to the Communist  system, he will indisputably fail to get the necessary number of  votes at present, despite the successful election of Communists  to the Supreme Council. Now is not their time, if there ever  will be such. I am certain that Oleksandr Moroz understands this  full well and wants to work as chairman more than anything else.  He knows what needs to be done. If Plyushch becomes president on  top of this, they will move mountains.    Valeriy BABYCH. We can only welcome him for his  courage in wanting to become president of Ukraine. Without a  political image, almost unknown among the peasants, workers, and  also the intelligentsia, he, the chief of the Ukrainian Finance  Group (few people are really knowledgeable about this  organization, either), came to the start line. Evidently, he is  merely trying the "princely crown" on for size because he is  very young, or else he is on a "diversionary" mission. It is  hard for him to speak Ukrainian. I ascertained this during a  chance conversation with him at the palace of our president. I  have heard that he is a top-notch financier. However, at present  Ukraine needs a wise and reasonable politician-president.    Petro TALANCHUK. He is the minister of education  of Ukraine, 56. As early as in October of last year, UKRAYINSKA  HAZETA predicted that he would be one of the real candidates for  president of Ukraine. This has been the case. He is a professor,  doctor of technical sciences, and president of the Academy of  Engineering Sciences. He graduated from the Technical University  of Kiev and became the rector of this college. He is a great  patriot of Ukraine, a highly cultured individual whose knowledge  of science and production is profound. He deserves to become  president of Ukraine, but he is not very popular with the people  as a politician. We will publish a more detailed story about him  in the next issue.    Ivan PLYUSHCH. He is 53. Plyushch is widely known  and respected by the common people and the intelligentsia. He is  energetic, persistent, and principled (he did not support L.  Kravchuk's position on the issues of the Black Sea Fleet; he has  his own, different view of the economic union and the CIS,  believing that economic agreements with individual states are  sufficient). This is how some new people's deputies dubbed  Plyushch: "He was a firm director of the Supreme Council."    Is it good or bad? If we consider that Mr. Plyushch always  got the decision he wanted, he is a terrible man. However, if  all of the decisions he "pushed through" are aimed solely at  protecting the interests of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, if  these decisions make Ukraine strong and its people happy, I  would want to advance two new "deputy-style" slogans, but this  time on a greater scale:    "People, let us elect Ivan Plyushch director of Ukraine!"    "Long live Director of Ukraine Ivan Plyushch! He is the one  we need now--the second president of the independent Ukrainian  state."    I have arranged with Ivan Stepanovych to publish in the next  issue a article entitled "Ivan Stepanovych Is Never Angry" about  such "directorship in Ukraine" and generally about the everyday  life of just People's Deputy Ivan Plyushch.    I will recall that the election of the president will be  held  on 26 June. It will definitely be held. It cannot be postponed  by any means. Oleksandr Moroz said very correctly from the  rostrum of the Supreme Council that political agitation on  account of the election of the president of Ukraine cannot be  fueled. The rampage of governmental mafia structures is  continuing; the undisguised plundering of the people is under  way.    Elections are needed. A new president is needed. A new  government consisting of Ukrainian patriots is needed. One  deputy prime minister already intends to resign. No, nobody  should be dismissed. Everybody, beginning with the president,  the acting prime minister, and deputy ministers, must come to  the rostrum of the Supreme Council, report on the operation of  the Cabinet of Ministers, and give an account of who has made  our people into beggars before the deputies and all honorable  people. It is hard to understand why our president  simultaneously comes out against the election of the president  in his voice while using his hand to write a petition concerning  his desire to fight for this position. In submitting himself to  a new popular vote, the president should know that the people  are happy with his previous reign. In this case, he will be  victorious. Meanwhile, in our country 78 percent of the  people do not know what they are going to eat tomorrow....</p>

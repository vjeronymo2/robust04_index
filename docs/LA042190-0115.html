			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> GALLEGLY'S CAMPAIGN WAR CHEST INDICATES BIG EDGE OVER KORMAN;  </P> <P> ELECTIONS: FILINGS SHOW INCUMBENTS IN OTHER VALLEY RACES ALSO HAVE EARLY  FUND-RAISING ADVANTAGES OVER CHALLENGERS.  </P> <P> Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) has stockpiled $267,555 in campaign funds,  giving him an apparent advantage over his Republican challenger in the June 5  primary, campaign reports released this week show.  </P> <P> His opponent, Calabasas real-estate developer Sang Korman, reported that he had  only $4,621 on hand as of April 1. Korman had raised $51,248 since Jan. 1 but  spent $76,242, much of it for mailings, advertisements and consulting.  </P> <P> In 1988, Korman loaned his campaign $243,710 of his own money. He has yet to  contribute to his current bid but said he plans to contribute an unspecified  amount.  </P> <P> In other San Fernando Valley area contests, incumbents also have early  fund-raising advantages over primary and general election challengers,  according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. The documents  cover fund raising and campaign spending for the first three months of this  year.  </P> <P> The reports underscore the extent to which incumbents -- already far better  known, bolstered by staff and publicly financed mailings and often representing  districts drawn to favor their political parties -- are better armed  financially to communicate with voters in their campaigns.  </P> <P> Gallegly, whose 21st District includes southern Ventura County and parts of the  western and northern Valley, reported raising $132,529 since Jan. 1 and  spending $41,288. He raised $188,653 last year.  </P> <P> The former Simi Valley mayor received 86% of his contributions from  individuals, an unusually high percentage, and 14% from political action  committees. This included $3,098 from the Farmers Insurance PAC and $1,300 from  the Great Western PAC.  </P> <P> Korman, meanwhile, received no PAC contributions. Campaign Manager Bob Lavoie  said Korman, who spent $391,000 in his unsuccessful 1988 race against Gallegly,  will have enough money to wage an active campaign. Korman expects to spend a  smaller sum this time, Lavoie said, but he would not specify an amount. Most of  Korman's contributions came from fellow Korean-Americans outside the district.  </P> <P> In other races, Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) has $307,341 on hand.  No report was available for his Democratic primary opponent, Scott Gaulke.  Reports were required to be postmarked by April 15; candidates who have raised  less than $5,000 do not have to file.  </P> <P> Berman raised $22,510, including $10,900 from PACs, and spent $23,398. His  largest contributors were the American Trial Lawyers Assn. PAC, which gave him  $5,000, and the Transamerica Life Co. PAC, which contributed $2,500. Berman, an  attorney, sits on the House Judiciary Committee.  </P> <P> Gary Forsch, who is seeking the GOP nomination in Berman's 26th District,  reported raising $3,158 from individual givers. No report was available for Roy  Dahlson, who is opposing Forsch in the GOP primary.  </P> <P> Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) raised only $2,015 during the first  three months of the year. Beilenson, who does not accept PAC contributions,  reported $79,974 on hand.  </P> <P> His likely GOP opponent, Jim Salomon (R-Beverly Hills), reported garnering  $43,137. All but $3,000 of his contributions were from individuals. The ARCO  PAC gave him $2,500.  </P> <P> Salomon also spent $70,711 during this period, much of it on fund raising,  computer and consulting fees. He reported $56,019 on hand.  </P> <P> Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) raised only $2,100 during the reporting  period but remains one of the best-financed House members. He has $702,952 in  his campaign fund. No report was available for his likely Democratic opponent,  Tom Vournas.  </P> <P> Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) reported taking in $42,850, including  $38,850 from PACs. Waxman, who chairs the health and environment subcommittee  of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, received $5,000 from the Pacific  Telesis Pac; $3,000 from BellSouth Pac; $2,500 each from the Gulf &amp; Western  Inc. PAC, the National Education Assn. PAC and the Human Rights Fund. He also  received additional contributions from various health-related PACs.  </P> <P> Waxman, who contributes generously to liberal Democratic candidates nationwide,  has $489,695 on hand. No report was available for his probable Republican  opponent, John N. Cowles.  </P> <P> Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands), whose 35th District includes part of the  Antelope Valley, has $130,697 available. He has no primary or general election  opponent.  </P> <P> Neither Rep. William Thomas (R-Bakersfield) nor his GOP opponent, Rod Gregory,  had campaign reports on file last week. Thomas' 20th District includes the  northern Antelope Valley.  </P></p>

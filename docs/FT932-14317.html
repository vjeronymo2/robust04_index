			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / World Trade News: US and UK plan air traffic reform THE US and the UK set themselves a one-year deadline yesterday to replace the existing rules that govern air traffic between the two countries. Mr Federico Pena, the US transportation secretary, set what he called 'an ambitious time-frame' at a meeting in London with Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport secretary. Their negotiating teams will reconvene in London on May 5. Mr MacGregor said the agenda for the talks would include details of how to deregulate air traffic, foreign ownership of airlines, dealing with 'anti-competitive practices' and the numbers of cities in each country to which airlines from the other country could fly. A new regime is likely to be far more liberal than the existing rules, which date from the late 1970s. 'There will be difficult decisions by both sides,' he said. Resolving US airlines' demands for better access to Heathrow, the world's busiest international airport, is likely to be one of those decisions. Mr MacGregor said an interim agreement might be needed to meet the deadline and deals on individual items might be struck in less than one year. It could also pave the way for rule changes in bilateral agreements between the US and France, Germany and Japan. Mr Pena said he hoped that the speed with which the UK and US reached an agreement 'would encourage France and the US to come to the negotiating table'. He said it was 'unfortunate' that talks with France on renegotiating the bilateral accord broke down earlier this month. France wants tight limits on US carriers' share of the France-US market.</p>

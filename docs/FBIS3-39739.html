			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Alain Juppe met his British  counterpart Douglas Hurd, this afternoon. Paris and London  agree to extend the UN soldiers' action on the ground to those  towns still under siege in the former Yugoslavia. Alain Juppe:    [Begin Juppe recording] A first step has been made, as we  have all said. Having said that, a lot remains to be done:  First, in order to guarantee the effective lifting of the siege  of Sarajevo and to rebuild this town ruined by war; second, in  order to extend our action to all safe areas or all besieged  towns in Bosnia, and third, in order to promote a global peace  plan without which a stable solution cannot be found. There has  been convergence on all these issues.    I would like to point out that a number of decisions have  already been taken. I am thinking in particular of Tuzla and  Srebrenica, two safe areas covered by Resolution 836, and on  which the Council of the Atlantic Alliance took a very clear  stance on 10 and 11 January. As you know, the aim is to reopen  Tuzla airport for humanitarian purposes, and to restore freedom  of movement in Srebrenica again, in particular for UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces]. We [Juppe and Hurd] both hope that these  decisions will be implemented in the very near future. [end  recording]</p>

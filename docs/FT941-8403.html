			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Transfer could be costly I will soon be able to exercise a share option in my name which will be subject to CGT. Since the gain exceeds the tax-free allowance, I intend to transfer some shares to my wife, which she will then sell. How will the gain be assessed for CGT, assuming that all transactions happen on the same day? Your tax inspector (and your wife's) could well take the view that you have merely used your wife as a nominee or puppet, so that any gains are assessable upon you alone. You have the right to appeal, as outlined in the free pamphlet IR37 (Income tax and capital gains tax: appeals), but we doubt if you would succeed. To make clear that your wife is acting on her own initiative, and that your gift of shares reflects a bona fide wish to give her a measure of financial freedom, it is preferable that no sale take place until after the shares have been registered in her name for some time. The proceeds, and any dividends in the meantime, should be credited to an account in your wife's sole name (to which you have no access). None of the money should find its way back to you, even indirectly. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

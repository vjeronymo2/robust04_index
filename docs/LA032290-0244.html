			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW DIVES 32.21 AFTER BIG SELL-OFF IN JAPAN  </P> <P> Wall Street lost its immunity today to the big stock sell-off in Tokyo, closing  sharply lower after a rapid dive in the afternoon.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 32.21 points at 2,695.72, but  above its low for the session. At around 2:25 p.m. EST, the index had fallen as  low as 2,678.60, off 49.33 points.  </P> <P> Declining issues outstripped advances by around 3 to 1 on the New York Stock  Exchange, with 1,194 down, 358 up and 410 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 175.93 million shares, up from 130.99 million in  Wednesday's session.  </P> <P> Losers outpaced gainers by a 4-to-1 margin.  </P> <P> It was the third straight decline on the New York Stock Exchange, following a  vigorous rally in recent weeks.  </P> <P> Traders awoke in New York to find the Tokyo market had dropped by 3.13%,  bringing its loss so far this year to about 23%. New York investors could not  withstand the pressure of Tokyo's loss and began taking profits.  </P> <P> "It's a belated reaction to the Japanese market," said Charles Jensen, an  analyst for MKI Securities Corp. "We've been ignoring that market for a couple  of weeks. You can only ignore reality for so long."  </P> <P> "The market was overextended," said Monte Gordon, vice president and director  of research at Dreyfus Corp. "You would expect the market to retrace."  </P> <P> Last week, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained a net 57.89 points to  2,741.22, its highest level since early January. The advance continued on  Monday, as the blue-chip barometer picked up another 14.41 points. But it  stalled in Tuesday's trading and the retreat was extended Wednesday and today.  </P> <P> Bond prices gained ground this morning as worries about the prolonged slide in  Tokyo's stock market attracted investors to the relative safety of U.S.  government securities.  </P> <P> The dollar's recent strong performance, tensions in the Soviet Union and  uncertainty about German unification also drew buyers to the U.S. bond market.  </P> <P> The market's benchmark 30-year Treasury bond spurted 5/8 point, or $6.25 per  $1,000 in face value, more than recouping Wednesday's loss of 3/8 point.  </P> <P> Its yield, which goes down when prices go up, fell to 8.43% from 8.49% late  Wednesday.  </P> <P> "I suppose that we could probably describe it best as some form of flight to  quality," said Robert Brusca, an economist and fixed-income analyst at Nikko  Securities Co. International Inc. "People are reminded that the United States  continues to play a strong power role in the world economy."  </P> <P> Weakness on Wall Street in the aftermath of another tumble on the Tokyo Stock  Exchange also benefited bonds.  </P></p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Sherlock loses battle with NFC old guard: Pay-out for transport group chief could reach Pounds 750,000 Mr Peter Sherlock has resigned after just 18 months at the helm of NFC, the UK's largest transport and logistics group. He could receive up to Pounds 750,000 in compensation. The former Bass director had been brought in to shake up a company controlled by long-serving NFC executives, but ultimately the old guard won. Mr Sherlock was on a three-year contract and was paid Pounds 254,618 last year. NFC would give no indication of the likely compensation being negotiated, but it will substantially exceed the Pounds 395,000 he received in 1992 from his similarly sudden departure from Bass. The NFC share price fell 14 1/2 p to 185 1/2 p on the announcement, which was accompanied by disappointing third-quarter profits figures. NFC would provide no reasons for the departure of its chief executive but it follows a dramatic clash of personality and strategy with fellow director Robbie Burns, who resigned in May after 23 years with NFC. Mr Burns has now agreed to rescind his resignation. Mr James Watson, chairman, and Mr Trevor Larman, finance director, will cover the chief executive's responsibilities until a replacement is found. NFC, formerly National Freight Corporation, was bought from the government by its employees in 1982, and has made significant efforts to retain a large employee shareholder base and a paternalistic management culture. Mr Sherlock was the first outsider to be brought in at a senior management level. He had been expected to provide a fresh perspective and implement a shake-up of what appeared to be a complacent top management. Six of the company's directors have been with NFC for more than 20 years and the commitment to change appears to have been far from unanimous. Mr Sherlock made himself unpopular with the former chairman, Sir Peter Thompson, who attacked NFC's handling of a Pounds 263m rights issue last December, which diluted the proportion of shares held by employees. One of NFC's corporate quirks is that employee shareholders enjoy double voting rights so long as they collectively retain more than 10 per cent of its shares. That barrier is now almost breached, and Sir Peter claimed NFC's traditional values were being put at risk. Mr Sherlock also faced the opposition of Mr Burns, who had been successful in building up Exel, NFC's logistics business, which arranges the distribution of goods for producers and retailers, and was the engine behind NFC's profits growth. Mr Sherlock was also beginning to disappoint the City. Yesterday's profit statement was well below analysts' expectations. NFC reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 76.6m for nine months to July, against Pounds 63.2m in the same period last year. Lex, Page 14 Background, Page 16 London stocks, Page 30</p>

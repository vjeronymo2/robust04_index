			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Retail sales growth slows again The annual rate of growth of retail sales in Britain slowed in August for the second month in succession, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday, fostering hopes that the Treasury and Bank of England will delay any planned increase in UK bank base rates. The CBI said its latest survey of 449 companies with 15,000 outlets in the retail, wholesale and motor trades came up with the slowest year-on-year rate of growth for high-street sales since retailers first reported rising volumes in January 1993. The poll, which covered 266 retailers between August 16 and September 1, found 31 per cent reporting a sales increase compared with a year ago, 29 per cent a decrease, and 39 per cent no change. The resulting positive balance of 2 per cent, which the CBI considers indicative of the trend, was lower than July's positive balance of 12 per cent and June's 27 per cent. It also confounded expectations the previous month that August would see a sharper increase in sales. The CBI reported that 30 per cent of retailers found sales poor for the time of year compared with only 15 per cent saying they were good. On balance, retailers cut employment in August compared with the year before and plan further cuts. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said the slowdown 'was perhaps not surprising' because sales grew strongly in August last year. But he said retailers had been unable to raise prices as much as they expected, indicating tough competitive conditions. While retailers struggled, the 123 wholesalers surveyed reported a strong increase in sales volumes in the year to August and sales well above average for the time of year. Wholesalers have been performing well since the late spring of last year. Although they supply goods directly to institutions such as schools, hospitals and local authorities, they are becoming increasingly independent of the retail trade. But the wholesalers' strong trading performance did not prevent a fall in employment in the year to August and expectations of a further drop this month. Wholesalers also expect to cut investment slightly in the months ahead. Although the motor trades reported an increase in sales in the year to August, the positive balance of 9 per cent was much less than expected. Motor traders reported their second poorest sales performance this year. The modest increase in volumes largely reflected increased sales of parts and accessories. In spite of generally disappointing results, most retail sectors reported annual growth in sales, with off-licensees reporting the strongest volume increases for the third month running. Mail-order houses and large multiple outlets continued to do better than small multiple and single outlets, which reported sales virtually flat in the year to August. All three distributive trades expect business to improve over the next three months. But Mr Whittaker said expectations have not been fully realised in the last two surveys.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ANNUAL GROWTH IN SALES VOLUMES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Percentage balances                                    Aug  Sep  Oct  Nov  Dec  Jan  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total retailers                    +31  +25  +26  +23  +34  +15 Grocers                            +37  +59  +25  +62  +60  +39 Specialist food                     +5  -14  -15  +10  +25  -26 Off licences                        -3  +23  -41  -61  -42  +15 Clothing                           +59  +14  +51  +32  +29  +19 Footwear and leather               +37  +84  +59  +12  +48 +380 Durable household goods             +3  -16  +13  -21  +17  +20 Furniture and carpets              +53  +17  +69  -29   +8  +18 Hardware, china &amp; DIY              +14  +23   +5  +10  +29   -5 Confectionery                     +300   -8  +36  +22  -10   -1 Booksellers &amp; stationers           +22  +20  +50  +18  +48  +48 Chemists                           +37  +61  +16  +74  +83  +18 Other retail                        -3  +14  +19  +13  +25  -10 Motor trade                        +27  +15  +16  +14   -5  +50  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Percentage balances                                  Feb  Mar  Apr  May  Jun  Jul  Aug  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total retailers                  +10  +12  +22  +12  +27  +12   +2 Grocers                          +40  +37  +33  +26  +38  +39   +9 Specialist food                  -36   +4   +9  -44  +15  -12  -40 Off licences                     +19   +4  +32  +36  +43  +50  +36 Clothing                         +17  +19  +40  +28  +35   +6  +25 Footwear and leather               0  +11  +42  +75  +43  +18  +11 Durable household goods           +6  +29   +6  +17  +29  +20  +35 Furniture and carpets            +36  -38  +27   -2  +31  -34  -48 Hardware, china &amp; DIY            +12  -13   -1  +29  -15   +5   +2 Confectionery                     -1  +36  +39  +18   +4  +23   +8 Booksellers &amp; stationers         +17  +47   +2   -5  +42  +23  -19 Chemists                          -8  -31  -53  -39   -5  +38  +12 Other retail                     -38   -4   +7  +13  +28  +15   +2 Motor trade                      +45  +22  +24  +16  +12   -2   +9  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- balance = % reporting an increase minus the % reporting a decrease in sales compared to a year ago  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. NAVY  </P> <P> This letter is in response to the one written by Joe Galliani of Long Beach  (May 23) regarding his diatribe against the United States Navy.  </P> <P> While I can accept skepticism about our public affairs policies from someone  obviously not familiar with the system, I cannot accept being called "fat,  arrogant, impotent and clueless." I joined the Navy five years ago to serve my  country and to try to improve my experience and education level. I have done  so, but the price has been a taxable income of $12,000 last year. I also  receive about $630 a month to subsidize my rent of $660 per month.  </P> <P> I have a wife and two small children, and I have spent over 18 months away from  them at sea, twice for six months at a time. My shipmates and I work 10-12  hours a day, longer at sea, in a dangerous and generally thankless environment.  One comfort we have is the general belief that the American public knows of our  sacrifices (danger, low pay, family separation) and appreciates it.  </P> <P> Recent events such as the people of Long Beach contributing funds to the  families of the men killed on the Iowa and the Torrance Armed Forces Day parade  make Galliani's contempt for the men and women of the Navy an obvious minority  point of view. Remember, sir, trite as it may sound, those men on the Iowa,  White Plains and Enterprise died for you, too.  </P> <P> JO2 WAYNE GATES, USN  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> UCI NURSES TO VOTE ON CONTRACT OFFER  </P> <P> Registered nurses at UCI Medical Center in Orange will vote next week on a  proposed contract that would give them a 3% raise this month and another 3% in  May, as well as increased benefits.  </P> <P> The nurses' two-year contract with the state expired last week while talks  between the university and the nurses' union continued in Berkeley.  </P> <P> Earlier, the university had offered UCI nurses a 2% raise now and 3% in May.  </P> <P> Nurses at the medical center have said they would need at least a 10% raise to  earn as much as nurses at other University of California medical centers. About  950 nurses at UCI are expected to vote Monday and Tuesday on whether to accept  the contract.  </P> <P> Highlights of the proposed contract for nurses at UCI Medical Center include  $100 a month extra pay for nurses with advanced certification in specialty  areas and increased pay for working during the evening and at night, Maureen  Anderson, a spokeswoman for the California Nurses Assn., said.  </P> <P> The proposed contract would bring the basic pay for UCI registered nurses to  between $31,840 and $60,026, depending on experience and skill, and between  $39,300 and $66,010 for nurse practitioners.  </P> <P> After weeks of negotiations, tentative contracts were written this week for  nurses at each of the university's five medical centers and various campus  clinics, Anderson said. Nurses at all of the university's hospitals and clinics  work under the same basic contract, with separate pay and benefit provisions  added for each campus. TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

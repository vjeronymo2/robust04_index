			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD SPORTS SCENE;  </P> <P> 10-YEAR-OLD MIGHT MEET HER MATCH ON TV  </P> <P> Television talk show host David Letterman wants to take a shot at a 10-year-old  girl.  </P> <P> Her name is Natasha Dennis, the goalkeeper for an under-12 girls' soccer team  in Lewisville, Tex., who received worldwide attention when two fathers of  children from another team wanted to check her gender. She said someone should  check between their ears. Touche.  </P> <P> Now, Letterman would like to put her in goal on his show and see whether she's  a match for him.  </P> <P> Calling her with advice last week was the goalkeeper for the U.S. national  team, Tony Meola, who is playing this season for Watford in the English League.  </P> <P> "I just wanted to encourage her," he said by telephone from England. "It's her  generation that's going to help make soccer popular in the United States, and I  didn't want her to be discouraged by an unfortunate situation."  </P> <P> Also participating in the call to Natasha was John Harkes, a midfielder for the  U.S. team who plays for Sheffield Wednesday in the English League. The call was  arranged by Harkes' agent, Shelli Azoff of Beverly Hills. Meola and Harkes were  teammates on junior teams in New Jersey.  </P> <P> "I told Natasha about a girl who played on one of our teams," Meola said.  "There was a lot of controversy because she was the only girl in the league.  There were no teams then for girls. But she stuck with the sport and became an  All-American at Rutgers."  </P> <P> Meola wouldn't reveal the advice that he gave to Dennis about defending against  Letterman.  </P> <P> "It's a secret," he said.  </P> <P> The announcement last week that Du Pont has bailed out the professional cycling  race on the East Coast that formerly was known as the Tour de Trump by signing  a three-year sponsorship agreement was not good news in Spain.  </P> <P> The May 9-19 Tour Du Pont will coincide with the final 11 days of the Tour of  Spain. That race has been considered the third most prestigious behind the Tour  de France and the Tour of Italy.  </P> <P> But Michael Plant, executive director of the Du Pont race, said that he has  heard from a number of top teams that are considering competing in the United  States instead of Spain despite a significant difference in prize money.  </P> <P> "I think the Spanish are very intimidated by what we're doing," he said.  </P> <P> In its third year, the U.S. race already has the fourth-largest purse, with  cash and merchandise prizes equal to $250,000. Spain offers $450,000. But Plant  said cyclists prefer to race in the United States because of the amenities.  </P> <P> "Would you rather come here and stay in first-class hotels every night or go to  Spain and sleep in gyms?" said the U.S. race's publicist, Steve Brunner.  </P> <P> Plant, a former speedskater who serves as chairman of the U.S. Olympic  Committee's Athletes Advisory Council, recently returned from a one-day visit  to Cuba with two other former U.S. athletes, swimmer Mary T. Meagher and  weightlifter Bruce Wilhelm.  </P> <P> Like a seven-member group from the Canadian Olympic Assn. that also recently  toured Cuba, Plant said that he and his two companions were satisfied with the  Cubans' preparations for next summer's Pan American Games in Havana and  Santiago.  </P> <P> He said that he will deliver a positive report to the U.S. sports federations,  which will meet in Chicago on Dec. 1 to discuss the situation. Anticipating  substandard living and playing conditions, officials in some sports have  indicated reluctance to send athletes to Cuba.  </P> <P> "Based on what we saw, there is no reason for the USOC to take a position of  not going to the Pan American Games," Plant said. "If some individual sports  decide not to go, that's their decision. But I don't think there's any  legitimate excuse."  </P> <P> The USOC's unprecedented decision to suspend funding to one of its governing  bodies, the Bobsled and Skeleton Federation, could cost the federation as much  as $400,000, about half its annual budget.  </P> <P> In its investigation into alleged financial improprieties, the USOC learned  from one member of the federation's board of directors, John Miller, that there  has been no detailed treasurer's report for years. Miller told the Associated  Press that former treasurer Jean Chaintreuil once stood before an annual  meeting and read from a piece of crumpled paper that he had pulled from his  pocket.  </P> <P> "That was the report," Miller said.  </P> <P> Notes  </P> <P> The British Amateur Athletic Board is campaigning to have athletes who test  positive for anabolic steroids suspended for four years. "It only seems like  yesterday since (Ben) Johnson got banned, and he will return to competition  amid a lot of hype," said Tony Ward, spokesman for the BAAB. He criticized  International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch and  International Amateur Athletic Federation President Primo Nebiolo for sending  welcome-back messages to Johnson.  </P> <P> The International Equestrian Federation has recommended that its competition at  the 1992 Summer Olympics remain in Barcelona despite an African equine fever  that has spread into southern Spain and killed more than 1,200 horses in three  years. The FEI considered moving the equestrian events to another European  city, but the European Commission's veterinary experts found that the area  around Barcelona was free of the sickness. . . . In France's biggest sports  scandal, Jean Claude-Darmon, the promotions director of the French soccer  federation, was charged last Friday with forgery, receiving stolen goods and  misappropriation of funds. After his release on bail of $200,000, he made a  brief stop at a Marseilles synagogue to pray, then boarded a plane for an  unknown destination.  </P> <P> Sampdoria of Genoa remained in first place in soccer's Italian League after a  4-1 victory Sunday on the road against Maradona's Naples team, the defending  champion. Salvatore Schillaci, Italy's World Cup hero, scored three goals in  Juventus of Turin's 5-0 victory over AS Roma. In Italy's version of the  USC-UCLA game, Inter-Milan beat AC Milan, 1-0. . . . A team of part-timers from  the Irish League almost upset the English League professionals in an all-star  game last week. Queen's Park Rangers forward Roy Wegerle, a South African who  wants to play for the United States in the 1994 World Cup and is trying to  obtain U.S. citizenship, spared the English embarrassment by scoring with 30  minutes remaining in the 1-1 draw.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Principals Have a Cow Over Bart: Spiky-headed cartoon antihero Bart Simpson has  been kicked out of two schools in different parts of the country.  </P> <P> The principals of Cambridge Elementary School in Orange and Lutz Elementary  School in Fremont, Ohio have discouraged students from wearing T-shirts bearing  the likeness of the bug-eyed 10-year-old star of "The Simpsons." At issue is a  shirt that boasts, "Under-achiever and proud of it, man." The principals say  Bart teaches kids the wrong lesson, and that the Simpsons are not an  appropriate family model for youngsters. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FIRED CSUN PROFESSOR PRAISED BY COLLEAGUES AT APPEAL  </P> <P> A Cal State Northridge professor appealing his dismissal for running an alleged  grade-selling scheme was described by colleagues Monday as honest and  hard-working during testimony before a state personnel board judge.  </P> <P> The professor, Eleazu S. Obinna, was fired last summer for allegedly promising  A grades to students in an upper-division Pan-African studies course in  exchange for selling $100 worth of raffle tickets to benefit a foundation he  headed. Obinna's appeal hearing, which began in November, resumed Monday after  a two-month delay.  </P> <P> "My opinion is that he is the hardest working professor in Pan-African studies  and one of the hardest working professors on this campus," said Ronald L.F.  Davis, a CSUN history professor specializing in black history. "He's one of the  few professors who was on campus five days a week."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Claims Not Believed  </P> <P> Davis and Pan-African professor Tiyo Soga said that they did not believe that  Obinna was involved in the grade-selling scheme. Obinna, a 17-year, tenured  faculty member, has in the past denied any wrongdoing.  </P> <P> Davis said that Obinna had made some enemies at the university because Obinna  was blunt and outspoken in his criticism of colleagues and superiors.  </P> <P> During testimony in November, four students said that Obinna and former  instructor Willie J. Bellamy had told them that the only work required during a  field studies course last spring semester was to sell 20 $5 raffle tickets for  the United Crusade Foundation. The four students said they were told that no  other work was required.  </P> <P> Bellamy, who was also fired, did not appeal. He also has denied the  allegations. During earlier testimony, Bellamy said that students were required  to attend two field trips, provide volunteer community service and write a  two-page report.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Notes Taken  </P> <P> An auditor with the state attorney general's office took notes during the  hearing Monday before Administrative Law Judge Byron Berry. Deputy Atty. Gen.  James Cordi said that his office is gathering information in the case, but he  would not comment further.  </P> <P> Students began complaining to university officials about the alleged ticket  selling in April of last year, according to university documents. After a  campus investigation, CSUN President James Cleary notified Obinna in May that  he was being fired for "unprofessional conduct and dishonesty," as well as for  lying about the grade-selling scheme.  </P> <P> Obinna's appeal hearing is to continue through Thursday. He will continue to  draw his salary during the appeals process, university officials said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Amy Pyle contributed to this story.  </P></p>

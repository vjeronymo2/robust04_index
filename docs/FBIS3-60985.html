Hizballah members have attacked and killed 10 of  Democratic Party of Kurdistan Leader Mas'ud Barzani's  supporters. What has drawn attention is that the Hizballah  attacks began after Mas'ud Barzani condemned the Kurdish Workers  Party [PKK].    2. The Hizballah movement in northern Iraq is still a weak  organization, but it is gradually gaining strength. Ethem  Barzani, who is a member of the Barzan tribe, is one of the  important members of the Hizballah.    3. The socialist group headed by Rasul Mahmud is gradually  becoming militant in nature. That group has been clashing with  Mas'ud Barzani's men.    4. Mas'ud Barzani's relations with Patriotic Union of  Kurdistan Leader Jalal Talabani have deteriorated. It is  difficult to predict how effective the chairmanship council that  Barzani and Talabani have established to prevent clashes between  the two sides will be.    The question at the present time is as follows: How will the  maintenance or the withdrawal of the Hammer Force affect the  present situation in northern Iraq?    Siyamet Muzuri, one of the Hizballah leaders in northern  Iraq, on 29 May told MILLIYET correspondent Namik Durukan the  following: "The day when we shall take control of northern Iraq  is very near. Our relations with the federal government are not  favorable at the present time. That is because the government  members prefer the secular system, as is the case in Turkey."    Muzuri openly praised Iran and said that "Ayatollah Khomeyni  taught us our objectives."    The radical groups in northern Iraq are gradually becoming  more and more aggressive. Furthermore, they seem to be inclined  toward establishing a front against Mas'ud Barzani. That front  will also include the PKK. Meanwhile, Talabani continues to be  an unreliable leader.    Obviously, the armed radical organizations will become more  effective if instability worsens as a result of confusion or  civil war in northern Iraq. Consequently, there will be a  gradual increase in the forces interfering in the developments  in that region. Obviously, the Hizballah groups and the PKK, by  nature, are eager to have such a situation prevail in northern  Iraq.    It is a fact that the Hammer Force safeguards northern Iraq  against Saddam Husayn's regime in Baghdad. However, that force  also helps the "moderate" Barzani-Talabani administration  maintain a relatively stable situation in that region.  Naturally, as far as Turkey is concerned, Barzani is a more  important leader.    The reason why the PKK and the Hizballah groups in northern  Iraq are opposed to the Hammer Force is as follows: They want  instability to worsen and a wave of confusion or internal war to  sweep through the region so they can become more effective. In  fact, they may even cooperate with Saddam Husayn in order to  achieve their objectives.    The destabilization in northern Iraq may result in armed  activities and create a new wave of refugees. That state of  affairs would disturb Turkey.    There is no evidence that the Hammer Force supports the PKK.  It must be pointed out that Turkish officers fly in the Hammer  Force aircraft that patrol the region. In fact, President  Demirel has said that the Hammer Force has been helpful to  Turkey by providing information for the operations the security  forces carry out in the region.    We wish that there was no justification for the presence of  the Hammer Force in Turkey. However, high-ranking officials in  Ankara regard that force as an essential factor because it is  keeping the instability in northern Iraq from becoming worse.  Furthermore, they believe that it is a "trump card" which  Turkey can use.</p>

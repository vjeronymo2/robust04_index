			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WHALE OF A WORK IN PROGRESS OFFERS GLIMPSE TO PAST  </P> <P> The newest addition to Sea World's family of whales is also the oldest -- 3  million years old, to be exact.  </P> <P> "Bony" is a nearly complete fossil of a young adult right whale that expired in  shallow coastal waters over what is now Chula Vista.  </P> <P> A temporary exhibit of the fossil was unveiled Friday at the marine park. The  display will last two or three months, while a team of paleontologists prepares  and reconstructs the whale's skeleton.  </P> <P> The exhibit is the brainchild of paleontologist Tom Demere, who manages the  fossil collections at the San Diego Museum of Natural History.  </P> <P> "When you go to a museum, you see a skeleton all cleaned and fully mounted, and  you lose that sense that it's been buried for 3-million years," Demere said.  </P> <P> This fossil is particularly interesting, he said, because it is the only one of  its kind that has been found in California.  </P> <P> The skeleton was discovered during the grading of a portion of the Rancho del  Rey housing development in Chula Vista, when earth-moving equipment chipped off  a piece of it, Demere said.  </P> <P> The developers, McMillin Communities, offered to help fund the exhibit, in  partnership with Sea World. The Museum of Natural History will provide the  paleontologists. After the exhibit closes, the fossil will join many others  unearthed at the Rancho del Rey site that are now in the museum's collections.  </P> <P> "So many times we find ourselves wearing the black hat, being the land-raper,"  said Ed Elliott, executive vice-president of development engineering for  McMillin Communities. "We're providing a free excavation for a guy like Tom, in  order to build the American dream."  </P> <P> Since grading on the development began in 1988, the team of consulting  paleontologists headed by Demere has identified fossilized remains of "the  largest sea cow that ever lived," a previously unknown species of toothless  walrus, and "the largest assemblage of fossil sea birds anywhere in the world,"  Demere said.  </P> <P> And lots of other whales.  </P> <P> "We've been collecting different kinds of baleen whales," Demere said. "We  collected a fin whale yesterday, without a head."  </P> <P> Baleen whales, which include the right whales, gray whales, and blue whales,  have a sort of vertical strainer -- the baleen -- where killer whales have  teeth.  </P> <P> Blue and gray whales trap schools of fish or bottom muck in their mouths and  force the water out, Demere said. But right whales are "passive strainers --  they're constantly skimming" as they swim along with their mouths slightly open  and water flowing out again through the baleen -- minus fish and krill.  </P> <P> "Bony" is missing his or her baleen, however, as well as the lower jaw and  flippers.  </P> <P> But fortunately for paleontology, Bony's carcass sank "en masse" before it was  further dismembered, Demere said. It landed in what paleontologists now call  the San Diego formation, a 100-foot-thick layer of sandstone deposited in  shallow coastal waters that once covered Imperial Beach, National City, Chula  Vista and part of San Diego.  </P> <P> Land animals prevalent during that time, some of whose remains are also  deposited in eastern Chula Vista, included mastodons, horses, tapirs, giant  camels, skunk, puma, and rabbits.  </P></p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries move up as dollar rebounds against yen US Treasury bonds were firmer yesterday, with a stronger dollar offsetting a tangle of mixed economic news and a moderate rise in commodity prices. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  5/16 higher at 88, with the yield rising to 7.236 per cent. At the short end the two-year note was  1/8 better at 99 19/32 , to yield 5.705 per cent. Activity continued to taper off from the heated pace set earlier in the week, when the latest boost in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve touched off a powerful rally in bond prices. A restrained tone early yesterday was partially explained by the confusing array of data and market trends. On the negative side, the Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit narrowed to Dollars 10.12bn in March from a revised Dollars 11.99bn in February, as exports rose faster than imports. The trend suggested the economy was accelerating, an unfavourable development for inflation-sensitive fixed-rate investments. For the same reason, traders were discouraged by a slight decline in claims for unemployment benefit last week. A solid increase in the Commodity Research Bureau's daily index of price movements also set off a warning bell on inflation. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's monthly report on regional business activity was a mixed bag. The overall May index showed a solid gain and the current prices-received reading nearly doubled from the previous month, suggesting manufacturers were passing higher prices on to customers. On the other hand, the prices-paid component and the employment index were lower. Also on the positive side of the ledger, the dollar rebounded strongly against the yen after weakening in overnight trading on the foreign exchange markets. The improvement came on the heels of optimistic remarks by US officials regarding informal trade talks with Japan. Soon afterwards, the long end of the yield curve retraced its early losses and pushed into positive ground. UK government bonds climbed yesterday, boosted by recent strength in the US market and by comments from Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England and from the Treasury's panel of independent forecasters. Gilts dipped in early trading on news that the volume of UK retail sales had grown by 4.4 per cent in the year to April, but recovered later. The long gilt future was up 1 1/16 points at 106 13/16 in late trading. The Treasury's 'wise men' said that they saw no need for a rise in interest rates, giving heart to the short end of the market. The December three-month eurosterling contract rose 0.20 points, implying short-term rates around 5.9 per cent by December. Mr George's warning against loosening monetary policy was seen as indicating the authorities were not prepared to jeopardise the long-term inflation outlook and this supported the long end of the market. Analysts reported renewed buying by investors in continental Europe and Japan. The 10-year gilt yield spread over bunds has narrowed in recent days from 160 basis points on Monday to 144 yesterday - a sign that investors are beginning to buy British stock. 'The market firmed, reflecting the better tone of markets around the world, which have taken heart from the US,' said Mr John Shepperd of Yamaichi. 'There is now a degree of confidence, especially in the UK, which was particularly oversold.' German bunds closed little changed in moderate turnover. Expectations of April M3 money supply data, due on Tuesday or Wednesday, kept activity muted amid rumours that it might be higher than the annualised 15.4 per cent rate of March. Sentiment was further dampened by comments from Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer, who said that 'as far as central bank interest rates are concerned, the horizon has now been cleared for a fairly long time'. While he did not rule out a further interest rate cut, many observers took this to indicate that Germany is close to reaching the bottom of the current interest rate cycle. Close on the heels of Tuesday's repo rate cut in Germany, the Bank of France lowered its intervention rate by 10 basis points to 5.40 per cent and its five to 10-day window to 6.40 from 6.75 per cent. The widely expected move had little impact on prices. Denmark also cut its repo rate by 10 basis points, highlighting that, despite forecasts of 4 per cent GDP growth this year, inflation pressures are subdued. March year-on-year inflation was 1.7 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Joseph Rajendran] </F>   [Text] Government-linked Chartered Semiconductor  Manufacturing [CSM], which today breaks ground on a US$660  million (S$1.05 billion) [Singapore currency] plant at  Woodlands, said yesterday it had signed up four joint venture  partners. It also said it would spend U.S.$100 million expanding  its existing plant, called Fab 1, at the Science Park.    For the Woodlands factory, the Economic Development Board  [EDB] is believed to be one of the partners which will fork out  part of U.S.$200 million which CSM expects to raise for phase  one of the project. This will be EDB's second major commitment  in the semiconductor business -- it has a 26 percent stake in  the U.S. $330 million Tech Semiconductor project, which is next  to the CSM site at Woodlands.    The other three partners in the CSM venture are U.S.-based  listed firms -- Rockwell International, Brooktree Corp and Actel  Corp. CSM, which is part of the Singapore Technologies Ventures  stable, will start negotiations with three other partners next  month. It expects to rope in up to six partners for the  project, called Fab 2. Plans for the plant -- which will be  Singapore's largest high-tech investment -- were announced three  months ago.    The Government, having made Singapore the world's largest  producer of disk drives, wants semiconductor technology to be  the country's strength in the next decade and is leading the way  with these projects.    Rockwell, which has been a good customer of Fab 1, designs  chips for use in aerospace, missiles and defence-electronics  systems. The company, which had 1993 sales of about U.S.$ 10.8  billion, gets most of its orders from the U.S. government.    Brooktree Corp, which grossed sales of U.S.$ 111.3 million  last year, is involved in Very Large Scale Integrated circuits  that solve complex technical problems. It also develops chips  for the multimedia industry.    Actel, with 1993 sales of about U.S.$59.6 million, designs  circuits for computers, telecom products and military equipment.    CSM's facility systems director Ang Tang Yong said yesterday  that the three partners will be "guaranteed manufacturing  capacity based on equity participation. They will also be given  preferential pricing."</p>

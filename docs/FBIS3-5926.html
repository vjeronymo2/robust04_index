The United States believes that  "Mr. Ozawa paved the way for breaking the deadlock on the mobile  phone (portable and car phones) issue." Although the itinerary  of Ozawa's visit is yet to be finalized, the government has  expressed its expectation that if Mr. Ozawa's visit takes place,  he "will surely bring compromise proposals" concerning objective  criteria designed to measure the progress in Japan's efforts to  open its markets.    The U.S. Government has received information on Mr. Ozawa's  visit through reports in the mass media as well as from the U.S.  Embassy in Japan. According to a U.S. Government official, Mr.  Ozawa will arrive in Washington on 21 March with the ostensible  aim of granting a request for a speech. The same official has  also said that the United States "has been sounded out" by Mr.  Ozawa on his intention to meet with senior U.S. Government  officials, including President Clinton, as well as congressional  leaders.    The U.S. Government has also been eager to improve relations  with Japan since the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks in February. A official at the U.S. Trade  Representative Office said that "Mr. Ozawa took action" under  the situation. Regarding the report on Ozawa's visit to the  United States, U.S. Congressmen who take a hard-line stance  against Japan, including House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt,  and U.S. Government officials stated the following: "Mr. Ozawa  reportedly plans to come to the United States to pave the way  for resuming the framework talks;" and "he reportedly intends to  accept the U.S. proposal for setting sector- by-sector objective  criteria as endeavor indicators if the United States promises  not to use such criteria for the purpose of imposing sanctions  against Japan."    However, the Foreign Ministry, the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry, and the Japanese Embassy in the United  States have reiterated: "We have not heard of such a plan.  This is not Prime Minister Hosokawa's intention, nor is it a  government policy. Mr. Ozawa's visit to the United States has  not been decided." If this is true, the current reports prove  that the U.S. Government cherishes excessive hope for Mr.  Ozawa's visit and that the two governments have now lost most of  their channels of communication.    The first task of Deputy Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs  Hayashi -- who has succeeded former Deputy Vice Minister  Koichiro Matsuura and who is scheduled to hold talks with U.S.  officials in charge of the framework talks in Washington this  week -- is to normalize channels between Japan and the United  States to dispel such misunderstandings. The current atmosphere  is such that if the channels are not normalized, the mistrust  between the two countries which followed in the wake of the the  summit meeting in February may worsen.</p>

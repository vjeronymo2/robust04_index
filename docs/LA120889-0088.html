			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Navistar International Corp.: The Chicago truck maker said net income for  fiscal 1989 dropped 64% from last year to $87 million. Revenue was $4.2  billion, about the same as last year. The company reported a fourth-quarter  loss of $13 million, contrasted with a profit of $82 million in the same period  a year ago. Navistar officials attributed the decline in earnings to reduced  industrywide demand for medium and heavy trucks, and to pressure on truck  margins from higher component costs. The company said earnings for the year  were also lowered by costs incurred in assimilating a line of 27 new truck  models.  </P> <P> Tables, D8  </P></p>

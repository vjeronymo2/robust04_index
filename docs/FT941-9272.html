			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Yeltsin balks over Nato's threat to Serbs President Boris Yeltsin yesterday raised strong objections to the threat of air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. He warned Nato it would not succeed in ending the conflict without full Russian agreement. After talks in Moscow with Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, Mr Yeltsin held back from outright rejection of the Nato ultimatum to the Serbian forces besieging Sarajevo. British officials said the Russian president was keeping open his options in the event that air strikes were launched after the Nato deadline runs out at midnight on Sunday. Mr Yeltsin has made clear he sees air strikes as a last resort. In Moscow, officials in the presidential administration said Russian troops under UN command in former Yugoslavia had been told not to obey orders given to them by their UN superiors until cleared by Moscow. At least one order had already been countermanded, they said, when Russian troops in Eastern Croatia refused an order to move nearer to the front line around Sarajevo. The Russian president, who appeared angry at the precedent set by the West in issuing a unilateral military warning, told journalists at the Kremlin yesterday: 'Some people are trying to resolve the issue on Bosnia without the agreement of Russia. This will not succeed. We will not allow that.' But, in his first public comments on last week's decision, Mr Yeltsin did not demand explicitly that the UN security council pass another resolution before launching any military action. He also threw Russia's weight behind efforts to lift the seige of Sarajevo. But he drew a distinction between air strikes called in self-defence of UN forces in Bosnia - which Moscow approved - and the wider remit of the Nato decision. He warned the West against attempting to impose a military solution to a conflict that could only be ended at the negotiating table. He added: 'Russia will take part actively in talks to bring a peaceful solution  . I am glad Mr Major supports our view on that.' A presidential spokesman said air strikes might be seen by the Russian public as a sign that last month's Partnership for Peace programme agreed by Nato and former Warsaw pact countries opened the door to US domination. Mr Major, the first Nato leader to meet Mr Yeltsin since the air strikes ultimatum was issued, was anxious to reassure his host. He told journalists: 'Before air strikes proceed on this very limited front there would need to be a reference back, under previously agreed security council resolutions, to the secretary-general.' Mr Major acknowledged that the search for a political settlement must involve active Russian participation. But British officials said the UK would oppose any move by Russia to force a vote in the security council on air strikes.</p>

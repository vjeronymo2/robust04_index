			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Books: Catch-22 in apocalyptic mode - Fiction CLOSING TIME by Joseph Heller Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 14.99, 464 pages Closing Time starts like Catch-22: Yossarian is in hospital, flirting with his nurse and thinking about death. ''We can't find anything wrong,' they told him. 'Keep looking,' he instructed. 'You're in perfect health.' 'Just wait,' he advised.' The difference is that Yossarian is now an old man suffering from 'late-life depression'. So is this the same Joseph Heller whose first novel, 33 years ago, gave a catch-phrase to the world? Heller must know the question well. ''You sound so bitter these days'', a friend says to Yossarian. ''You used to be funnier.'' True, this is a bitter novel, and not so 'funny' as Catch-22, nor, I think, is it intended to be. Much has been made of Closing Time being the 'sequel' to that first, best-selling masterpiece, but the point should not be over-stated. Yossarian, the Armenian bombardier with a healthy fear of being killed, is 68, still has sex on his mind, and is contemplating a third marriage. Milo Minderbinder, the mess officer who takes capitalism to extremes, has prospered beyond all dreams and, with his son M2, is developing an invisible, super-Stealth bomber. The Chaplain is discovered in old age to be passing heavy water and to have tritium in his flatulence: Milo says, 'We will patent the chaplain as soon as we find how he works, and we are looking for a trademark. We are thinking of a halo . . .' But be warned that there is no return for Major Major, Colonel Cargill, General Dreedle or Doc Daneeka. Instead there are two Jewish friends from Coney Island, Sammy Singer and Lew Rabinowitch; Noodles Cook, the hopeless publicist who goes to work in the White House; an all-knowing private eye; assorted wives and nurses; and Little Prick, the US President, whose passion for video games eventually brings the world to an end. There is much re-visiting - and re-working - of the wartime episodes of Catch-22, and, for today, lurid descriptions of the nightmare squalor of 1990s New York. It is a sprawling, scarcely coherent jumble of a book, bursting with ambition and imagination. Parts of it are excellent. By far the best chapters have to do with Sammy and Lew. Sammy Singer, who had only a tiny part in Catch-22, is widowed, melancholy, plucky, an early-retired copywriter: 'I never thought I'd be this old, wake with stiff joints, and have nothing really to occupy myself with most days but my volunteer fund-raising work for cancer relief.' Lew Rabinowitz, an entirely new creation, is an ex-infantryman who is dying  - again, brave and jesting  -of Hodgkin's Disease ('I'm sick of feeling nauseous'). In these two characters, and especially in their memories of their Coney Island boyhood, Heller has returned to his own roots and has rarely seemed better. The problem comes when he switches into apocalyptic mode, as Yossarian observes the preparations for a grotesque society wedding in, of all places, the Port Authority Bus Terminal. This leads him down into a Dante-esque Underworld, a Hell where he meets up with the dead and chooses to escape, only to emerge into nuclear holocaust. Heller has attempted nothing so bold, and fails, because, in contrast with the sustained comic satire of Catch-22, in Closing Time he lurches between realism and surrealism with only the certainty of ever-closer death, for individuals as well as for our world, to hold them together. 'I'm well into my sixties and we're into the nineties, and this time I'm beginning to feel . . . that this time things are beginning to come to an end.' Incidentally, we are told what happened at the ending of Catch-22. After the Chaplain, at Nately's funeral, saw the vision of a naked angel in a tree, Yossarian (who was in the tree) ran away from the war; he was caught, sent home, and promoted to Major because the Air Force didn't want a fuss. ''I didn't get far. I couldn't even get to Rome'. 'You didn't escape there? In a little yellow raft?' 'That happens only in the movies . . .' '</p>

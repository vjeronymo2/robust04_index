			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / US seeks OECD foreign bribes ban: Many countries wary of extending laws beyond their own frontiers The US will this week demand that other industrial countries follow its example by outlawing bribery of foreign officials. At a meeting in Paris of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, US officials plan to propose a set of binding recommendations to take much tougher measures against bribery. But other member countries fear that by rejecting the less stringent recommendations that the OECD's own task force has been working on for four years, the US may delay the adoption of international standards. While almost all countries outlaw bribes to their own officials, the US with its Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is the only country which criminalises bribery of another country's officials. Most other countries are more wary than the US about extending their laws outside their own territory. US State Department officials complain that, apart from the negative effects of bribery in the developing world, US companies bidding for contracts around the world are set at a competitive disadvantage to companies permitted to bribe. Their proposals would require OECD countries to make bribery of a foreign official a criminal offence, and ensure that companies were not allowed to deduct the bribery costs from their taxable income. Mr Dan Tarullo, assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs, told other OECD members at a recent meeting in Paris that the US was disappointed with the 'lax approach' by the organisation's working group on illicit payments. 'The most recent meeting of the group suggests that some members prefer to minimise the problem and to dilute efforts to address it,' he said. A senior US official said the OECD working group's recommendations amounted to a shopping list from which countries could pick one or two measures, and needed to be made more binding. Officials from other OECD countries, however, say the US is seeking to raise the stakes from the level it accepted some months ago. They fear this may make it impossible to finish work on their proposals at their meeting on Thursday and Friday. Some officials speculated that the US initiative might even prevent the completion of bribery rules in time for ministers to ratify them at next June's OECD meeting.</p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA'S TOMORROW: A NEW SYSTEM OF VALUES  </P> <P> Values flow beneath the surface of our consciousness like great Pacific  currents. Nothing cuts more directly to this vast inner realm of choice than  the question of taxation.  </P> <P> Money is one of the two or three great and powerful mysteries of human culture.  In social and political terms, money raised from taxes emerges as the most  powerful force we own and administer in common. Alexander Hamilton saw this  from one perspective. The power to tax, he said, is the power to govern.  </P> <P> Thus when we Californians tax one another through legitimate agencies of  government, we express the profundity of the ties that bind us together.  Without money, without taxes, there is no res publica, no public thing, no  common identity or commonweal. The old-fashioned English word commonwealth  expresses this point perfectly.  </P> <P> In California this question of "common wealth" has an even more powerful  valence because we are a complex, multi-ethnic society. We constitute, in fact,  what might very well be the first successful polycultural commonwealth in these  United States -- a commonwealth that takes no one ethnic or cultural tradition  as its preemptive norm but seeks instead to empower social and political  structures that function efficiently on behalf of all individuals and all  groups.  </P> <P> In terms of lessons from the past, the relationship between value and taxation  in California is fascinating. It also holds a few surprises. California, for  instance, woefully underfunded education, especially secondary education, in  the middle and late-middle 19th Century. Not until the 1890s was there anything  resembling a flourishing high school system in place. Americans of that era  tended to leave school after the primary grades.  </P> <P> And 19th-Century Californians were also slow to spend proper funds on flood  control. Prof. Robert Kelly of UC Santa Barbara, in his forthcoming book,  "Battling the Inland Sea," writes about how state engineer William Hammond Hall  struggled unsuccessfully in the 1880s to encourage a workable statewide water  plan. Only by the late 19th Century did it finally dawn on the political  community that water was the paramount public issue facing the state. Even  then, it took another two decades and more before anything truly creative was  done about it.  </P> <P> Twentieth-Century California reversed itself on water and education. By the  1960s, in fact, we had largely defined public state culture in terms of the  excellence of the statewide water program, educational system and highways.  </P> <P> These programs -- water, education and highways -- were empowered by vision and  values. Each served the creation of California as a mega-state with a  population moving toward 25 million. The heroes of this era were creating a  society that could support a large educated population, with a level of  physical mobility unprecedented in any previous culture -- a mobility, in fact,  making automobiles and freeways the very symbols of a new world called  California.  </P> <P> Crime and social deviance was the exception in that era; today they become  increasingly the rule. We plan vast prison systems and we raise the money  through bond issues to build them without even allowing ourselves the luxury of  lamenting the crime waves that make all this necessary. As I understand it,  California has a higher portion of its population in prison than any other  commonwealth on the planet. Our predecessors planned for the future; we are  forced to plan for the social disaster of crime and its aftermath.  </P> <P> We are also beset by the necessity of responding, through tax-supported  programs, to other socially catastrophic problems: drugs; the breakdown of the  family; the epidemic of violence including sexual abuse against children; the  social effects of alcoholism ranging from deaths on the highways to industrial  accidents to declining productivity; the increase of the severely mentally  disturbed howling on our streets, and the new phenomenon, homelessness,  displaying an intensity of visible suffering and disorder unprecedented since  the long lines of the Great Depression.  </P> <P> A recent report in San Francisco newspapers describes how the social effects of  crack, joining with the health-care costs of the AIDS epidemic, could possibly  bankrupt the city. Neither crack nor acquired immune deficiency syndrome were  even heard of 10 years ago, and yet today they pose a substantial social and  economic threat.  </P> <P> As a taxpayer I have my own shopping list of values. First, I believe there  resides in most California taxpayers a pervasive suspicion of large-scale  public works or bureaucratic structures as solutions to problems. Thus we can  expect to see taxpayer resistence to the construction of the peripheral canal  as a solution to the state's water problem; to the construction of a massive  multi-billion-dollar public transit system or heroic augmentation of existing  highways as a solution to gridlock in Southern California and elsewhere; to the  construction of block public housing; to the construction of more and more  buildings as a solution to educational problems; to the construction of more  and more prisons as protection against crime.  </P> <P> One can expect, rather, an emphasis on programs as opposed to construction,  solutions based on more sophisticated software as opposed to further hardware.  Thus water-use patterns will be dramatically modified through tax penalties and  incentives. Thus a process already under way -- the alignment of job sites and  housing sites -- together with tax and toll systems will be used to ease the  transportation crisis.  </P> <P> In education, we will be emphasizing classroom discipline, student/teacher  contracts with incentives and enforced penalties, parental responsibility and  right of review, better teacher salaries and incentives as opposed to the  construction of more buildings. In housing, more and more incentives will be  given to developers who create affordable rental housing on unused sites  adjacent to public transportation, on marginal properties near industrial parks  or on metropolitan properties under public jurisdiction.  </P> <P> In the matter of crime, we will have reached the physical limits of  prison-building and prison capacity in the early 21st Century. There will  therefore be an emphasis on longer sentences for the violent -- the relatively  small group that repeatedly commits the truly terrible crimes -- and a growing  use of community-sponsored public service and work programs for first-time  offenders. Victims of adult crime will be awarded major financial indemnities  from those who have abused them. Lifetime liens against income will become part  of sentencing. Crime, in other words, will cease to be a free ride for the  criminal.  </P> <P> An emphasis on programmatic responses is based on a growing awareness, among  liberals and conservatives alike, of the limitations of government. Again, if  government were the solution, California would be Utopia; for we Californians  support, in comparative terms, the most developed government infrastructure in  the United States. We are, in fact, the most governed state in the nation.  </P> <P> Because each individual will be expected to put more effort into his or her own  personal survival, the disposition to favor one or another targeted social  group for special consideration will come under assault. With the exception of  a growing bias in favor of children -- the most defenseless victims of poverty,  crime and social misbehavior -- there will be a growing tendency toward a  philosophy of equity cutting across ethnic groups and generations. This will  not involve a philosophy of indifference or racial intolerance. It will,  rather, be an increasing realization that Americans cannot sort themselves out  from each other on the basis of race, creed or generation.  </P> <P> We must struggle to be fair, finding ways to reward positive behavior in every  sector of our culture. We will no longer take social misbehavior as the norm;  instead we will regard all the peoples of California as equally capable of good  and bad behavior. Thus we will cease to pay for programs out of guilt and start  to pay for programs that work.  </P> <P> California, in other words, the first true multicultural commonwealth on the  planet, might be the first state to accept in its private values and public  policies the full terror and glory of equality among its individual citizens.  </P> <P> We will continue our bias toward the environment; for Californians, the  environment has been a primary icon of identity since the days of John Muir. On  the other hand, we will harmonize environmentalism with a program of proper  growth, for we will have long since realized that a total no-growth philosophy  represents violent injustice against aspiring minorities today and future  generations of all ethnic backgrounds. Only dead entities cease to be nurtured  and to grow. The current no-growth philosophy is based, simultaneously, on a  massive selfishness and despair: selfishness regarding others who are not so  prosperous, despair of our ability to find and enforce solutions that allow for  growth that respects the environment. Thus California's already flourishing  interplay of nature and technology, high-tech and high touch, will continue to  flourish as a value system affecting the way we raise and spend our taxes.  </P> <P> Hope for a larger measure of human happiness is, after all, the fundamental  energy source for the California Dream. California is not just anywhere.  </P></p>

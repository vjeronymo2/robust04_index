			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- The great leader  President Kim Il-song's work "answers to questions raised by the  general director of the Latin America News Agency 'PRENSA  LATINA'" was carried by foreign newspapers.    It was carried by the Russian paper PATRIOT under the title  "unanimous desire of the whole nation".    It was also reported by the Russian paper PRAVDA, the  Laotian  paper PASASON, the Indonesian paper INDONESIAN OBSERVER, the  Lebanese paper AL SHARQ, the Tanzanian paper UHURU, the  Senegalese paper LE TEMOIN, the Romanian paper RIPOSTA and  magazine EUROPA, the Mexican paper LA AFICION, the Madagascan  paper IMONGO VAOVAO, the Thai paper BAN MUANG, the Cambodian AKP  News Agency, the State Radio of Guyana and the TV of Mongolia.    President Kim Il-song in the work declared that since the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula has been raised by the  introduction of nuclear weapons by the United States into South  Korea and it has emanated from the United States' hostile policy  towards the DPRK, it must be resolved through dialogues between  the DPRK and the United States.    Noting that it is the consistent stand of the DPRK to  resolve  the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through dialogues,  President Kim Il-song said pressure can never be a solution to  the problem and it is a miscalculation to think that the United  States can bring the Korean people to their knees by means of  pressure and force.</p>

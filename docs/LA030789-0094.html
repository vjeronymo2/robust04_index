			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCORSESE SEES SUPPORT FOR CONTROVERSIAL ARTWORKS  </P> <P> Film director Martin Scorsese, who came under attack in the United States and  abroad for his depiction of a vulnerable and sometimes confused Jesus in the  film "The Last Temptation of Christ," said Monday that his Academy Award  nomination for best director serves as a signal of support for other artists'  controversial works.  </P> <P> "It supports their right to make certain kinds of films and supports the  American system," said Scorsese, who was in Los Angeles Monday to receive the  Courage in Filmmaking Award from the Los Angeles Film Teachers Assn. It is the  first time the group has extended the honor.  </P> <P> The parallels between the violent reaction to "The Last Temptation of Christ"  and the outcry among Muslims to Salman Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses" were  obvious to Scorsese.  </P> <P> "I think it's a fair comparison," he said. "The reaction to 'The Satanic  Verses' is frightening."  </P> <P> Film rights to Rushdie's novel are available, but no one seems to be jumping at  the chance to adapt the controversial book to the screen. Would a film maker  take heart from the support Scorsese has received from the artistic community?  </P> <P> "It has to be made by someone who believes in it," Scorsese said. "Someone  can't make it to make a quick buck."  </P> <P> Scorsese had been committed to making "The Last Temptation of Christ" for more  than 10 years. He and screenwriter Paul Schrader began working on an adaptation  of Nikos Kazantzakis' novel in 1976 and it had come close many times to being  produced, only to be shelved, before Universal stepped up to take the heat.  </P> <P> Since the film opened last August, it has been denounced as blasphemous by  fundamentalist Christians and has been banned in India, Israel, South Africa  and Athens. Its opening in France incited violent protests.  </P> <P> Scorsese said he did not set out to provoke controversy, but he is heartened by  the fact that "The Last Temptation of Christ" "opened up a dialogue" both in  American churches and in homes.  </P> <P> "It's become a very strong tool in discussion, in making the concept of Jesus  and the religion alive and vibrant for today," he said. "That's really what I  set out to do."  </P> <P> A lapsed Roman Catholic who was educated in Catholic schools, Scorsese said he  understands the concerns of protesters, though he believes the film is not  blasphemous .  </P> <P> "We're dealing with people who, I think, mean well, to a certain extent, but  their interpretation of the Gospel adheres to the word of the Gospel, and (my  interpretation) is different," Scorsese said. "I really do understand how they  feel about it, but what surprises me is their intolerance to my belief."  </P> <P> He said he was surprised by his Oscar nomination because he feared the protests  that surrounded the film might have put people off.  </P> <P> "The film has not really been seen as a movie because of the other issues that  are in the way," Scorsese said. "Rather than a movie it became a news event."  </P> <P> Scorsese said he is particularly happy to receive an award from a teachers  group.  </P> <P> "The primary job of a teacher in America is to open the minds of the students,  make them think," he said. "Maybe that has something to do with this award."  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATVIANS STAGE RALLY FOR INDEPENDENCE IN CAPITAL  </P> <P> Hundreds of thousands of people thronged the Latvian capital of Riga on  Saturday to celebrate the small Baltic state's declaration of independence in  1918 -- and to protest its incorporation into the Soviet Union two decades  later.  </P> <P> Singing "God Bless Latvia," the national anthem, and other patriotic Latvian  songs, the crowd surged through the center of Riga to rallies where speakers  demanded independence once again from Moscow. It was the first official  observance of Latvian independence since 1940, when it was occupied by Soviet  troops.  </P> <P> The red and white flag of independent Latvia flew from most homes and public  buildings in Riga, according to Soviet journalists in the city, and tens of  thousands of people waving small flags lined the banks of the Daugava River  through the capital in a protest impressive for its solemnity.  </P> <P> "A page of history was brought back to life, preserving the memory of the  events of 1918, when the Latvian state was proclaimed," the official Soviet  news agency Tass reported from Riga in a rare appreciation of what independence  meant to the Latvians after centuries of Russian, Polish, Swedish and German  rule.  </P> <P> "We must fight for independence," Janes Chakste, the grandson of the first of  independent Latvia's three presidents, told the main rally. "Latvia must be  independent, as it was before."  </P> <P> The main complaint, as elsewhere in the Soviet Union's constituent republics,  is the deteriorating economic situation, which is matched by a conviction, also  shared by other republics, that local leaders could do better alone.  </P> <P> According to state-run Latvian television, more than 550,000 people  participated in the citywide demonstrations, although Riga has a population of  little more than 900,000 and Latvia a total population of about 2.7 million.  </P> <P> Anatoly V. Gorbunov, the republic's Communist Party chief, said in a televised  address that the independence-day observance should "unite all the people of  Latvia" and "enrich and deepen the understanding of our historical roots."  </P></p>

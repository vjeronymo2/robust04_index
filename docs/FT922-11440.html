			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / The Lex Column: The long dark tunnel Judging by yesterday's announcement, negotiations between Eurotunnel and the contractors are as delicately poised as ever. The financial position appears rather worse. Granted, Eurotunnel has effectively disabled last month's damaging ruling from the disputes panel by seeking time-consuming arbitration on the small matter of the original contract. That levels the score with the contractors, so for practical purposes the project's commercial and operational future will once again be thrashed out behind closed doors. To Sir Alastair Morton that must look reassuringly like business as usual. But the future shape of its finances has arguably never been less clear than now. It must be a matter of partial relief for the banks that accusations of mutual villainy which flew freely around two years ago are absent this time. That said, the stakes are higher, if only because Eurotunnel's ability to absorb funding problems gets smaller the nearer it gets to opening for business. Its margin for error is already a mere Pounds 870m. Hence, perhaps, the 5 per cent fall in the company's shares yesterday. Until the tunnel is producing revenues, the banks will have to grant a series of waivers to their funding agreements just to allow the company to draw on its existing facilities. Any further disputes or delays - and Eurotunnel hints there are plenty waiting to happen - will push back the point at which the project breaks even. So at this stage, any increase in the banks' lending looks decidedly unlikely. While the risk of outright foreclosure is negligible, the danger is that the banks will demand a higher price for their co-operation. For all his ingenuity, even Sir Alastair will have his work cut out to protect shareholders' interests to the finish. An eventual rights issue seems inevitable either way.</p>

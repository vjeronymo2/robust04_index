			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CHINESE SOOTHSAYERS WARN OF CIVIL WAR  </P> <P> China will teeter on the brink of civil war, the United States and Japanese  currencies will fluctuate wildly and Hong Kong residents should wear white this  summer -- at least that's what the soothsayers predict for the Year of the  Horse.  </P> <P> The horse, which took over from the snake on Jan. 27, the lunar New Year's Day,  will offer a rough ride but will handsomely reward anyone who is able to take  the calculated risk.  </P> <P> Calculations and risks are very familiar to the British colony's gambling-mad  Chinese population, but the writings of its sages surged in popularity  following Beijing's brutal crackdown on China's pro-democracy movement in June.  </P> <P> "I used to avoid talking about politics, but after June 4 people changed the  way they think and they really want to know what will happen," writes Lam Kwok  Hung, who credits himself with predicting the brutal military crackdown in  Beijing's Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> The horse comes seventh in the Chinese zodiac of 12, each with different  characteristics and a different animal as its symbol. The Chinese believe the  horse signifies speed, strength and vitality.  </P> <P> For about $1 one can purchase a red booklet sporting the photograph of  fortune-teller Lam. It contains specific instructions on how to get through the  Year of the Horse without annoying the spirits and demons.  </P> <P> Hong Kong residents wondering if they should join a steady stream of people  trying to leave the colony before it is handed back to China in 1997 can be  told if and when they should emigrate or whether it is worth staying.  </P> <P> Lam says they should wait, arguing that by 1993 China will be embroiled in a  civil war between the north and the south.  </P> <P> "So there is no need to emigrate and become third-class citizens abroad,  because when fighting breaks out, Hong Kong will become more important to China  and China will then ask Britain to administer Hong Kong for another 30 years,"  Lam says confidently.  </P> <P> And, according to another fortune-teller, the negotiators who have been trying  to work out the details of Hong Kong's future political system may as well take  early retirement.  </P> <P> "Hong Kong's political prospects are not good because there will be no major  breakthrough in diplomatic talks," says Lee Kui Ming. He adds, however, that  Hong Kong will escape a major disaster as long as its citizens take adequate  precautions.  </P> <P> "I hope people will wear white clothes during the summer to reduce the violent  atmosphere which will prevail then," he writes.  </P> <P> Many predict that thousands will take to the streets this summer, as they did  last year, in support of the democracy movement in China.  </P> <P> "In the ninth moon (Oct. 18 to Nov. 16) democratic pioneers will come out again  and shout loudly their slogans, endangering relations between China and Hong  Kong," writes Lam Chan. "I warn those democracy activists in Hong Kong to  control themselves and not to provoke China."  </P> <P> The Hong Kong Chinese soothsayers also give financial advice.  </P> <P> "This year is not good for speculation, so keep away from buying gold and  stocks and avoid the foreign exchange market," says one.  </P> <P> Lam advises cautious investment and adds that smaller companies on Hong Kong's  stock exchange will collapse. "They will not be a good buy, even if they appear  sound," he says.  </P> <P> Massive foreign currency fluctuations are predicted for May and June as well as  December and January.  </P> <P> China will approach economic ruin, Britain will perform badly but West Germany  will go from strength to strength, according to some of the soothsayers.  </P> <P> But in the next year, bold investors can take heart.  </P> <P> "By year's end," one soothsayer concludes, "the faint-hearted will be out of  the race while those with the stamina will be rewarded with runaway success."  </P></p>

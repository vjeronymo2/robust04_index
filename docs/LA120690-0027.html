			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ROWE NAMED SECOND TEAM ALL-AMERICAN  </P> <P> San Diego State wide receiver Patrick Rowe's scrapbook season continued  Wednesday when he was named to the second team of the Associated Press  All-American team.  </P> <P> In Aztec history, only wide receiver Webster Slaughter (second team, 1985) and  offensive guard Pete Inge (second team, 1978, 1979) have placed that highly on  the AP team. Defensive back Henry Williams was named second team to the United  Press International's All-American team in 1978.  </P> <P> Rowe, a junior, and Miami's Wesley Carroll are AP's second-team wide receivers.  The two named to the first team are Virginia's Herman Moore and Florida State's  Lawrence Dawsey.  </P> <P> "I'm just overjoyed," Rowe said. "I felt quite honored because it was one of my  preseason goals."  </P> <P> It turns out that when Rowe met with Curtis Johnson, SDSU receivers' coach,  before the season, he listed "honorable mention, All-American" as one of the  things he would like to accomplish.  </P> <P> "I put 'honorable mention' as a starting base," Rowe said. "And to (be) second  team, that's quite an honor."  </P> <P> But as far as AP goes, Rowe never could have made honorable mention. The wire  service did away with the honorable mention portion of its All-American team  last season. It names three teams.  </P> <P> "He deserves it. He works hard. He had a hell of a year," said quarterback Dan  McGwire, who was bypassed in favor of Heisman Trophy winner Ty Detmer,  Virginia's Shawn Moore and Houston's David Klingler.  </P> <P> Rowe finished the season with 71 passes caught for 1,392 yards and eight  touchdowns. He led the nation with an average of 126.55 receiving yards per  game and was fifth with 6.45 receptions per game. He set the NCAA record with  nine consecutive games in which he had 100 or more yards receiving, surpassing  the previous record of eight held by Howard Twilley (Tulsa, 1965) and Henry  Ellard (Fresno State, 1982), and he and Dennis Arey became only the second  receiving tandem in NCAA history to each have more than 1,000 yards receiving.  </P> <P> Rowe's 1,392 yards receiving also set Western Athletic Conference and SDSU  single-season records.  </P> <P> According to Gary Johnson of the NCAA, Rowe's nine consecutive games with more  than 100 yards receiving is considered a single-season record, and if he  continues his streak into next season it will be considered as a career record.  The NCAA currently does not have a category for consecutive 100-yard games in a  career.  </P> <P> Rowe, who was named to the all-WAC team last month, said he will return to SDSU  next season and bypass the NFL draft.  </P> <P> "I want to stay at State and get another year of experience and have another  year of school," he said.  </P> <P> And, he said, second-team All-America status still leaves room for improvement.  </P> <P> "It leaves a lot of hard work," he said. "It makes me want to become first  team, now."  </P> <P> The players were selected by AP sports editor Darrell Christian, college  football writer Rick Warner and regional AP sports writers.  </P></p>

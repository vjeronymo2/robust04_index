			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Short Lautro test that 'a monkey could pass': How sales staff are trained Ms Gillian Hurley spent what she regards as 'the worst time of her life' selling personal pensions and other life products. She worked for Henley Financial Associates, a London-based company which sells insurance on behalf of Lincoln National, a big US investment products group. Ms Hurley joined Henley in 1991 aged 20. After four weeks' sales training, she travelled around south-east England by train and taxi selling investment plans and pension products to doctors. She left disillusioned after less than a year. Her earnings, worked out on a commission basis, totalled no more than about Pounds 2,000. Ms Hurley, who now works for a City investment group, says she never knowingly gave misleading advice to clients but says that she never knew enough about the products she was selling - and crucially their possible disadvantages compared with other insurance products - to give best advice. Yet she managed to satisfy the training standards laid down by Lautro, the insurance industry watchdog, which were meant to ensure that people buying pensions and related products got a good deal. Because her salary was linked to sales Ms Hurley was under pressure to sell as many products as she could. 'I learnt to bluff my way through many situations where clients asked too many technical questions - dangerous considering I was toying with the financial future of many people,' she said. 'The product training I received was atrocious. (To satisfy the Lautro requirement) I had to take a half-an-hour test that a monkey could have passed.' Critics of the life insurance industry say the high rate of turnover of sales staff, with poor training standards and the emphasis on commission, can often lead to consumers being sold inappropriate products. According to industry estimates about half the 150,000 sales people in the industry have been in their jobs for less than two years. Many believe their training is inadequate given the complexity of the products they are selling. Mr Joel Joffe, former deputy chairman of insurance company Allied Dunbar and an advocate of higher consumer standards, said: 'The industry has in recent years increased the competence of its sales staff, but more needs to be done.' Ms Janet Trimmer, who left the industry last year after 10 years as an insurance consultant, said: 'Companies will take on just about anyone as long as they don't have a criminal record.' The industry can point to many sales staff who are happy with their conditions of employment and believe they do a valuable job, but it is not difficult to find other people with experiences similar to those of Ms Hurley. Mr Simon Evans, who worked for Henley for 18 months in the early 1990s and is now an independent financial adviser, said that the product training at Henley failed to cover what was available in the industry. As a result the products he was selling 'may not necessarily have been the best ones' to suit particular customers. Ms Margaret Kinlay, head of sales at Henley, which employs 50 staff in three offices around Britain, said she was 'sorry and surprised' to hear the complaints about training standards. She said: 'In the past Lautro has told us we were well ahead of what is required.' Mr Derek Rogers, marketing director at the UK subsidiary of Lincoln National, said his company insisted on rigorous training standards. Henley had a very good training record. Another person with a less than glowing tale of his experiences in the industry is Mr Richard Butler, who worked for two months from December 1990 at the Southend on Sea, Essex, office of the Laurentian Milldon insurance group. On the dole at the time, Mr Butler, aged 23, answered an advertisement in his local paper calling for sales staff. He said his four weeks of training emphasised not the products but sales procedures. 'You had to say to the customer: 'You know it makes sense.' If they nodded their heads or said 'yes' you were on the way to making a sale. I had to pass a test to meet the Lautro standards, but it was dead easy. You were asked a set of questions 10 minutes after having been told what the answers were.' After earning Pounds 1,400 selling three investment plans, Mr Butler left Laurentian having realised that the insurance business was not for him. Laurentian said all its 450 sales staff received 'intensive training' and that had Mr Butler stayed with the company he would have been put through more rigorous training procedures to increase his knowledge of the industry.</p>

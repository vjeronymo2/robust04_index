			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian Border Defense troops command has  information on preparations for wide-scale military actions by  Tajik opposition militants against Russian border guards in  Tajikistan. This was announced by Press Secretary of the Russian  Border Defense troop command, Colonel Aleksandr Suvorov today.    He suggested that such actions would mark the beginning of  the spring-summer attack planned by "the Tajik government in  exile." Suvorov stressed that large formations of militants were  concentrating on the Pyanj and Shuroabad areas near the border.  He did not rule out that the armed opposition in Tajikistan  could participate in actions against Russian border guards.    Suvorov stated that all actions against Russian border  guards  would fail. The command of the Russian Border Defense troops in  Tajikistan is taking all necessary measures in order to resist  possible attacks, Suvorov emphasized.    "All responsibility for the attempt to trigger off military  actions on the border will lay on those trying to hamper the  peace settlement in Tajikistan with their own lives and that of  others," Suvorov said.</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Clinton unveils healthcare for all PRESIDENT Bill Clinton last night promised the US 'healthcare that can never be taken away, healthcare that is always there' as he launched his campaign for far-reaching reforms in the US medical system. 'This healthcare system of ours is badly broken and it is time to fix it,' Mr Clinton said in an address to both houses of Congress. He said the current health system was 'too uncertain and too expensive, too bureaucratic and too wasteful. It has too much fraud and too much greed.' Mr Clinton said his plan was based on six principles: security of coverage, simplicity for patients and doctors, savings on costs, choice of doctor, quality of care, and responsibility. The core of Mr Clinton's plan is a national health card guaranteeing every US citizen a defined package of health insurance benefits, similar to that provided today by many big companies but with additional coverage of preventive medicine. Most people would be enrolled in 'health alliances' which would bring market forces to bear to bring down costs. All employers would be required to pay 80 per cent of the premiums for their workers. The plan envisages spending Dollars 160bn (Pounds 105bn) over seven years on subsidies to smaller employers, as well as Dollars 80bn to expand coverage of long term care and Dollars 72bn to pay for prescription drugs under the Medicare programme for the elderly. Mr Clinton hopes to save Dollars 285bn on existing government health programmes and to raise Dollars 105bn from 'sin taxes', such as increased tobacco tax.</p>

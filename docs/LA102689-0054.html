TO PLAY HAWTHORNE  </P> <P> The status of Friday's Bay League football game between Hawthorne and Beverly  Hills high schools will not be decided until today because of the teachers  strike in the Beverly Hills Unified School District.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills Principal Ben Bushman said the Normans will forfeit the game if  co-coaches Bill Stansbury and Dick Billingsley remain on strike. Beverly Hills,  scheduled to play host to Hawthorne at 2:45 p.m., forfeited last week's game to  Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills freshman and sophomore games with Hawthorne have already been  canceled.

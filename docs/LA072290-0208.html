			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UC IRVINE STUDENT TO HONE HER ACTIVISM AS STUDENT REGENT  </P> <P> When Jenny Doh and her family emigrated to Bakersfield from Korea in 1974,  their arrival was heralded by a banner headline and story on the front page of  the local paper.  </P> <P> But though civic leaders welcomed the city's first Korean family, other  children's curiosity was painful to the gregarious 7-year-old, who suddenly  found herself among blond, blue-eyed youngsters demanding to know why her eyes  were so oddly shaped and her nose so flat.  </P> <P> "I just shut up; I turned inward," the 23-year-old UC Irvine senior said,  wincing at the memory. By high school, though, Doh emerged from her shell. She  began to take pride in her Korean heritage, her academic and artistic  abilities, and became one of the leaders at her school.  </P> <P> Now, as the first Asian and first UCI student appointed to serve on the  University of California Board of Regents, the self-described radical feminist  said her mission is to be an effective voice for students, and especially for  women and ethnic minorities.  </P> <P> It is a remarkable opportunity -- a victory, really -- for the young political  science major who two years ago lost an ego-bruising campaign for UCI's student  body presidency to emerge as the most prominent student in the nine-campus UC  system.  </P> <P> In 1988, Doh helped organize a student coalition that sought more minority  representation in UCI's Associated Students group. Movement of University  Students for Effective Lobbying backed her unsuccessful bid for AS president.  The movement was later named 1989's outstanding political organization on any  University of California campus by the statewide Associated Students group.  </P> <P> "I may lose, but in the process, I try to get my voice heard," explained Doh,  who became an official voting regent at last week's meeting in Santa Cruz. "And  this (being student regent) is an opportunity to get my oar in the water."  </P> <P> By appearance, she would hardly be taken for a radical.  </P> <P> At the regents meetings, where decorum is studiously observed and the public is  kept at a distance, she conveys confidence and seriousness. She is always  attired in conservative business suits. Her shoulder-length black hair is  neatly trimmed. Only a waist-length braid at the nape of her neck belies the  corporate image.  </P> <P> And while Doh views herself as a crusader for the oppressed, her style has  evolved into one of building on common interests that some say portends a  future in public service or politics.  </P> <P> Serving as UCI's student ombudsman last year has helped, said UCI campus  ombudsman Ronald Wilson, who offered Doh the student job when she lost the  campus president's race.  </P> <P> "She has grown in the last year," he said. "That fire is still there, but it is  now tempered with reason, with the ability to look at both sides of an issue  rather than the side most appealing to her.  </P> <P> "Make no mistake, Jenny is a politician. And I say that in the most positive  sense. . . . In fact, I told her, 'I expect to see you as the second woman  governor of California (after his choice for the upcoming race, Dianne  Feinstein) or the first woman President,' " said Wilson, who with his family  has taken Doh under his wing.  </P> <P> Historically, radicals among the 15 previous student regents have had trouble  being taken seriously when they were perceived as too strident or identified  too closely with the UC students association, especially in the wake of student  protests in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  </P> <P> Carol Lynn Mock, the first student regent, compared the post to walking a  tightrope, saying that it was never clear whether she was to be a regular  trustee or a student representative on the 26-member board.  </P> <P> "At times, the (UC) student body council wanted the student regent to be their  voice. And at times, the regents wanted that too. The problem is that one  person cannot be representative of 130,000 students," said Mock, a senior at UC  Santa Barbara when she was named to the Board of Regents in 1975.  </P> <P> Asked at the time what her goals were, she was widely quoted as saying: "Not to  be the last student regent."  </P> <P> That angered some of the more radical UC students, recalled Mock, now 37 and an  assistant professor of political science at the University of Illinois in  Champaign.  </P> <P> Mock is generally credited with deftly negotiating the tightrope on a Board of  Regents dominated by conservatives, thereby ensuring the future of the  student's seat.  </P> <P> "If the first student regent wasn't so effective, the board may not have  continued to have one," said Bonnie Smotony, secretary to the regents.  </P> <P> Still, over the years, many members have tended to regard the student they  select as a "special-interest regent . . . (who was) only representing  students, and that what they said therefore ought to be discounted," said  former regent Vilma S. Martinez, a prominent Los Angeles attorney whose 14-year  stint on the board ended in March.  </P> <P> "I thought that was an unfair charge," she said. "They bring a perspective and  talent which the rest of us simply don't have. They are students who are on a  campus daily. They know what's going on. . . . I always listened very carefully  to what they had to say."  </P> <P> UC Irvine's 1990 Student Body President, Todd Schubert, said Doh is savvy  enough to realize she must "earn the respect" of fellow regents if she wants to  convey her views effectively.  </P> <P> "Jenny will keep that in mind and work well with the group, and at the same  time advocate students' views," predicted Schubert, 21, a senior majoring in  social ecology with an emphasis on criminal justice.  </P> <P> Issues of concern to Doh are quality education, support -- financial and  otherwise -- for students and cultural diversity. That's why she chose the  regents' special committee on affirmative action as one of her assignments  during her one-year term. She also serves on the educational policy, grounds  and buildings, and hospital governance committees.  </P> <P> As student regent, she said, she knows she'll have to balance the university's  budget realities against her radicalism and desire to help students and boost  support for women and minorities.  </P> <P> "It's tough, because I do understand what the dollars mean and how important it  is to make the (budget) numbers balance." At the same time, she said, scrimping  on education doesn't pay, asserting that California's economic health depends  on educating its people.  </P> <P> "I don't argue that we (University of California students) are getting a great  education at an affordable price. But what is a public institution's purpose if  not to provide education for the public?"  </P> <P> Doh, who postponed graduation a year to be student regent, said she plans to  get a graduate degree in women's studies. "I want to study where I can write  about women's oppression, radical feminism and issues of public policy, like  equal pay and child care," she said.  </P> <P> When she's not studying or crusading, she's like any other college student --  joking around, socializing with friends, listening to music and watching the  latest movies. "Steel Magnolias" was a special favorite of hers, friends said.  </P> <P> She also plays the cello, piano and guitar. Yet the earnest crusader emerges  even in her music.  </P> <P> Wilson said he stumbled on Doh and his 10-year-old daughter playing the folk  protest song, "We Shall Overcome."  </P> <P> Some past student regents were criticized by their peers as being too  interested in having the job on their resumes and making future professional  ties.  </P> <P> Elaine Yamaguchi, an employee for UC Students Associated, which yearly selects  the three student regent finalists, said Doh is unlikely to be one of those.  </P> <P> "A lot of times you get to be student regent and you see yourself as somewhat  exalted," said Yamaguchi. "Jenny still sees herself as one of the real people.  She has no problems being a kid."  </P> <P> After Thursday's session at UC Santa Cruz, the usual elegant reception was  planned for all the regents, top UC officials, the university chancellors and  their spouses at a nearby hotel.  </P> <P> Doh ducked out in jeans and T-shirt and went with Yamaguchi and former student  regent Jaquelyn Ross of UC Davis in search of more modest fare.  </P> <P> Asked what she would want to say of her term in office a year from now, the  bespectacled young woman knitted her brow and looked past the crowd gathered on  the Santa Cruz wharf. "To have remained true to my beliefs and the interests of  students, and have had the other regents listen to me."  </P></p>

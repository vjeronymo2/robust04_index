			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Independent set to back Mirror's bid Directors of Newspaper Publishing, owner of the Independent and Independent on Sunday newspapers, are poised to recommend to shareholders a takeover bid from a consortium led by Mirror Group Newspapers. The recommendation is likely to come on Monday, provided some remaining details can be hammered out at the weekend between the committee of independent directors and the consortium. The consortium, which holds more than 47 per cent of Newspaper Publishing, includes El Pais of Spain, La Repubblica of Italy, and a group which founded the newspapers, led by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, editor-in-chief. The consortium raised its bid last weekend from 261.6p to 350p a share, in a mixture of cash and MGN shares valuing the company at Pounds 73.65m. The bid was raised to match the sum paid earlier this month by Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers of Ireland for 24.99 per cent of the company. Mr O'Reilly has subsequently raised his stake in Newspaper Publishing to 29.99 per cent, subject to approval from the Department of Trade and Industry, and is the single biggest shareholder. He has so far been denied representation on the board, however. The consortium is arguing that access to MGN's production facilities and sharing of overheads will provide benefits to both businesses. National Union of Journalist members at the newspapers fear that, if the bid is successful, there will be heavy job losses and editorial independence will be under threat. The consortium has assured the independent directors that editorial integrity will be 'sacrosanct'.</p>

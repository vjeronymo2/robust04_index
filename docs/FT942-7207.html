			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: ACT division forms alliance with Gartner ACT Business Systems, a division of the Birmingham-based computing services company, has formed a strategic partnership in Europe with the Gartner Group, a leading US information technology consultancy, writes Alan Cane. The alliance marks a further stage in ACT's transformation from computer manufacturer to a provider of computing services. The alliance is intended to exploit the expertise of BIS Information Systems, which ACT bought last year for Pounds 94m, and ACT Logsys, part of the group which specialises in open systems for central and local government. Last year, ACT made pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.5m on sales of Pounds 108m. Gartner, once a Saatchi &amp; Saatchi subsidiary but now a US company quoted on Nasdaq, advises companies on information technology strategies. It will be the prime contractor in the new alliance, subcontracting analytical work to ACT. Mr Harvey Parr, managing director of ACT Business Systems, said he believed the division, which had sales of about Pounds 32m last year, was complementary to ACT's core financial interests.</p>

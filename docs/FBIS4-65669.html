			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Conor Cruise O'Brien article: "Puncturing the PLO </F> Illusion"]    [Text] Gaza and Jericho are in the process of being handed  over to a non-existent organisation known to the media as "the  PLO." The Palestine Liberation Organisation was set up in 1964.  It was then a cover for Syrian intelligence, which gave it  credit for Syria's own covert fedayeen attacks on Israel. The  object of the exercise, accompanied by a lavish propaganda war,  was to shame Nasir's Egypt into conflict with Israel. The  outcome was the Six Day War, in 1967.    In the aftermath of that war, the PLO was reformed on a  broader basis, and to meet a shared need of the defeated Arab  states. It became a loose association of the Palestinian  clients of the different Arab states. The need it met was an  urgent one: to provide an answer to the awkward question, put  by ordinary Arabs: "What are you going to do about Israel, now?"    The answer was: "We are giving unflinching support to the  PLO, in its continuing struggle."    As the Arab states continued to have to rely on that answer,  over the decades, the PLO became exalted to great heights, in  terms of propaganda, and richly subsidised. Every Arab summit  re-dedicated itself to the support of "the PLO, sole legitimate  representative of the Palestinian people." The PLO remained  what it had been since 1974, a loose association of factions  competing with one another in sporadic acts of terrorism against  Israel. The most important faction is -- or rather has been --  Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah, and media references to "the PLO" have  almost always meant Fatah.    The main trouble with the present fumblings over Gaza and  Jericho is that Fatah itself has now been reduced to the same  nebulous condition as that in which the PLO has subsisted for 20  years. Mr 'Arafat's daft gamble in embracing Saddam Husayn at  the time of Desert Storm cost Fatah its rich sponsors in the  Gulf. Once Mr 'Arafat no longer had the money to pay his troops,  many defected. Further defections, of more committed followers,  followed on Mr 'Arafat's second gamble: the self-government  interim agreement with Israel.    Leaflets are now being distributed in the territories, in  Fatah's name, pledging continuance of the armed struggle. Even  those who still nominally support Mr 'Arafat are locked in  inter-factional struggles. He has found it extremely difficult  to nominate the 24-member Palestinian authority that is supposed  to rule Gaza and Jericho until the elections that are supposed  to be held four months from now. At the time of writing, only  15 members have been nominated, and the best known are reported  as having accepted with reluctance.    Leaving aside the conditional promises of billions of  dollars  from the international community, Yasir 'Arafat has just one  thing going for him in the here and now: the desire of the  people in Gaza and Jericho to see the last of the Israeli  occupying troops. But once the troops are gone -- to the extent  to which they are committed to going -- Mr 'Arafat will be left  with nothing, except the odium attached, in the eyes of  Palestinians, to the terms under which the Israelis have  executed this limited withdrawal.    Under Article XVIII of the agreement signed on 4 May, "the  PLO" is committed to various forms of military co-operation with  the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) -- including joint patrols --  as well as "to take all necessary measures to prevent...hostile  acts directed against the (Jewish) settlements, the  infrastructure serving them and the (Israeli) military  installations in the area."    Such a policy runs counter to the feelings of the population  in the territories concerned -- especially the young -- and Mr  'Arafat cannot even attempt to deliver on what he has promised  to the Israelis without alienating the population he and his  dwindling band of friends are about to attempt to govern. Last  September, when the Declaration of Principles was signed in  Washington, I thought the test would be a matter of whether Mr  'Arafat's followers would be able to face down Hamas and other  organisations bent on continuing hostilities against Israel. At  the time, I assumed that Mr 'Arafat still had a substantial  following, which he might just be able to equip for such a  struggle. But he has had difficulty even in mustering the token  force of policemen required for the initial takeover of  installations abandoned by the Israelis. "The PLO" is in  manifest disarray.    For most of last week the telephone at the PLO office in  Jericho went unanswered, while reports from PLO headquarters in  Tunis tell of "a group of people inhabiting a complex of offices  who report to no one and have no idea what is to become of  them.... People who have worked for the PLO for 20 or 30 years  are just milling about, stunned."    If Mr 'Arafat tries to deliver on Article XVIII, he will be  overwhelmed by the forces arrayed against him in a renewed  intifadah. If he does not try to deliver, the IDF will --  probably informally -- resume responsibility for security in any  areas from which attacks on Israeli targets are resumed. Either  way, Mr Arafat is the loser. His first gamble, over Desert  Storm, crippled the only organisation he had: Fatah. His second  gamble, over "peace with Israel," seems certain to finish Fatah,  and Yasir 'Arafat along with it.    About the only people who have cause for any degree of  satisfaction in the immediate wake of the impending fiasco are  Israeli diplomats in Western countries, who can now say: "You  were always pressing us to give `territory for peace.' All  right, we gave some territory -- Gaza, Jericho -- and just look  what we got! No peace, only anarchy in the ceded territories and  continued hatred and terrorism, coming out of them, against us."    In the longer term, some good may follow from the puncturing  of the great illusion, of peace through the PLO and Palestinian  self-government. Once all that nonsense is dissipated -- as it  must be, even within the present year -- both Israeli and  Western minds will have to concentrate on the only solid option  that is actually attainable: peace between Syria and Israel.    In a move that escaped general attention last month amid the  orgy of hype surrounding the PLO's peace process, Yitzhaq Rabin  made the first great breakthrough towards peace with Syria.  Showing courage and vision, Mr Rabin indicated conditional  willingness to withdraw Jewish settlers from the Golan Heights.  It was through a similar willingness, in the case of the  settlers in Sinai, that Menahem Begin made peace with Egypt  possible in 1979.    In both cases, the question is one of ceding territory for  peace -- but ceding it to a former adversary who can deliver  peace, in exchange for unencumbered territory. Anwar al-Sadat  was able to do that. Yasir 'Arafat cannot. But Hafiz al-Asad  can. Mr Rabin knows that and is moving that way, with the  deliberate caution that the politics of Israel require from him.    There is hope there. But first, the remains of the PLO's  peace process will have to be carted away, and that is likely to  be an ugly business enough.</p>

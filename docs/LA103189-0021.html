			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG BEACH FREEWAY  </P> <P> More than 3,500 people homeless, 1,500-plus homes destroyed, 24 businesses  employing 500 people displaced and at least 7,000 mature trees destroyed in El  Sereno, South Pasadena and southwest Pasadena. Price tag, $1 billion.  Hurricane? Fire? Earthquake? No, Caltrans version of progress -- the Long Beach  Freeway extension!  </P> <P> You should be ashamed for endorsing such destruction without first doing your  homework. There are multi-modal approaches to transportation that have proven  to be much more effective in moving people and goods, cost much, much less and  that don't destroy the integrity of 100-year-old commmunities, like freeways  do.  </P> <P> Our thinking has been mired in concrete much too long. California needs a  visionary approach to transportation that propels its people into the 21st  Century with much greater mobility.  </P> <P> JOANNE NUCKOLS  </P> <P> Chairman, South Pasadena  </P> <P> Transportation Commission  </P></p>

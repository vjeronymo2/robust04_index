			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / BA operating profits withstand price war BRITISH Airways reaffirmed its position as one of the strongest carriers in the world yesterday as first-quarter figures showed operating profits at Pounds 108m, up from Pounds 96m, in spite of continuing price wars in the industry. At the pre-tax level, however, profits were depressed by a jump in borrowings which pushed BA's interest charge up from Pounds 8m to Pounds 42m. Pre-tax profits fell 31 per cent to Pounds 63m, down from Pounds 91m in the first quarter of 1992. BA said its passenger yield - a measure that would reflect poor sales or heavy discounting - rose by 2.3 per cent to 6.17p per person per kilometre in the three months to June 30 compared with a year earlier. Cargo rose 5.9 per cent to 15.65p per tonne per kilometre. The increased debt followed payment for a stake in US carrier USAir and a second interim dividend, which would normally have been paid as a final dividend in the second quarter. After a Pounds 442m rights issue in May, to help finance the USAir deal, borrowings were Pounds 2.14bn, a fall of Pounds 312m on a year earlier. BA continued to increase capacity ahead of demand, and passenger load factor, a measure of how full each aircraft is, fell 2.6 percentage points to 69 per cent. Sir Colin Marshall, chairman, said that business remained 'under pressure from too much capacity in the industry, offset by further exchange rate benefits'. The fall in the value of sterling against the dollar had brought a net benefit to the company of about Pounds 20m, said Mr Derek Stevens, BA's chief financial officer. 'This full year we expect to make a gain of Pounds 70m or Pounds 80m as a result of currency changes.' BA continued to cut its payroll with the number of employees falling 1.1 per cent to 49,481. It increased the number of aircraft in service by eight to 238. Mr Peter Bergius, transport analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said the figures showed BA was continuing its 'stringent cost control'. He believed the recovery in passenger yield would continue in the second quarter. Earnings per share fell from 8.1p to 6.3p on a fully diluted basis. BA's shares rose 14 1/2 p to 350p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nairobi, 26 Apr (AFP) -- Rival Somali factions have  agreed to hold a preparatory peace conference in the Kenyan  capital on May 10, a United Nations spokesman said Tuesday [26  April]. The meeting was earlier scheduled for Monday but was  postponed.    Later on Monday, representatives from Somalia's 15 main  factions met in Mogadishu and decided on the new date, the  spokesman George Bennett told AFP by telephone from the Somali  capital. The conference will bring together representatives  from the Somali National Alliance led by Mohamed Farah Aidid and  those from the group of 15 factions headed by self-styled  president Ali Mahdi Mohamed. The preparatory conference will  prepare the ground for a conference of national reconciliation  tentatively planned to take place on May 28 in Mogadishu.</p>

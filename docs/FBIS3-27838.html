The new organization will consist of cabinet ministers  instead of vice administrative ministers, as was formerly the  case with the OTO. The prime minister will serve as chief of  the new body.    The upgrading of the OTO is in line with a proposal made  last  December by a government advisory panel that the OTO be expanded  to deal more efficiently with trade complaints.</p>

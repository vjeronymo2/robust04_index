			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VAN DE KAMP TO LAUNCH PROBE OF LINCOLN SAVINGS  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp announced Monday that he intends to launch "a  far-reaching, two-pronged civil and criminal investigation" into troubled  Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan.  </P> <P> The decision to move ahead with a full-fledged investigation follows several  months of congressional and legislative hearings into the events that led to a  federal takeover of Lincoln last April following the collapse of the S&amp;L's  parent company, American Continental Corp. Salvaging the Irvine-based Lincoln  could cost taxpayers more than $2 billion -- making it the most expensive  S&amp;L bailout in history.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Van de Kamp was asked by Assemblyman Patrick Johnston  (D-Stockton) to investigate Lincoln. But the attorney general hesitated, citing  a conflict between his role as the state's top prosecutor and his job as  attorney for the state of California.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp described the conflict "as a delicate matter because of legal  barriers against taking actions counter to a clients' interests." On the one  hand, he has an obligation to prosecute possible government wrongdoers. But he  may also have to defend the actions of the same individuals in a suit filed  against the state and others by more than 22,000 customers of Lincoln.  </P> <P> Those customers -- many of them Southern California retirees -- bought an  estimated $250 million in American Continental bonds through the S&amp;L's  branches. When the company entered bankruptcy proceedings, the bonds became  virtually worthless.  </P> <P> "My office is representing the California Department of Savings and Loan and  the Department of Corporations in civil litigation where the state Treasury  faces a potential liability of a quarter of a billion dollars," Van de Kamp  said two weeks ago. At the same time, he noted that he had begun a criminal  investigation into allegations that unlicensed employees of Lincoln had sold  the bonds in violation of state law.  </P> <P> Duane Peterson, a spokesman for Van de Kamp, said the attorney general will  spell out the details of his investigation at a press conference today.  </P> <P> Peterson said that it took "lots of legal research and some innovative  thinking" to resolve Van de Kamp's conflict-of-interest problem but that the  issue had been resolved.  </P></p>

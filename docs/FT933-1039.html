			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Markets: An offshore fund without charges - Serious Money REGULAR Weekend FT readers will know how much we welcome any efforts to bring down the cost of financial services products for investors. So it is good to see Charles Schwab, the US discount broker, launching a service for investors in offshore funds. The International FundSource service is modelled on the Mutual Fund OneSource sold by Schwab in the US. The idea is that funds are sold without any initial charge, or 'front end load' as it is known in the US. Since that initial charge is often around 5-6 per cent, that can represent substantial savings. Of course, over the long run, a good investment manager can easily overcome the effect of an initial charge. The problem is that the investor does not know in advance who the good fund managers of the next few years will be; you do know what the charges are. Investing in a no-load fund, as they are called, gives you a 5-6 per cent head start. At the moment, however, the Schwab deal is rather restricted. For a start, some of the funds on offer - the currency funds from Guinness Flight and Rothschild Asset Management - already have no initial charge. Furthermore, there is only a restricted choice of fund managers: Guinness Flight for bonds, equities and currencies; Wright Investor Services for equities; and Rothschilds for currencies. Furthermore, all the funds on offer are offshore; the British investor will be unable to buy, say, M &amp; G Dividend via the no-load route. Since Schwab is promoting the service across Europe, using offshore funds avoids regulatory problems. Still, everyone has to start somewhere. In the US, the same service offers 200 no-load funds from 25 fund management groups. And the European service does at least offer a wide range of funds, from Australasian equities to yen bonds. All the funds are recognised by the Securities and Investments Board, the UK's chief regulator. Schwab will also send investors summarised statements of their portfolios and orders can be made through a 24 hour telephone service. Are there any catches? Schwab makes its money by taking a fee from the fund manager, which it says is around 0.3 per cent. It adds that the manager pays the fee out of its own annual management charge, so there is no additional cost to the investor. The manager benefits because of the extra volumes of funds under management which Schwab will generate. The service is dollar-denominated, so sterling-based investors will have a currency risk, and a conversion cost, which Schwab says will be around 0.2 to 0.3 per cent. To benefit from the service, investors must open a Schwab dollar account and the minimum investment into any of the funds is Dollars 2,000. (Some of the funds on offer normally have much higher minimums.) There are toll-free numbers for anyone interested in details - 0800-526027 in the UK, 0130-817465 for Germany and 0590-8103 for France. US residents cannot use the service. Schwab is not a well known name in Europe and it is hard to see this service revolutionising the market. Still, it is good to see further competition in the field and someone who was already considering investment in, say, a Guinness Flight bond fund, might find the Schwab approach worthwhile. ***** Those who follow our weekly table of directors' dealing in their companies' shares, might be intrigued by the new Pointon BRI Directors Dealings Unit Trust. The trust will use the pattern of transactions by directors to determine its investments. The obvious rationale for following directors' dealings is that they must know something the rest of us do not. But this is a fine line. They are not supposed to be insider dealers, buying shares in advance of a takeover approach. There is a 'close' period before the publication of results, during which directors cannot deal. So it is more of a question of directors acting on a gut feeling, based on their general knowledge of the company, than on specific information. Nor is it wise to assume that directors' instincts are infallible. Back in 1991, after one year of publishing the directors' dealing table, I conducted an exercise to see how investors would have done if they had acted on the basis of that first table. The results were not encouraging. Investors would have done better to buy shares in companies where directors had sold holdings, than to buy where they had made purchases. Nevertheless, there have been obvious cases where a pattern of directors' sales have been followed by a share price slump and similarly, if directors are consistently buying shares, that ought to give investors some confidence. The new trust will be managed by BRI, a rival service to Directus, which produces our table. It says there will be no 'blind following of directors transactions'. It will assess the financial and marketing strengths of companies and look at details, such as whether more than one director has been dealing, the track record of the purchaser and the scale of the deals in relation to existing holdings. The initial charge will be 5.5 per cent and the annual charge 1.5 per cent. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000.</p>

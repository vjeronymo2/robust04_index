			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Tehran Preparing To Open New Page in </F> Relations With Washington"]    [Excerpt] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Despite the  severity of the verbal attacks on the United States, the mullahs  in Tehran are preparing to make a new attempt to open the door  of dialogue with it. Well-informed sources in Tehran said  yesterday that 'Ali Khamene'i, guide of the Iranian republic,  has ordered that a special study be conducted on Iranian-U.S.  relations and the future course which Tehran should take in this  connection.    Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani raised with 'Ali  Khamene'i the idea of preparing a special report on this issue.  It is worth mentioning that in his private conversations,  Rafsanjani supports normalizing relations with Washington.    The task of preparing this report has been assigned to three  people: Ardeshir Larijani [Foreign Ministry adviser]; Sa'id  Raja'i Khorasani, member of the Majles (Iranian parliament); and  Mahmud Va'ezi, deputy foreign minister.    Khamene'i's and Rafsanjani's joint initiative is aimed at  moving the issue of relations with Washington out of the circle  of political debate between the wings of the ruling  establishment, because competition among the various wings was  the cause of tension in Iranian-U.S. relations and in relations  with other states.

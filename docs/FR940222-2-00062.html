The Canadian Pacific Limited (CP) filed an application for authority to abandon and discontinue all freight and passenger operations over 201.2 miles of rail line between Skinner and Vanceboro, in Franklin, Somerset, Piscataquis, Penobscot, Aroostook, and Washington Counties, Maine. Because of the proposed abandonment's potential for significant environmental impacts, SEA has determined that preparation of a DEIS is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The DEIS will address the environmental impacts associated with this proposed abandonment and will be served on all the parties to the proceeding and made available to the public. There will be a 45 day comment period from the date the DEIS is served to allow the public opportunity to comment. After assessing all of the comments to the DEIS and any other comments filed during the environmental review process, SEA will issue a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) that will include SEA's final recommendations to the Commission. The Commission will consider the FEIS and the environmental record in making its decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the scoping process is to identify significant environmental issues and determine the scope of issues to be addressed in the DEIS. Issues typically addressed in DEIS's include alternatives to the proposed action, impacts on transportation systems, land use, socio-economic impacts, energy resources, air quality, noise quality, public health and safety, biological resources, water quality, historic resources, coastal zone management consistency review, and mitigation to reduce or avoid impacts on the environment. Persons that cannot attend the scoping meetings may submit questions and comments in writing up to 30 days after the scoping meetings. Written comments may be submitted directly to the Commission no later than April 15, 1994. Public scoping meetings will be held on the following dates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;March 15, 1994, from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. at The American Legion Hall, Maine Street, Woodland, ME, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;March 16, 1994, from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. at City Hall, City Council Chambers, 73 Harlow Street, Bangor, ME. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Phillis Johnson-Ball at (202) 927&hyph;6213 or Vicki Dettmar at (202) 927&hyph;6211, Section of Environmental Analysis, room 3219, Office of Economic and Environmental Analysis, 12th and Constitution Avenue, NW., Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC TDD for hearing impaired: (202) 927&hyph;5721. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> By the Commission, Elaine K.

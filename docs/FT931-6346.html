			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Letter: The Duke of Westminster 'should have read Marx' Sir, The Duke of Westminster seems genuinely surprised at the Conservative government's desire to interfere in property rights with the lease reform bill currently before Parliament. The Conservatives are clearly trying to remove some power and wealth from the large London estates in favour of the professional middle classes that live in West End flats. This is a case of redistribution of wealth from the very rich to the merely rich. Had the Duke of Westminster read his Karl Marx as a young man like everybody else, he would have realised that the shifting of the balance of power between social classes is what politics is all about. Politicians of all persuasions endeavour to protect or extend the power of some social classes at the detriment of others. Had the Duke realised that, he might have adopted the well-known policy of diversifying one's investments. Luca Salice, 8 Ascham Street, London NW5 2PD</p>

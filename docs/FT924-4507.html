			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Machine-tool exporters act over customs delays BRITAIN'S machine-tool industry is seeking urgent talks with the government to discuss growing concerns that customs delays are hurting the industry's exports. The Machine Tool Technologies Association has written to Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, to express concern that machine tools have been delayed at docks even when they have had the correct customs documents. The association's plea underlines the suspicions of some machine-tool companies that in the wake of the Matrix Churchill affair, exports to some countries in the Middle East and Asia are being singled out for delay. One industry source said: 'There certainly seems to be a connection. Customs are very touchy about anything that says 'machine tool' on it.' In recent weeks Mr Keith Bailey, the chairman of BSA Tools, and Mr Iain Exeter, the joint managing director of Wickman Machine Tools, have both complained publicly about delays in receiving export licences for selling machine tools to Iran. Wickman went into receivership in September, and Mr Exeter blamed that on customs delays. Mr Bailey is waiting for approval for a potential Pounds 150m UK-Iran joint venture to produce UK lathes under licence in Iran. The association says some of the equipment being held up by Customs and Excise does not require an export licence. It is worried that UK machine-tool makers will be unable to give guarantees to customers that deliveries will not be held up. This might cause them to miss vital export opportunities in the middle of a recession. The association's letter does not specify the export markets involved or the individual exporting companies. On Friday, the DTI said again that its revised special licensing procedures for countries such as Iran and Pakistan, which were introduced in October, would lead to extra delays in processing export licences. UK machine tool exports to Iran slipped to Pounds 2.3m in the first half of this year from Pounds 3.8m a year earlier. Italy's exports to Iran nearly trebled to L35.8bn (Pounds 17m) from L13.2bn during the same period, according to Ucimu, the Italian machine tool association.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / UK Company News: In search of a more fruitful direction - The reasons for the departure of the man who built Albert Fisher MR Stephen Walls, the new non-executive chairman at Albert Fisher, calls it a victory for corporate governance. Mr Tony Millar, chairman and chief executive since he started to build the fruit and vegetable producer in 1982, was not ousted on Thursday in a board room coup by non-executive directors. His departure had been agreed by the board to be in the best interests of smooth transition to a new strategic direction. But, however Mr Walls, himself ousted in May as chief executive of Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British papermaker, might choose to present the departure of Mr Millar, Albert Fisher is still in deep trouble. The company that grew through 50 acquisitions to be worth Pounds 784m at its peak in March last year has joined a group of 1980s wonder stocks struggling to prove they can cut the mustard in the altogether tougher 1990s. Judging by Albert Fisher's share price, the jury is still out and not just because Mr Millar's resignation was accompanied by no clearer idea about the security of the dividend payment for the year to August 31. Mr Walls was at pains yesterday to point out that while fresh produce prices in Europe and North America had recently gone soggy, as indicated by the company's profits warning earlier this month, there were no black holes in the company and its overall trading remained in line with expectations. At a much broader level, however, Albert Fisher is embarking on a reassessment of its strategic direction under the board led by Mr Walls in a non-executive capacity. But there are no clear ideas where it should or will go. Mr Walls insisted that with the appointment of new chief executives for the European and North American operations, there was no immediate need for a new chief executive until the board had taken a measured look at what to do next. The emphasis on management structure and long consideration before decisions are taken is a break from Albert Fisher's explosive 1980s history. Mr Millar came to Albert Fisher and fresh produce from the stable of Mr Michael Ashcroft, the sometimes controversial and always colourful chairman of ADT, the car auction and security group. After three years under the Ashcroft wing and a six months search, Mr Millar homed in on Albert Fisher, a company traded on the Liverpool and London stock exchanges with sales of Pounds 7m, as a vehicle for his ambit-ions. The fruit and vegetable industry, he realised, was fragmented among family businesses which enjoyed neither economies of scale nor centralised purchasing. Through frequent issues of new shares - which many institutions now bleating about the recent share performance were then perfectly happy to take up - Mr Millar began to consolidate the industry. Having moved a long way along that path in the UK, he started in 1985 to expand in Europe, based around the Rotterdam markets, and then into the US. Consolidation of the fragmented industry was followed by moves into frozen food and food processing. In the peak of this heady growth, Albert Fisher produced pre-tax profits of Pounds 89m last year on sales of over Pounds 1bn but, gripped by its first real recession, the doubts were beginning to set in about the quality of the acquisition-derived earnings. After years of 20 per cent profits growth, Albert Fisher lost its following and forecasts began to be scaled back. From Pounds 97m at the end of last year, market expectations fell to Pounds 77m in April. Then in early July, as the extent of the slump in fresh produce markets in Europe and North America became apparent, forecasts slipped to Pounds 60m following a profits warning that was accompanied by the statement that it was 'inappropriate' to make any comment about the dividend. Albert Fisher is not in as bad a shape as some of the other debt-financed acquisitive growth companies of the 1980s. Thanks to the rump of an Pounds 180m rights issue in 1990 the group has a strong balance sheet and net cash of Pounds 60m. It leaves Mr Walls, at least, sanguine about the rethink and comfortable with Mr Millar's departure. 'Companies change, markets evolve, opportunities change,' he said. 'We have assessed the situation relative to external and internal confidence (in Mr Millar) and decided that the best thing is to have a change of management.'</p>

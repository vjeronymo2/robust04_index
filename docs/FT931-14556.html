			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / EC setback for ministers on contracting-out EUROPEAN Community laws protecting the jobs and pay of workers affected by company mergers will apply even when public services are contracted out to the private sector, in the view of UK lawyers assessing the implications of a recent judgment in the European Court of Justice. The legal opinion, which is directly contrary to the views of British ministers, has emerged on the eve of a conference in London organised by the government about ways in which companies can compete for public services worth Pounds 1.5bn. Uncertainty about the reach of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations, known as Tupe, has cast a shadow over the current extension of contracting-out in central government services. The UK government has argued that the Tupe legislation does not normally apply to contracting out. Private-sector companies taking on work from the public sector are thus free to sack workers who transfer to them under the contracts, and alter their pay and conditions. Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, said last month about contracting-out: 'There is not normally a transfer of an undertaking in these circumstances.' The European court ruled recently in the case of Rask v ISS Kantineservice that the EC Acquired Rights Directive, on which Tupe is based, does apply when a service is contracted out. An analysis of the case by Ms Melanie Tether, a solicitor with the law firm Norton Rose, says: 'The ruling reflects the willingness of the ECJ to put the protection of employees' rights before the promotion of commercial interests.' The Rask case, which began in Denmark, arose when Philips contracted out its staff canteen, underlining the fact that Tupe also applies to contracting out within the private sector. The contractor, ISS, agreed to manage the canteen in return for a fixed fee. However, Philips continued to own the premises and equipment. It also retained economic control over the service provided because it continued to fix the prices charged for food and restricted the canteen's customers to its own employees. Ms Tether believes the court has thus backed a minimalist definition of what does not constitutes a 'transfer' and an 'undertaking' and has undermined many of the UK government's arguments on the limits of Tupe. One argument apparently undermined by Rask is that Tupe cannot apply when a public authority contracts out a service because the statutory duty to provide that service remains with the relevant authority. The government argument that no transfer has taken place unless the contractor acquires the assets used in the service is also disputed by the Rask judgment. The judgment is likely to alert unions to the fact that Tupe applies to private sector contracting-out and might even affect routine corporate restructuring. Private sector contracting-out is a much bigger market than that in the public sector. It is not yet clear, however, how long after a transfer the Tupe regulations will apply.

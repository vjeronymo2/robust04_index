			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOP HOPES DASHED IN DEEP SOUTH RACE  </P> <P> Democrat Glen Browder won a solid victory Tuesday in a special congressional  election, dashing Republican hopes to use the race as a building block toward  GOP gains in the Deep South.  </P> <P> With all of the 656 precincts reporting, the unofficial count showed Browder  with 53,031 votes, or 65%, to Republican John Rice's 28,787, or 35%.  </P> <P> The seat was left vacant in December with the death of Rep. Bill Nichols, a  conservative Democrat from Sylacauga who held the mostly rural, 13-county east  Alabama district for 22 years.  </P> <P> The district, which is about 75% white and dotted with small towns, appeared  ready-made for the GOP's plan to bring such conservative-leaning Southern seats  into the Republican House column next year. President Bush captured more than  60% of the district's votes last November.  </P></p>

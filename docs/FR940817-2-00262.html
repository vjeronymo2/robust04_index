			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> When neural tissue, typically from fetal animals, is dissociated into a suspension of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single cells, and the suspension is inoculated into tissue-culture dishes, the neurons and glia  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survive, grow, and establish functional neuronal networks. Such preparations have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made from most regions of the CNS and exhibit highly differentiated, site-specific properties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that constitute an in vitro model of different portions of the CNS. Most of the neuronal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transmitter and receptor phenotypes can be demonstrated, and a variety of synaptic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interactions can be studied. Glial cells are also present, and neuroglial interactions are a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prominent feature of the cultures. A substantial battery of assays (neurochemical and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurophysiologic) is now available to assess the development of the cultures and to indicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxic effects of test agents added to the culture medium. Relatively pure populations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different cell types can be isolated and cultured, so that effects on specific cell types can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessed independently. Pure glial cells or neurons, or even specific neural categories, can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be prepared in this way and studied separately, or interaction between neurons and glial cells  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be studied at high resolution. The neurobiologic measures used to assess the effect of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any agent can be very specific (for example, activity of neurotransmitter-related enzyme or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> binding of a receptor ligand) or global (for example, neuron survival or concentration of glial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fibrillary acidic protein). The two-dimensional character of the preparations makes them  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly suited for morphologic evaluation, and detailed electrophysiologic studies are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> readily performed. The toxic effects and mechanisms of anticonvulsants, excitatory amino  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acids, and various metals and divalent cations have been assessed with these preparations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cerebellar granular cell culture system, for example, has been exploited recently in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studies of the mechanism of alkyllead toxicity (Verity et al., 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A related preparation made from single-cell suspensions of neural tissue is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reaggregate culture. Instead of being placed in culture dishes and allowed to settle onto the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surface of the dishes, the cells are kept in suspension by agitation; under appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions, they stick to one another and form aggregates of controllable size and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> composition. Typically, the cells in an aggregate organize and exhibit intercellular relations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are a function of, and bear some resemblance to, the brain region that was the source of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cells. The cells establish a three-dimensional, often laminated structure. Reaggregate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cultures lend themselves to large-scale, quantitative experiments in which neurobiologic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variables can be examined, although morphologic and ligand-binding studies are performed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less readily than with surface cultures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organotypic explant cultures also are closely related to the intact nervous system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Small pieces or slices of neural tissue are placed in culture and can be maintained for long  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periods with substantial maintenance of structural and cell-cell relations of intact tissue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specific synaptic relations develop and can be maintained and evaluated, both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> morphologically and electrophysiologically. Because all regions of the nervous system are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amenable to this sort of preparation, it is possible to analyze toxic agents that are active only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in specific regions of the central or peripheral nervous system. Explants can be made from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relatively thin slices of neural tissue, so detailed morphologic and intracellular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electrophysiologic studies are possible. Their anatomic integrity is such that they capture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many of the cell-cell interactions characteristic of the intact nervous system while allowing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct, continuing evaluation of the effects of a potentially neurotoxic compound added to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> culture medium. The process of myelination has been studied extensively in explant cultures,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and considerable neurotoxicologic information has been gained. A preparation similar to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explant culture is the organ culture, in which an entire organ, such as the inner ear or a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ganglion, rather than slices or fragments, is grown in vitro. Obviously, only structures so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small that their viability is not compromised can be treated in this way.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, the technical ease of maintaining a culture varies inversely with the degree  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to which it captures a spectrum of in vivo characteristics of nervous system behavior. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problem of biotransformation of potentially neurotoxic compounds is shared by all, although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the more complete systems (explant or organ cultures) might alleviate this problem in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific instances. In many culture systems, complex and ill-defined additives_such as fetal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calf serum, horse serum, and human placental serum_are used to promote cell survival. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of thoroughly described synthetic media are now available, however, and such fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined culture systems can be used where necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

President Seguin first acclaimed the French-Chinese joint  communique announced by the governments of the two countries not  long ago on restoring traditional friendship and cooperation.  Seguin pointed out: Friendship between France and China is  built on a solid political, historical, and cultural base. In  the past when there was a bipolar contention in the world, both  France and China opposed hegemonism. The governments of the two  countries have similar or close viewpoints toward the current  major international issues. Seguin said: Both France and China  are important countries in the world and their cooperation at  the UN Security Council plays an important role in protecting  world peace.    Seguin praised the rapid economic development in China. He  said that the economies of the two countries are complementary  to each other, and hoped that the two countries would further  strengthen cooperation in economic development and trade.    Seguin noted that the French National Assembly has attached  particular importance to developing relations with the Chinese  NPC, and so it has set up a France-China Friendship Group which  is responsible for developing friendly contacts with the Chinese  NPC.    During their meeting, Zhu Qizhen pointed out: Through joint  efforts, Sino-French relationship has passed a difficult period  and opened an important new page. He said: China and France  have traditional friendship and the development of friendship  and cooperation between the two countries are in accord with the  common wishes of people of the two countries.    Zhu Qizhen also briefed President Seguin on Second Session  of  the Eighth NPC, which has just ended,    PRC Ambassador to France Cai Fangbo took part in the  meeting.</p>

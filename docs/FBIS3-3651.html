At the end of last year, the province had a total of 754  towns under the county level and 2,498 rural market towns.    In 1993, the province spent more than 2.19 billion yuan on  the construction of public facilities, industrial buildings and  civil residences in towns.    Linking cities and the countryside, towns have become a  reservoir of surplus labor forces in the countryside.    Four towns in Tongling county absorbed more than 16,300  surplus laborers from the countryside, and 22 towns of Huaibei  city received nearly 110,000 farmers.    Towns have also become a spring-board for farmers to break  away from agriculture and engage in other occupations.    In a town of Huaibei city more than 13,200 farmers found  jobs.    Township enterprises also take advantage of the location of  towns to edge into urban markets.    In Feidong county, markets in 10 minor cities and towns  registered a business volume of 330 million yuan. In Caohu  city, township enterprises in 11 towns reported an output value  of 1.09 billion yuan last year, a great increase in comparison  with a few years ago.    Because of the accelerated urbanization of the countryside  in  the province, which used to be widely known as a poor  agricultural area, the economic gap between its urban and rural  areas is narrowing.</p>

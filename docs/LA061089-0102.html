			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARYLAND INTERVIEWS USC'S RAVELING, WILL PICK NEW COACH IN NEXT 2 WEEKS  </P> <P> George Raveling, USC basketball coach, has been interviewed for the University  of Maryland coaching job. The school is seeking a replacement for Bob Wade, who  resigned last month.  </P> <P> The interview, first reported in the Washington Post, was confirmed elsewhere  Friday. Raveling wouldn't comment.  </P> <P> Raveling has two seasons remaining on a five-year contract he signed with USC  in 1986. With the Trojans, Raveling has a 26-62 record, while finishing last in  the Pacific 10 Conference three straight seasons. The Trojans were 10-22 in  1988-89.  </P> <P> Raveling was an assistant at Maryland for three years in the early 1970s under  Coach Lefty Driesell, who was ousted in 1986 in the wake of the Len Bias  situation. Bias, Maryland's star and the top draft choice of the Boston Celtics  that year, died of a cocaine overdose.  </P> <P> Raveling left Maryland in 1972 for Washington State, where he became the first  black head coach in the Pac-10. After compiling a 167-136 record in 11 seasons,  he moved to Iowa, where he had a 54-38 record in three season before coming to  USC.  </P> <P> Gary Williams of Ohio State and Morgan Wooten of DeMatha High School in  Hyattsville, Md., are considered the top candidates for the job. Others being  considered are Jeff Mullins of North Carolina Charlotte, Ed Tapscott of  American University and Bob Wenzel of Rutgers.  </P> <P> Maryland officials said they hope to name a new coach within two weeks.  </P></p>

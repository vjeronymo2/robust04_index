			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / BTR sells its 4.1% stake in Pilkington BTR, the industrial conglom- erate, yesterday sold its 4.1 per cent stake in Pilkington, the UK glass maker, formally marking an end to its takeover hopes which began with its contentious and unsuccessful Pounds 1.16bn bid in November 1986. Stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd offered to buy BTR's Pilkington stake. The 31m shares were sold in a bought deal, where prices are pre-arranged, at 161p a share. BZW yesterday sold just over half of its Pilkington holding for 162 1/2 a share. BTR's shares rose 3p to close at 493p while Pilkington's shares fell 4p to close at 160p. Following its unsuccessful bid, BTR went on to increase its Pilkington holding in 1987 and 1990. However, since it acquired Hawker Siddeley, the British engineering group in a Pounds 1.55bn takeover last November, it lost interest in using its Pilkington holding as a platform for a bid. The deal is worth around Pounds 50m. BTR will make a small above-the-line profit which will help reduce gearing. BTR's sale is the latest in a long line of bought deals. Hanson last week sold its 2.8 per cent shareholding in Imperial Chemical Industries to Goldman Sachs. A financier with a close knowledge of BTR said Mr Alan Jackson, chief executive, did not believe in holding shares purely for investment. Mr Jackson, an Australian, earned a reputation as a formidable dealmaker during a long stint at the head of BTR Nylex, the group's antipodean offshoot. The financier said: 'Mr Jackson's skill lies in deal making not stock market gambling. Once BTR decided that the group would definitely not bid for Pilkington a decision was made to sell the shares.' Pilkington, which makes glass for both the construction and automotive industries, has suffered badly in the recession in the UK and North America with profits down from Pounds 314.3m to Pounds 151.6m in the 1990-91 year. In the past two years Pilkington has been reviewing all its operations and has sold a number of peripheral activities which were not performing. Last month it appointed Mr Roger Leverton as group chief executive, replacing Mr Derek Cook, group managing director and deputy chairman, who will retire in June.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei declines as dollar falls against yen A sharp fall in the dollar against the yen and jitters over the situation on the Korean peninsula prompted profit-taking, and the Nikkei 225 average closed 0.9 per cent down, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index was finally off 198.84 at 21,353.97 after opening at the day's high of 21,495.70 and declining to a low of 21,304.16 on profit-taking in the afternoon. The dollar's drop to the Y102 level and North Korea's announcement of its withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency offered domestic financial institutions and investment trusts an opportunity to take profits. Traders noted heavy selling orders around the 21,500 level. Meanwhile, dealers were at a loss to explain the sudden appreciation of the yen. 'Traders are blaming German politics, but it is more likely that the lack of activity is creating a vacuum for speculation,' said Mr Dick Beason, economist at James Capel. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 9.93 to 1,702.80 and the Nikkei 300 receded 2.05 to 309.66. Declines led rises by 693 to 315, with 175 issues unchanged. Volume totalled 470m shares, against a previous 423m. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 1.16 firmer at 1,403.59. Export-oriented issues were hurt by the higher yen. Hitachi retreated Y20 to Y1,090, NEC Y30 to Y1,260 and Sony Y50 to Y6,330. Low-priced, large-capital shipbuilders and steels, which led the recent rally, lost ground on profit-taking. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the most active issue of the day, fell Y16 to Y812. Speculative favourites were supported by individual investors. Iseki, the agricultural machinery maker, saw a new high for the year, rising Y17 to Y519, and Kubota, the textile maker, advanced Y15 to Y504. Minebea, the ball bearings company which had rallied recently on support by speculators and dealers, lost Y24 to Y876, declining heavily for the second consecutive day. In Osaka, the OSE average eased 78.62 to 23,668.56 in volume of 53.9m shares. Nintendo, the video game company, moved ahead Y170 to Y6,620. Roundup In the absence of Hong Kong, closed for a holiday, and weakness in Tokyo, the region's markets searched for direction. SEOUL was hit hard by North Korea's decision to withdraw from the International Atomic Energy Agency. The composite index weakened 19.52, or 2.1 per cent, to 903.72 in volume of 34.9m shares, against Monday's 30.9m, as investors retreated awaiting developments. KUALA LUMPUR closed off the day's lows as a fresh round of rumours of an early general election in Malaysia prompted bargain hunting in the afternoon. The composite index ended 4.44 down at 1,013.49, after touching 1,006.90, in volume that shrank to 183.9m shares from Monday's 461.7m. Perstima appreciated 65 cents to MDollars 6.80 amid rumours of a change in ownership. SINGAPORE had a quieter day after Monday's strong showing by Malaysian shares traded over the counter, and the Straits Times Industrial index dipped 17.62 to 2,278.30 in volume down to 125m shares from a previous 358m. Some rotational activity was seen in selected index stocks. Sembawang lost 40 cents at SDollars 11.10 and Inchcape fell 30 cents to SDollars 5.35. SYDNEY was broadly higher, helped by mining stocks, which were lifted by the rise in commodity prices. The All Ordinaries index improved 7.2 to 2,076.6 in ADollars 445m turnover. In the natural resources sector, Western Mining forged ahead 26 cents, or more than 3 per cent, to ADollars 8.40. BHP was 8 cents higher at ADollars 18.70 and CRA 4 cents up at ADollars 18.96. TAIPEI ended off the day's best on late selling. The weighted index gained 25.51 at 6,098.94 in TDollars 75.7bn turnover. The electronics sector continued its strong performance, Acer adding TDollars 4 at TDollars 77 and United Microelectronics TDollars 3.50 at TDollars 129. Financials were also strong, led by Cathay Life, up TDollars 6 at TDollars 264. BOMBAY closed higher on late buying in selective shares by foreign mutual funds, and the BSE 30 index put on 4.28 at 4,133.13. But the overall mood was weak ahead of tomorrow's end of account in specified, or 'A', shares on Thursday. Indian Hotels, which is expected to announce a bonus issue tomorrow, finished unchanged at Rs1,350. MANILA slipped back in a market devoid of new developments. The composite index lost 50.14 at 2,936.05. Turnover rose to 677m pesos. Philippine Long Distance Telephone, San Miguel and Manila Electric suffered bouts of profit-taking. The latter's 'A' shares showed the day's heaviest fall, 2.5 per cent at 290 pesos. PLDT dipped 2 per cent to 1,830 pesos and San Miguel 'A' 1.5 per cent to 99.50 pesos. BANGKOK fell back as investors took profits late in the day, particularly in the finance sector. The SET index ended 0.16 softer at 1,378.88 after fluctuating between 1,375 and 1,390. Turnover was moderate at Bt8.5b, against Monday's Bt7.6bn. The finance sector was the most active with some Bt3.1bn worth of shares changing hands. Finance One firmed Bt4 to Bt418. KARACHI moved upwards on brisk trading in blue chip stocks as Imperial Chemical Industries announced that it might set up a new plant. The KSE 100-share index climbed 11.47, or 0.5 per cent, to 2,230.53. ICI rose Rs6.50, or 3.7 per cent, to Rs182.50.</p>

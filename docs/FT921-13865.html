			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Arts: Controller takes the hot seat - Radio A TRUE democrat, Michael Green, Controller of Radio 4, submitted himself on Sunday to half an hour's telephoned comment on his network. The lines had already been open for two hours, so no doubt the comments we heard were only a few of those made. How else account for a mere two criticisms of the morning-timed Woman's Hour? One of them complained simply of inability to hear it at its new time, or even at the evening repeat at 7.20 pm to be tried for six months. The other reckoned that the programme had begun to deal with women's general, ie feminist, rather than domestic, interests. The most important complaint made was surely the inability to receive FM signals in some areas. Things would be better during the 1990s, Mr Green promised. Or perhaps we must wait half a decade for DAB, or digital audio broadcasting. Most of the other complaints were matters of taste. Reporters' voices in the news bulletins were too 'magazine-y', there were too many old comedy items like quizzes, there was too much nostalgia, there should be more listener-involvement (like phone-ins), there was too much background music in the plays, there were too many repeats, too much obsession with politics. The Controller kept his end up well enough and promised to take notes of what was raised. Hardly had he ended than a violin began the background music for the repeat of Planche's play The Garrick Fever, a delightful comedy about an ambitious young Irishman playing Hamlet in place of the absent star (there was no more music, though). Then followed the first of a political series, The Power and the Glory, in which James Naughtie examines American leadership. Two excellent programmes. Nostalgia followed almost at once, in a series on the Gulf fighting, The Desert War, and in Concerto, a reminiscent interview with Moura Lympany; but I doubt if the objection was meant to include all such memories. For serious nostalgia we had to wait for the first programme in Never the Same Again on Tuesday (a repeat), and the second programme on Thursday morning. The series deals with 'critical periods in family life', and the general sentiment is self-pity. I find this an unattractive sentiment, however accountable, especially when flaunted as a sort of entertainment. With respect to Mr Green, I find the best drama on Radio 3 as a rule, but this week they repeated two plays about which I have already written fairly lately. On Sunday we had the interesting Much Ado about Nothing directed by Clive Brill, with its cultural range of voices - Afro-Caribbean sounds for the Fairies and RADA sounds for the Greeks, well worth its second hearing. On Tuesday came a repeat of Anthony Burgess's A Meeting in Valladolid, a fantasy about a meeting between Shakespeare and Cervantes, which has already been broadcast all over Europe in 13 languages, and I would have thought that enough. By way of total contrast, Radio 4 gave us Chris Galer's Manikudlak and the Bear on Thursday, part of the channel's current Northern Lights Festival. Set in Greenland, this was about an Inuit (Meredith Edwards) and his young nephew (Marc Heatley), who go hunting together. Manikudlak hears voices, of the Sea-mother who lives at the bottom of the sea waiting for men to come and comb her hair, and of the days of his youth. The boy is not interested in such old stories and goes home on his own after a bear has been sighted but Manikudlak has jammed his rifle. The bear is in fact a revival of the bear that Manikudlak and his brother had killed years before, and in whose gutted body he had sheltered from an ice-storm. Now the brothers are reunited. The play mixes fact and folk-tale throughout in this pleasant if not always expert way. The director was Jane Dauncey. There were more Inuits elsewhere in the week, with more to come, dealing with the cultures of the peoples living on the Arctic rim - all pretty new to most of us, I suspect.</p>

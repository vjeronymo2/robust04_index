			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CIGARETTE FIRMS UNDER FIRE FOR PAID DISPLAY IN MOVIES  </P> <P> Tobacco companies that pay to have their cigarettes displayed prominently in  major motion pictures -- as in "Superman II," "Supergirl" and the upcoming  James Bond movie, "License to Kill" -- may be breaking the law if the movies  are shown on TV or without a health warning, a congressman charged Monday.  </P> <P> Rep. Thomas Luken (D-Ohio) called the promotional spots in movies, which he  said amount to paid advertisement, a violation of congressional bans against  cigarette advertisement on television or elsewhere without a health warning by  the surgeon general.  </P> <P> Luken, chairman of the House subcommittee on transportation and hazardous  materials, said tobacco company Phillip Morris agreed to pay $350,000 to the  makers of "License to Kill" to have Lark cigarettes used in the film as one of  James Bond's secret weapons.  </P> <P> "Tobacco companies are on the attack seeking to increase their power and  influence while continuing to recruit new addicts to the smoking habit," Luken  said. "These movies reportedly do not carry the surgeon general's warning (and)  the movies are shown on television, which is absolutely prohibited by law."  </P> <P> A spokesman for Phillip Morris called Luken's press conference "an attempt to  curtail people who make artistic decisions," and said the "film maker has  absolute discretion as to the content of the film and we stand behind that  100%."  </P> <P> Mary Taylor, director of communications for Phillip Morris, said that in the  last 10 years, her company has only paid for movie promotions twice and  defended the James Bond deal by saying that the movie is being produced outside  the United States and will be distributed internationally.  </P> <P> However, Luken called that argument "the usual evasion" and predicted it would  not hold up in court if the case were brought to trial.  </P> <P> Luken said he has written a letter to U. S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh asking  him to consider "prosecution of those persons and companies involved in  contracting for blatant advertising of cigarettes in movies."  </P> <P> The letter requests that the attorney general investigate whether federal laws  are being broken and to determine what steps, if any, could be taken to stop  the activity.  </P> <P> "I believe that paying to have a particular cigarette appear in a movie is in  fact an advertisement," he said in the letter. "I request that you investigate  these payments."  </P> <P> No one at the Justice Department was available for comment on the issue.  </P> <P> The practice of paying for visibility in movies has become fairly common in  recent years, most notably in the smash success "E.T.," where Reese's Pieces  candies were prominently displayed.  </P> <P> But Luken said that deals involving tobacco products violate laws that do not  apply to other products. "It is a federal crime to violate any provision of the  Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertisement Act," he said.  </P> <P> In "License to Kill," Luken said, James Bond uses Lark cigarettes as a secret  weapon, while a spokesman for the Coalition on Smoking or Health said that  "Lois Lane smokes constantly" in the Superman movie.  </P></p>

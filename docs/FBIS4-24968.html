			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Li Jianchang (2698 1696 2490)] </F>   [Text] Tianjin, 3 Jun (XINHUA) -- At a national work forum  on bonded zones today, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau  Member and State Council Vice Premier Li Lanqing stressed the  need to seek unity of thinking as well as standardize and  improve bonded zone administration to really make such zones new  growth points for China's open economy that will spur on  regional economies and promote development of the open economy.    The national work forum on bonded zones was held in Tianjin.    After giving a briefing on the sustained, rapid growth of  our  foreign trade, Li Lanqing fully affirmed the achievements of the  bonded zones since they were introduced more than two years ago.  He said: The bonded zones were a result of our efforts to draw  lessons from current international practice -- including the  advantages of bonded warehousing, export processing zones, and  other administrative models -- as well as a new kind of pilot  project for opening up China's economy under prevailing national  conditions. Over the past two years, the bonded zones have  demonstrated their unique advantage and played a positive role  in attracting foreign investment; exercising the functions of  export processing, transit trading, and warehousing; promoting  convergence of the domestic and international markets; spurring  on regional economic development; and other areas. The bonded  zones' unique position, advantage, and demonstrative effect are  increasingly pronounced in the overall pattern of China's  opening up to the outside world.    Since 1991, our nation has approved the establishment of 13  bonded zones covering a total area of 17.62 [as received] square  kilometers. Most of these bonded zones have been put into  operation. By the end of March 1994, these bonded zones have  approved the establishment of a total of 5,813 enterprises  involving $8.8 billion in investment and handled the import and  export of goods worth $1.74 billion.    Li Lanqing pointed out: Although the bonded zones have  achieved great results, there remain many unstandardized and  flawed practices in our bonded zone system as compared to  current international practice and these practices have  restricted healthy development of our bonded zones. He proposed  solving these problems from two aspects.    First, we should have a correct understanding of and give  full play to the three basic functions of bonded zones. In  other words, we should give full play to their export processing  function, try hard to develop their international transit  trading function, and give active play to their function in  providing trade services such as warehousing and commodity  display. Particularly in bonded warehousing, it is necessary  to, in the light of domestic demand, properly and purposefully  store up agricultural chemicals, petroleum products, and other  important commodities for use as contingency supplies. These  basic functions are the bonded zones' major distinctions from  economic development zones and special economic zones.    Second, we should further standardize and improve bonded  zone  administration. The present administrative system of most  bonded zones calls for further improvement. A bonded zone  should be a specially designated zone under the supervision and  jurisdiction of customs and be regulated mainly by the customs  and bonded zone administration committees instead of all kinds  of administrative and law enforcement organs. Furthermore, the  administrative rules and regulations for bonded zones are not  complete or standardized. So far, there has yet to be a unified  and complete set of rules and regulations for the 13 bonded  zones across the nation, and this has hampered their healthy  development.    Li Lanqing especially stressed: All bonded zones should  study and draw up their own development direction and strategy  based on individual characteristics and conditions to give full  play to their overall relative advantage and spur on regional  economic development.    He said: If we are to bring about healthy and orderly  development of bonded zones, we must standardize administration.  Generally speaking, we should refer to current international  practice when standardizing bonded zone administration and build  our bonded zones into a point of convergence and a mixture of  the international and domestic markets to gear business  operators directly to the needs of the grand international  market. With the exception of commodities under state import  and export bans and rationing, goods and capital may flow freely  between the bonded zones and the international market. It is  necessary to exercise effective and tight control over the flow  of goods and capital between the bonded zones and other parts of  the country in strict accordance with stipulations by relevant  state policies, to build the bonded zones into a new model for  developing an externally oriented economy with complete  institutions, simple and convenient formalities, quality  services, and highly effective and tight administration. To  this end, we should stress the following principles:    Reform the administrative system for bonded zones; simplify  the customs' supervisory and administrative formalities and  enhance self-discipline among business operators; suit monetary  policy for bonded zones to their peculiar needs; employ advanced  technology to improve administrative means and strengthen  administration; and pay particular attention to resolutely  cracking down on unlawful smuggling activities.    In conclusion, Li Lanqing emphatically pointed out: In  issues related to bonded zones, we must properly handle matters  that should be handled and firmly refuse to do things that  should not be done. We must do good things properly and never  spoil them.    After the meeting, Vice Premier Li Lanqing visited the  ongoing "1994 Export Commodity Fair of Tianjin, China" in the  company of Tianjin Municipal CPC Secretary Gao Dezhan and Mayor  Zhang Lichang and held an informal discussion with the heads of  trading delegations from various localities on existing problems  in foreign trade. Li Lanqing also inspected the Tianjin Customs  and had lunch at the canteen together with customs personnel.</p>

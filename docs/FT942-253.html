			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Legal move on Greek embargo fails: European Court of Justice refuses Brussels an emergency ruling to help end Macedonian dispute The European Commission has lost its gamble to use legal pressure to force Greece to lift its crippling trade embargo against Macedonia. In a setback for Brussels, the European Court of Justice has refused the Commission's request for an emergency interim ruling ordering the Athens government to end the blockade, EU officials said. The ruling vindicates pro-Greek officials and diplomats who have been pressing for a political rather than legal solution to the crisis in relations between the Skopje government and Athens. The row centres on Greek complaints that the Macedonian name, flag and constitution amount to a territorial claim to its own northern province. Because of the Luxembourg Court's lengthy procedures, it could take up to 18 months for a definitive judgment. By that time, the impact of the trade embargo against the Macedonian economy could be devastating, introducing new instability into the Balkans, according to Commission officials. The Commission put its case against Greece at a court hearing two weeks ago held in camera under EU rules permitting such proceedings to take place in secret when they cover matters of international security. The Court had the power to order interim measures to halt the embargo if it considered that there was a risk of grave and irreparable damage. Its decision on an interim ruling was communicated to the Commission and to the Greek government only. The Commission's role in the Macedonia dispute has been complicated by the dual responsibilities of Mr Hans Van den Broek, Commissioner for external political affairs. Mr Van den Broek was in the forefront of those arguing for a legal case before the European Court of Justice in order to underline Brussels' role as the guardian of the treaty of Rome; but he was also acting as a political mediator between Skopje and Athens, alongside the US. A senior Greek official said the Court ruled on the grounds that the Commission had been unable to show that the trade embargo had caused damage to the European Union, through its trade with Macedonia. The official added that the Greek government would use the breathing space offered by the court ruling to renew diplomatic efforts to find a solution to its dispute with the Skopje government. Athens justified its initial imposition of a trade embargo as a means of breaking the diplomatic deadlock with Macedonia - a high-risk move which alienated the majority of its EU partners. Greece hands over the rotating presidency of the EU to Germany tomorrow. The trade embargo against Macedonia blighted its six-month tenure, though Germany may also be taken to the European Court if it carries out plans for a six-month ban on British beef on the grounds that it could contain 'mad cow disease'.</p>

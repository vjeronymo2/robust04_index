Clinton said the money would come from U.S. funds previously  appropriated for peacekeeping operations this fiscal year.    The President made the authorization in a memorandum to  Secretary of State Warren Christopher that was released today by  the White House.    The Clinton administration has announced withdrawal of all  U.S. troops from Somalia by March 31.    Fears are increasing that Somali factions could be fighting  again after U.S. forces and other nations' peacekeeping forces  pull out.</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Q&amp;A: BERNARD L. SCHWARTZ;  </P> <P> FORD AEROSPACE: HIDDEN JEWEL;  </P> <P> LORAL CORP. MAY WIND UP 'GETTING A GOOD ASSET FREE'  </P> <P> Bernard L. Schwartz, chairman and chief executive of New York-based Loral  Corp., doesn't make any apologies for the fact that his $3.2 million in  compensation made him the defense industry's highest-paid executive last year.  </P> <P>  Asked recently about his compensation, Schwartz said: "We're in a competitive  market and we pay well for good performance. I'm reminded of a remark made by  Babe Ruth when he was asked why he made more money than the President. He said,  'Well, I had a better year.' "  </P> <P>  Indeed, Wall Street has long regarded the 64-year-old executive as a savvy  businessman. And, as Schwartz says, he has had a very good year.  </P> <P>  Even before the Middle East crisis began in August, Schwartz believed he could  find hidden values in the defense industry, which many on Wall Street had  written off after the warming of U.S.-Soviet relations.  </P> <P>  Schwartz believes he's found just such a hidden jewel in Ford Aerospace Corp.,  the Newport Beach-based defense subsidiary of Ford Motor Co. In July, Loral and  its partner, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., announced plans to acquire Ford  Aerospace for $715 million, outbidding two other rivals who had more financial  resources than Loral.  </P> <P>  With Ford Aerospace, Loral gained a company with revenue of $1.8 billion and  17,000 employees, including 2,600 at the Aeronutronic missile division in  Newport Beach.  </P> <P>  Even before the sale closed, however, Schwartz was making deals. He agreed in  September to sell Ford's BDM International consulting division for $130  million. In late October, Schwartz announced that he would sell 49% of Ford  Aerospace's space systems division in Palo Alto for $182 million.  </P> <P>  Meanwhile, the long-profitable defense electronics company expects combined  sales in excess of $3 billion as a result of the Ford purchase. It also expects  continuing profits despite the bleak outlook for many contractors.  </P> <P>  Michael Beltramo, a Los Angeles defense analyst, said Schwartz's purchase of  Ford Aerospace is looking smarter every day in light of the Persian Gulf crisis  and the amount of money the asset sales have generated for Loral.  </P> <P>  "Pretty soon, he (Schwartz) will wind up getting a good asset for free,"  Beltramo said recently.  </P> <P>  The acquired company in Newport Beach will be known as Loral Aerospace, a  subsidiary of Loral Corp. In a recent interview with Times staff writer Dean  Takahashi, Schwartz discussed the Ford Aerospace acquisition, Pentagon budget  cuts and the impact of the Mideast crisis on the industry.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Q. A lot of companies such as Ford Motor Co. and Unisys Corp. are diversifying  out of the defense business these days. What is scaring these people away from  the defense industry?  </P> <P> A. I think there are a number of things. The perception that the defense budget  is declining and may be vulnerable to sharp cuts in the future.  </P> <P> Secondly, there is the general perception that everyone is unfriendly to the  defense industry. Some of that perception has been caused by the Department of  Defense itself, which is just emerging from a time when there has been a lot of  contractor bashing in the media, in the defense circles, in financial circles.  </P> <P> As a result of both of those issues, it's harder to secure financing for  defense projects, and that is another negative or cost of being in the defense  industry.  </P> <P> Q. You obviously think the rewards of the industry are worth the risks.  </P> <P> A. Yes. I think there's a difference between the reality and the perception in  this case. The perception of the industry cuts have been overstated and fully  discounted the values of the business. Secondly, I believe the worst has passed  as far as the defense industrial base is concerned. Both the government and the  industry recognize that a viable and healthy industrial base is an important  part of national security.  </P> <P> We as an industry have been living in an atmosphere of no-growth budgets for  five or six years. Loral still sees opportunities because we're on the cutting  edge of technology. We've grown throughout this period. Our experience is  different from the perception.  </P> <P> Q. Regardless of what is happening right now in the Persian Gulf, what is the  outlook for the defense industry over the next five years?  </P> <P> A. I think the defense budget will continue to be under pressure because the  political resolution of the deficit has not really been achieved. Because of  the Gulf and the recognition that the world is still dangerous to America's  interests, the expected Draconian cuts will be avoided.  </P> <P> Secondly, I believe there will be reallocation of defense resources toward  mobile, fast-response and high-technology capability. The total amount of  defense may be the same, but there will be new priorities to reflect the new  realities. Therefore, some will win and some will lose.  </P> <P> Q. On a more immediate level, what is the impact of the Persian Gulf crisis for  the defense industry?  </P> <P> A. I think there will be some winners and some losers. The high-tech,  electronic segment, fast-response, highly mobile capabilities will be winners.  I think there may be a reorganization away from the kind of threat that Russia  posed to us five years ago. The total amount of defense may be the same but  there will be a new priorities.  </P> <P> Q. Everybody is preparing for some kind of defense budget crunch and also  changing their plans as a result of the Persian Gulf crisis. What is Loral  doing different?  </P> <P> A. For one thing, we're concentrating in five or six core business areas. We  have been doing that for a period of years, and we believe that those choices  have turned out to be fortunate ones in terms of today's relevancy.  </P> <P> They are self-protect; reconnaissance; training; anti-submarine warfare;  command, control and communications; and now space. We believe each one of  those is going to be a growth area because they represent the priorities of the  Defense Department. We positioned ourselves in those areas that continue to get  support.  </P> <P> Q. Analysts are saying your purchase of Ford Aerospace is looking smarter every  day. If you had to purchase Ford Aerospace Corp. today, do you think you would  have to pay more than the $715 million?  </P> <P> A. I think the answer to that is probably, yes. Loral, in effect, has educated  the marketplace as to the hidden values of Ford Aerospace. There were elements  within Ford Aerospace that were considered negatives that are turning out to be  positives. Having brought the harsh light of scrutiny to those issues, I think  the values would have been increased and would be perceived to be more valuable  today.  </P> <P> Q. Do you expect a war in the Persian Gulf?  </P> <P> A. That's a tough question because it's a political question. I don't pretend  to be able to calibrate that issue for the government. I think the President  has a tough decision because there are some important political objectives that  need to be accomplished in any settlement in the Gulf. Not the least of which  is this country must not be setting diplomatic and economic objectives staring  down the barrel of a hostile gun. We have to resolve that issue, but I think it  would benefit everybody if we did it peacefully, thereby using our strength in  a deterrent way, rather than in a hostile way. I hope we can achieve our  objectives without hostilities.  </P> <P> Q. According to Wall Street, you've estimated $100 million in additional  revenue in 1991 as a result of the buildup in the Mideast. Is that accurate,  and if so, how will that break down?  </P> <P> A. That is not accurate. What we have done is identify $100 million worth of  potential bookings that could be made in a year's time, but there would be a  longer lag in the revenue base. I think the booking potential is a little  higher than when I made that estimate a month ago. There is a long tail to it,  and it will take a couple of years to realize that in sales.  </P> <P> Q. Based on the media coverage of the Persian Gulf crisis, what sort of image  do you think the defense industry has in the mind of the public? Is this a  better image than, say, 10 years ago?  </P> <P> A. I think so. I think most people realize if we get a peaceful solution, it  could not have been achieved without the deterrence of a strong military. If  there are hostilities, I think everybody will want our men and women to be  protected by the best equipment available. I think there will be a new  recognition that American interests are global and can only be protected from  time to time by military capabilities.  </P> <P> Q. Loral has stayed away from big-ticket items in the defense budget. Do you  expect certain programs will be cut in the next five years?  </P> <P> A. Yes. I'm reluctant to get into a debate as to which ones. I think there will  be a change in priorities away from the kind of weapons systems that were  important when two global powers were confronting each other to more regional  requirements.  </P> <P> More geared to the kind of conflicts that will arise from the Gulf, Central  America, the Pacific Rim -- there are many areas of the world that are  potentially dangerous and will affect America's interests and the civility of  the free world. Our deterrent power will be called into play. There is a shift  and that shift is very profound.  </P> <P> Q. Do you think there is ever going to be something like a peace dividend? If  so, how soon will it come?  </P> <P> A. I think there will be a significant peace dividend and it will take a couple  of years to get there. The GNP is expected to rise above the present level of  defense spending, and the difference is going to the peace dividend. If, in  1995, we're spending not 3% but 2% of GNP on defense, we're talking a  $100-billion-a-year peace dividend that can be available for very proper uses  elsewhere.  </P> <P> Q. Do you believe a recession is here or coming?  </P> <P> A. I'm not an economist, but it sure feels that way. I travel around the  country, and I've found that not many industries or companies feel good about  their bookings. So much of our economy depends on consumers. If we have a good  Christmas season, that will soften the blow. I'm optimistic it won't be a long  one or a severe one, but I think we're in one.  </P> <P> Q. Do you think that is going to spell more layoffs for the aerospace industry?  Have we seen the worst of layoffs?  </P> <P> A. I think we have had the worst impact, though this is not to say there won't  be some adjustments going forward in various companies. I think there will be  continued consolidation in the industry, and that in itself will create  dislocations that for a temporary period might be reflected in layoffs. But  from a recession point of view, I think we've seen the worst of it.  </P> <P> Q. Is there much hope for defense contractors to look overseas for sales as the  domestic defense budget decreases?  </P> <P> A. Yes. I think places like Europe will produce a great deal of protectionism  for the European defense industry. But there will be increased requirements for  countries like Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Egypt and the Gulf area. That will  provide very good opportunities for Americans. I think the same will happen in  Japan. I think around the world, overseas opportunities will be a significant  part of the high-tech defense industry's growth.  </P> <P> Q. Does that create a concern that some of our weapons might be used against us  or our friends?  </P> <P> A. Absolutely. I'm hopeful the appropriate agencies in the government will be  very conservative before granting licenses. For the United States, the  high-tech weapon has always been important. I think there's an opportunity to  help our allies overseas with weapons that do not compromise America's lead in  high technology. I think we can do both if we're smart.  </P> <P> Q. Getting back to the Ford Aerospace deal, Loral is allowing Ford Motor Co. to  keep $100 million from Ford Aerospace's overfunded pension fund, correct?  </P> <P> A. Ford is not letting us keep it. The arrangement was they transferred to  Loral an amount that kept the pension fund intact and transferred a surplus  above the requirement. Above that amount, they kept a certain amount. They  transferred to Loral sufficient and surplus funds to take care of all the  liabilities.  </P> <P> Q. I have seen a copy of a January, 1989, report from the Defense Department's  inspector general's office that estimates the government had a claim of about  $90.9 million out of a total of $527.3 million in excess pension assets after  11 defense contractors' plans were terminated between 1982 and 1987. Do you  think the Pentagon has any claim on the money that Ford is keeping?  </P> <P> A. I haven't seen that report. Everything you've seen in print up to this point  is speculation. The government has not maintained a claim -- they have not said  they won't but they have not yet done so -- and there's been no quantification  of what that claim might be. There's been all kinds of speculation of how to  compute that. It's a very complex issue, having to do with what portion of the  pension assets came from overseas, what came from commercial activities over  which the DoD would have no claim, what portion came from fixed-price versus  other types of contracts, how much was charged by Ford Motor Co. to the  government. It's a complex issue, and no claim has been made. If they did make  it, I don't know how it would stand in the courts.  </P> <P> Q. As far as your 17,000 new employees are concerned, do you think there was a  political risk to that transaction involving pension assets?  </P> <P> A. No. I think the interest of the employees was to make sure that there were  adequate assets to protect the expected liabilities. Beyond that, the  employees' interests end. They have an interest in making sure the integrity of  the plan was taken care of.  </P> <P> Q. Do you expect any other big changes with Ford Aerospace?  </P> <P> A. No. I think we've done the things we wanted to do. We've sold BDM and the  part of the space systems unit. Now our goal is to get synergies from the  combination of the companies. We're well on our way to that. I'm very pleased  about the progress.  </P> <P> Q. In Southern California, there's a lot of concern about aerospace companies  leaving the area because of the high costs of manufacturing here. In the long  term, how big a problem is this, and how much of a factor is this to your  company strategy?  </P> <P> A. I don't like to move plants, I can tell you that. Our commitment to our work  force is a significant positive for why we're successful as a company. I'm not  suggesting there's never a need to close a plant or move an operation. I don't  foresee any of that in Loral's arena. We have an eight-year lease with the  Aeronutronic operation. After six years, the rent goes up quite a bit, so we  have to look as management for a way to solve that problem. That is not a  unique problem since we have a lot of leased property. You work out what you  have to work out.  </P> <P> Q. In six years, you'll be paying $1 million a month to rent the Newport Beach  land. Will you be able to make missile products profitably with that lease?  </P> <P> A. We think it's profitable now and it will continue to be profitable. When the  rent factor becomes uneconomic -- and I have to tell you that's generally not  the reason companies relocate -- management has to do some things to respond.  We think we're in good shape. If we can go out and book new business and raise  the level of business activity at Aeronutronic, the rent portion will be  unimportant. The division management and Loral's viewpoint are the same. This  is not a decision that will be made by me in New York. What to do with the  facility when we face that issue is not going to be decided in an isolated  place away from Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Q. What are the most important programs for Aeronutronic right now?  </P> <P> A. The most important potential program is the U.S. Navy's AIM-9R missile. If  that goes into production, Aeronutronic is going to have a very large program.  Getting the F-18 forward-looking infrared pod (an electronic warfare device)  into production in good shape . . . is an important part of Aeronutronic's  future. Because of the situation in the Persian Gulf, the Chapparral missile  program is going to be (important to the Newport Beach unit).  </P> <P> Q. Some of your employees will no doubt be reading this. What sort of message  would you like to impart to them?  </P> <P> A. You can tell them I'm extremely pleased with the progress we have made in  becoming one family. I feel confident we have a cultural and a community  objective that will be mutually good for everyone. Their joining the Loral  family is a significant plus for us. I'm excited as the devil.  </P></p>

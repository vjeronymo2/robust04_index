			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLTS KEEP PLAYOFF HOPES ALIVE, 35-28;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: INDIANAPOLIS BEATS WASHINGTON AND LOOKS FOR HELP IN A BID FOR  POSTSEASON PLAY.  </P> <P> The Indianapolis Colts' playoff chances are out of their hands.  </P> <P> Even a 35-28 victory over the Washington Redskins on a 25-yard interception  return by rookie Alan Grant in the final minute Saturday settled nothing.  </P> <P> "Who knows?" said quarterback Jeff George, whose three touchdown passes  included one that tied the game with a little more than a minute to go.  </P> <P> "I know we're (good enough to be) a playoff team; we've proven that. We'll just  have to see," George said.  </P> <P> The Redskins (9-6) already had clinched their first NFC playoff berth in three  years, and the victory kept alive Indianapolis' slim hopes for an AFC wild-card  berth.  </P> <P> But the Colts (7-8) still need to beat Miami next week, and that won't be  enough if either Cincinnati, Pittsburgh or Seattle also win.  </P> <P> "I just dropped back in a short zone and was in between two receivers," said  Grant, whose interception off Mark Rypien was the first of his career and gave  him his first NFL touchdown.  </P> <P> "I saw he was getting pressure and was going to get rid of the ball really  quick," the rookie defensive back said. "Just as he released it I stepped in  front of the receiver. It happened so quick. . . . The ball was just there. I  can't describe it, it happened so fast. It was all on instinct."  </P> <P> The Redskins appeared to have the game under control after two touchdown passes  by Rypien and four field goals by Chip Lohmiller, including a career-best  56-yarder.  </P> <P> Lohmiller's fourth field goal, a 27-yarder with 4:15 to play, put the Redskins  ahead, 28-21. The Colts had to punt on the next possession but got the ball  back with two minutes to go after Clarence Verdin returned a short punt by  Washington to the Redskins' 37.  </P> <P> George completed a 12-yard pass to Bill Brooks for the tying touchdown with  1:21 to play.  </P> <P> Rypien, who completed 18 of 37 passes for 249 yards, started the next drive at  the Redskins' 21. Twenty-five seconds later, Grant intercepted the pass and ran  untouched into the end zone.  </P> <P> George hit 18 of 33 passes for 252 yards, including two touchdowns to Stanley  Morgan.  </P> <P> Washington cornerback Sidney Johnson was hospitalized with a concussion after  being knocked unconscious while covering a kickoff late in the first quarter.  </P> <P> He left the field on a stretcher and regained consciousness in the ambulance on  the way to Methodist Hospital. There were no abnormal findings, but he  underwent a CAT scan as a precaution and was to remain hospitalized overnight.  </P></p>

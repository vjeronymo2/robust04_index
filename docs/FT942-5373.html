			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: British tea and torte - Nicholas Lander visits Betty's, which serves 2m cuppas a year The waitress apologised profusely, although it was a tiny mistake, and smiled warmly. She was wearing a black skirt, starched white blouse, apron and alice band, and looked the embodiment of the Victorian maid. But I was not on the set of television's Upstairs Downstairs, or in a plush London hotel. I was in Harrogate, Yorkshire, in what many consider to be the British tearoom - Betty's. Taking tea is a peculiarly British custom. This is only partly due to the commercial acumen of British tea traders and their forays into India and China. Tea is universally popular because of its refreshing qualities and its versatility. The story of Betty's is an interesting one. In the early 1900s Frederick Belmont, a young Swiss confectioner, arrived in London to make his fortune. He eventually found himself in Yorkshire and fell in love with the Dales. In 1919 he opened the first Betty's - the origin of its name is still unclear. Belmont's timing was as good as his patisserie. Harrogate in the 1920s was booming but, until Betty's opened, there was nowhere for women to go unchaperoned. The tea room became a great success. The surrounding countryside supplied its own baking traditions and the finest raw materials. Cream was so plentiful that it was served with tea until the 1930s when the switch to milk was made. Accordingly, the price of afternoon tea was reduced to six pence. - An orchestra played during the tea. Belmont secured the Swiss succession to his culinary empire when his nephew, Victor Wild, took over the business. In spite of its size, Betty's still remains a family affair. It employs 700 full and part time workers and, with the departure of chemicals manufacturer ICI, has become one of Harrogate's biggest employers. Last year, the four Betty's tea rooms (the others are in York, Ilkley and Northallerton) served 1.5m customers with 200,000 cups of coffee and 2m cups of tea. In the 1960s, Betty's took over its rivals, Taylor's, and runs this as a separate division which blends 570 tons of coffee a year and the Yorkshire Tea, of which 5m cups are drunk a day (Betty's also supplies, free of charge, tea to all the northern branches of the Women's Institute). Betty's has flourished because of a refreshingly open policy towards what it serves and whom it employs. In the bakery trays of continental pastries - Amadeus torte, strudels and slices of Venetian festival cake - are stacked next to vanilla slices, Yorkshire curd tarts and fat rascals, a cross between a scone and a rock bun, of which more than 500,000 are produced each year. Yorkshire bakers and confectioners are sent to Richemont College in Lucerne, which accounts for the excellent quality of puff pastry and chocolate. In Mike Riley, the company's young coffee buyer, they have a true, hard-working Yorkshireman. Riley rose through the ranks. He begins every day with a blind tasting of numerous teas and coffees - including those of his competitors. He enthuses about the different tastes of the Puerto Rico Yauco Selecto Peaberry coffee and the 1993 vintage St Helena coffee - of which he has bought the entire crop. The quality of the tea and coffee is unquestionably high at Betty's but, in the main, people flock there for scones, cinnamon muffins, buttered pikelets, chocolate cream eclairs, hazelnut meringues . . . As Jillian Miller, training co-ordinator, put it: 'If everybody round here decides to get health conscious we're in real trouble.' Betty's, 1 Parliament Street, Harrogate HG1 2QU.

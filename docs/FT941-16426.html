			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Bidders line up for Italian phone prize - Other companies Bidders for Italy's second mobile communications network will be working flat out this week to finalise preliminary proposals before the pre-qualification deadline on Saturday. After months of false starts, the initiative to liberalise Italy's cellular phone market, hitherto monopolised by the state controlled Sip group, and to set up a new GSM-standard network, is moving ahead in earnest. Italy is one of Europe's fastest-growing mobile phone markets, with more than 1.1m subscribers to the existing network. The four consortia in contention are: Unitel (Fiat, Fininvest, Vodafone); Omnitel (Olivetti, Swedish Telecom, Bell Atlantic, Cellular Communications, Lehman Brothers); Pronto Italia (Pacific Telesis and a number of medium-sized Italian companies); and Etra (Eni group, BellSouth, Millicom, Premafin). The concession is expected to be awarded by the end of April.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> SHOPTALK;  </P> <P> FROM THE MOUNTAINS TO THE SEA  </P> <P> 'ROBERTO'S FAMILY in Colombia would send gifts, and friends saw them displayed  in the house and loved them," says Vance Grosser, who with partner Roberto  Concha took a chance when they opened their shop, Foresta. "We felt that the  art was different enough from other ethnic arts, and Colombia is such a large  country -- it touches the Caribbean, the Amazon, the mountains -- that it has a  large area from which to draw crafts."  </P> <P> Foresta is located in downtown Long Beach, currently in the midst of a  redevelopment boom -- the new World Trade Center and Landmark Square are right  up the street, and the Metro Rail Blue Line one block away. Specializing in  arts and handicrafts from South America, its diversity of colorful,  high-quality wares ranges from sophisticated leather goods (including a  wonderful shoulder bag that expands to a carry-on flight bag) and chic straw  hats to primitive werregue canasto, vegetable fiber baskets from the Pacific  and Amazon regions of Colombia that are so tightly woven they can hold liquids.  Other Colombian offerings include brightly painted clay bells in the shapes of  peasant women, friars and birds; hammered copper bowls and pots, and fringed  cotton scarves that can double as soft, wrapped belts.  </P> <P> From Venezuela comes a crop of fertility masks made by the Guajaribo tribe in  the Orinoco River delta; from Peru, alpaca tapestries in muted earth tones.  </P> <P> Arriving in time for the year-end holidays will be a selection of nativities,  Ecuadoran shoulder bags, ceramic jewelry and vibrantly colored primitive oil  paintings.  </P> <P> Foresta, 107 W. Broadway, Long Beach; (213) 432-5220.  </P> <P> ROBIN TUCKER  </P></p>

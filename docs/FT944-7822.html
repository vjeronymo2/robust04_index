			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / People: Metrotect: new finance director Metrotect Industries, the newly-floated company which makes protective coatings for pipelines, is changing its finance director less than a fortnight after it warned that its profits would be sharply lower in the current year. Guy Thomas, 31, a senior audit manager with Ernst &amp; Young, the company's auditors, joins the company as finance director on January 1. He replaces Jim Ball who will remain on the board as company secretary. Metrotect, which was floated on the stock market at 108p a share in the summer of 1993, has failed to live up to expectations. In the year before its flotation, it more than trebled its profits and doubled its turnover to Pounds 22.6m. But in its first full year as a public company its profits rose by 3.5 per cent to Pounds 2.36m and turnover fell slightly. Earlier this month Metrotect reported a jump in interim pre-tax profits but warned that its full year profits were likely to be below last year's figure. Yesterday, Metrotect said it is now carrying out a review of all contracts being undertaken or anticipated and had instructed Ernst &amp; Young to review the company's budgeting and management information system. This review will include the budget for the year ending March 31 1995. Metrotect, which was created from a 1990 management buy-out from BPB Industries, said that it is clear that the result for the second six months is likely to be no better than the result for the first six months. As a result of this statement analysts have downgraded their forecasts from Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 1.6m and the shares fell by 9p to 60p yesterday.</p>

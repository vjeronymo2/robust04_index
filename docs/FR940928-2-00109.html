			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Part A:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Operation of BFN Unit 1 and 3 in the ELLL region does not create any new failure mode or sequence of events that can lead to an accident of a different type than any previously evaluated. Operation in the ELLL region does not increase challenges or create any new challenges to safety-related systems or equipment, or other equipment whose failure could cause an accident. Changing the equation for the flow-biased APRM scram trip setpoint does not change the function of the APRM subsystem. The APRM scram trip setpoint will continue to initiate a scram to ensure that the fuel safety limit is not exceeded. Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Part B:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed change to the RBM operability and surveillance requirements does not create any new failure mode or sequence of events that can lead to an accident of a different type than any previously evaluated. The proposed change does not increase challenges or create any new challenges to safety-related systems or equipment, or other equipment whose failure could cause an accident. The proposed change does not change the function of the RBM subsystem. The RBM subsystem will continue to block control rod withdrawal to ensure that fuel safety limits are protected. Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Part C:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The miscellaneous editorial changes do not affect any plant operations, equipment, or any safety-related activity. These changes increase the probability that the specifications will be correctly interpreted by adding clarifying information and/or correcting errors. Therefore, these editorial changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Part D:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed change will delete the specific value for the rated loop recirculation flow rate found in a factor used to calculate limiting safety system settings for the APRM rod block and trip settings. The proposed change does not change the limiting safety system settings or alter the method for calculating the settings. The proposed change does not affect or change operation of the plant. The proposed change does not change the APRM rod block or trip settings, the method or frequency of calibration of the APRM flow biased network, or any other operational features of the APRM system. The proposed change will only delete an incorrect flow rate that is required to be calculated and maintained outside of the TS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since there will be no change in plant operations, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Part E:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Removal of the APRM rod block and RBM upscale setpoint equations does not change or affect any safety-related plant equipment or its functions; or any equipment, systems, or setpoints designed to prevent or mitigate accidents. Removing these rod block equations does not create any new challenges to safety-related systems or equipment, or other equipment whose failure could cause an accident; and does not change the function and manner of operation of the APRM or RBM subsystems. The APRM and RBM subsystems will continue to block control rod withdrawal to prevent reactor power from increasing to excess levels and to ensure that fuel safety limits are protected. Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Part A:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Operation of BFN Units 1 and 3 in the ELLL region does not affect the ability of the plant safety-related trips or equipment to perform their intended functions. Operation in the ELLL region will not cause any significant increase in offsite radiation doses resulting from any analyzed event. Although this change increases the APRM flow-biased scram equation, no credit is taken for this equation in the accident analyses. These analyses assume that transient events initiated from less than rated conditions are terminated by the fixed 120% flux scram or other safety-grade scram signals. These signals are not affected by the proposed change. Additionally, as noted above, TVA's analysis of operation in the ELLL region determined that the consequences of previously evaluated accidents remain within the acceptance criteria of the licensing basis. Therefore, this change does not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Part B:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed change does not change the function of the RBM system. The RBM system will continue to block control rod withdrawal to ensure that fuel safety limits are protected. The proposed change does not affect plant operation, design, or any safety-related activity or equipment. The proposed change does not affect or change any margin of safety. The proposed change will actually increase the margin of safety by providing more conservative operability and surveillance requirements for the RBM subsystem. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Part C:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The miscellaneous editorial changes do not affect plant operation, design, or any safety-related activity or equipment. These changes increase the probability that the specifications will be correctly interpreted by adding clarifying information and/or correcting errors. Therefore, these changes do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

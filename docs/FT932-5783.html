			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Observer: Burnside issue The Burnside call sign is clearly a passport to prominence in aviation public relations. No sooner has David, the erstwhile PR director of British Airways, set up David Burnside Associates, than fellow Ulsterman, Alan, of the confusingly named Alan Burnside Associates steps in to run PR for the sale of Belfast Airport.

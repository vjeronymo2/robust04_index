			<p>BFN     [Text] Bashkortostan's President Murtaza Rakhimov believes  that adoption of the agreement on civic peace and accord in  Russia proposed by Boris Yeltsin can negatively affect the  political and social-economic situation in the country.    Addressing the Wednesday sitting of the republic's  Presidential Council, he underlined that introduction of a  moratorium on acts of a political manner, proposed by the  agreement, again postponed signing of the bilateral agreement  between Russia and Bashkortostan for an indefinite time,  Rakhimov noted that this is being done "at that very moment when  all issues on this bilateral agreement have been coordinated in  the course of years of difficult negotiations."    Members of the council called on the head of the republic  not  to sign this document because it is "a chauvinist document  infringing upon the rights of the constituent members."  According to the council, in general the agreement reminds of a  directive from Moscow sent to the regions without minding the  interests of the republics within the Russian Federation.</p>

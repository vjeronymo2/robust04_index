			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Arts: A Quebecois statement on life - Theatre The Watermans Arts Centre, Brentford is introducing the Quebecois play La Deposition (The Statement) by Helene Pedneault to a British audience. This 90 minute psychological thriller rewards close attention without demanding it. The Statement was first staged in Montreal in 1988, and reached the Avignon Festival in 1991. It has been translated by Mark Ravina, and directed by Astrid Hilne for The Troupe, a company formed to bring world theatre to the UK. An Inspector is investigating a murder. The chief suspect and the victim's daughter, Lena, describes it as an accident 'which began in childhood and happened 30 years later.' The play turns on the question of Lena's collusion in her mother's death. Was it a merciful release or a vindictive blow? This evolves into an investigation where a whole life is called into question; it is a technique begun and perfected by Robert Browning last century in his dramatic monologues. Here it is taken even further. The dialogue is dense and involved. The barge-footed Inspector gradually grows into a sympathetic figure, and the recalcitrant suspect softens into a kind of confession. There are two clips of video evidence from Lena's sisters: one a prim paralegal and the other a blowzy mother. This is much more like overhearing therapy than watching drama, but no less compelling for that. At the end, the Inspector calls for help: 'Someone's fallen apart in front of me. I don't know how to pick up the pieces.' As a series of images for Quebec's relations with Ottawa, the play works very well. Behind its questions of guilt, identity and the role of the past there are resonances which work better in Quebec than Brentford: what it is to break free from the past, and why present questions mean past answers. You can love and hate the place you come from. Susan Penhaligon plays Lena; she handles the role extremely well, finding corners for psychosis and space for sympathy. Opposite her, Simon Wright is an understanding Inspector. The play is topped and tailed by sea sounds and whale music, perhaps an encouragement to take the long, cosmic view. The Statement is in repertory at the Watermans Art Centre until February 5. 081 568 1176</p>

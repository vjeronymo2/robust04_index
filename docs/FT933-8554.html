			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Finance and The Family: Dispute drags on PAY-OUTS from the Investors Compensation Scheme have been a mixed blessing for 17 people who lost money with failed financial adviser Denis Dale-Greaves. Ever since they received the money, they have been pursued by Toby Micklethwait, an accountant who claims he is owed 10 per cent on a contingency fee basis under contracts which investors signed with him. He issued a writ last October and the case reached a pre-trial review before a judge in chambers at Plymouth County Court on July 28. Acting for himself, Micklethwait had 14 days to amend the drafting of his claim, which sought fees of Pounds 29,300 plus Pounds 2,000 for 'time wasted as a result of non-payment' - a concept unknown in English law. Lawyers estimate that the full hearing probably will not get under way until the beginning of next year. Micklethwait said he filed an amended claim on Thursday but was unsure if he had met the deadline. He said the claim was longer, and spelt out more precisely what his contract had been. 'It will go to court unless a sensible settlement is proposed, but I will settle for less than the full amount because I am a nice chap - it came out easier than I expected.' The ICS paid a total of Pounds 1.6m to 109 investors who lost money through Denis Dale-Greaves. But the scheme initially told some of the investors - including the 17 now being sued - that, on the evidence available, its rules would not allow compensation to be paid to them. This was because their money had gone into fake 'bonds' issued by Dale-Greaves between December 18 1986 (the date when investment business was first defined legally) and August 28 1988 (when cover against bad advice became available from the ICS). The ICS said issuing fake bonds could not constitute investment business but had to be treated as bad advice, not covered at the time. However, the ICS offered the investors further personal interviews to discuss details of their cases. Three days before the interviews, the investors had a meeting with Micklethwait and agreed he would attempt to recover money for them. The exact terms of this agreement are in dispute. He says the wording of the contract entitles him to 10 per cent of money recovered from whatever source. But Clive Lambert, of the Plymouth-based firm Lamberts, which acts for the 17, says his clients' understanding was that Micklethwait would receive only 10 per cent of any money he recovered over and above anything the ICS agreed to pay. He says Micklethwait acknowledged this in a letter to the ICS. Other points at issue are the amount of work actually done by Micklethwait and whether he had any influence on the ICS payments made to the investors in February and March 1992. 'I anticipated a two-year slop and was planning and moving accordingly,' said Micklethwait; 'I did a lot on the telephone and a certain amount face to face, but I don't have a lot of records to prove all the 'phone calls and I didn't keep time sheets.' Lambert said his clients felt that Micklethwait had not done anything on their behalf: 'The meeting with him was on a Friday, they went to the ICS interviews the following Monday and Tuesday, and got compensation several administrative months later.' He added that Micklethwait could not claim under his contract for any work done on the Dale-Greaves case in a general way before the meeting as that would amount to past consideration, which is no consideration in law. Lambert also noted that the ICS had written - in a reply to his query about the involvement of Micklethwait in his clients' cases - that the scheme had 'no correspondence or reference from Micklethwait specific to their claims.' The 17 investors may have to seek legal aid if and when the case gets to court, Lambert adds. But the compensation payments will have taken some beyond the capital limits for legal aid.</p>

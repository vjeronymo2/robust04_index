The Russian President, Mr. Boris  Yeltsin, has repeated his invitation to the Prime Minister, Mr.  Narasimha Rao, to visit Moscow -- and proceeding from that,  officials of the two Governments are working on plans for a trip  in May. This will be the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister  to Moscow, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. The  last trip at that level was by Mr. V.P. Singh in 1990 when  Russia was not a separate republic.    Another symbolic gesture, contemplated now, envisages  telephonic talk between the two leaders on the newly-established  direct line between Delhi and Moscow.    A spokesman of the Russian Embassy confirmed that Mr.  Yeltsin  had written recently to Mr. Rao, but said he would not be able  to give the contents or the gist of this confidential  communication. Russia, he however, stressed, regarded Kashmir an  internal problem of India and supported its territorial  integrity. In this context, he said there was no change in the  Russian Government's stand.    According to details of Mr. Yeltsin's letter available from  diplomatic sources, Kashmir and Indo-Pakistan relations figured  in it along with several other issues of bilateral interest. In  Mr. Yeltsin's opinion, it was impossible to achieve true  security in South Asia, without normalising relations between  India and Pakistan. Russia, he said, welcomed the resumption of  dialogue between these two countries and considered it of utmost  importance.    It was his hope, Mr. Yeltsin said, that the two countries  would demonstrate goodwill and constructive and well-considered  approach in regard to their current problems, including Kashmir.  Stressing the importance Russia attached to India's territorial  integrity, Mr. Yeltsin said that it was a "must" not only for  the region, but for the world as a whole. That was Russia's  principled position and it, according to Mr. Yeltsin, had been  conveyed to Pakistan.    The letter, it appears, noted with satisfaction Pakistan's  decision to give up its plan for moving a resolution in the U.N.  on human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir. Russia, he  said, regarded it a step in the right direction. Mr. Yeltsin  approvingly noted the additional steps taken by the Government  of India to ensure prevention of such violations. This, perhaps,  was a reference to the establishment of the Human Rights  Commission, intended to probe allegations of excesses by the  security forces and other law enforcement agencies, and the  decision to allow international human rights organisations to  visit Kashmir. Mr. Yeltsin also expressed satisfaction over the  handling of the Hazratbal crisis.    The letter referred to the problem of trans-border terrorism  -- in the context of the activities involving Afghanistan and  Tajikstan. India which is a victim of this phenomenon and has  been drawing attention of the international community to  Pakistan's role in instigating terrorist violence in the Kashmir  Valley, would certainly have derived comfort from Russia's  views, though expressed in a different context.</p>

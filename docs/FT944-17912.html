			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Congress abandons Superfund legislation: Clean-up reforms fail for this year Congressional leaders yesterday abandoned efforts to reform the US's complex Superfund legislation on the clean-up of toxic waste sites. The Superfund reform was once expected to be a centrepiece of President Bill Clinton's environmental programme this year, but it died yesterday, a victim, like so many other measures blocked in the closing days of the congressional session, of fierce Republican opposition. Although a series of objections from industries affected by the legislation have been resolved over the year, the Superfund reform bill's sponsors failed to clear aside all the obstacles that have prevented it from coming to a vote in either chamber of Congress. Although some members claimed there was still a chance of winning both votes and then reconciling the Senate and House of Representatives versions, this was generally regarded as wildly unrealistic in the three days remaining before Congress is due to break up for the election campaign. The original 1980 Superfund law aimed to clean up toxic waste sites by requiring polluters to clean up dumps listed by the Environmental Protection Agency. But that law has turned into an administrative nightmare, with more time and money spent on lawsuits over who should be held responsible than on the actual clean-ups. An attempt to overhaul the law in 1986 left many problems unresolved, and this year's reform effort by Ms Carol Browner, head of the EPA, has attracted the support of an unusual alliance of chemical companies, insurers, mayors, small businesses and some environmentalist groups. 'The bills before Congress would have greatly improved public involvement in clean-up decisions, cut litigation costs, brought consistency and transparency to clean-up decisions and retained the core principle of 'polluter pays',' said Mr William Roberts, legislative director of the Environmental Defense Fund. The overhaul was still opposed, however, by reinsurers and a portion of the environmentalist community. 'This whole thing is about saving the money of the polluters, and that should be the last thing on anyone's mind,' said Mr Rick Hind of Greenpeace, an environmental organisation opposed to the bill. Both supporters and opponents of the Superfund reform bill said the central role in killing the measure was the hostility of Senator Bob Dole, leader of the Republican minority in the Senate. Mr Dole has argued that any reform must remove one of Superfund's most controversial elements: the application of retroactive liability to anyone involved with a polluted site. But his principal motivation is widely believed to be his determination to deny the Clinton administration even the slightest legislative victory in the closing days of the congressional session. Industry groups that might, in theory, have benefited from the changes Mr Dole sought had begged him in vain to let the bill go forward. Other bills on the Clinton administration's environmental agenda, including tighter controls on mining and grazing on federal land and the transformation of the EPA into a full cabinet department have already fallen by the wayside.</p>

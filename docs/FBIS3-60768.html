In an annual report on the domestic and international  security situations, the Public Security Investigation Agency  said the extremists escalated "indiscriminate" attacks against  targets including national cultural treasures and  state-designated national assets.    The report also cited guerrilla activities targeting the  April visit by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko to the  southernmost island of Okinawa and the March dispatch of a  second Self-Defense force engineering contingent to Cambodia.    The report said ultrarightists have escalated activities  against Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa after he voiced in his  August policy speech remorse and apology to Asian people for  atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers in World War II.    It said about 2,260 international guerrilla cases were  reported, of which seven targeted Japanese people and companies.    The Public Security Investigation Agency, established in  1952, collects intelligence on extremist groups in line with the  1952 Antisubversive Activities Law which is designed to crack  down on subversive groups.</p>

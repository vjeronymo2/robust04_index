			<p>BFN     [Text] KHMER Rouge guerrillas attacked a Cambodian  government border village yesterday, killing about 20 civilians  and sending some 1,000 civilians fleeing across the border to  Thailand.    Over 200 guerrillas launched a pre-dawn attack on Boeng  Trakuon village, which was defended by about the same number of  government troops headed by Lt Gen Chea Tun.    Thai military sources said the Khmer Rouge appear to have  routed the defenders and captured the base, which is located  opposite Ban Ta Phraya of Ta Phraya district.    A black market at Boeng Trakuon, an ammunition dump and a  storage bungalow were burned down by the guerrillas.    The blaze sent big black plumes of smoke twisting into the  sky which were seen from the Thai side of the border.    Cambodian army major Kong Savin, who fled to Ban Ta Phraya  with the refugees, said at least 20 civilians were killed and an  unknown number were captured. He said the Khmer Rouge attack  caught the government forces by surprise.    He added that the guerrillas had threatened to kill every  man  who was seen wearing an army uniform.    Maj Kong said he deeply appreciated Thailand's humanitarian  support for the refugees.    Col Atchawin Sawetserani, deputy commander of the Burapha  Task Force, said he had received a report that 628 Cambodian  refugees had arrived in Thailand and the number was still  increasing.    The refugees, he said, will be given refuge and food.    But armed Cambodian soldiers will be disarmed, he added.    The colonel added that the refugees would be repatriated as  soon as possible to safe areas where there is no fighting.    He said the border passes at Phnom Phra and Phnom Chat would  be the repatriation route.    He also warned that the Thai military would retaliate if  stray shells land in Thailand.    "Only one artillery shell landed on the Thai side yesterday,  but there has been lots of small arms fire," said the colonel,  acknowledging that the cross-border firing might be accidental.    A military source said Khmer Rouge guerrillas had been  spotted advancing towards Thmar Puok which is the head quarters  of the 7th Division.</p>

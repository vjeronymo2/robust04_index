			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Manders in Pounds 38m Dutch purchase Manders yesterday grasped a bigger share of the European printing inks market by agreeing to pay Fl 105m (Pounds 38m) in cash and shares for Premier Holding, the Dutch specialist manufacturer. The move is part of the Wolverhampton-based group's plan to shift from being a paints, inks and property group to a specialist chemicals manufacturer with an emphasis on printing inks. Manders shares yesterday were unchanged at 368p. The alliance of Manders' existing operations in coldset and liquid inks with Premier's heatset inks production will create the sixth largest printning inks supplier in Europe. The biggest players are Sun-Dainippon, a US-Japanese group, BASF of Germany and Total of France. The Premier purchase is the fourth significant move in Manders' reorganisation. It has sold its decorative paints division for Pounds 55m and will next month complete the sale of its shopping centre in Wolverhampton for Pounds 82m. It has bought the inks business of Croda International for Pounds 26m. The transactions have caused sharp but short term shifts in Manders' borrowings, but once the Premier purchase and the shopping centre sale have been completed, Manders expects to hold Pounds 25m of net cash, according to Mr Robert Purshouse, a group director. Premier is being bought from Colora, the private company owned by Premier's managing directors, Mr Jaap Groen and Mr Albert Schuite. It owns 60 per cent and the ABN Amro bank has the remaining 40 per cent. Of the purchase price, Manders is paying Pounds 29.7m cash. The balance is being settled with the issue of 2.15m new shares to Colora, which will then hold 5.41 per cent of Manders. The shares are valued at 369.2p, a slight premium over the present market level. From a factory near The Hague, Premier supplies printing inks to 25 countries. It is the Benelux market leader and the second largest supplier in the UK. In 1993 the company made operating profits of Fl 13.3m from turnover of Fl 105.2m. Net assets at the year-end were Fl 25.7m.</p>

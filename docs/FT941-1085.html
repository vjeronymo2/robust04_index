			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / FT Fashion Guide (3): Designers agree on crumpled look - The discovery of a simple and unstructured style for the 1990s / For men this summer Not since the ubiquitous power suit and black polo neck of the 1980s have menswear designers agreed so unanimously. This summer, natural creams and beiges are the colour, linen is the cloth, crumpled is the texture and loose and unstructured is the silhouette. They say it takes about four years into a decade before the styles for which it will be remembered come to the fore. If this is so, designers - having spent the last few seasons in a state of confusion as they struggled to understand and reflect the mood of the era - have finally discovered the 1990s. And it would seem that fashionable '90s man will go down in history as someone who appears to have bought his clothes at a bazaar while trekking in India and has just slept rough in them. Showing spring/summer '94 collections on the catwalks of Paris and Milan last year, designers sent out unkempt models in outfits which, not long ago, would have looked like abortive work by a drunken sewing machinist. Primitivism is the desired effect and any tricky details which reveal garments have been manufactured in state-of-the-art factories are banned in favour of unstructured, simple clothes which could have been hand-made on a Bengali peasant's loom. Shirts have lost their collars and hang loose to mid-thigh under jackets which themselves look over-size, often with Nehru collars. Trousers are as fluid and baggy as pyjama pants and are often held up with a draw-string belt or an elasticated waist. Neck scarves replace ties and Jesus sandals are worn without socks. Only the omnipresent waistcoat holds in the layers and gives some remnant of shape to the torso. Informality has been taken to an unprecedented extreme as high-priced clothes look well-worn and soap-washed at birth. Items seem to be thrown together unselfconsciously, prompting the term 'accidental fashion'. The message is clear, whether it comes from Katharine Hamnett, John Rocha, Nicole Farhi, Issey Miyake, Dries van Noten, Yohji Yamamoto, Dolce e Gabbana, Byblos, Cerruti, or Giorgio Armani: status dressing is out. Contemporary man is sufficiently socially at ease to turn to those who toil in the paddy fields for sartorial inspiration instead of wearing his wealth on his sleeve. Relaxed clothes with rural and ethnic workwear connotations send out the signal that modern man is ecologically sound and aware of the world as a global village. He is a free spirit, unharnessed from the stiff formality of boxy tailoring. That is the theory, anyway. Whether many men adopt the look in reality, is another story. It could be as short-lived as grunge was. Unless men work in the more Bohemian side of the media or the applied arts, they usually still need to wear a conventional suit, shirt and tie for the office. It is also debatable whether many men are prepared to spend designer label prices for clothes that can only be worn on summer holidays or at weekends. Deliberately creased linen may eliminate the need for regular ironing but this bonus is countered by cleaning chores as cream and beige will show every stain. And such overtly summery clothes could look foolish in torrential rain. On the other hand, most of the individual items of clothing are, in fact, thoroughly wearable when taken out of the context of the catwalk, where they have been excessively styled to make a bold statement. For instance, with a cricket sweater, baggy cream trousers would look more Brideshead Revisited than Krishna convert - a commercial, though less imaginative look. The clothes are also incredibly comfortable due to their fluidity and relaxed appearance. And one size fits virtually everyone. The mainstream clothing industry seems convinced the linen look will have mass appeal as high street stores from Marks and Spencer to Reiss, the menswear chain, have taken their cue from the international catwalks. Even Hackett, the gentleman's outfitter, has nodded its Sloaney Panama hat to linen with the introduction, for the first time, of unstructured, unlined jackets; albeit more parish priest than Buddhist convert. In fact, enormous worldwide retail demand for linen has caused severe supply problems. Flax production has an inflexible lead time - a year from the farmer's decision to sow the crop to spinning stage. A sudden boom can diminish stocks which then take a year to replenish. John Rocha, British Designer of the Year, says: 'We have had great difficulty ordering all the linen we need due to the shortage. Prices have also shot up and we have had to cover the costs ourselves rather than pass it on to the consumer.' However, the over-saturation of linen could lead consumers to tire of it quickly, especially as so many designers seem reluctant to corrupt its naturalness with coloured dyes or treatments to eradicate creases. Wary of this danger, most designers are offering alternatives, alongside the main cream, linen story. Jasper Conran, Paul Smith and Comme des Garcons, for instance, are offering the antithesis of the unstructured look with a return to figure-hugging tailoring, reminiscent of the sharp-suited mods of the 60s. Rei Kawakubo of Comme de Garcons takes tailoring to an extreme with high-buttoned, narrow-lapel jackets - as stiff and flat as cardboard cut-outs - paired with slim permanent-press, school uniform-style trousers, cropped at the ankle for the 'cool to be square' look. Paul Smith revives skinhead fashions by making accessories of slim-legged, ankle-length trousers with tight T-shirts, braces and bovver boots or brothel creepers. Jasper Conran makes references to Carnaby Street mods with a collection of lightweight, dapper, three-button or four-button suits. Jigsaw presents knitted collared T-shirts with 60s go-fast stripe patterns. Just as the conservative-dressing mods of the 60s co-existed with dishevelled hippies, so the 90s equivalents complement each other today. The world will always be full of men who strike a balance between a desire to be fashionable and a need to be moderate in their dress. This summer, London department stores such as Harrods, Harvey Nichols and Liberty are, therefore, offering the unstructured, the tailored, and the clothes that fall between the two extremes. Liberty, for example, is offering tailored suits under its own label in sober navy and grey, priced Pounds 295. They happen to be in slightly creased linen. That is true compromise.

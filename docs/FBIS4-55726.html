			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Michal Strak, chief of the Office of the </F> Council of Ministers, URM, by Agnieszka Kublik and Wojciech  Zaluska; place and date not given: "Government's Time-Slot;  Conversation With URM Chief Michal Strak"]    [Text] [GAZETA WYBORCZA] Is it true that you want to see  an amendment to the Law on Radio and Television to enable the  government to have its own program on television?    [Strak] Yes, it is. I suggest that the government have its  own time slot on public television a few times a week and at an  appropriate time.    [GAZETA WYBORCZA] Meaning?    [Strak] Meaning a time when information programs are  broadcast.    [GAZETA WYBORCZA] What kind of program is it supposed to be?    [Strak] It would be the kind of program where the government  would be able to portray itself the way it wants. In the  program, the government would speak about itself and its  responsibility. This way, we will prevent situations such as on  "Wiadomosci" [main television newscast] on 17 May, where I had  spoken a sentence out of which television people selected only  half, thus completely changing the meaning of the statement. We  continue to be the target of unprofessional or intentional  maneuvering.    [GAZETA WYBORCZA] So, in this government program, there will  be just the camera and a minister?    [Strak] I can guarantee you that we will utilize experts.  After all, it was precisely GAZETA WYBORCZA that said that the  Polish Peasant Party's election campaign on television was one  of the best.    [GAZETA WYBORCZA] And where were your experts when the prime  minister decided to fly to Italy with his wife and two children,  when the government insisted it did not have enough money to  transport war veterans?    [Strak] Let us not go back to that. Everything has already  been said on the subject.    [GAZETA WYBORCZA] So you want to have your own "Directly  from the Office of the Council of Ministers"?    [Strak] The name is irrelevant. It is going to be like in  the case of election programs...    [GAZETA WYBORCZA] ...Polish Television is not responsible  for  the program's contents?    [Strak] Exactly. I am hoping that a program like this will  ease tensions between politicians and television reporters. For  instance, "Wiadomosci" on Tuesday showed clips of the prime  minister visiting the pope, and, of course, neither his wife nor  his children were shown.    [GAZETA WYBORCZA] Is that a terrible mistake?    [Strak] Yes, it is because the prime minister repeatedly  explained that he was taking the family along with him on the  Italian trip precisely because of the meeting with the pope.    [GAZETA WYBORCZA] So, in this government time slot, the  prime minister would be shown along with his wife and children?    [Strak] Exactly.    [GAZETA WYBORCZA] Such government programs do not enjoy  enormous audiences.    [Strak] I am not saying this is going to be a "Dynasty," but  those who are interested in politics will definitely watch the  program.    [GAZETA WYBORCZA] So the government wants a time slot for  itself because it does not like "Wiadomosci"?    [Strak] There is a popular view that the media portray the  government in a biased way.    [GAZETA WYBORCZA] Why is that?    [Strak] There are three possible reasons: both we and the  journalists are not professional enough; we differ in our  political views; or there is bad will.    [GAZETA WYBORCZA] How do you think the "Wiadomosci" people  should have reacted when the prime minister sent over his  two-page communique?    [Strak] That was the first case in which the government  wanted its communique to be read. Strikes were in progress and  the situation was abnormal. The point was to ease the tension.  At such points, journalists must not arbitrarily select certain  parts from the prime minister's speech. They think they are  holding just a gun in their hands, whereas, in fact, it is a  cannon.    The force of influence that "Wiadomosci" has is enormous.    In my view, a professional journalist should consult the  government over what he will read on the program. I am  absolutely certain of that. This is what would have happened in  any civilized country.    [GAZETA WYBORCZA] But this was a very poorly written text.  Besides, it would have taken four minutes to read it.    [Strak] She could have said: "We are not responsible for  what is in the text, and we are hereby extending this edition of  `Wiadomosci' by four minutes." How is the prime minister  supposed to rule the country if it is journalists who decide  what he is supposed to say?    [GAZETA WYBORCZA] Does this "government time slot" idea mean  that the government intends to give up its fight with the  National Radio and Television Broadcasting Council [KRRiT]?    [Strak] There are some who think that personnel replacements  would be the answer to the current problems...    [GAZETA WYBORCZA] You mean, for instance, replacing Polish  Television's Chairman Wieslaw Walendziak as well as KRRiT?    [Strak] Exactly. But, as for myself, I tend to lean toward  the idea that it would be enough just to design a decent  television program for the government.</p>

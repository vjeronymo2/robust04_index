			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Newfoundland Premier A. Brian Peckford plans to step down after 10 years of  governing Canada's poorest province. The fiery provincial leader announced his  resignation, which will take effect at the end of March, at a meeting of  Progressive Conservative party leaders. A date for a leadership convention will  be decided by Monday, party officials said. International Trade Minister John  Crosbie, a Newfoundlander who helped shepherd through Parliament a free trade  pact with the United States, is believed interested in succeeding Peckford.  </P></p>

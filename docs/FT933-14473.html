			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Roche Roche is a rare example of a pharmaceuticals company which has successfully reinvented itself. Having lived through dark days during the decline of Valium, the tranquilliser on which its fortunes rested until the early 1980s, Roche's prodigious investment in research and development is now bearing fruit. The 14 per cent sales increase in pharmaceuticals during the first half stands in contrast to modest expectations elsewhere in the sector. Holding drug sales steady in Germany despite the havoc caused by healthcare reforms is especially impressive. Like other drugs companies, Roche may still be vulnerable to nasty shocks. A successful patent challenge to its diagnostics technology, or disappointment for Genentech's new products, would cloud the earnings outlook. With strong positions in biotechnology, over-the-counter medicines and prescription pharmaceuticals, Roche has spread its risks second time around. Strange, then, that it should remain shy about the fine details of its financial performance. Investors will have to wait until the year end for an indication of first half profits. Still, as long as the company is turning in annual earnings growth of around 20 per cent, even the most principled investor will be inclined to forgive. If the stratospheric growth rate starts to falter, Roche may have to be more forthcoming to retain support.</p>

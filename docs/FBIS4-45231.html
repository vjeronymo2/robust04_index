Leroy arrived today at Ruml's invitation for an official  visit to the Czech Republic. Also present at the talks were  Health Minister Ludek Rubas, Deputy Justice Minister Cyril  Svoboda and Deputy Interior Minister Martin Fendrych.    Ruml told Leroy about the Czech Republic's fight against  drugs and drug-related crime, Bernikova said, and is at present  preparing a proposal that the status of the inter-ministerial  anti-drug committee be raised, to give it more powers. The  ministers involved should meet at its sessions twice a year.    Bernikova said the Czech Republic was paying considerable  attention to the preparation of new laws concerning drugs. It  was working on a law on money-laundering and perfecting a law on  narcotic and psychotropic substances. Other necessary measures  would be worked into the new criminal law and the criminal code,  he said.    Leroy will also take part in a meeting of the  inter-ministerial drug committee, Bernikova said. He welcomed  the attention which the Czech Republic was paying to the drug  problem, and offered financial and administrative help in the  fight against drugs.</p>

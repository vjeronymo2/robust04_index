A group of six U.S. representatives, led by John Murtha,  chairman of the Defense Subcommittee of the House Appropriations  Committee, met with South Korean Vice Foreign Minister Hong  Sun-yong to discuss the effectiveness of sanctions against North  Korea and security on the Korean peninsula, ministry officials  said.    The talks touched on how far Japan and China would go in  case  the UN Security Council imposed sanctions against North Korea,  whether the Tokyo government would be able to halt the money  flow from pro-Pyongyang Korean residents into North Korea and  whether Beijing would stop supplying crude oil to its ally.    Vice Minister Hong said he expects Beijing to recognize the  international mood and meet South Korea's expectations.    Apparently trying to allay criticism here that Washington is  taking advantage of the current tension to sell arms to Seoul,  the congressmen dismissed any commercial interest in the matter,  the officials said.    The Clinton administration's plans to deploy Patriot  missiles  at American bases in South Korea, the lawmakers said, are aimed  at countering North Korean missiles that can reach as far as  Japan.    The Patriot deployment should be understood for its  "political symbolism," the congressmen were quoted as saying,  and the missiles' presence would greatly improve deterrence  against North Korean aggression.    The legislators left Tuesday morning, ending a three-day  visit to Seoul that included meetings with the defense minister  and presidential aide for diplomacy and national security.</p>

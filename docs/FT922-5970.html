			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Gadaffi regime seen as least of many evils: Showdown with the west strengthens Libyan leader's hand IN THE souks and the narrow, rundown streets of Tripoli's old town the mood of Libya's organised revolutionary youth is still defiant. Under a brightly painted billboard displaying a romantic portrait of Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, or 'the leader' as he is known in Libya, crowds of angry young men gather to vent their rage. 'Even if America and England bomb Tripoli again and kill our people we will not give up,' said one man. 'They are just trying to persecute us and we won't agree to their demands. Never.' But in the upper echelons of Libya's internationally isolated ruling clique the defiance once shared by the revolutionary militants on the streets is crumbling. Six weeks after the United Nations imposed air sanctions on Libya for its support of alleged terrorists and its possible involvement in the bombing of a Pan Am passenger jet over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, Col Gadaffi's 23-year-old regime is seeking a face-saving compromise with the west. Intensive efforts by Arab states, in particular Egypt, have helped to push the regime towards conciliation. Cairo, with up to 1m Egyptians working in Libya, is particularly anxious to avoid any destabilising fallout from conflict between Tripoli and the world. In the face of such pressure Libya has already announced it would implement a UN security council resolution which, in the words of the official statement, would mean 'the categorical renunciation of terrorism in all its forms and whatever its sources are'. The Libyans have agreed to cut all links with terrorist groups and invite UN monitors to verify that Libya was not training any terrorists on its soil. Col Gadaffi has also indicated he is willing to disclose details of Libyan links with the Irish Republican Army in Britain. The problem with Libya's latest position is that it still leaves open the matter of the two suspects in the airliner bombing. The UN has said they must stand trial in Britain or the US. In an interview, Col Gadaffi said that the matter did not concern the Libyan state but was a problem for the two men and their lawyers. Another possible face-saving way out for Col Gadaffi is the national debate which is being held in the 'people's conferences' which will decide within two weeks whether to change Libyan law to allow the two suspects to be extradited - a decision which will appear to have been taken outside Col Gadaffi's circle. For the moment the impact of air sanctions against Libya appears largely psychological. Life in Tripoli is normal. Foreign businessmen, mostly oil men, continue to arrive in the sleepy capital. The markets are full of fresh fruit, vegetables, eggs and meat. Ships and passenger ferries glide across Tripoli bay into the port. Most Libyan businessmen have adapted easily to making the four-hour drive on good tarmac roads to Djerba, in neighbouring Tunisia, to catch an international flight, or to taking a catamaran to Malta. However, faced with the prospect of either maritime sanctions or an embargo on Libyan oil exports, which provides more than 90 per cent of the country's Dollars 3bn foreign earnings, many Libyan businessmen and political observers believe that the two suspects will stand trial in the west, probably in Scotland. 'Libya is a small country dependent on the west for experts and technology,' said one Libyan businessman. 'There is no way we can risk being cut off even though most people here believe it is neither fair nor legal. It's just a matter of time and finding an honourable truce.' However, Tripoli's business community complains that since last November the Lockerbie issue has dominated the government's time and held back a sweeping economic liberalisation and privatisation programme which included laws to privatise banking and increase allocation of foreign exchange to the private sector. They say it has also strengthened the hand of the myriad and sinister security agencies by resurrecting the fears of foreign military intervention. Optimistic businessmen believe that the regime, faced by bureaucratic incompetence, economic failure, a burgeoning black market for the Libyan dinar and its own unpopularity, was prepared to edge away from the socialist experiments set out in Col Gadaffi's 'Green Book'. More than anything else they fear that a western-prompted change in the regime, which many Libyans believe is the real motive behind the current showdown, would unleash the suppressed fundamentalist Islamic movement which Col Gadaffi has kept at bay and upset the delicate tribal balance of power he has maintained. 'There is no organised or visible political opposition in Libya and no independent institutions,' said one US-educated university lecturer. 'The revolution has swept all that away. If Gadaffi went tomorrow there would be chaos - perhaps even civil war. 'This regime may be considered by the west as evil but for us Libyans it is the least of many evils.' On the streets the support for 'the leader' is less pragmatic. Despite the squandering of Libya's oil wealth and the brutal excesses of the security forces, many Libyans, particularly the previously underdeveloped Bedouin peoples and the eastern tribes, have benefited from the revolution's progress in education, housing and health. Col Gadaffi's apparent unswerving support for the Palestine Liberation Organisation also continues to exercise a powerful pull on the 'Arab masses'. Western diplomats agree that the current crisis has strengthened Col Gadaffi's hand both inside and outside the regime. 'It would be a great mistake for the west to think that pressure will topple Gadaffi for a better regime,' said one western envoy. 'He is bowed, not broken.'</p>

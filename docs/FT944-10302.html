			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Lady Porter lawyer says gerrymander charge 'was absurd' A district auditor was wrong to use the word 'gerrymandering' when he accused Westminster City Council's former Conservative leader Dame Shirley Porter of mis-using public money, her lawyer claimed at a public inquiry yesterday. Mr Anthony Scrivener QC was defending Dame Shirley against accusations from Mr John Magill, district auditor, that she and nine others sold off council homes to people who they believed were likely to vote Conservative. Mr Scrivener said it was 'absurd' to call it gerrymandering because there was no way of guaranteeing that the buyers would vote - let alone that they would vote Conservative. 'This was not gerrymandering,' he said. 'I can hardly imagine a more emotive word to hit the headlines.' At the start of the public inquiry, Dame Shirley tried to get Mr Magill removed from the case because he had used such a term when presenting his provisional report in January to a televised press conference. She claimed it had prejudiced her defence. Mr Scrivener said he appreciated it would be difficult for Mr Magill 'to retreat from your high point' after the views had attracted so much publicity. 'But I hope that you will have the strength to do just that,' he said. Mr Scrivener also argued that Mr Jeremy Sullivan, a leading QC, had approved the scheme to sell the homes before it had been passed in July 1987. Mr Scrivener said Dame Shirley attached great importance to obtaining legal approval for her policies as council leader. He added that if the district auditor stuck to his report, it would be the first time that councillors would be surcharged after obtaining legal approval from independent counsel. Mr Scrivener criticised Mr Magill for going further than any other district auditor when he sought and seized papers arising out of closed meetings of Tory councillors. He alleged that Mr Magill had 'feasted' on these political papers and had used them to back his accusations of gerrymandering. Mr Scrivener did not deny these papers existed. He told the inquiry: 'What was said in these meetings is one thing. It does not mean that councillors forget their duties when they go into the council chamber. If the district auditor is right, I can imagine that all the shredders in councils around the country would be working overtime.' The inquiry was adjourned until Tuesday.</p>

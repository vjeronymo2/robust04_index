			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / One option they don't want: US and UK companies are angry at plans to give more information in accounts Public hearings convened by the US Financial Accounting Standards Board do not normally attract capacity crowds. But when the standards-setting body held a meeting in San Jose, California, recently, 3,000 managers and employees protested outside and a band attempted to drown out the proceedings. The board's 100-page technical document known as '127-C', published last June, has proved highly controversial. Its subject is the one accounting topic guaranteed to provoke ire among companies on both sides of the Atlantic: the disclosure and treatment in accounts of the details of executive compensation - and in particular options, which are rights to buy shares at a fixed price in the future. Business is coming under increasing pressure in both the US and UK. Last week, the UK Accounting Standards Board, the national standards-setting body, issued draft recommendations that urge companies to disclose full details of the options they grant to directors. In the US, its counterpart, the FASB, reconvenes next month to draft revised proposals. These would require companies for the first time to treat options granted to senior executives as a cost to be set against profits. Concern about executive pay packages has risen as a growing number of top managers are remunerated not only with salary and perks, but also with options. The intention is to provide a form of performance-related pay. Directors exercise their options only if the value of the shares on the stock market rises above the fixed price at which they are entitled to buy them. The greater the difference, the more profitable are the options, giving executives the incentive to run the company in a way that boosts the share price. But many companies now complain that draft requirements from accounting standards bodies will jeopardise their future growth, by forcing them to stop awarding options. This, in turn, would make it more difficult to hire the best people, they argue. 'You would never have thought this level of reaction would have come out of a proposed accounting standard,' says Stephen Zeff, professor of accounting at Rice University in Texas. 'The debate is extraordinarily emotional. To listen to company executives you would think this was the Doomsday scenario.' Last week's guidance from the Urgent Issues Task Force, a subcommittee of the UK Accounting Standards Board, was an attempt to close a loophole which has allowed companies to disclose far less about options in their accounts than the law intended - and less than their counterparts in the US have to reveal. It follows growing pressure for disclosure from investors. The report of the Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance, published at the end of 1992, called for full disclosure of directors' remuneration. While a few UK companies have begun to make detailed disclosures on options  -such as British Petroleum and Reuters - most make it impossible for shareholders to see how much directors are being paid in this way. Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the UK Accounting Standards Board, says the aim of the draft guidelines is for sufficient disclosure to provide readers of accounts with a 'do-it-yourself kit' of information, from which they can calculate the value of options being granted to directors. The guidelines call for companies to show the total number of share options granted, as well as the number awarded to each director. They call for publication of the date and price at which the options can be exercised and when they expire. They also recommend that, if any options have been taken up during the financial year, companies should disclose the market price of the shares on the day when they were exercised. However, in contrast to most standards issued by the board, the share options guidelines are only advisory and cannot be enforced by the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog. The board hoped to make them mandatory, but it recently ran into a legal hitch: the existing law does not require disclosure of remuneration unless it can be precisely valued. 'The law says that if you are paid Pounds 100 plus a sheep and you cannot value the sheep, you are not required to say you are paid Pounds 100 plus a sheep. You can just say you are paid Pounds 100,' says Mr Tweedie. Options defy precise valuation. Directors cannot sell them immediately, and their final value is dependent on the share price - which may be highly volatile - at the time when they can be exercised. If the company collapses, or the share price at the time of exercise is less than the fixed price at which they were granted, they are worthless. This difficulty also lies at the heart of the current debate in the US. There have long been requirements for companies to disclose the number and exercise price of share options in the proxy statements, which are sent to shareholders before a vote. Two years ago, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US market watchdog, tightened the rules to stop companies burying the information in the small print. However, the FASB proposals go much further. The draft accounting standard issued last summer argues that options are a charge to the company and should therefore be taken as a cost, which would correspondingly reduce earnings - the single financial measure most used to assess corporate performance. Ms Diana Willis, FASB's project manager for stock options, is confident that there are mathematical models which are sufficiently precise to place a more realistic value on options. 'There will never be one definitive method of valuation, but we all know that the existing value of zero is wrong,' she says. She points out that there are many other numbers in financial statements which cannot be precisely measured but which are included, such as post-retirement benefits. 'Accounting is not very precise once you get past what cash you have,' she says. However, business has been almost universally opposed to FASB's proposals. No sector is more upset than the new high-technology companies, such as those based in northern California, which say, because they are unable to pay high salaries, the recommendations will jeopardise their only way to attract the best workers. Others accuse FASB of jumping on the current bandwagon of criticism of excessive executive pay. Even the large accountancy firms, which initially supported the FASB proposals, have now turned against them - Mr Walter Schuetze, the chief accountant of the SEC, denounced the firms in a speech in January for losing their independence and acting as 'cheerleaders for their clients'. Surprised by the public reaction, the seven-member FASB board meets again next month, and hopes to produce a final version of its standard by early next year. The indications are that it is still firmly behind its proposals. Meanwhile, the politicians - responding to business pressure - have joined the growing ranks of critics. A senate resolution has urged FASB to drop its proposals, and a draft bill now in Congress mandates the SEC to ignore them even if they are issued, which would render them ineffective. Mr Dennis Beresford, FASB's chairman, remains committed. 'We are not going to back down simply because of political pressure,' he says. 'The board is still strongly convinced that options have a value and there is a way to value them. There have been some questions about how appropriate is the valuation method we discussed before, but we are going to try our best to come up with a reasonable approach.' Shareholders in the UK looking for greater disclosure of the costs of options are unlikely to receive any such strong reassurance. The Accounting Standards Board's proposals are likely to be republished within two months, virtually unaltered. There is little sign in the short term that the Department of Trade and Industry or the stock exchange will change the regulations in order to make such disclosures mandatory.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- America's top executives: in the money  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             Value of stock options yet Executive            Company             to be exercised (dollars'000)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael D.

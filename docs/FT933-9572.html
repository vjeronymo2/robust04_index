			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Home territory under threat: Upheavals in German insurance Allianz's international competitors may have breathed a sigh of relief when Europe's largest insurance company reported its 1992 results. For the first time in more than 20 years the group lost money - some DM400m (Pounds 156m) - on its insurance operations in the traditionally profitable German market. Allianz's after-tax profits were down by 18.1 per cent to DM857.9m and overall underwriting operations remained in deficit for the second year running. After a long period of relentless expansion, Allianz's difficulties reflect the radical changes affecting the traditionally stable, heavily regulated and highly profitable German insurance market. German insurers have long enjoyed wide margins on home, motor and life policies, paying out less in claims and expenses than they receive in premiums. But this has begun to change as a result of several factors: A sharp increase in car thefts since the opening of borders with eastern Europe and German reunification in 1990. Some 87,000 cars were stolen in 1991, rising to more than 130,000 last year. Allianz's losses from theft rose by 15-20 per cent in the first quarter of this year. Volatile weather patterns. Storm losses at Allianz totalled DM200m in the first six months, up more than 40 per cent. One hail-storm alone, which swept across southern Germany, cost the company DM60m in claims. The cost of expanding eastwards. Allianz moved into eastern Germany with the DM711m acquisition of Deutsche Versicherungs, the former state insurance monopoly. Losses are expected to mount to DM1.5bn before the acquisition starts to make a profit in the latter half of the decade. Other German companies are also incurring heavy losses as they build up operations in eastern Germany from scratch. Increased competition from banks. As in other countries, German banks have diversified into insurance on the assumption that the distinction between banking and life insurance products is narrowing. Deutsche Bank set up a life insurance company in 1989 and has since acquired stakes in Deutsche Herold, a life insurance company, and Gerling, a large industrial insurer. The pressures will intensify next year. By July 1994, the European Commission's single market programme will allow insurers from all EC states direct access to each other's markets. At the same time, new European rules will force the German supervisory authorities to scrap restrictions on both prices and policy wordings. Motor liability business and life business will be directly affected by the changes, but analysts expect competition to become more intense in other classes too. These changes should present opportunities for international competitors to increase their share of the German market from their current 13 per cent. Already foreign companies are seeking to take advantage. In particular, France's two largest insurers - Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) and Assurances Generales de France (AGF) - are keen to expand in Germany as part of their broader European ambitions. UAP - through its 34 per cent holding in Victoire - owns a sizeable minority stake in Colonia, Germany's third biggest insurer, and is seeking to increase it. Recently AGF, the second largest state-controlled French company, acquired a 33 per cent stake in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), the second biggest insurance group in Germany. 'Any major insurer with a pan-European strategy would like eventually to have a position in Germany because it is Europe's largest country and because it is perceived to be a good place to expand from into eastern Europe,' says Mr Stephen Dias, an analyst with Goldman Sachs. Allianz's senior executives appear unruffled by the market turbulence and the threat of increased competition. Mr Uwe Haasen, head of German operations at Allianz, concedes that 1993 will be another tough year with losses in Germany running at a high level in the first six months. But he is confident that this will prove to be a temporary dip. Most analysts covering the company agree, citing a number of factors that will shield it from the impact of greater competiton. First, its 17 per cent share of the German general insurance market is nearly three times greater than that of its closest rival, the Colonia Group - and is one of the reasons it enjoys lower costs. Allianz's expense ratio, which measures costs as a percentage of premium income, amounts to 21 per cent, several points less than most of its competitors not only in Germany but in the broader European market. Unlike many of its UK rivals who distribute their products through independent brokers, Allianz also controls its sales outlets. Its network of 8,000 full-time and 40,000-50,000 part-time exclusive agents, helps it retain customer loyalty and makes it difficult for competitors to take market share. Allianz retains 90-95 per cent of its customers each year, compared with 75-80 per cent for UK companies. Allianz's property and financial assets - often valued at the cost at which they were acquired rather than their present market value - represent a huge store of hidden wealth. Mr Tom Bennett, analyst with Banque Paribas Capital Markets, estimates that unrealised capital appreciation on Allianz's 25 per cent holding in Munich Re, Germany's largest reinsurance company, exceeded DM1.1bn last year. And unlike some of its German competitors, Allianz has already begun to reorganise its operations to adjust to the expected increase in competition. At the beginning of 1992 Allianz announced a reorganisation of its business on the basis of customer types: individual customers; small businesses; multinational businesses. Finally, following its rapid expansion abroad in the late 1980s, Allianz is no longer so dependent on its domestic market. In 1992 subsidiaries in the US, the UK, Italy, France and elsewhere generated nearly half of the DM54.7bn premium income. More recently it has begun to move into Asia, announcing a joint venture with the Japanese retail company, Nichii, to sell personal accident and liability insurances in 50 department stores from the autumn. Premium income is expected to grow to more than DM60bn in 1994, with general business now as large as the four biggest UK insurance companies together. It looks as though, even with the problems of the German market, there will be little respite for Allianz's rivals.</p>

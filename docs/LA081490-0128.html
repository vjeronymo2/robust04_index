			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> DUELING MEASURES CONFOUND OFFICIALS  </P> <P> In the wake of the City Council's decision last week to place a measure on the  Nov. 6 ballot to rival an activist group's beach-and-park preservation  initiative, city attorneys are now trying to figure out what would happen if  voters approve both measures.  </P> <P> City Atty.  </P> <P> Gail Hutton said she plans to seek an opinion from the state attorney general's  office to clarify the matter.  </P> <P> The initiative proposed by Save Our Parks, a grass-roots group that collected  more than 15,000 voter signatures to qualify the measure, would bar the sale or  lease of city parkland or beach land without voter approval. The rival  proposal, which four council members voted to place on the ballot Friday just  hours before the filing deadline, restricts sales but would allow leasing of  parkland or beach land for development without a citywide referendum.  </P> <P> Hutton and other legal experts say they believe that, should both proposals be  approved, the measure garnering the most votes would win, as is the case with  competing state initiatives. But because the measures are proposed amendments  to the city charter -- which carries with it a unique set of laws and  guidelines -- some lawyers believe the matter is not so clear-cut.  </P> <P> Assistant County Counsel Arthur C. Wahlstedt Jr. said he believes the same  guidelines that govern state measures would apply to city charter amendment  proposals.  </P> <P> "If the two could be harmonized," Wahlstedt said, "it's possible that both  could be passed. . . . But I'm not absolutely certain. I don't have a lot of  experience with charters, so I hesitate to respond to something on city  charters." JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AFTER KEY RESIGNATION, PELTASON ORDERS STUDY OF UCI MEDICAL SCHOOL  </P> <P> UC Irvine Chancellor Jack W. Peltason said Thursday that he will assemble a  panel of expert consultants to examine problems in UCI's troubled medical  school after the resignation of Dr. Edward J. Quilligan as vice chancellor of  health sciences.  </P> <P> Quilligan's resignation earlier this week as vice chancellor and dean of the  College of Medicine will become effective no later than March 15, upon  selection of an interim dean, Peltason said in a statement issued from San  Francisco, where he was attending a UC Board of Regents meeting. The acting  dean is expected to be chosen from among UCI's medical faculty.  </P> <P> "In view of the rapidly changing nature of demands on and needs of the medical  school, I am bringing in some expert faculty and administration from other  institutions to serve as professional consultants to me and to the faculty,"  Peltason said in a letter to the medical school faculty.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Consultants From UC System  </P> <P> The consultants, to be assembled next week, will be selected from within the UC  system, UCI spokeswoman Linda Granell said.  </P> <P> The advisory panel will also consult with UCI's Academic Senate, the faculty  body that sets curriculum. The same search committee that brought Quilligan to  UCI from Davis in October, 1986, will be reactivated to find a successor.  </P> <P> Quilligan, an internationally recognized authority on Cesarian sections and  fetal monitoring who has been president of the American Obstetrics and  Gynecology Society, will return to teaching and a clinical practice in  affiliation with the university.  </P> <P> Despite a tumultuous tenure, Quilligan's resignation took most faculty members  by surprise.  </P> <P> Rumors swirled on campus and at UCI Medical Center in Orange on Thursday.  Well-connected faculty members and administrators advanced opinions that seemed  to depend as much on their alliances as their vantage points -- that Quilligan  was fired by Peltason, or that he quit because he could not unify the faculty  and wanted to make way for someone who could.  </P> <P> Quilligan and Peltason, the only ones who really knew, were not talking  Thursday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lost an Astute Mediator  </P> <P> Dr. Cyril Barton, associate professor and kidney specialist who is among  faculty physicians opposing Quilligan's plan to require doctors to pay up to  60% of their outside earnings to the medical school, said Quilligan lost a  politically astute mediator when his No. 2 man, Dr. Philip DiSaia, resigned as  associate vice chancellor because of a heart condition in January.  </P> <P> Quilligan then was on his own to answer for personnel problems and a Medical  Center deficit that leaped from $1 million in 1986 to a projected $12 million  this year, Barton said.  </P> <P> "Quilligan had this problem of a huge medical center deficit, and he lost the  confidence and respect of the rank-and-file faculty," Barton said. "When DiSaia  became ill, Quilligan came under fire from above."  </P> <P> A high-ranking administrator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, described  Quilligan's problems as "cumulative." The administrator said Quilligan stepped  aside despite Peltason's urgings that he stay on.  </P> <P> "I think the chancellor and Prof. Quilligan saw eye to eye on long-range  goals," the administrator said. "The fact that there was disruption over the  compensation plan was not the reason -- anytime you deal with the salaries of  physicians, there are going to be complainers. And there was a deficit at the  hospital, but there is always going to be a deficit.  </P> <P> "The basic problem was that Prof. Quilligan was unable to get past those issues  and unite the faculty and move forward.  </P> <P> "It's a tough, demanding job, and sometimes someone comes to the conclusion  that 'this is more than I can handle,' " the administrator said.  </P> <P> But a prominent faculty physician who spoke highly of Quilligan called the  resignation "a firing -- it was a power play."  </P> <P> The physician, who also asked not to be named, said the lack of unified faculty  support for Quilligan created a condition in which he could be fired without  substantial backlash.  </P> <P> "Quilligan got himself into difficulties, with the faculty of the medical  school over the pay plan issue, and the administration with the hospital  deficit," the doctor said. "He didn't have the full support of the faculty, and  that provided the means for the chancellor and his other administrators to move  in for the kill."  </P> <P> Half a dozen past and present medical school and medical center administrators  were included in speculation about who might be named acting dean. Dr. Stanley  van den Noort, who was dean for 12 years, said he is "absolutely not" a  candidate.  </P> <P> "In the short term, Dr. Quilligan's departure slows recruiting and other  important activities," van den Noort said. "It would be better if (the  resignation) didn't happen. It will require an acting dean while a search goes  on -- maybe a year or two or three.  </P> <P> "We're looking ahead to somewhat unstable times for the College of Medicine and  the Medical Center."  </P></p>

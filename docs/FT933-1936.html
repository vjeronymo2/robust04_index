			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / UK warship hosts fresh Bosnia talks THE THREE Bosnian factions were yesterday locked in secretive meetings on board a British naval vessel, as international mediators made a last-minute attempt to overcome obstacles to a Bosnian peace deal, due to be signed in Sarajevo today. Representatives from all three sides, including Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and the Bosnian Croat leader, Mr Mate Boban, held talks with Lord Owen and Mr Theovald Stoltenberg, the international mediators, on board the aircraft carrier, HMS Invincible, in the Adriatic sea. Bosnian Serb officials in Pale, the capital of the self-styled Bosnian Serb state, yesterday said that the Serb side was represented by Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader. The meeting, said to have beencalled at the mediators' request, appeared to mark a final attempt to overcome remaining territorial disputes, in particular the Bosnian governments' demand for access to the Adriatic. The three sides are expected to meet in Sarajevo today to sign a broad agreement which would turn Bosnia into a loose union of three ethnic mini-states. However, after all three sides indicated at the weekend they remained opposed to any fresh territorial concessions, Lord Owen yesterday warned that the meeting was still not definite. The mediators now appear to be pushing the three sides to agree to an outline agreement, leaving some of the territorial details to be decided at a later date. But in spite of the sudden ceasefire agreements conducted between the Bosnian government and their Serb and Croat counterparts last week, the sticking points to a peace agreement remain the Bosnian government's demand for further land and access to the sea. Diplomats yesterday said the mediators' decision to call the meeting on the ship appeared to be an attempt to escape the media spotlight and increase pressure on the three sides. 'The thing about meeting on a ship is that you can't suddenly storm out,' commented one British official yesterday. Fighting was reported to be continuing between Moslem and Croat forces in parts of central Bosnia in defiance of the ceasefire agreed last week. A Bosnian Croat said Moslem forces had launched a three-pronged attack on the city of Mostar. UN peacekeepers in central Bosnia said that earlier fighting between Moslem and Croat forces around Vitez and Gornji Vakuf appeared to be dying down. Russia may be unwilling to send extra troops to help enforce a peace agreement in Bosnia, General Pavel Grachev, its defence minister, has indicated, writes David White in Moscow. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, British defence secretary, said General Grachev made clear in talks yesterday that he was not contemplating an increase. The National Bank of Yugoslavia is to issue a 10bn dinar note to replace currency made almost worthless by a devastating daily inflation rate of 20 per cent, Reuter reports from Belgrade. The new white, black and red note will be issued today, the Belgrade-based news agency Tanjug quoted central bank officials as saying. It is worth Dollars 6 on Belgrade's foreign currency black market. This will be the third new banknote issued in a month, each with more and more zeroes to it. In mid-August the bank issued a 500m dinar note then worth Dollars 3.50 and now worth 30 US cents.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BASEBALL OWNERS AFFIRM PLAN FOR LOCKOUT AT SPRING TRAINING  </P> <P> Baseball owners today reiterated their plan for a spring training lockout but  seemed to soften their hard-line stance.  </P> <P> "There is no change in our strategy," Milwaukee owner Bud Selig said. "But  there is going to be another meeting with the players on Monday, and this is  going to be a day-by-day negotiation."  </P> <P> Camps are scheduled to open Thursday. Clubs have been told by the owners not to  start spring training unless an agreement is reached with players on a new  contract.  </P> <P> Selig, chairman of the owners' Player Relations Committee, tried to avoid the  word "lockout." When pressed, he said, "nothing has changed."  </P> <P> Chuck O'Connor, management's chief negotiator, said, "The clubs are not free to  go to camp on Feb. 15."  </P> <P> Commissioner Fay Vincent, who attended the two-hour meeting with owners, said  he hoped something could be accomplished in next week's bargaining sessions.  </P> <P> "I'm eager to find a resolution to this problem. I am trying, in a way I hope  is relevant, to be useful," Vincent said.  </P> <P> "I am convinced that the efforts will be very intensive to reach an agreement  in the nearest possible time frame. Will that happen? I have no idea."  </P> <P> Donald Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Assn., was  about to enter a meeting with players in Phoenix when owners announced their  decision.  </P> <P> "It's so unnecessary," said Fehr, who met with 50 players in Los Angeles on  Thursday night. "This is a lockout in an industry that just signed a  billion-and-a-half dollar television contract. It's going to be very difficult  to generate any kind of sympathy."  </P> <P> At issue is a demand by the owners to tie player salaries to the amount of  money the teams make. Such an arrangement would in effect cap salaries.  </P> <P> In addition, the owners want to make performance on the playing field a  determining factor in how much players are paid in their first six years in the  major leagues.  </P> <P> Selig said the owners endorsed the strategy that the negotiating committee has  adopted.  </P> <P> "Obviously if on Feb. 15 there is no agreement, the camps won't be opened," he  said. "We're going to take each day and each week as it comes and get this  done."  </P> <P> The players are seeking an increase in the minimum salary from $68,000 to  $125,000 and oppose any proposals that would put a lid on how high salaries can  rise.  </P> <P> Some star players have reached stratospheric salary levels, with several  receiving contracts worth more than $3 million a year in recent months, led by  Will Clark of the San Francisco Giants.  </P> <P> The decision to lock the spring training gates was the second such move by the  owners since 1976 when a 22-day stoppage occurred. That was halted on orders  from then-Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, and the regular season opened on schedule.  </P></p>

			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Technology: Trading up in Montreal - A new service at a Canadian exchange Every stock exchange aims to make trading in its listed securities as efficient and orderly as possible. Any market that falls short risks losing business to its competitors in an era when many companies list their shares on more than one exchange. The Montreal Exchange is going one step further. Besides honing its own trading system, the exchange is in the advanced stages of a project that will give member firms access to other exchanges and provide the myriad sources of data required by a securities dealer - all on a single terminal. 'We see it as a normal extension of a stock exchange,' says Keith Gray, president of TD Green Line, Canada's biggest discount brokerage and one of six securities dealers that have agreed to install the Montreal system. The ME's project - known as Platform for Electronic Access to Exchanges (Peace)  -both competes against and complements services offered by established systems integrators in the financial services industry. One Canadian securities firm, RBC Dominion Securities, has shunned the Montreal project in favour of its own trading platform, which it is developing with the help of Reuters. Ken Troy, president of Reuters Information Services in Canada, says that by mixing and matching trading platforms and data feeds, securities firms can 'get exactly what they need'. Peace users will be able to use Reuters data and will have access, if they wish, to a Reuters trading platform through an electronic bridge. The Peace project has its origins in the long-standing rivalry between the ME and the busier Toronto Stock Exchange. Most large Canadian companies and several foreign ones list their shares on both exchanges, with the result that competition for trades is intense. Trading volumes in Toronto are five to six times higher than Montreal, and the ME saw a risk of an even greater imbalance when the TSE unveiled plans early last year to replace its trading floor with a fully automated trading system. 'It was a cue for everyone that it was time to change,' says Rene Poirier, the ME's vice-president for development. Peace will give traders equal access to the ME and the TSE through a single workstation. Traders will enter buy and sell orders into Peace, which will search each exchange's electronic order book for the best deal and then match orders on the basis of price and volume. The system will also be able to split orders between the two exchanges. Toronto's automated trading system has similar capabilities but does not integrate its software with members' other trading and data requirements. Peace will enable traders to use the same terminal for a variety of other functions, such as historical market data, information on a trader's limits and positions, and back-office links. 'The idea is to have one physical device in front of a trader which can do almost anything,' Poirier says. A key element in the Montreal package will be a data distribution system known as Fist, which has been developed by Kapiti, a UK-based systems integrator. The Kapiti software is already used by, among others, Barclays Bank's global treasury division and Republic National Bank of New York. 'The name of the game will be that the best market will win,' Poirier says. 'If the people in Montreal are aggressive, they'll be in a better position to get their share of the market.' The Peace system is due to be commissioned by the first of its six initial customers in August. If it proves successful, the ME plans to add trading functions for the Vancouver and New York exchanges, both of which have several dozen listings in common with Montreal and Toronto. The next step will be to try to interest foreign securities firms that execute trades on more than one exchange. New customers would make Peace not just a technological success, but a commercial one as well.</p>

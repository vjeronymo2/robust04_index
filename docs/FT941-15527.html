			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Private rail operators will compete with low fares Sir, You reported a BR manager's claim that there is a threat to discounted fares on off-peak railway services on the new franchised passenger routes ('Rail sell-off threatens to limit scope of discount fares', January 13). BR will have no part to play, however, in the setting of franchised service discount ticketing levels except where it wins a franchise itself. The new private sector operators will be extremely keen to attract the maximum number of passengers to their routes. As has been the experience in other transport fields, they will not achieve that by raising prices but by offering their own discounts to tempt new passengers. If BR finds it commercially sensible to offer discounted tickets, which it does at present without any compulsion, you can expect the private sector to be even keener. A balance has to be struck between the convenience of commonly priced inter-available tickets and the possibility of a wider choice of differently priced services. Inter-availability and common pricing of tickets will normally be a requirement of franchise agreements for season and full-fare standard and first-class tickets on shared routes. Discounted travel, even now, does not offer unrestricted travel. Off-peak fares attract their own conditions limiting travel to particular trains, days and times. The present success of Apex fares shows that many passengers are prepared to accept restrictions on their time of travel to benefit from cheaper fares, and I am sure that such passengers will benefit from allowing operators to compete for their custom with discounted fares.

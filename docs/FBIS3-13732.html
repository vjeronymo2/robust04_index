He said that those who make these accusations  are unscrupulous criminals who want to cover up their actions by  accusing us. These accusations are rumors and are not based on  evidence [words indistinct].    Ja'ja' said that under the pretext of investigations, an  organized political campaign of suppression is launched. The  campaign is now aimed against the Lebanese forces and it will be  aimed against other parties tomorrow.    According to press reports, Dr. Ja'ja' made two telephone  calls to President Ilyas al-Hirawi and Chamber of Deputies  Speaker Nabih Birri inquiring about the reasons for the raids on  the Lebanese Forces centers and requesting them to intercede to  stop this campaign.</p>

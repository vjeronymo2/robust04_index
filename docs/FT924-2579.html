			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / International Company News: Sanyo sees 73% drop in profits and cuts payout SANYO Electric, the Japanese electronics company, has revised downwards its profits forecast for the year ended November and announced plans for a cut in dividend - its first in 22 years. Sanyo yesterday said annual pre-tax profits would fall 73.3 per cent to Y10bn (Dollars 80.64m). In July, it forecast a 35.9 per cent decline. The company also expects to post losses of Y17bn at the operating level, against an operating profit of Y11.3bn the previous year. The announcement follows sharp falls in interim earnings at other leading Japanese electronics companies, such as Matsushita Electric Industrial and Sony. The severe downturn in profits also forced Sanyo to cut its dividend to Y6.50 per share, from the previous term's Y8. Sanyo is trying to restructure its ailing operations by giving more responsibilities to each of its business sectors. Some 350 staff have been transferred from headquarters to sales and marketing departments. In an effort to quicken the pace of reforms, Mr Satoshi Iue, son of Sanyo's founder, tightened his grip over the company last month by promoting himself to chairman and chief executive officer, from the presidential post. Mr Yasuaki Takano, former vice-president, has become president and chief operating officer. For 1991-92, the company now expects a 8.4 per cent decline in sales to Y1,080bn, and after-tax profits to fall 72.1 per cent to Y5.7bn. The company incurred foreign exchange losses of 3.2bn due to the higher yen. Sales of audio and visual equipment dropped 18 per cent, due to weak European sales, while a cool summer led to a 15 per cent fall in sales of air conditioners.</p>

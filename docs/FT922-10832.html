			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: AIB moves to reassure depositors THE Cairo-based Arab International Bank, part-owned by Libya, has moved to reassure clients their deposits are secure after Dollars 60m was withdrawn since mid-April in a mini-run on the bank. Dr Mustapha Khalil, chairman of AIB and a former prime minister of Egypt, said yesterday a press campaign quoting assurances from the US government that the bank was not on the list of banned Libyan institutions was one of several steps taken to calm depositors' fears. The assurance, issued by the US Cairo embassy, stated that AIB, whose deposits amount to Dollars 2.5bn, was not 'considered to be a government of Libya-controlled entity' and 'US persons are under no restrictions from engaging in transactions with this bank'. Dr Khalil described the withdrawal of deposits as 'not very acute,' but was anxious to reassure the bank's clients their funds were 'in no danger whatsoever. We are very liquid. We do not deposit money in Libya,' he declared. Withdrawals accelerated after the UN imposed sanctions against Libya on April 15, following Tripoli's refusal to yield nationals accused of the 1988 and 1989 bombings of US and French aircraft. Libya and Egypt each hold a 28.76 per cent share of the bank which was established under a special law in 1974 as a banking 'shop window' after late President Anwar Sadat instituted his new 'open door' policy to business with the west. Bankers say Egyptians have been made extremely nervous by the collapse in recent years of Islamic investments houses which mushroomed in the 1980s.</p>

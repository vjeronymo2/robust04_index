			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOT PROPERTY: CHER'S NEW HOME: ONLY TEMPORARY  </P> <P> CHER, who has been giving concerts from Boston to San Diego during the last  couple of months, found time during her tour to buy a new $4-million house in  Malibu, which she plans to use as her main residence until a mansion that she  is having built nearby is completed.  </P> <P> The actress/singer is planning to build a house that a real estate source said  will be "a sprawling, walled fortress, like something you would see coming out  of the Arabian desert."  </P> <P> Planned on 1.72 acres that she purchased last year near Pepperdine University,  the ocean-view mansion is expected to be more than 15,000 square feet. It will  replace a 40-year-old hacienda and some corrals that are now on the site.  </P> <P> Cher sold her 10,000-square-foot-plus home, with Egyptian decor, in Benedict  Canyon about 18 months ago to actor/comedian Eddie Murphy for about $6.3  million, including some of her furnishings. She built that home 10 years ago.  </P> <P> The two-story home that she just purchased was built on slightly more than an  acre in the Point Dume area. It is a Mediterranean-style house with five  bedrooms, a step-down living room and marble fireplaces and flooring in about  5,200 square feet.  </P> <P> It also has an ocean view, tennis court, tennis pavilion and a waterfall that  feeds a spa and a terraced swimming pool.  </P> <P> When telephoned, Ron Wilson, Cher's interior designer, said: "In the house that  she just purchased, we will do another extension of what Cher enjoys calling  her 'futuristic prehistoric' style, which is a very textured, monochromatic  approach to the interiors, using a lot of stone, precast concrete and natural  materials." The exterior is white.  </P> <P> Cher had been renting in Malibu since last fall, when she moved from a rental  on Wilshire Boulevard.  </P> <P> STEPHANIE EDWARDS, the red-haired TV spokeswoman for Lucky Stores who co-hosted  the 1990 Pasadena Rose Parade with Bob Eubanks and hosted Channel 9's recently  canceled "L.A. in the Morning," and her husband, actor MURRAY MacLEOD, have  decided to remodel in Santa Monica rather than build in Bel-Air.  </P> <P> They're fixing up their longtime house near the beach and have put the Bel-Air  property that they purchased for their dream house on the market at $1,525,000  with Micheline Swift at Fred Sands Estates, Beverly Hills. The property, a bit  less than an acre with a three-bedroom fixer-upper on it, has city and ocean  views.  </P> <P> The Beverly Hills house where JOSE MENENDEZ and his wife, KITTY, were murdered  last August has been leased by a Saudi prince for two or three months at  $40,000 a month, real estate sources say.  </P> <P> The house, which some realtors are calling "Nightmare on Elm Street" because of  the killings that occurred there, was put on the market in June at $5.95  million.  </P> <P> "It was hardly listed when a doctor made an offer on it, but that deal fell  through," a source said.  </P> <P> Songwriters JOHN TRIVERS and ELIZABETH MYERS have just moved into a  $1.25-million home they had built on The Strand in Hermosa Beach. They call  their new home the "New York Loft by the California Sea."  </P> <P> The musicians, who met while playing in the pit orchestra of the Broadway  production of "Grease," lived in an industrial space in the Park Avenue South  section of New York City before moving West. The industrial space had been a  sewing-machine factory and then a dance studio before it became their home.  </P> <P> "We wanted to re-create that loft feeling," Myers said through his spokesman,  Steve Goldberg.  </P> <P> Mark Appel, the Playa del Rey architect who built the strikingly contemporary  Manhattan Beach house featured in the movie "Against All Odds," designed the  Hermosa Beach home, which Goldberg described as "high-tech." The nearly  3,000-square-foot home has four baths and three bedrooms, including a master  suite that overlooks the ocean and has a fireplace.  </P> <P> The living and dining areas are in one large room with exposed, red steel  I-beams and a two-story atrium. An upstairs music room has hardwood floors, a  vaulted ceiling, 12-foot-long skylight and mitered windows with a panoramic  ocean view. It was designed especially for Myers' grand piano.  </P> <P> Myers and Trivers created the musical theme for the "CBS Evening News,"  Goldberg said, and Myers co-wrote the hit "Shakin' " with Eddie Money and  orchestrated ballets for Agnes de Mille and the Joffrey Ballet. Trivers wrote  songs for Blue Oyster Cult and played bass on the "We Are the World" LP with  Tina Turner, Goldberg added.  </P> <P> Sculptor ERWIN BINDER, who counts Johnny Carson and Bob Hope among his dozens  of famous collectors, has put his estate in Los Feliz Hills, just below the  Griffith Park Observatory, on the market at $895,000.  </P> <P> Binder has owned the three-bedroom, three-bath villa with guest  apartment/maid's quarters, patios, loggias and gardens for about 20 years.  </P> <P> He decided to sell the nearly 3,000-square-foot home, built in 1926, because he  wants a larger residence where he can create larger sculptures, said Bruce Jay,  broker/co-founder of Bruce George Associates, who has the listing.  </P> <P> "We're looking in the San Fernando Valley, because there is more land there,"  Jay said.  </P> <P> Binder, who is listed in "Who's Who in American Art," has created a number of  major pieces, including the controversial, 12-foot war memorial "Requiem" in  Burbank.  </P></p>

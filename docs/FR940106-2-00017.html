We determine that Minasligas provided a unique code for each sieve size for each sale during the POI, in accordance with directions in Appendix V. We used Minasligas' product matching method for purposes of margin calculation; however, we rematched in a few instances where we disagreed with their selection. We based matching on home market sales with sieve size ranges which were closest to the sieve size range of the U.S. product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also determine that CBCC reported sieve sizes in accordance with Appendix V. The sieve size ranges reported by CBCC were broader than those reported by Minasligas and were broader than the ranges observed on CBCC's individual home market sales. Nevertheless, these ranges do allow us to match within the closest sieve size range, as specified in Appendix V. Moreover, these broad ranges are consistent with CBCC's selling practices. CBCC stated on the record that it fills customer orders with the broadest range of possible sieve sizes. Therefore, we accepted CBCC's revised coding system, and matched home market sales with all possible sieve sizes, including those that may extend beyond the sieve size range of the U.S. product because this corresponds to CBCC's selling practices. We excluded from FMV only those home market sales where the sieve size ranges are entirely outside the sieve size range of the U.S. sale in question. (See Concurrence Memorandum dated December 29, 1993.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, we also agree with respondents that reported silicon content ranges, within acceptable ASTM specifications, are adequate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 3: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Petitioners claim that both CBCC and Minasligas failed to report their respective interest expenses on a consolidated basis for the purposes of calculating COP in accordance with Department practice. Petitioners argue that CBCC's refusal to provide this information prevented the Department from verifying these expenses. Accordingly, petitioners state that the Department should use adverse, ``noncooperative BIA'' in calculating interest expense for CBCC. However, in the event that the Department does not use ``noncooperative BIA,'' petitioners suggest that the Department use Solvay do Brasil's audited financial statements to calculate interest expense for the purposes of calculating CBCC's COP and CV. Similarly, petitioners contend that the Department should allocate interest expense to Minasligas' COP based on Delp's (Minasligas' parent company) 1992 audited financial statements as a percentage of cost of goods sold, without allowance for a short-term interest income offset.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CBCC argues that the Department should use its non-consolidated income statement, rather than the corporate consolidated figure, to compute net interest expense. CBCC claims that the advances of funds from subsidiary to parent were the reverse of those normally seen by the Department and were not ``interest free''. CBCC further argues that without CBCC, Solvay do Brasil would have had to borrow funds in the commercial market. Thus, CBCC suggests that the Department should increase CBCC's financial receipts by an imputed interest on the interest free loans that CBCC made to its parent. With regard to petitioners' allegation that CBCC refused to provide the Department with Solvay do Brasil's financial statement, CBCC explains that the Department requested an additional copy of the translated financial statement, previously submitted to the Department on June 10, 1993, which the company was unable to provide at verification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Minasligas contends that its financial statements are not consolidated with Delp's statements. Minasligas maintains that there is no borrowing relationship between Delp and Minasligas, and further, there is no evidence of control by Delp over borrowings by Minasligas. Minasligas, therefore, believes it is inappropriate to substitute Delp's interest expenses for that of Minasligas. Minasligas asserts that it correctly reduced its submitted unconsolidated interest expenses by various forms of short-term financial income, including capital gains, exchange rate gains, discounts, and monetary correction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DOC Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree with petitioners that CBCC and Minasligas should report interest expense on a consolidated basis. The Department's position is that the cost of capital is fungible, therefore, calculating interest expense based on consolidated statements is the most appropriate methodology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in the cost verification report of CBCC, we noted that CBCC and Solvay do Brasil rely on intercompany interest-free borrowing to meet their working capital requirements. In addition, in order to extinguish its outstanding debt, CBCC issued new shares of capital stock to its parent company. After establishing at verification that CBCC and Solvay do Brasil have significant financial transactions with each other, we requested information documenting financial expense at the Solvay do Brasil level. Company officials refused to provide any data. Therefore, we have based financial expense for CBCC using BIA. As BIA, we used information from Solvay do Brasil's financial statements (exhibit B; June 10, 1993, questionnaire response). This percentage was then applied to each month's COM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of Minasligas, Delp does not consolidate its accounts with Minasligas. In addition, because there are no significant intercompany transactions between the two companies, we combined the financial expenses of the two companies, effectively creating consolidated accounts. Regarding the offset claimed by Minasligas, the Department only allows income generated from investments of working capital which the company documents as short-term in nature. Minasligas was able to substantiate only a portion of the investments to be short-term; consequently, we have allowed only the documented portion of interest income as an offset. We did not allow an offset to Minasligas' parent, Delp, for interest expense because the information required to substantiate such an adjustment is not contained in the record of this investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

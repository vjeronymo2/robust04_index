			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Air Canada chief sees break-even this year Air Canada, which yesterday placed orders for 25 Airbus 319 112-seat short-haul airliners, reduced losses in the first quarter and is on target to at least break even for 1994, said Mr Hollis Harris, chairman. The March quarter, normally the slowest, showed a loss of CDollars 32m (USDollars 23.1m), or 27 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 293m, or CDollars 3.96, a year earlier, including restructuring charges. The operating loss was CDollars 12m against a CDollars 143m loss. Mr Harris said operating results had exceeded expectation and Air Canada's turnround was continuing with the benefits of cost reduction, rising efficiency and steps to build new North American and overseas markets. Passenger traffic rose 9 per cent, helping to push revenues to CDollars 902m for the quarter, up 12.5 per cent. Yield per revenue passenger mile gained 2 per cent due to reduced fare discounting.</p>

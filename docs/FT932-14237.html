			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Letter: Real dangers of Bosnia appeasement policy Sir, Had the US refrained from pouring oil on the fire and refused to supply arms to the UK in 1940, and later to the Soviet Union, many lives could have been spared and the second world war much shortened. It could have been avoided entirely had the UK kept out of the conflict between Hitler and his neighbours. Indeed, if not deported and sent up the chimney, we could now be spared the Maastricht treaty tussle: we would be living in a Nazi Union. Of course, the brutal expulsion of millions of Bosnians from their homes and the connected atrocities touch the nerve. But so also should the genocides in progress in many other parts of the world. In Bosnia-Hercegovina, however, what is at issue is not our feelings but our future. Srebrenica is the present day Munich. It stands for the appeasement of Russia, whose imperialism is only temporarily subdued. Having survived the czars, Stalin, and Brezhnev, it is already lifting its head again by supporting Serbian conquest. And this will hardly stop before the Serbs subdue also Croatia and Slovenia on whose toil they became accustomed to live. Like Munich in 1938, so now Srebrenica. The appeasement policy of the present government will encourage further Russian expansion - by setting Romanians against the Hungarians, Slovaks against the Czechs and Ukrainians against the Poles. The time will come when the UK and the US will be no longer be able to sleep in peace and will be obliged to take much more radical and more painful decisions than lifting the arms embargo by which they are now helping the Serbs to complete the genocide safely and without effective opposition. The real danger is that the present appeasement policy will in five to 10 years lead to a third world war. A H Hermann, 14 Fawley Road, London NW6 1SH</p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HONECKER'S WIFE, 5 OTHER EAST GERMAN OFFICIALS QUIT;  </P> <P> EAST BLOC: MORE REFUGEES HEAD FOR THE WEST AS 50,000 PROTESTERS MARCH IN EAST  GERMAN CITIES.  </P> <P> Six senior East German government and political officials resigned Thursday as  the new East German leader, Egon Krenz, conferred with Polish officials in  Warsaw about the political reforms that have been undertaken there.  </P> <P> In East Berlin, the official news agency ADN reported that more than 50,000  demonstrators marched in various cities Thursday evening, calling for political  and economic reforms -- which the news agency characterized as a "social  crisis."  </P> <P> The latest to fall from the Communist firmament, according to the official news  agency, were Margot Honecker, minister of education and wife of ousted leader  Erich Honecker; labor boss Harry Tisch, two regional party leaders and the  heads of two minor political parties.  </P> <P> At the same time, thousands of additional East Germans crossed into  Czechoslovakia hoping to escape to West Germany. About 8,000 people reportedly  have taken this route in the past two days, since travel restrictions to  Czechoslovakia were removed.  </P> <P> Krenz flew to Warsaw to meet with Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, head of  Poland's new, Solidarity-led government, and with Communist President Wojciech  Jaruzelski and Communist party chief Mieczyslaw Rakowski.  </P> <P> Krenz arrived in the Polish capital after spending two days in Moscow, where he  discussed with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev the economic and social reforms  Gorbachev is pressing on his country.  </P> <P> Of his talks in Warsaw, Krenz told reporters, "I can take a lot of good from  this experience back (to East Germany)."  </P> <P> PAP, the official Polish news agency, quoted Krenz as saying: "I think that all  socialist states must learn from each other, and by learning and enriching our  experience we can all move ahead."  </P> <P> The agency said the Krenz visit indicates that the new East German regime  desires to maintain close ties with Poland, even though Warsaw has introduced  dramatic reforms of the sort that were rigidly resisted by Krenz's predecessor,  Honecker -- who resigned last month under increasing popular pressure for  change.  </P> <P> The Polish government newspaper Rzeczpospolita offered Krenz the following  advice: "Only a wide opening of activities for opposition parties, letting  young people speak out, and clear changes of the political system can calm the  situation and start a new stage in the history of this state."  </P> <P> In East Berlin, the official news agency ADN announced the resignations of  Margot Honecker, as minister for higher and technical education, and Tisch, a  member of the party Politburo, as head of the Confederation of Free German  Trade Unions. Both had been expected since mid-October, when Erich Honecker was  forced out as national leader, and Tisch's resignation was announced in advance  by the official news agency Tuesday.  </P> <P> Tisch, who was accused of ignoring workers' rights, is expected to be expelled  soon from the Politburo as well. To replace him as leader of the confederation,  the news agency said, the Central Committee of the ruling Socialist Unity  (Communist) Party, named Annelis Kimmel, head of the confederation's East  Berlin division.  </P> <P> The other four officials whose departures were announced include the heads of  two parties allied with the Communists in the National Front and party leaders  in two of the 15 East German bezirke, or counties.  </P> <P> They are Heinrich Homann of the National Democratic Party, Gerald Goetting of  the Christian Democratic Union, Herbert Ziegenhahn of Gera and Hans Albrecht of  Suhl. No official reason was given for their resignations.  </P> <P> The East German news agency produced another jolt with news that the board of  the official union of composers and musicians resigned Thursday after coming  under pressure to produce more openness in the arts.  </P> <P> In Prague, Czech sources said that as many as 8,000 East Germans have flooded  into Czechoslovakia since travel restrictions were removed Wednesday. About  1,300 of them were said to have applied at the West German Embassy for  documents that will enable them to travel to West Germany.  </P> <P> The East Germans must go first to their own embassy in Prague, where they  renounce their citizenship, and this step apparently has developed into  something of a bottleneck. According to West German officials in Prague, the  East German Embassy can process only about 100 applications a day.  </P> <P> In light of this, West German officials have asked Czechoslovak authorities to  designate sheltered places where the East Germans can wait.  </P> <P> Also in East Berlin, the news agency ADN on Thursday quoted retired spymaster  Markus Wolf as saying that the state security apparatus must be responsible to  the legislature.  </P> <P> Wolf, who retired in 1987 after directing the East German espionage service for  29 years, said in Leipzig that "it is wrong to believe that the Ministry for  State Security stands above the state and can be considered independent of  developments in society."  </P> <P> A rumor circulating in East Berlin has it that Wolf will come out of retirement  and take a top government job.  </P> <P> In Bonn, meanwhile, French President Francois Mitterrand arrived for two days  of discussions with Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The situation in East Germany was  said to be high on their agenda.  </P> <P> Bonn sources said Kohl had been persuaded to drop his insistence on visiting an  ethnic German church in Silesia during his visit to Poland next week.  </P></p>

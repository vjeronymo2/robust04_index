			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The clique of killers continues its work in our  country. Now they have turned their attention to the country's  Armed Forces. Currently, government soldiers who oppose the  clique of killers, those who are unhappy about the continuing  deaths of innocent people, are being killed while others are  being hunted. It is said that many have been killed since 16  April.    The Radio Television Libre des Milles Collines [RTLM] tried  to hide it by saying that some soldiers were planning to kill  their superiors. The clique needed a pretext for these deaths.  RTLM also said some soldiers had committed suicide. This is  their way of explaining the deaths of innocent people.    All these explanations are meant to hide the truth. Some  government soldiers are being killed because their goals do not  coincide with the clique of killers who want to kill innocent  people. The killings of innocent soldiers started when Colonel  Augustin Bizimungu was appointed chief of staff of the  government's Army. One can say that the current killings in the  government's Army was the objective when he was appointed to  that position by the clique that took power after removing those  already there. Col. Augustin Bizimungu's aims were the reason  he replaced Col. Gatsinzi, since the clique was not sure the  latter would do things in the same way as Col. Bizimungu. Col.  Bizimungu is well known for his wrongdoings. [passage omitted]    This should be a lesson even to the Interahamwe [militia]  and  the Impuzamugambi [Coalition for the Defense of the Republic  youth wing members] who agreed to follow blindly by becoming a  tool for killings. As the dictatorship (?is exposed), those who  supported it now begin to suspect it. The dictatorship then  loses trust in them and starts killing them. That is how things  go with dictatorships; the other day it was the Tutsis and  opposition members who were and still are being killed. Now it  is the government soldiers who are being killed by the clique,  even though some were fighting for it. Soon, it will be the  Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi themselves who will be  targeted by the clique. That is certain, because that is the  reality of the dictatorship. [passage omitted]</p>

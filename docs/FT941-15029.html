			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Hurd urges closer security links Co-operation on defence and security issues between Britain and Japan could be increased as part of a broader strengthening of the close bilateral relationship, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, suggested yesterday, writes Alexander Nicoll, Asia Editor. Mr Hurd, addressing a conference in London entitled 'Britain &amp; Japan: The New Era,' said London and Tokyo had already discussed security. He asked whether they could 'broaden defence staff talks, expand mutual visits between service units and generally work for more sharing of experience and know-how'. He reiterated Britain's support for Japanese permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council if it was enlarged. Both Mr Hurd and Mr Hisashi Owada, an adviser to Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's foreign minister, stressed the need for closer Japanese/European co-operation as part of a tripartite structure with the US to build the post-cold war world order. Mr Owada said strengthening the UN Security Council was 'a problem of great urgency and of utmost importance from the viewpoint of making it an organ that can perform a truly central role in the new order based on co-operation among nations'.</p>

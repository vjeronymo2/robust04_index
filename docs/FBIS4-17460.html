			<p>BFN     [Text] At the talks in Sevastopol Friday on the division of  the Black Sea Fleet, the military delegations of Russia and  Ukraine came to an agreement on the Fleet's division. In an  exclusive interview to INTERFAX Ukranian Defense Minister  Vitaliy Radetskyy said that 18.3 percent of the Fleet, or 164  warships and other vessels, are to be handed over to Ukraine.    Radetskyy said that he had reported to President Kravchuk  about the decision and the Ukrainian president backed it.  Radetskyy said that Russia was ready to pay for the Ukrainian  part of the fleet after it was divided 50-50. However, it is up  to the governments to decide how payment should be effected, he  said.    Radetskyy also said that Russia decided on which ships it  needed proceeding from the tasks faced by the Black Sea Fleet.  The remaining vessels will be written-off or sold, he said.    Earlier, spokesman for the Ukrainian Defense Ministry,  Aleksandr Kluban, told reporters that the split up would affect  833 warships on active duty and 61 reserve ships. Out of this  number 18.3 percent or 164 ships will belong to Ukraine. The  remaining 31.7 percent of ships out of Ukraine's 50 percent are  to be sold to Russia, in line with the earlier agreements.    Ukraine, said the spokesman, proposes that the matter should  be settled by the signing of an agreement. The draft agreement  is ready and will possibly be signed on 22 April.    Radetskyy said that still unresolved is the issue of bases  for the Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian naval force. He said  that both Ukraine and Russia have proposals on that score. He  believes that the delegations should not leave Sevastopol  without solving the problem.    Meanwhile, Kluban said that there are difficulties in  discussing the issue. Russia proposes to base its fleet at all  Crimean bases (Sevastopol, Balaklava, Kerch, Donuzlav and  Feodosiya). Moscow is flatly against the deployment of the  Ukrainian naval force in the Crimea, said the spokesman. This  is unacceptable for us, he said.    The spokesman also said that the Ukrainian leadership will  elevate the cash allowance for seamen of the Ukrainian fleet to  be equal to that of the Black Sea Fleet officers.    Kluban said that the problems associated with naval aviation  were not discussed.    An Interfax correspondent reports from Sevastopol that on  Friday, later in the day, the Russian and Ukrainian defense  ministers, Pavel Grachev and Vitaliy Radetskyy, are to sign an  agreement which will fix parameters for the fleet's division.  Experts who are drafting the document doubt that the  delegations in Sevastopol will manage to solve the issue  surrounding bases for the Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian  naval force.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev by Marc </F> Semo in Sofia on 19 January: "Regional Stability the Bulgarian  Way"]    [Text] The hosts, the place, and the table are exactly the  same as five years ago when, on 19 January 1989, President  Francois Mitterand -- on an official visit to communist Bulgaria  -- welcomed 12 "dissidents," unknown at the time, at the French  embassy. They included Zhelyu Zhelev, 57, a philosopher whose  works were regularly banned and who organized the Club for  Glasnost and Perestroyka, the first intellectual coterie for  opponents of the regime. Following the palace revolution that  ousted Todor Zhivkov in November 1989 and set the country on the  road to democracy, Zhelev became a unifying force and leader of  the UDF [Union of Democratic Forces], a heterogenous group of  the anticommunist opposition. The former dissident, elected  president in August 1990, met Francois Mitterand yesterday. And  LIBERATION.    [Semo] The former Communists are ahead in the opinion polls  and, what is even worse, more than one Bulgarian in two turns  his back on all political parties. After Poland, is it not now  Bulgaria's turn to fall victim to disillusionment and a certain  nostalgia for Communism?    [Zhelev] There is a real danger of this. These are the  negative effects of the move toward a market economy. People  are facing enormous difficulties in their day-to-day lives and  are having to do without many things. The increase in crime  further fuels this nostalgia. It is not surprising.  Dictatorships and authoritarian regimes manage to brutally but  successfully control lawlessness. Freedom does not mean  anything to ordinary people with no guarantee of security.    [Semo] With the war worsening in the former Yugoslavia, does  the risk of it spreading to neighboring countries like Bulgaria  still seem real?    [Zhelev] I do not believe the conflict can reach our  country,  as we are on good terms with our neighbors. But if Macedonia  was torn apart by deliberately provoked inter-ethnic tensions,  we would be directly affected, if only by the flow of refugees  into our country. A policy of active neutrality is the best  barrier against this danger of conflagration in the Balkans.  This means first of all non-interference. Second, the rigorous  respect for the embargo and sanctions imposed on the former  Yugoslavia by the international community. But I stress the  active nature of this neutrality. We cannot remain indifferent  to the human rights situation and the rights of minorities in  these neighboring countries.    [Semo] In spring 1992, Bulgaria became the first country to  recognize the Republic of Macedonia as a state if not a nation,  despite criticism from a large part of public opinion which  considers the Macedonians to be Bulgarians. On this occasion  you affirmed the need to break with the major nationalistic  myths?    [Zhelev] We have very close ties with Macedonia: We have a  common history, culture, religion, and language. But that is  the sentimental aspect of the problem. The act of recognition,  on the other hand, represented the acceptance of this state with  its full sovereignty and its borders.    [Semo] Do you believe there is now a need -- in order to  exert pressure on Belgrade -- to further tighten the embargo or  consider air strikes?    [Zhelev] This embargo, which seriously penalizes our  economy,  is already very severe. The real problem is how to ensure that  these sanctions are respected, also by neighboring countries.  Any decision to undertake air strikes or any form of military  intervention must be taken by the United Nations, NATO, or the  WEU [Western European Union]. But if the international  community were to choose to use force, it is vitally important  that neighboring countries should not be involved in these  operations. That would risk sparking off a new Balkan war.    [Semo] Bulgaria -- along with other countries in Central and  Eastern Europe -- has asked to join NATO, which it sees as a  guarantee for its security. How do you judge the offer by  President Clinton for a form of "Partnership for Peace" while  awaiting possible integration?    [Zhelev] It remains the best proposal made to date. But this  initiative perhaps remains insufficient in security terms, as  what we are being offered is not the same as that which Alliance  members are guaranteed. I nevertheless feel it is particularly  significant as it offers an equal chance to all Central and  Eastern Europe's new democracies, without categorizing or  differentiating, which is always a source of tension.    [Semo] Since you became president, you have managed to  defuse  the problem of the Turkish minority -- one-tenth of the  population -- which was the most explosive legacy of Communism.  Is there a Bulgarian model for the ethnic question?    [Zhelev] I based my action on the old tradition of tolerance  of the Bulgarian people. Even after five centuries of Ottoman  domination, relations between the Bulgarians and the Turks were  good. The tensions of recent years had been deliberately  created by the former regime which -- seeking a demagogic excuse  for its failures -- opted for an absurd policy which violated  the fundamental rights of this minority group. We felt bound to  immediately restore these rights, and, in addition, we  guaranteed active participation in governmental bodies for the  Turkish minority. One-tenth of the elected representatives are  Turks and their party plays a key role in the Parliament.</p>

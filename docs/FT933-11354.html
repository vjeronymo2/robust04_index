			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Germans place French in a double bind: Bundesbank's decision has left the ball in France's court but options appear equally unpalatable AS policy options go, waiting for the Bundesbank to put the other members of the exchange rate mechanism out of their misery looks close to the end of its shelf-life. With pressure directed at strong and weak currencies alike after yesterday's smaller than expected cut in German interest rates, it is clear that the markets are losing confidence in the ERM itself. The implicit message is that a peg to the D-Mark is simply not tenable, while the inflationary strains of German unification persist, for countries whose unemployment rates are rising as fast as those of France or Spain. The future of the ERM now lies chiefly in the hands of the French government. In effect, the Bundesbank has invited France to go back to an unpalatable combination of raising short-term interest rates (again) and supporting the franc through central bank intervention. Yet it is becoming harder by the week to argue that the strategic benefits of the franc fort policy outweigh the costs in lost output and employment. There lies the credibility problem for France and for what remains of the ERM. In the US, where the economy is growing and inflation is low, real (inflation-adjusted) short- term rates of interest are close to zero. In France the economy is shrinking, inflation is minimal, yet real short rates are close to double figures. French industry and commerce are less sensitive to short rates than the Anglo-Saxon economies. But they are not immune; and the damage to the increasingly fragile banking system is mounting. It follows that the further French rates rise, the less convincing the existing policy looks to the markets - especially with a presidential election due in less than two years. But if the French government fails to raise rates, it will find it harder to pin the blame on the Bundesbank if the franc is ultimately forced to float. It is a classic double bind; and the paradox is that France does not need a devaluation on fundamental economic grounds. French industry is more competitive than German industry. The problem relates solely to the level of interest rates. If, as seems inevitable, market pressure persists, the choice will lie between realignment within the ERM and floating the franc. The first option is manifestly less horrific, from a political point of view. But it would destroy the hard-earned credibility that the franc has won since the rigid relationship with the D-Mark was established in 1987. The result of the credibility loss would be that the markets would demand a higher risk premium in French interest rates. Indeed, according to Mr Keven Darlington of UBS Global Research, the level of interest rates might then be even higher than when speculation began. In those circumstances any hope of French interest rates falling below those of Germany for a sustained period would be destroyed. The speculators would return to the assault, causing further damage to the real economy. And the policymakers would be forced to consider the last ditch solution of floating. That, nonetheless, is something that the government of Mr Edouard Balladur would do almost anything to avoid. It is widely accepted that to float would destroy the ERM which, with European Monetary Union, remains at the core of France's European policy. It would inflict a devastating blow on the Franco-German relationship. And it could well end the tenure of Mr Balladur, who has said that he will not preside over a devaluation. This underlines the dangers inherent in other countries entrusting important areas of domestic policy to the Bundesbank, whose agenda is all too clearly defined by statute. The German central bank has no mandate to take into account economic conditions in other ERM countries. It is overshooting its targets for inflation and the money supply. And it remains justifiably concerned at the level of inflationary pressure in the German public sector. The irony in all this is that there is little or no inflationary pressure at all in Germany's private sector, where exporters are being subjected to a vicious squeeze. Equally ironic is the fact that France's anti-inflationary credentials would probably remain intact after a float, despite any initial devaluation. From the moment that the currency markets are forced to evaluate the franc on economic fundamentals once again, they will have to recognise that the French economy is in better shape than the German and that on competitiveness grounds the need is for a weaker D-Mark, not a stronger one. By putting an end to prolonged currency turmoil, a float would also help prevent the European economy succumbing to powerful deflationary forces. And it would reduce the risk of a retreat into protectionism arising from recriminations over wholly unintended competitive devaluations. But a float remains the extreme option. It will not be conceded lightly by the French. See Editorial Comment, Lex Column</p>

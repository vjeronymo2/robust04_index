			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / People: GKN finds finance director Automotive components and industrial services group GKN is at last filling the finance director's seat left vacant by Brian Walsh's departure to the TI Group in April. About to get his feet under Walsh's old desk at GKN's London headquarters is 48-year-old Merseysider David Turner, who has been finance director of food distribution and agri-business conglomerate Booker for the past nine years. Turner, a chartered accountant whose career included spells with Touche Ross and Mobil Oil before signing up with Booker as a financial controller in 1975, is expected to take up the post 'in the next month or two', according to GKN. The lack of apparent urgency might seem somewhat surprising, given the length of time since Walsh's departure. But costs are well battened down, recession is starting to abate and the rest of GKN's hierarchy has been stable for some time. Not least, hands-on chairman Sir David Lees himself had a lengthy stint as finance director before climbing the last few rungs of the corporate rigging. 'So the ship of finance has been able to sail serenely on,' according to one GKN insider.</p>

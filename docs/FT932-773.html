			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Lloyds wants to be able to disclose account details: Bank seeks right of reply to customers' criticism LLOYDS BANK is pressing to be allowed to disclose details of the accounts of its customers who complain to newspapers about how they have been treated, without first having to obtain the customers' written permission. Lloyds wants all banks to be allowed to respond to public criticism by discussing details of their customers' accounts with journalists. The call is in response to the wave of criticism of banks over the past two years. The suggestion is among a series made by Lloyds to the review committee headed by Sir George Blunden, the former deputy governor of the Bank of England, which is reviewing the voluntary code of practice governing their behaviour. Lloyds has suggested in a confidential submission to the British Bankers' Association that all banks should be able to discuss relevant details of customers' accounts. The code, introduced in March 1992 as a system of voluntary regulation, currently imposes a 'strict duty of confidentiality' on banks. Lloyds believes this prevents it from replying sensibly to many public criticisms. It has suggested the code should clarify the maximum for which customers are liable in cases of 'phantom' withdrawals from cash machines. At the moment, banks can charge Pounds 50 for each withdrawal or in total. Among suggestions made by the bank for the revision of the code, due to come into force next March, are: Banks should provide for customers on request details of how interest charges on overdrafts have been calculated, and how it has worked out the amount of interest credited to interest-bearing current accounts. Lloyds believes this would replace services offered by small companies which have developed software for customers to calculate the charges and interest applied to their accounts and check for banks' mistakes. Banks should have a united policy for the disclosure of full details about customer accounts to credit reference agencies. Lloyds also believes the code should define more closely the 'express consent' which is required from customers before banks can distribute to their insurance and product sales arms data about current accounts. The review committee is expected to report on the current working of the code of practice next month. Lloyds declined to comment on its submission. Ghosts in the machines Page 8</p>

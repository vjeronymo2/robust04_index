			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Shakhray, deputy prime minister of </F> Russia, by journalist Natalya Zhelnorova; place and date not  given: "The Contradictions Have Already Been Revealed..."]    [Text] [Zhelnorova] Sergey Mikhaylovich, why, in your  opinion, do we hate each other so much? What has happened?    [Shakhray] There is just one answer: There has been no  universal brotherhood and love. Man's soul is an entire world.  And we hate, remembering someone in a cloth cap at the market or  with an assault rifle. But in that same soul there is also love  for people of another nationality, for their culture and  history. What Russians do not have, incidentally, is a  recognition of themselves as a national great community. After  all, there are 150 million Russians. And for this reason it is  harder for us to consolidate as some national "ego." Tolerance  of the ideas of other peoples is strong in Russian man. Russians  are the sole nation not to have swallowed up all other  nationalities, even the smallest. We looked for the same  attitude, naturally. And national unity with us emerges only as  a necessity, as a blow in retaliation for a threat.    [Zhelnorova] But what is happening now? Russians in the role  of social odd-men-out outside of Russia. Russian soldiers  fighting for the sake of others' interests and dying on the  territory of the former Union republics. And the "great nation,"  which should be displaying concern for its fellow citizens, is  essentially betraying them. People do not feel that there is a  native state which is defending them. You, as a minister, more,  deputy prime minister, what are you doing to ensure that  Russians recognize that they are protected?    [Shakhray] This is what I am working for. At the diplomatic  level within Russia I have sought to ensure and will continue to  seek to ensure that Russia, as the successor of the Union, bear  responsibility for all people carrying the passport of citizen  of the USSR. Not simply in spirit--the sense of blood and  kinship--but legal responsibility. It is a question of the  conclusion of treaties and agreements on citizenship and on aid  to Russians who live in other countries. The delivery of  humanitarian freight. The settlement of interethnic conflicts,  which is saving the life of Russian people. Finally, we will  adopt a program of their reconstitution and settlement in  Russia. For this work to be effective, not only in the form of  intentions, we need to revive Russia as a powerful state.    [Zhelnorova] This will take some time. They are living  today.  And suffering today.    [Shakhray] Your question presupposes that some people are  sitting on a moneybag and not giving money to Russians.    [Zhelnorova] You represent the authorities. Both party and  state. You should, therefore, be prepared to bear responsibility  for all that happens. Many people were unaware that in switching  from one economic system to another we had to negotiate an era  of cynicism. Crime is on the rise, morality is declining, wealth  is being exported from the country. You here, behind these  strong walls, are less aware of this, perhaps; we, however, find  ourselves beneath a barrage of grievances and disappointments.  People hate both you and us for the fact that we are not,  allegedly, showing the real picture. They are asking: Who do we  believe, on whom do we pin our hopes?    [Shakhray] I personally believe that our news media are  "exposing and revealing" by force of inertia. Only those who are  shooting, blowing up, and burning are being shown on the screen.  People are already tired of this. But what is the greater  cynicism: what is happening now in open form or what was for  decades driven inward and has, as a result, exploded? Where has  the lack of faith come from? At one time we were building  communism, then, developed socialism. People of the  1920's-1940's went on believing everything.... And by the  1960's-1970's did not believe in anything. This is where the  roots of our cynicism lie. Nothing with us is sacred. Religion,  spirituality, and culture were eradicated, and nothing was given  in exchange. And now added to this are the problems of the  transitional period.... We are moving from one era to another.  And the lancing of the abscess could either be cleansing or will  lead to gangrene.    [Zhelnorova] You take offense at us showing scenes of  violence. This, of course, jars on me also, as an average  person. But the journalist cannot, after all, remain silent  about the fact that children, playing near entrance ways, die as  the result of the detonation of automobiles containing some  "stern" uncles. Children are being abducted and sold, people are  demanding money for them. Is there in Russia no force capable  tackling this insane crime?    [Shakhray] The authorities and the state still have to be  created. Society has been left to its own devices. Thank God  that the force of inertia is strong in our society, that Russian  man could not give a damn. Where are the authorities? There are  none--understand this. An agonizing process of recovery or  extinction is under way. Recovery, I hope. It was so that there  be order in this society and so that the individual and his  family be protected that society invented the state and  authority. But we have still a long way to crawl before we reach  this.    [Zhelnorova] Society to crawl or the authorities?    [Shakhray] Society. There are no authorities without  society.    [Zhelnorova] You mean that society will have a long time to  wait while there is a change in political elites?    [Shakhray] Not simply a change--a war--of elites--economic  and political. And there will be such until these groupings  share property. And they will either destroy one another in this  war or will reach an understanding. Why are people being killed  and automobiles being blown up? Because the elites are at war  with one another. Because society has no mechanisms for  resolving such conflicts in civilized ways.    [Zhelnorova] And what about on the inside--THIS is  approaching an end or not? Everyone has obtained what he wanted  or not yet?    [Shakhray] The contradictions have already been revealed, in  any event. As always, there has in Russia been a noncoincidence  in terms of phase: Society wants transformations, the  authorities are not prepared for this. Social revival and  renewal peaked in the period 1987-1989, but the authorities  missed it. This curve of social assertiveness has now turned  down, and the curve of arousal of the authorities, up. Whence  the conflict. The restoration of authority and order cannot now  rely on public forces. The utter apathy at the last elections  was evidence that authority can no longer be revived at  referenda. That's it, gone. These elites fighting one another  have now been left to their own devices. We need now to pray and  to work. While there is a parliament, a president--their  interests are known.    There are now no incidental votes, no incidental documents,  believe me. The situation is heating up, and all parties need to  sit down at the negotiating table. Because if these elites, God  forbid, switch to a war with weapon in hand, society will  suffer. And a new wave of clarification of relations will begin.  The tragedy of our society is that political and economic  groupings whose power is based on exports and the groupings  whose financial and economic power is based on industry, on  native technology, have different political signs. Conditionally  speaking, some are democrats, others, communists.    [Zhelnorova] Was it worth having this whole "perestroyka"  and  all the demonstrations and congresses to clear the way for new  power-lovers....    [Shakhray] We have to find parallel levers of influence.  This  is why parties are being formed, to assemble forces in the face  of danger. The concept of civil reconciliation was created for  this also, so that not only the senile and idiots sit at the  table. Although both those who manipulate them and those who are  standing behind them with money and with their own interests  will sit at the table, all the same.    So a shareout has taken place, not everyone is happy with  what he has received, but if the shareout continues, this will  mean simply war. We have now approached the line at which we  need to agree: 30 percent for you, 30 percent for him, and so  forth. And, with regard to this division of property and power,  to start to live peacefully. This is what the concept of civil  reconciliation amounts to.    [Zhelnorova] And what, then, in your opinion, will everyone  agree?    [Shakhray] For many of them, inasmuch as they are actual  proprietors, there is no other way. Otherwise, open  confrontation and, as a result, a chance to suffer and lose  everything.    [Zhelnorova] It has been the case that many questions of  regional and national policy have been decided without you. Is  this becoming the norm?    [Shakhray] It is not a question of me but of the general  chaos. The federal institutions of power should, particularly in  respect to the regions, operate in concerted fashion. I have  attempted to achieve this. And I have been more or less  successful. People harbor illusions: It seems to them that  another's problem is easy to resolve. But this proves not to be  the case.    [Zhelnorova] You are not afraid for your life?    [Shakhray] I am, of course. I have two small children. A  politician has to be afraid. I have no accounts in banks  overseas. Nor do I have any relatives there. I live here and  make policy here. This is how it should be.    [Zhelnorova] What do you fear most?    [Shakhray] That the self-preservation instinct and common  sense will cease to operate in society.    [Zhelnorova] What might operate in place of this?    [Shakhray] An emotional outburst of hatred. An attempt to  resolve all our problems at a stroke. The most important thing  the authorities must do is to speak with people honestly. People  are tormented not only by prices, crime, housing. The main thing  is the unknown, the unpredictability. Everyone is now expecting  of the authorities calm and peace, therefore.    [Zhelnorova] Do you consider yourself a person with power?    [Shakhray] I consider myself a person with authority. The  functions of authority are sometimes very close to the functions  of power. I believe that no one has power with us at this time.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: Political observers have followed with  intense interest President Hafiz al-Asad's visit to the Arab  Republic of Egypt and his talks with President Husni Mubarak,  especially since the talks dealt with all aspects of the peace  process and ways of attaining its objectives. It is known that  holding Syrian-Egyptian consultations on hot regional issues has  become a tradition in the life of the two countries. When these  consultations rise to the level of a direct meeting between  Presidents al-Asad and Mubarak, this emphasizes the importance  of the topics under discussion.    In fact, the region is close to making a decision on the  resumption of the peace talks in Washington. The parties  directly involved in the peace are expected to hold a joint  meeting to discuss the issue of resuming the talks and to emerge  with a unified Arab stand. Consequently, it is natural for the  two sisterly countries -- Syria and Egypt -- to hold  consultations on the highest levels to assess the peace process  and future prospects in light of regional developments and  contacts with the United States.    It is common knowledge that the Geneva summit between  Presidents al-Asad and Clinton has revived the world's hopes  about the possibility of advancing the Middle East peace  process. No progress has yet been made in this process due to  Israel's intransigence and because the Zionist lobby in the  United States has moved to disrupt any effective and influential  U.S. role. The latest round of the Washington talks ended just  as they started, without any significant results. Moreover,  Israel has reciprocated the sincere Arab intentions with the  Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. This was followed by President  Clinton's reported commitment before Zionist organizations in  the United States to keep unified Jerusalem as the capital of  Israel, in contravention of UN Security Council Resolution 242  and the policies of the previous U.S. Administrations, which  refused to acknowledge the annexation of Arab Jerusalem and  insisted on considering it part of the occupied territories.  Afterward, the U.S. secretary of state expressed readiness to  visit the region, but he said that he would not put any pressure  on Israel. This is despite the fact that Israel's  procrastination and maneuvering have made it impossible to make  any progress. After this, the Zionist lobby in the United  States pushed the U.S. Administration to adopt extortionist  stands defaming Syria and aimed at dissuading it from its  principled stands on the aspired peace in the Middle East.    All these issues and developments need meticulous Arab  assessment. Syria has offered great services for the peace  issue and frequently saved it from Israel's plotting. However,  Syria does not negotiate for the sake of negotiations, but in  quest for a genuine, just, comprehensive, and honorable peace  that is based on the implementation of UN Security Council  resolutions and leads to the return of Arab rights and  territories. Syria has joined the peace process in the hope  that the U.S. Administration will honor its pledges and play the  role of a fair and impartial full partner. However, so far,  pledges to play such a role have not been turned into tangible  action. The talks are taking place in a vicious circle and  Israel is committing massacres and crimes in front of the entire  world. Meanwhile, the U.S. Administration refrains from  condemning these massacres and crimes. Besides succumbing to  the Zionist lobby, the U.S. Administration has also placed Syria  on the list of terrorism.    Syria adheres to the bases of a just, comprehensive peace as  outlined by the Madrid conference, the UN Security Council  resolutions, and the meetings of the Arab foreign ministers.  Syria is not in the habit of giving in to extortion or  relinquishing its own or other Arab territory or any national  and pan-Arab rights. Therefore, Syria holds consultations with  its sisters, in particular Egypt. As shown by modern and  ancient history, Syria and Egypt are the backbone and main power  of the Arab nation. The Arab people everywhere pin great hopes  on coordination between Syria and Egypt and on their efforts to  revive pan-Arab solidarity and unify stands. President al-Asad  headed for Cairo proceeding from these bases and principles and  in his quest for a pan-Arab position that maintains the Arab  nation's rights and stresses its concept of a just,  comprehensive peace.</p>

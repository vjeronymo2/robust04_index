Flag-waving, slogan-chanting activists of the youth wing of  India's ruling Congress (I) party took part in the  demonstration, which police stopped on an avenue leading to the  mission, witnesses said.    The police sprayed the protesters with water cannon when  they  knocked down barricades. Some demonstrators were physically  lifted and flung back but no one was seriously injured.    The clash came after a small Youth Congress (I) delegation  left for the US Embassy with police permission to present a  letter of protest to the mission, located in the high-security  diplomatic enclave.    "Bill Clinton, down down," chanted the estimated 3,500  demonstrators who gathered on a call by Maninder Singh Bitta, a  Sikh politician and Youth Congress president. "America, come to  your senses," they shouted.    The protest was provoked by a letter written by the US  president to a group of US Congressman who sought US  intervention to stop alleged human rights abuses by police  battling a waning Sikh militancy in India's Punjab state.    Clinton said in the letter that he wanted a "peaceful  solution that protected Sikh rights" in Punjab, where "abuses  still occur."    The Youth Congress leader denounced "constant meddling" by  Washington in the internal affairs of India, noting US  utterances on alleged human rights abuses in Kashmir as well.    Bitta, who last year survived an attempted assassination by  Sikh militants, said the United States had tended to "totally  gloss over the issue of terrorism" while voicing concern for  human rights.    Clinton's concern was unwarranted because "Punjab is  witnessing peace and prosperity again after a decade of  terrorist violence" and the Indian constitution protects the  rights of all religious minorities, he said.    Sikh separatist lobbies are active in the United States,  campaigning for Congressional support for their cause and  helping fund the Punjab militants.    Separatist violence in the rich farming state has fallen  dramatically over the past year, with hundreds of militants  killed or captured.</p>

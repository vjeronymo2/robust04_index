			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: DISTANCE RUNNER: 49 ONLY A NUMBER  </P> <P> At a time when most men are slowing down, Jurgen Ankenbrand, 49, is stepping up  the pace.  </P> <P> He recently was one of 14 men and two women out of a field of 22 who completed  the torturous 146-mile Death Valley-to-Mt. Whitney run.  </P> <P> Now he wants to visit Panama for a 50-mile race alongside the canal.  </P> <P> "That's the kind of thing I'm looking for, something different," said the  Fountain Valley man who started competitive running only three years ago, about  the same time that he was divorced.  </P> <P> "I had to do something to use up my energy," said Germany-born Ankenbrand, who  claims he never participated in sports as a youngster. Or for that matter,  until he was 30 years old.  </P> <P> "I was always working and never had time for sports," he said in a thick German  accent.  </P> <P> Before his current job as food services director for El Acanto Convalescent  Home in the City of Industry, Ankenbrand worked as a chef at some of the  leading hotels in Europe.  </P> <P> "I got tired of working nights and weekends. It didn't leave much time for  other things," said the one-time food services director at Cal State Long  Beach, where co-workers urged him to try long-distance running.  </P> <P> Ankenbrand had been playing seven sets of tennis every Sunday for 20 years with  the same partner (Don Ogden of Orange), "so they thought I was in good enough  shape to run a marathon."  </P> <P> That was three years ago and without much training, Ankenbrand has run in 16  marathons in an average time of 4 hours and 10 minutes, finishing them all.  </P> <P> But he has cut his tennis playing to only five sets each Sunday, noting that  "tennis is now my second sport."  </P> <P> Unlike other marathoners, who run upwards of 100 miles a week, "I don't like  regimented workouts. Maybe I'm lazy," he said, noting that he runs only 20  miles a week, in training or not.  </P> <P> However, at this point in his life, Ankenbrand is getting bored with marathons.  </P> <P> "It's no longer a challenge," he said, pointing out that 90% of all marathon  runners finish.  </P> <P> "I need something more challenging," said Ankenbrand, who has run the Los  Angeles and Long Beach marathons and two 50-mile races this year.  </P> <P> That was the reason for the 146-mile Death Valley run last month.  </P> <P> "It was my most challenging race and there were times when I wanted to stop,"  he admits. "The heat was up to 115 degrees and I had so many blisters on my  feet."  </P> <P> Some of the other runners in the international field of competitors dropped  out. Most of the other athletes were in their 30s.  </P> <P> "I was hurting and my body was telling me to quit, but I had the determination  and will power you get from maturity," he said. "I just kept going."  </P> <P> It's that philosophy that keeps Ankenbrand running.  </P> <P> "You have to have a positive attitude," he said. "It has never occurred to me  that I would not finish a race."  </P> <P> And now, Ankenbrand said, all his races will be 50 miles or longer and he feels  his age is not a factor.  </P> <P> "I'm 49, but I think of myself as younger than that," he said. "The number 49  doesn't mean anything to me. It's just a number."  </P> <P> And just to prove it, he plans to compete in a triathlon in August, the  100-mile Angeles Crest Trail Run in September and the San Juan 50-Mile Trail  Run in November.  </P> <P> Ankenbrand has also learned that rewards are not substantial for long-distance  running.  </P> <P> He received a T-shirt for finishing the 146-mile Death Valley-Mt. Whitney Run.  </P> <P> Acknowledgments -- Suzanne Schultz, who teaches special education students at  Springbrook Elementary School in Irvine, was named Teacher of the Year by the  school and later received a letter from Barbara Bush, lauding her for the  honor. "Thank you for caring," wrote the First Lady.  </P></p>

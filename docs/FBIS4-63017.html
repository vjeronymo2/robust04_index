			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolay Dudnikov report: "Oilmen Killing Off Wells. </F> Because of Debts"]    [Text] Yamalo-Nenetsk and Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous  Okrugs -- Sabotage against oilmen. That is how V. Gorodilov,  general director of the "Noyabrskneftegaz" Joint-Stock Company,  views the situation that has developed with regard to black gold  in Russia. How else you can explain the fact that Russia is  turning down a highly valuable raw material that is the  country's main source of revenue?    All the main pipelines are full of oil, but the refineries  do  not want it. The Omsk Oil Refinery, for instance, which usually  used to take 60,000-70,000 tonnes of crude a day from the men of  Noyabrskiy, has now "frozen" the amount at 30,000 tonnes. And  it is quite possible that the emerging downward trend in Omsk's  demand will continue. As a last resort the "Purneftegaz" and  Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug fields are now pumping oil only  four hours a day.    What does this oil policy mean for Russian citizens? The  decline in refineries' receipts of crude oil will create a  shortage of fuel and lubricants and increase their prices. What  is the consumer to do -- in particular the agrarian sector,  faced with the imminent sowing campaign?    Analyzing the prevailing situation, some mass media at the  prompting of high-ranking officials are trying inter alia to  heap all the blame for the soaring prices on the oilmen. But  they are forced to say in their defense that, whereas the  increase in food prices is keeping pace with inflation at 10-12  percent, the price of production resources is up 40 percent.  And that made them raise the price of the raw materials. Why  am I using the past tense? Because the direct producers of oil  have not been dictating anything to anyone since the beginning  of the year. Inter alia in January the Noyabrskiy were getting  80,000 rubles [R] per tonne and in February just over R60,000.    Incidentally, Russian Fuel and Energy Minister Yu. Shafranik  recently asked V. Gordilov: How is the decree on cooperation  with foreign firms in repairing wells being implemented? The  answer from the well-known Russian specialist and head of a  major oil production unit was unequivocal: For Russia, this  cooperation does not pay.    When we use oil to settle up with foreign countries we  receive equipment at a price inflated, according to some  estimates, by as much as 100 percent. At the same time Russia's  oilmen are becoming technologically dependent on foreign firms.  And that is not all. In doing that we are destroying with our  own hands a national industry geared to the production of  equipment for the oil and gas industry.</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: MIM Group mines protected from Aboriginal land claims THE GOVERNMENT of Australia yesterday moved to protect MIM Group's ADollars 300m (USDollars 210m) lead and zinc mine in the Northern Territory from possible Aboriginal land claims. The move came amid fears in Australia of an avalanche of land claims after a high court decision recognising the existence of land titles before the Europeans came in 1788. The Northern Territory government has filed a bill to override native titles that might be presented against MIM's titles covering its leases for the McArthur River project. The bill, backed by Canberra, was filed after Aboriginal groups in the area threatened to lay claims on the land unless given infrastructure and compensation packages. The MIM leases reputedly hold one of the world's largest reserves of lead, zinc and silver.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Chance to turn the political tide: The battle for Germany's presidency is a test of the coalition government's electoral strength The chances are that by Monday evening the rather splendidly named Mr Roman Herzog (his name means Roman Duke in English) will have been elected the next federal president of Germany. The bluff Bavarian judge who heads Germany's constitutional court is not the most popular choice. That would have been Mr Johannes Rau, the former leader of the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), and prime minister of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia since 1978. Nor is the election all over bar the shouting. The complex arithmetic in the cumbersome electoral college known as the federal assembly still has political analysts scribbling alternative scenarios on the backs of their envelopes. But the political probabilities are that Mr Herzog will win through in the third round of voting, where he requires a simple majority, to provide Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his Christian Democratic Union with a much-needed psychological boost in a marathon election year. That is in spite of the fact that he is his own party's second choice of candidate. Mr Kohl's first runner, the east German, Mr Steffen Heitmann, was unceremoniously ditched when he proved to be altogether too gauche, inexperienced and conservative to enjoy any cross-party backing. It was inevitable that the outcome of the presidential vote would be decided on the basis of party politics, once it was clear that it would fall in the middle of no fewer than 18 other federal, state, local and European elections. In spite of the fact that the federal president's job is largely powerless and ceremonial, it is highly symbolic and very visible. Above all at such a crucial moment in the post-war history of the federal republic, when the country is struggling with the unique task and expense of reunifying the former communist east with the capitalist west, it bears a special responsibility. President Richard von Weizsacker, the incumbent, has used the post with considerable success to promote a greater sense of national unity, at a time of resentment on both sides of the national divide at the cost and pain of the process. He has also worked tirelessly to reinforce Germany's international image as a force for reconciliation and stability, and counter any fears of the revival of an overbearing German national state at the heart of Europe. When a rash of racist attacks on asylum-seekers and foreign workers in Germany threatened to dent that international image, Mr von Weizsacker was among the first to speak out in condemnation, and urge practical action to promote better race relations. In attending the funerals of the victims, and visiting the bereaved, he demonstrated a considerably clearer political instinct than most party politicians, including Chancellor Kohl himself. His personal relations with the chancellor have become increasingly frosty, both because of his publicly stated criticism of the whole party system, and because of his tendency to preach from a high moral platform. Few close observers doubt that his personal views are more national-conservative than those of the passionately pro-European German chancellor. Yet few would contest that Mr von Weizsacker's 10 years in office have enhanced both the presidency, and Germany's national image. Everyone agrees it would have been better not to have a party contest for the succession. But nobody really knows how it could have been done. In the event, the polling on Monday in the old Reichstag building in Berlin, still awaiting refurbishment as the future home of the German parliament, will be acutely political. Ironically, the outcome hinges on the voting split not between the two main parties of right and left - Mr Kohl's CDU and the opposition SPD - but on the split within the minority Free Democratic party (FDP), the junior partner in the Bonn coalition, eternal kingmaker of postwar politics, and currently suffering a disastrous slump in prestige and popularity. There are 1,324 members in the federal assembly - 662 from the Bundestag, the directly elected lower house of parliament, and the same number from the 16 state parliaments. The vote is supposed to be secret, but the delegates reflect the political composition of their respective institutions. That gives Mr Kohl's CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), 619 members in the assembly, the SPD 502, and the FDP 111. After them come the Greens, with 44, the Democratic Socialists (the former east German communists) with 33, and others, including the far-right Republicans, with 15. Apart from Messrs Herzog and Rau, there are two other candidates: Mrs Hildegard Hamm-Brucher, a grand old lady representing the true liberal wing of the FDP, who was put up by the party when it still looked as if Mr Heitmann might run; and Mr Jens Reich, the only easterner standing, a thoroughly independent-minded academic and former hero of the civic revolution which overthrew the communist dictatorship there. Neither is likely to dent the big parties' dominance, and the question is only when they will withdraw from the race. That would leave Mr Rau picking up pretty well united support from the left  -still short of an overall majority - and Mr Herzog in the same position on the right. The balance would lie in the hands of the fractious FDP. The liberals are divided between Mr Klaus Kinkel, its leader and foreign minister, who is inclined to back Mr Herzog, and thus the current coalition, and Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the former economics minister and would-be party leader, who supports Mr Rau and a future coalition with the SPD. How they split depends on how they read the political tea leaves in this election year. Mr Robert Leicht, editor-in-chief of the respected weekly newspaper Die Zeit, traditionally SPD-inclined, argues that the FDP can only be truly liberal by supporting Mr Rau. A vote for Mr Herzog, he says, would be a vote to hang on to power in the present exhausted coalition at all costs. Mr Rau has long been seen as an obvious candidate for the presidency, and as one who could enjoy broad cross-party support. After the refusal of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former FDP leader, to run for the office, it appeared there could be a broad coalition behind him. But the SPD played its cards too soon: by putting him up as the party candidate early in the race, it embarrassed Mr Kohl into looking for his own alternative. Once he had embarked on that exercise, there was no going back to a cross-party compromise. It must be said that Mr Rau is not everybody's cup of tea. He is himself rather inclined to preach, a la Weizsacker, from his moral position as a pious northern protestant. His health is also uncertain, since he had a kidney operation in 1992. And given his former position as SPD party leader, he is actually the most party political of all the candidates. Mr Herzog, on the other hand, is very much a southerner in style and temperament: in spite of his position as the ultimate arbiter of the country's constitution, he is a humorous and often self-deprecating speaker, a quality all too rare on the German political scene. It counts against him in the public perception that he was always a close ally of Mr Kohl. As a minister in the state government of Baden-Wurttemberg, where he was responsible for law and order, he enjoyed the reputation of a strict conservative. Yet since going to the constitutional court in Karlsruhe, he has been seen far more as a legal liberal, suggesting an altogether more humanitarian disposition. Two factors could yet upset the Herzog bandwagon. One is the perception that he is too conservative. The other is a possible revolt by easterners, including those in the CDU. He managed to stir up a controversy with an interview in which he apparently expressed the view that, while all second- and third-generation foreigners in Germany should be given every opportunity to take out German citizenship, those who declined should be encouraged to return home. Mr Herzog insists he was misunderstood. Most of the interview in question, in Focus magazine, was devoted to a rather careful and balanced view of German nationalism. 'I am convinced that the concept of nation, in itself, is no longer a real force,' he said. 'The idea that we are historically all of one blood is historical nonsense. Only an old Nazi could believe that.' The second factor that could make it difficult for Mr Herzog is that his relaxed southern attitude does not seem to appeal to the embattled easterners. They are bitter at the failure of the campaign for an electable eastern candidate, which Mr Kohl had promised. The CDU members in the east, who won the unification elections in 1990 with ease, now face decimation in the coming state and national elections. They may feel the need to show their independence from Mr Kohl and the western establishment. Those are the dangers, not just for Mr Herzog's candidacy, but also for the chancellor himself: for he desperately needs a good result to boost his own re-election prospects. So far, the political omens seem to be improving for Mr Kohl. His own low popularity is picking up, the economy is just starting to improve, and the mood in the country at large, including the east, is gradually moving from pessimism to optimism. The SPD, led by Mr Rudolf Scharping, is clearly ahead in the opinion polls, but it is not as far ahead as it needs to be for a clear victory in the general election in October. Everything is left to play for. If Mr Herzog can win the presidential poll decisively, it would be just the public demonstration Mr Kohl needs to turn the tide. If he were to lose, it would be politically disastrous: it would show that the FDP no longer has any faith in its present coalition partners, and that the chancellor's once-sure political touch has deserted him. It would be the clearest indication yet of the beginning of the end.</p>

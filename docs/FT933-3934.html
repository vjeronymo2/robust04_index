			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC's 'naive' aluminium import curbs attacked THE ROW over restrictions imposed by the European Commission on aluminium imports to the Community from the Commonwealth of Independent States flared up again yesterday as Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economist at RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, launched a scathing attack. He said the EC's imposition of quotas was 'naive, ineffective and an irrelevance. One might just as well have attempted to prevent the recent Mississippi floods with a child's index finger'. He pointed out: 'Supplies of any fungible commodity are indivisible.' The commission announced at the begining of August that the surge in CIS aluminium imports had 'seriously damaged' EC producers and that imports to the end of November would be limited to 60,000 tonnes. This would give some breathing space for further negotiations. At presentations associated with the publication of RTZ's half-year results, Mr Crowson also added his voice to those who had suggested that the level of metals prices in coming months mainly depended on the producers. More output cuts were needed if prices were to rise, he argued. He pointed out that CIS exports of all metals had levelled off but warned that they would persist at present high levels. The 'clamour' of some metal producers for trade restrictions was understandable but represented 'a failure to live up to changed realities'. Because of the collapse of the former Soviet Union, those realities included 'permanent and irreversible shifts in patterns of demand, relative costs and production'. Economic pressures were forcing western lead and zinc miners to cut production but smelters had so far been insulated. 'Their insulation is now disintegrating rapidly,' Mr Crowson suggested. Cuts in aluminium production had not been enough to restore the market to supply/demand balance, let alone reduce stocks. There was a very good economic case to be made for Japanese copper smelters to cut output, but it would be unwise to bank on this happening. He said most metals prices appeared to be near their cyclical low points. 'The speed of any subsequent upturn depends partly on the course of economic activity, but mainly on how suppliers themselves react in coming months.' Discussions about the Lihir Island gold project between the government of Papua New Guinea, RTZ and RTZ's potential joint venture partners were proceeding amicably, said Mr Bob Wilson, RTZ's chief executive. 'We are hopeful that a satisfactory conclusion will prove possible,' he added. RTZ's proposal to sell part of its 80 per cent stake to Venezuelan Goldfields, a Canadian company, seemed in jeopardy last month after the PNG government suggested RTZ was behaving in a high-handed manner and threatened to take a 50 per cent holding in Lihir, the biggest western gold deposit outside South Africa, instead of 30 per cent as previously expected.</p>

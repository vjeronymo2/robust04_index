The most dangerous and the  most difficult to deal with are foreign and internal debts and  the payments hold-ups between enterprises. The prime minister  believes that Poland, with the potential of its people and its  economic potential, is capable of holding a worthy place in  Europe.    Listeners asked the prime minister about his views on  privatization:    [Begin Pawlak recording] As far as the principle goes I  think  one can say one thing: we must sell less and sell it better --  and then we shall all be satisfied -- because when comparing the  effects of privatization for this year, when revenue from  privatization amounts to about $400 million, when comparing this  to some specific undertakings I don't know whether with this  kind of money one could build as much as a Kwidzyn [city in  Gdansk province]. So this illustrates the scale of this  phenomenon.    So I would like to stress again: The point is to sell less  --  for a better price. And then there will be no doubts regarding  this process.    It is important that privatization should not be a program  motivated only by ideology; it should be an undertaking which  would improve the efficiency of the economy and an undertaking  which would allow us to stabilize the economic situation. Here  we have the example of other countries which managed to  implement large privatization projects and to stabilize their  economy. If this revenue is not used as soon as it is received  then there will be both acceptance and justification for  effecting such important undertakings. This task faces us all  -- faces the government but also those who have a good grasp of  the money market: to introduce procedures which will be  effective. [end recording]</p>

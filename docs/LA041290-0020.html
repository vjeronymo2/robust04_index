			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> SCHOOL'S ANNUAL RAFFLE BANNED  </P> <P> A raffle held for the last 20 years that has raised $60,000 each year for a  Catholic high school in Oxnard will be closed down under pressure from the  district attorney's office, school officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Sister Anne Eugene Metcalf, principal of Santa Clara High School, said Deputy  Dist. Atty. Gregory W. Bose's April 4 letter declaring the school's spring  fiesta raffle to be an unlawful lottery will not be challenged by the private  school "at this point."  </P> <P> However, Metcalf said, school officials will push for a change in state law  that she said "would allow drawings and other lottery-type events for  charitable organizations."

			<p>BFN     [Text] Two agreements were signed during the first day of  the official visit of Albanian President Sali Berisha to  Bulgaria. The first was an agreement on trade and economic  cooperation and the second was an agreement on the mutual  protection of investments. The agreements were signed by Selim  Pelurtaja, Albanian minister of economy and trade, and Bulgarian  Trade Minister Valentin Karabashev.    In brief statements after the official ceremony to sign the  agreements, Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev and Albanian  President Sali Berisha expressed their satisfaction with the  development of relations between the two countries. They pointed  out that this tendency was confirmed by the two documents, which  regulate bilateral cooperation between Bulgaria and Albania.    Presidents Zhelev and Berisha had a 45-minute face-to-face  talk, but refused any statements before the joint news  conference scheduled to take place on 29 April.</p>

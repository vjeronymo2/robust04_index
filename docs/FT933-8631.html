			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Light goes out in the tunnel of hope: The quickening pace of pit closures Less than five months have passed since the UK government completed its coal review and raised the industry's hopes with promises to save a dozen pits from closure. But now British Coal is on the point of shutting down a number of the 12 pits, and others will go soon afterwards. More damaging still for the government, a further seven or so of what were previously regarded as 19 core pits also seem doomed. That will leave a rump of barely a dozen pits with a long-term future out of the 50 that British Coal had in operation this time last year. This decline in the industry's fortunes will shock and confuse backbench MPs and the general public, whose outrage at the original closure plans forced the government to undertake its review last year, and who believed that many pits had been saved as a result. Were they deceived by ministers? Or has further bad news hit the coal industry since March? Is this evidence that the government has broken its promises to give coal a better chance to compete with other forms of energy such as gas and nuclear power? The reality is that the white paper made few promises. In spite of ministers' efforts to present themselves as the saviours of some pits, the white paper never offered more than a breathing space for the industry to rationalise gradually. The six-month review rejected one by one the radical measures put forward by pressure groups to make room in the market for the fuel: for example, cutting back the state-owned nuclear industry's electricity output or slowing down the so-called 'dash for gas'. The government was thus left with measures which could only affect the margins of the electricity market where most coal goes. Some of the white paper's provisions and calculations proved to have less substance than the government suggested. A prediction by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade secretary, that production of orimulsion, a bitumen-based substance, would fall by 500,000 tonnes a year, perplexed the fuel's importers. They believe sales will remain steady. Mr Heseltine appeared to offer firmer support with his promise of up to Pounds 500m in subsidies to British Coal if it could agree sales to the electricity generators over and above contracts already confirmed. Five months later, not a penny has been claimed, either by British Coal or the private operators which are also entitled to subsidies. The money is still on offer. But National Power and PowerGen, the generators, with 34m tonnes of coal stocks, more than three times their needs, have shown scant interest in buying more. They have little incentive. First, both companies have faced a stronger than expected challenge to their market shares from nuclear power and from the gas-fired stations of rival competitors. Second, the government has made little progress in its talks with the generators on the amount of coal stocks they are required to hold by law, even though the white paper described the consultations as 'a matter of urgency'. Against this background, British Coal has almost finished a 'market-testing' exercise - government jargon for studying whether the market can sustain the 12 reprieved pits. Although the exercise will end only when the generators decide on additional purchases, probably in the autumn, there is little reason for optimism about securing extra sales. Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, expects the generators to buy fewer than 8m tonnes of additional coal this financial year and next, with most of it being bought after next March. Additional sales to industrial and household markets are likely to be limited. This leaves British Coal with some simple calculations on which to base the pit closures programme which it has yet to finalise. In the year from next March the likely market for sales of British Coal's deep-mines will amount to about 33m tonnes at most, assuming the more profitable opencast operations contribute about 12m. However, current annual production of the corporation's 30 remaining deep mines is at least 44m tonnes. That leaves an imbalance between output and sales next year of at least 11m tonnes. The problems do not end there. Annual productivity improvements of about 30 per cent mean that next year's sales will be more than met by the 19 core pits. Meanwhile, over-production could increase British Coal's stockpiles to about 20m tonnes. That represents more than four times what British Coal wants. But it also represents a threat to the government's privatisation plans. The higher the coal stocks, the less the incentive for private sector operators to mine coal in the future. Although last winter's pit closures furore delayed privatisation, it actually fortified the government's resolve to sell off the corporation. Ministers want to get rid of a direct connection with an industry which often presents them with awkward political problems. They also believe the private sector offers the industry the best chance of becoming competitive. However, the private sector is unlikely to be keen to invest in a producer which is too large for the market. It is also uncertain which purchaser will want to take on such a politically charged and problematic industry. Hanson and RTZ are the UK companies with the most relevant international experience to tackle British Coal but neither has declared an interest. Nevertheless, the government is determined to find a buyer, and that is why it is keen to get British Coal into commercial shape. Ministers must therefore be tempted to agree with the corporation that the best solution is to implement pit closures quickly, with as many as 15 before next April. The final decision on timing will rest on whether ministers believe the backbench Tory MPs who threatened to vote against them last October are still in the mood to rebel.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / World Trade News: EC, Brazil agree more talks on milk duties THE European Community and Brazil agreed yesterday to try again to resolve differences over anti-subsidy duties imposed by Brazil on imports of EC milk powder. The EC had asked for conciliation by the subsidies committee of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), which met yesterday, as a preliminary step towards calling for an independent panel investigation. The committee asked the two sides to continue consultations on a mutually acceptable solution, but if these fail the EC can ask for a panel after 30 days. The Community claims Brazil imposed the provisional 31-52 per cent countervailing duties in April without observing procedures laid down under Gatt's subsidies code and without establishing that the imports had in fact injured Brazilian producers. Brazil yesterday denied the claims, and said it would supply to Brussels evidence on subsidies by the EC, the harm done to domestic industry and the link between the two. The row is yet another example of the trade friction generated by failure to complete the Uruguay Round of Gatt talks, which includes a revised version of the subsidies code. Brussels claims Brazil, and also Argentina, are flouting existing rules because they are angered by the Uruguay Round impasse over farm trade reform.</p>

The former U.S. president, who is visiting Moscow for the  tenth time, noted that statements alleging that "America has  triumphed over Russia" are a myth. Nixon also said that America  jointly with Russia can cope with the global problems which  "impose certain obligations on the two great powers."    Richard Nixon did not rule out the possibility of some  frictions between the United States and Russia in the future but  expressed confidence that "these will be differences between  friends, not enemies." Nixon stressed the importance of open  discussions of these differences.    Nixon described as "a positive phenomenon of the new time"  the good personal relationship between Presidents Clinton and  Yeltsin.    Along with this, Nixon sought to bring home to the Russian  parliamentarians the concern felt by a part of American society  about Russia's relapse to the aggressive policy. The  ex-president said, "Russia is of course entitled to make its own  steps in foreign policy, which do not always coincide with  America's."    "We are now friends, so let us work together in order not to  poison our relations," Nixon stressed. He pointed out the  importance of strengthening cooperation between Russian and  American parliamentarians.</p>

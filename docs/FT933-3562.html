			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / International Bonds: IFC emerges from the World Bank's shadows THE International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank, is starting to emerge from the shadow of its bigger and older sibling. In the past, the IFC's presence in the international bond market has been dwarfed by the World Bank, whose borrowing programme is about 10 times bigger than the IFC's. However,rapidly growing demand from developing countries for private-sector financing could well tip the balance more in the IFC's favour in the coming years. Mr Robert Graffam, director of the IFC's treasury and financial policy department, says volume of new financing has risen 20 per cent a year over the past five years. Although the lion's share of the IFC's investment programme is financed through loans, it also makes equity and off-balance-sheet investments. For example, the new investment programme for the current fiscal year, which runs until the end of June 1994, is estimated at Dollars 2.4bn. Of the total, Mr Graffam expects that Dollars 1.6bn will be in the form of loans, which the IFC will finance by borrowing in the international bond market. This compares with a borrowing programme of about Dollars 1bn in the 1993 fiscal year, and an annual average of Dollars 800m in the preceding three years. The IFC tends to conduct most of its borrowing in fixed-rate dollars, which are then swapped into floating-rate dollars. This is because 90 per cent of its lending is denominated in the US currency. However, it taps other sectors of the international bond market if they offer attractive swap opportunities back into dollars. It has already raised about Dollars 650m this fiscal year through various issues denominated in Hong Kong dollars, lire and yen. The IFC plans to launch a dollar Eurobond issue of between Dollars 300m and Dollars 500m in the next three months. Mr Graffam is aiming for a spread of not more than five basis points over the yield on the World Bank's latest global bond offering. The World Bank's offering was priced to yield 10 basis points over underlying US Treasuries at the launch last week. The IFC's average funding target for its Eurobond issues, which usually have a maturity of five years, is 50 basis points below dollar Libor (London interbank offered rate). But the IFC, which is triple-A rated, only achieved 36 basis points below dollar Libor in fiscal 1993, mainly because of a lack of arbitrage opportunities. Currency and interest-rate swaps were hindered by volatile financial markets earlier in the year, when the European exchange rate mechanism came under pressure. The IFC is an intensive user of derivatives. This facility has been extended to its clients to enable them to manage risk more smoothly and to trade on the same terms as competitors in the developed world. Most developing countries are barred from the international derivatives markets because they are not regarded as acceptable counterparts in a swap transaction. The other obstacle is a lack of information about how to operate in these highly complex markets. Since the IFC is eligible to trade in the international derivatives markets  -the notional value of its swap book stood at Dollars 4.9bn at the end of fiscal 1993, against total borrowings of Dollars 5.5bn - it can act as an intermediary for its clients. Mr Graffam gives the example of an Egyptian steel company which would have been driven out of business but for the IFC's access to the derivatives market. The company was having increasing difficulty in servicing a large yen-denominated loan, taken out to finance the purchase of capital equipment from Japan, because the yen had started to rise sharply and its revenue was denominated in dollars. However, the IFC saved the company from bankruptcy by executing a series of currency swaps on its behalf. 'By using derivatives our clients can eradicate mismatches which should not have been there in the first place,' Mr Graffam says. The IFC is active throughout the world, but at present more than 60 per cent of its loan and equity portfolio is located in Latin America and Asia. However, Mr Graffam expects the weighting to shift to eastern Europe and the Middle East over the coming years, as those regions adopt market-oriented economic policies. The IFC recently made its first investment in Lebanon for 10 years. The IFC, whose share capital is provided by its 155 member countries, seeks profitable returns on its loans and equity investments. 'We would like to be increasingly self-sustaining,' says Mr Graffam. 'We cannot rely on getting additional financing from our shareholders.' Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating agency, has upgraded the foreign-currency debt rating of the People's Republic of China by one notch to A3 from Baa1. The rating has been assigned to China's Y30bn five-year Eurobond issue launched last week.</p>

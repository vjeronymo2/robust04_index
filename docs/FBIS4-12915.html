			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with 'Arafat adviser Ahmad al-Tibi by </F> Mikha Friedman; place not given -- live]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-Tibi] With your  permission, I would like to address the Hadera event. Innocent  people, blameless civilians riding a civilian bus were murdered  on their way from 'Afula to Tel Aviv. Murder is murder, and I  repudiate this in no uncertain terms. Even if I ignore  everything that happened before, murder is murder. Yet we  should all remember that both sides are paying with precious  blood. What started with the Hebron massacre and continued in  'Afula and in Hadera and Jericho today should motivate us all to  prevent murderers from both sides from achieving their one and  only purpose -- harming the peace process and the chance for  compromise between the two nations. [passage omitted]    I see no option other than sitting down and completing the  agreement as soon as possible, in order to reduce the level of  violence and terror to a minimum.    As for condemnation, it must come from both sides. As I have  condemned today's event, I expect to hear a condemnation of what  happened in Jericho today; of the cold-blooded killing yesterday  of a pregnant woman in al-Jib; of the appalling demolition of a  house belonging to a senior PLO official in Ramallah, which was  also intolerable, although no one was hurt. Appalling things  happen on both sides, and they merit a second look even when  they are carried out by the authorities.    [Friedman] Dr. al-Tibi, we ran a seemingly astonishing  report this morning about an ongoing dialogue in Gaza between  the moderate, peace-seeking Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement], which is usually seen as an enemy of peace. There is  talk of cooperation when autonomy is implemented there. Can you  confirm it?    [Al-Tibi] Local-level meetings have been held in Gaza  between people from all elements. The purpose of these meetings  was to avert conflicts and bloodshed among Palestinians in the  Gaza Strip. No one expects the Palestinians to start killing  each other, and therefore the statement issued today by one of  the Hamas leaders, saying they will respect and defend the  Palestinian police, is a step in the right direction. I welcome  it.    [Friedman] Except that 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam is not a party  to this dialogue.    [Al-Tibi] There are clear discrepancies between the stands  of the Palestinian leadership, namely the PLO, and Hamas, on the  political process. It is no secret that the PLO favors  continuing the political process, while Hamas is opposed to it  and is even fighting it.    [Friedman] Will the Palestinian police and the Palestinian  security services relentlessly fight the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam  peace opponents?    [Al-Tibi] Whenever I hear people call for a Palestinian  civil war, I reject it categorically.    [Friedman] A relentless struggle is a determined fight  against those who are out to kill you too, not just me.    [Al-Tibi] But the Palestinian leadership and the Palestinian  national authority will do all it can to maintain order and  security in a democratic fashion in the framework of the  Palestinian national rule in Gaza and Jericho.    [Friedman] Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, thank you very much.    [Al-Tibi] Thank you.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: UK premier urged to pursue growth EUROPEAN employers yesterday urged Mr John Major, the British prime minister, to look beyond Sunday's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty and use Britain's EC presidency to pursue policies for longer-term economic growth in Europe. Representatives of Unice, the confederation of employers' organisations, asked Mr Major to give priority to completion of the EC single market and to seek agreement in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Although the meeting was billed as an opportunity to press for action to stimulate recovery across Europe, Unice did not discuss turmoil in the currency markets or request concerted moves to cut European interest rates. Mr Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, a member of Unice, said employers agreed with the British presidency's agenda for economic and political progress There was no case for a devaluation of sterling as British companies were not uncompetitive at current exchange rates. The business leaders, headed by Mr Carlos Ferrer, the organisations's president, restated their backing for progress towards monetary union, which they said offered the best guarantee for medium-term financial stability. Action, they added, should be pursued irrespective of the Maastricht treaty's fate. Mr Major was pressed to help improve Community procedures across a range of activities affecting competitiveness. He was also asked to improve consultation between business and EC decision-makers, including the wider use of consultative 'green papers' and improved methods of assessing the impact of legislation on small and medium-sized companies. Mr Major said completion of the single market remained a priority.</p>

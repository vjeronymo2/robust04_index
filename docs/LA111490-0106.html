			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NHL;  </P> <P> OUT-OF-SHAPE KRUTOV MAY BECOME OUT OF SIGHT SOON  </P> <P> The Cold War might be over for the rest of the Soviet Union, but not for  Vladimir Krutov.  </P> <P> His battle, however, is with one small segment of the Western world -- the  National Hockey League in general and the Vancouver Canucks in particular.  </P> <P> Krutov has become a hockey player frozen out of his own sport, a Russian living  in self-imposed exile from the ice.  </P> <P> A 30-year-old left wing with a dozen seasons on the Central Red Army team  behind him, Krutov signed a contract with the Canucks last season for two years  plus an option season.  </P> <P> He arrived in the flush of euphoria over the Soviet invasion of the NHL, but  his numbers, like many of his fellow transplants, were less than spectacular in  his first NHL season. Krutov had 11 goals and 34 points in 61 games for  Vancouver.  </P> <P> He arrived in training camp this year out of shape and overweight, and Canuck  officials fumed.  </P> <P> When he didn't look much better in the exhibition season, his days in Vancouver  seemed over. The Canucks were ready to send him to the minors.  </P> <P> "Our entire management team has had enough of him," said Brian Burke, the  Canucks' director of hockey operations. "After repeated and stern warnings, he  showed up at training camp in horrendous shape, and we all decided we can't  tolerate it anymore. . . . It's nothing less than sad for everyone, the hope we  had for him, the reception our fans gave him.  </P> <P> "Everything was right there on the table for him."  </P> <P> Unfortunately for Krutov, who reported 10 pounds overweight at 205, the only  thing on the table he seemed interested in was food.  </P> <P> End of Krutov, end of story?  </P> <P> Not quite.  </P> <P> It seems that when the Soviets arrived last year, some of their contracts  included clauses forbidding trades or shipment to the minors. Such clauses are  not permitted in standard NHL contracts.  </P> <P> Several of the Soviet contracts, including the one signed by Igor Larionov,  Krutov's teammate in Vancouver, have since been reworked to exclude the  prohibitions on trades or demotions.  </P> <P> But not Krutov's.  </P> <P> Therein lies the problem. The Canucks don't want him, but they can't legally  get rid of him.  </P> <P> What to do? So far, nothing.  </P> <P> Krutov has not been in a Vancouver uniform since opening day, nor has he been  paid a penny of his $375,000 salary this season.  </P> <P> Krutov, who does not speak English, has remained in Vancouver, working out with  a local university team.  </P> <P> The Soviet Ice Hockey Federation has gotten involved in negotiations to work  out a deal.  </P> <P> There are four possibilities:  </P> <P>  -- The Soviet officials will order Krutov home because he has become an  embarrassment.  </P> <P>  -- The Soviet officials will order him to go to the minors in order to collect  his money -- the Soviet government also receives $375,000 a season from the  Canucks for Krutov's services and it may consider the money the prime  consideration.  </P> <P>  -- The issue could go to court.  </P> <P>  -- A buyout could be reached.  </P> <P> Until then, Krutov remains in limbo, the hockey player who refuses to come in  from the cold.  </P> <P> Tough Call: The Winnipeg Sun, in a headline, calls the Kings' Tomas Sandstrom  "Public Enemy No. 1." Labeling him "the most hated NHL player" because of his  tactics on the ice, the article says: "Militant Iraqi President Saddam Hussein  should be so hated."  </P> <P> Tough Call II: The Toronto Maple Leafs followed up Friday's trade of center  John McIntyre to the Kings for center Mike Krushelnyski with the shipping of  center Ed Olczyk and wing Mark Osborne to the Winnipeg Jets in exchange for  wing Paul Fenton and defenseman Dave Ellett.  </P> <P> Olczyk was at a Toronto hospital, awaiting the birth of his second child, when  the deal was completed.  </P> <P> Not wishing to have him hear the news through the media, a Maple Leaf official  called Olczyk while his wife, Diana, was still in labor.  </P> <P> "I held off telling my wife because I just wanted her to worry about the  labor," Olczyk said. "But she knew something was up. She just looked at me and  said, 'Where are we going, Winnipeg?' I said, 'Yes.'  </P> <P> "I was thrown off the roller coaster for a minute. But then I got back on track  and realized the most important thing was my family."  </P> <P> Miami Ice: Some people have expressed reservations about the NHL's $50 million  fee for expansion teams, but Godfrey Wood is not one of them.  </P> <P> Part of a group attempting to land a franchise for Miami, Wood is undaunted  despite the fact a group in Milwaukee recently pulled out of the expansion  derby, citing the financial difficulties involved.  </P> <P> "I don't happen to agree with any of (their) reported reasons," Wood told the  Boston Globe. "I don't see how you can lose money, given the league's  requirements (for arena size and season-ticket sales) and the southern Florida  market area. We've got 4 million people to draw from, and our reports show they  are just dying for hockey."  </P> <P> Dying for fans: Expansion groups are not the only ones interested in this  potentially lucrative territory.  </P> <P> The new management of the Minnesota North Stars, beset by low attendance and  morale problems, is reportedly looking at Florida as well.  </P> <P> And the Winnipeg Jets, supposedly headed for Anaheim last year, are rumored to  be on their way to Wisconsin next season, perhaps under new management, to fill  the void left by the Milwaukee group's exit from the expansion picture.  </P> <P> Why not? Existing teams in trouble at home could get all the benefits of  enthusiastic new fans and a shiny new home without the $50-million expansion  fee.  </P> <P> Of course, the league might not look too kindly upon such carpetbagging, but as  Al Davis proved, so what?  </P> <P> Add expansion: Owner Bruce McNall of the Kings doesn't think the $50-million  fee is exorbitant.  </P> <P> "Not when you figure that baseball is talking about $95 million to $100 million  for an expansion team," he said. "We've got nine groups prepared to pay that  right now.  </P> <P> "The important thing is, we want to take our time and bring in the right  people, not just grab the money."  </P> <P> Monopoly game: Although the season is only six weeks old, Pittsburgh Penguin  center John Cullen's moving to the top of the scoring list is news.  </P> <P> It's only the second time since 1982-83 that anyone except Wayne Gretzky or  Pittsburgh's Mario Lemieux has led the NHL in scoring this far into the season.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel has called upon North Korea to open its nuclear  installations immediately to inspections of the International  Atomic Energy Agency. He was very concerned about North Korea's  continuing refusal to meet its obligations under the nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty, Kinkel told the daily newspaper DIE  WELT (Tuesday [5 April] edition). Any state's violation of the  treaty was a serious danger to world peace.    As a state which had renounced the production of ABC  [atomic,  biological, chemical] weapons under international law, Germany  supported the nonproliferation of all weapons of mass  destruction. In this connection, Kinkel referred to his  suggestion of a worldwide cooperative policy of nonproliferation  of 15 December 1993. Kinkel said that he strongly supported the  unlimited extension of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty,  which was due for renewal in 1995.</p>

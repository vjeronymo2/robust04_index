			<p>BFN     [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- Science and Technology Minister  Israel Vargas announced yesterday in Rio de Janeiro that he will  travel to China with President Itamar Franco on 17 or 18 May to  make the last arrangements for a joint project by the two  countries to build a remote control satellite for monitoring the  earth's geological and weather conditions and soil, and for  mapping purposes. The satellite, that will cost $150 million,  should be finished in 1996. Brazil will finance one-third of the  project. Vargas asserted: "If this project materializes,  France will be our only competitor in this field."    Israel Vargas also said that this project is to be added to  another for the construction of the first satellite made  entirely in Brazil, which is being developed at the National  Space Research Institute (Inpe) in Sao Paulo. According to  Vargas, the Brazilian-made telecommunications satellite will  cost between $30 and $40 million, and will be finished within  the next four years.    The science minister also announced that in two months' time  the largest factory for integrated circuits in the southern  hemisphere will be dedicated in Campinas, Sao Paulo. He  explained that a pilot plant is being set up at the Informatics  Technology Center [Centro de Tecnologia de Informatica, CTI] and  will cost $18 million. Vargas said: "This is a revolutionary  project that will allow many scientists to participate in  computer, electronics, and other projects."</p>

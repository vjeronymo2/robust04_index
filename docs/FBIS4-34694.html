			<p>BFN     [Text] Surprising decisions were made today in Congress.  Despite recommendations by the respective Constitution and  Justice Committees, the plenums of the Senate and the Chamber of  Deputies respectively today dismissed charges against Senator  Ronaldo Aragao and Deputy Ezio Ferreira.    The process against Senator Aragao began four months ago,  and  evidence that he was guilty was produced every step of the way.  The Senate special committee recommended early this month that  Aragao be impeached. Yet the plenum of the Senate today reached  an altogether different decision.    Facing charges of having moved $700,000 in his banking  accounts in one year and of having obtained benefits from  construction companies, Aragao -- the only senator included on  the list of the Congressional Investigating Committee on the  budget scandal -- will not be impeached. In a secret vote, 28  senators voted for the impeachment, while 19 voted against it.  Because 41 votes were needed to impeach Aragao, the process  against him was dismissed. Upon leaving the Senate, Aragao  declined to make remarks to reporters. He only said that he was  relieved and that the Senate has done justice.    There was also surprise in the Chamber of Deputies, which  today heard the case of Deputy Ezio Ferreira, who was charged  with moving 35 billion real cruzeiros in his banking accounts  and having received checks from construction firms. Despite a  recommendation approved earlier by the Constitution and Justice  Committee that Ferreira be impeached, the plenum today dismissed  the charges against him. Ferreira's attorney rebutted the  charges, and tempers flared during the process. Yet the final  vote came 73 votes short of impeachment. The Chamber of  Deputies has thus dismissed the case against him.</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of Birmingham and the West Midlands (6): Academia spurs innovation - Industry and the universities Birmingham University has floated the idea of a Birmingham Investment Fund. It would seek to attract long-term capital so that it could support the science and technology from which will come the next generation of industrial products. Coventry University is planning an innovation centre which would enable graduates from its product-oriented courses to start up and run new companies which would capitalise on the ideas they have themselves developed. These two examples illustrate universities' increasing search for ways in which they can help to foster regional economic growth. The intellectual activities of universities can be a source of industrial innovation. The problem is how to strengthen the link between academia and industry. And, given the high importance of manufacturing in the regional economy, the way this problem is handled is critical for the West Midlands. 'If you don't innovate, you're dead,' said Mr David Storey, head of the centre for small and medium-sized enterprises at Warwick Business School. In the six months to last April, according to the West Midlands Business Survey, 13 per cent of companies introduced new products to the market, compared with 4 per cent in 1991-92. 'If we don't make value-added products, we won't reverse decline,' warned Mr Bob Bushaway, director of research support and industrial liaison at Birmingham University. There have always been ties between commerce and the institutions: in many cases, the one provided the funds for the formation of the other. But now the mutual dependence is increasingly recognised, as companies understand the store of expertise locked in the universities and the universities are required increasingly to act like businesses. For the universities, there are hard financial reasons for re-examining ties with industry. 'The Higher Education Funding Council notice that we're going to have a 14 per cent fall in funding concentrated minds,' said Mr Charles Leonard, head of commercial development at Coventry University. 'The only way to improve the situation is to deal more effectively with the funds you've got, or to generate more. All the universities in the region are looking at generating more.' On the face of it, the restructuring of industry gives the universities a commercial opening which did not exist before. 'Industry has now shed a great deal of the R&amp;D (research and development) it had in-house. So there is an opportunity for universities,' suggested Mr Bushaway. But Mr Leonard is doubtful whether much more research work will be farmed out. 'Some companies have abandoned research altogether, rather than commissioning research by others.' The universities - Aston, Birmingham, Central England, Coventry, Keele, Staffordshire, Warwick and Wolverhampton - are rivals to the extent that they vie for undergraduates and post-graduates. Many have links with companies for particular courses: Birmingham Business School and Powergen for the MBA, for example. But all do contract research, and in the industrial world they frequently have niche areas of expertise: Birmingham (advanced materials), Warwick (manufacturing systems), Staffordshire (ceramics). This reduces the chances of the universities tripping over each other in the attempt to create lucrative links with business. 'There's so much business for universities (that) we shouldn't be in competition. If we did it all, we couldn't cope,' said Ms Anne Doughty, director of Staffordshire University Enterprises. 'There's a lot of networking with other universities at working level, but not at institutional level,' noted Mr Colin Rickwood, director of Birmingham's business school. Indeed, officials from each university, responsible for liaison with industry, meet regularly at the government's regional offices to exchange notes. So universities are being drawn more deeply into the web of agencies interested in, or responsible for, economic development. For example, Birmingham's prospectus for City Pride, an invitation from the government to set out a vision of future development, recognised that 'there must be better exploitation of Birmingham's research and development capability.' It stated confidently that 'partnerships will be developed to provide the key brokerage-entrepreneurial role linking research activity to business and markets.' The suggestion of a Birmingham Investment Fund is one way of creating such a partnership; but how, in more general terms, this role might materialise is unclear. In any case, it is a role which is of most relevance to smaller companies. The larger ones will go their own way, creating their own university relationships, as Rolls-Royce and Lucas have with Birmingham, or Rover with Warwick. Universities themselves have tended to see business or science parks as a link with the wider commercial world. Such parks, attached to universities, are scattered across the region and growing in number: Wolverhampton is the latest to develop one. They could be the incubators for future high-technology companies. Looking at the Warwick park, arguably the best known in the Midlands and home to 60 companies, Mr David Storey, of the university's business school, identified three types of tenant: academics seeking a commercial spin-off from their activities; businesses which seek links with the university, in either an academic or social sense; and businesses that see the parks as a desirable location but are not seeking to exploit a formal link with the university. It is to this last category that universities will look first in their search to tighten the academic-industrial nexus. There could be obvious benefits in economic terms. Research at Warwick University, said Mr Storey, had shown that 'science-based independent businesses have faster growth rates and lower failure rates than typical small businesses.' In terms of job creation then, there is a strong regional incentive to draw the universities into the wider commercial community - which explains the government's interest in Coventry's plan to encourage suitably able graduates to waste no time in plunging into commercial waters.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Jewish settlers kill 3 in Hebron Jewish settlers seeking to sabotage the Israeli-Palestinian peace process shot dead three Palestinian civilians yesterday in Hebron, the main focus of the recent upsurge in violence in the occupied West Bank. The murders came less than 72 hours before Israel was due to begin a troop withdrawal from the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho under the terms of the outline peace accord. They are certain to exacerbate tensions between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. In a fresh sign of the continuing disarray inside the PLO, Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, who had risen to prominence as spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation at the Washington peace negotiations, resigned yesterday. Mrs Ashrawi has long been identified with a growing body of senior Palestinians deeply critical of the leadership style of Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman. She announced she was going to set up a human rights watchdog to monitor the new self-governing authority in the occupied territories. The killings in Hebron overshadowed last-minute efforts by the PLO and Israel to resolve outstanding differences on implementing the peace accord. Since the agreement was signed on September 13, 38 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have been killed. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, confirmed yesterday in Tunis that Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Mr Arafat would meet in Cairo tomorrow in a last minute effort to break the deadlock before Monday's deadline for the beginning of Israeli military withdrawal. Israel and the PLO remain deeply divided over the size of the Jericho area, control of border crossings and the future role of Israeli troops in Palestinian areas. Israel radio said a Jewish caller claimed the Hebron triple murder was in revenge for the killing on Monday of an Israeli settler by the militant Islamic Hamas movement. In Gaza yesterday, Palestinians wounded two Israelis. Israel has said it will not let Arab-Jewish violence jeopardise the peace process. Gen Ehud Barak, army chief of staff, was quoted as saying troops were on a war footing to combat both Palestinian and Israeli extremists. Many believe the longer a formal protocol between the PLO and Israel is delayed the more extremists will try to exploit the vacuum. Mrs Ashrawi, a professor of English literature, denied her resignation was a protest against Mr Arafat's leadership. 'You have a leadership which has been in exile and a people which has been under occupation ..and the prospect of merging these two and creating a democratic system is a source of fear,' she said.</p>

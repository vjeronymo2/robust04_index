			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Andrey Serov, Lev Rumyantsev, </F> and Lev Frolov]    [Text] St. Petersburg May 18 TASS -- Prince Charles,  currently visiting here, called for the creation of "easier  conditions" for foreign investors in Russia. Addressing the  forum of leaders of the business world, now under way here, the  Prince of Wales expressed satisfaction with the fact that  Russia, particularly St. Petersburg, was already carrying out  several concrete projects with the participation of British  businessmen. He said that if St. Petersburg was regarded in  Russia as a window into Europe, it was for him a window into  Russia. He believes that the cityscape of any centre of  population is important for the successful development of  entrepreneurship and St. Petersburg was lucky in this respect.  The monotype architecture of many other modern megapolises  makes them spiritless, which has a negative effect on business,  he stated.    The prince dwelt on the responsibility of entrepreneurship,  on the need to ensure proper balance between wealth and the  social sphere. In his opinion, a market economy cannot decide  by itself the task of building up a sound society, but can  combat such phenomena as hunger and poverty. It is most  important, at the same time, to safeguard the environment.    Addressing the forum, St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak  said that the West realises that Russia has lived through the  most difficult stage of the reforms. If no new mistakes are  made in the course of the ongoing reforms, the country's economy  will begin to perk up by the end of 1994. Sobchak criticised  the Western mass media which frequently speculates on such  subjects as growing crime in Russia and its alleged  neoimperialist designs. This desire to slur Russia is explained  by their realisation that the reviving Russian economy will  become an increasingly active competitor on the international  market. The mayor believes that such negative tendencies are  not be seen in relations with Great Britain and that cooperation  between that country and Russia has "brilliant prospects."    On Tuesday, the British guests called at the St. Petersburg  Mariinskiy Hospital. Its building was designed by architect  Giacomo Quarenghi early last century. It, so to speak,  illustrates the extraordinary history of Russia's first  multi-profile clinic. The hospital was intended for the poor  and was patronaged by the imperial family until the revolution  of 1917. It was backed by generous charity donations. As the  entire Russian public health service, this hospital, catering to  more than 30,000 patients a year, is today badly in need of  investments. "The positive emotions, evoked by Prince Charles'  visit, had, without doubt, a curing effect on our patients,"  chief physician of the Mariinskiy Hospital Alla Popova said.    Prince Charles talked with a group of St. Petersburg  businessmen in the library of the hospital. They discussed  possible investment projects in the humanitarian sphere. "It is  yet difficult to say anything certain about the initiatives of  our potential British patrons, but our foundation is ready to  cooperate with them in the sphere of charity," ITAR-TASS was  told by Lyudmila Nurusova, president of the Mariinskiy  Foundation.    Prince Charles' St. Petersburg agenda includes a visit to  one  more medical establishment -- the hospice clinic for incurables.  The distinguished guest plans to visit it on May 19, the last  day of his stay in Russia.</p>

Saudi authorities are now  issuing reentry visas to unskilled Thai workers who previously  found it difficult to obtain such permission after an absence  from the country, he said    Skilled workers remained much in demand as goldsmiths,  gardens and auto repairs, he said. But the pay was not as good  as in the past few years so Thai workers should not expect too  much. At the same time, the number of Saudi nationals applying  for entry visas to Thalland has increased significantly. A  total of 7,000 people, mainly those aged over 30, submitted  applications last year, he said.    When relations were more strained, Saudi employers took  workers from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines. They  were being paid at lower rates of about 2,800 baht a month he  said.</p>

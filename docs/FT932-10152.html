			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Twelve give blessing to plan for east EC foreign ministers yesterday gave a broadly warm welcome to European Commission proposals to accelerate the political and economic integration of six former communist east European countries into the European Community. France called for a study on how the Commission's bolder-than-expected plan to liberalise trade with eastern Europe will affect EC member states, and others said they needed more information before tendering their support. Britain, Denmark and Germany signalled strong backing, with the UK indicating it would like to see even more efforts to dismantle trade barriers. Denmark, which holds the EC presidency, wants to make trade liberalisation with eastern Europe a centrepiece of the EC summit in Copenhagen next month.</p>

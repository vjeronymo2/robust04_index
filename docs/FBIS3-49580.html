			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] faxed  our editorial office the following communique:    The PDSR acknowledges with satisfaction the recent position  taken by the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] regarding the need  to reach a historical reconciliation between Hungry and its  neighboring countries, including Romania.    No doubt, the communique reads, such a reconciliation, in  our  opinion, should be sanctioned through the conclusion, as soon as  possible, of a basic treaty between the two countries, a treaty  that would confirm the current borders and would include mutual  engagements in accordance with international norms regarding the  insurance of the rights of national minorities.    The PDSR believes that the national interests of Romania and  Hungary require that the relations between the two countries  should be freed from the bitter burden of the past, and the  settlement of these relations should ensure security,  territorial integrity, and the prosperity of the two neighboring  nations, namely the Romanian and Hungarian nations.    The communique also notes that not only the lessons of  history, but also the current requirements of the European  system direct us toward this goal. The normalization and  development of Romanian- Hungarian relations would speed up the  process of integration of the two countries in the Euro-Atlantic  structures and would facilitate the success of democratic  transformations, of reform, and of the transition to market  economy in our countries. The communique also mentions that, as  a matter of fact, the draft plan for stability in Europe  proposed by France and adopted by the Group of 12, sets the act  of finding bilateral solutions, through negotiations to possible  problems that still exist among them, as a condition for a  future integration with complete rights of our countries in the  European Union, the way it is also suggested by NATO's  Partnership for Peace.    Therefore, the PDSR reaffirms its confidence that realistic  forces in Romania and Hungry will succeed in bringing about the  complete normalization and development of relations between them  as soon as possible, including the conclusion of a basic treaty  that will serve the interests of the two neighboring people and  the cause of security and peace, the communique sent to us by  the PDSR reads in conclusion.</p>

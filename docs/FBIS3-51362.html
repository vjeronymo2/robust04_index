			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Imelda Alvarenga; from the "Facing the Moment" </F> newscast]    [Text] The Catholic Church has reported that at least five  persons, including two regional FMLN [Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front] leaders, were assassinated death-squad style  last week. The information was reported by Father Jesus  Delgado, who issued an appeal during yesterday's homily on  ending the violence as soon as possible.    Meanwhile, Camelia Cartagena, member of the Human Rights  Commission's directorate board, today endorsed the Catholic  Church's report, adding that various people who have been  assassinated and found without their documents were victims of  paramilitary groups.    [Begin recording] [Cartagena] As far as we are concerned,  all those who are found without their documents, with their  hands tied, and with signs of torture are victims of the death  squads. Hence, we agree with the Catholic Church's statements.    [Alvarenga] How many reports have you received so far?    [Cartagena] I cannot give you figures because I do not have  the year-end statistics on hand. The ideal thing would be to  give you that information. However, I can tell you we have a  large number of cases and the figure coincides with those given  by the Catholic Church. [end recording]    Camelia Cartagena said the Human Rights Commission this week  will issue a detailed report on human rights violations.  Moreover, the humanitarian leader urged that the agreements  concerning the Civilian Police installation and justice  management have failed to achieve enough progress.    Camelia Cartagena reported that members of the much  criticized Commission for Criminal Affairs and the Antidrug  Trafficking Unit joined the Civilian Police without a proper  evaluation.</p>

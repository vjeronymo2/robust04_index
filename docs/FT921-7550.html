			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Overtime ban looms at Vauxhall UNION LEADERS at Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors, yesterday chose an overtime ban as the best method of pursuing a dispute with the company over pay, Michael Smith writes. However, the start of any ban - already sanctioned by workers in most unions through a series of ballots - will be delayed by at least a week. Plant conveners and local union officials are asking the company to meet national union officials and to improve a two-year pay offer of 5 per cent in the first year and a rise equal to the inflation rate in the second year. They also want the EETPU electricians' union to re-ballot members in the Luton manufacturing and parts plants on the ban. The electricians at the two plants have already voted to accept the offer.</p>

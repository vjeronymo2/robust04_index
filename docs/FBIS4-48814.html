			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Sam Nujoma by Veronique Kiesel in </F> Brussels; date not given: "On Namibia and the President's Visit  to Belgium"]    [Text] [Kiesel] Four years ago, Namibia gained independence  and, after winning the elections, you became its first  president. What has changed in your country since then?    [Nujoma] The Namibians are free, masters of their fate. They  make their own decisions, through the process of parliamentary  democracy. Human rights are respected, as is press freedom and  freedom of speech, which are protected by law. Before that,  people were separated according to their color, their ethnic  origin. Today, Namibian children go to school together, all are  citizens of the same country. We have striven to establish  peace and stability, which are vital to economic development.    [Kiesel] Your government program includes an agrarian  reform,  the redistribution of land to peasants who were deprived of it.  Is this reform not likely to disrupt the good relations which  you have succeeded in maintaining with the white minority in  your country?    [Nujoma] Namibia was colonized first by the Germans, and 80  percent of arable land is in the hands of the Whites. Now that  apartheid no longer exists, and that all Namibians are equal  citizens, we need land for some people, but we believe in the  virtues of dialogue. The land problem was discussed at the 1991  National Conference, with all the interlocutors, including the  Whites. A technical committee then sent a report to the  government and to Parliament. Of course, there are some Whites  who do not want to share, who support the status quo, but the  Constitution guarantees everybody's rights, and we want to  ensure that every Namibian can own land. This is a big country,  and there is a political will to achieve justice and a decent  life for all. I therefore think we will manage to overcome this  problem.    [Kiesel] Your big South African neighbor has just changed  its  face with Nelson Mandela's victory. What wishes do you have for  the new South Africa and what are your hopes for Namibia and the  rest of the region?    [Nujoma] As citizens, we welcome the new democratic and  nonracial South Africa. We hope that there will be no more  explosions of violence as there were before the elections, but  that instead all South Africans will set to work for the common  good.    As for our relations with our big neighbor, we hope that by  joining the various regional organizations, and with its high  economic standard, it will contribute to the welfare of the  whole of southern Africa, and even the whole continent. At  present, our economy is highly dependent on South Africa's  economy, because of our historical ties. I think that this can  be used in a positive way, now that apartheid is a thing of the  past. Together we can be stronger faced with competition from  the rest of the world. Let us follow the example of the  European Union (EU), we should succeed in creating an African  economic community.    [Kiesel] Just a few years ago, you were regarded as a  Marxist  guerrilla and now you are developing a free trade economic  policy. How do you explain this change?    [Nujoma] I have been called all kinds of names: I was a  terrorist, a Communist. In fact, I was primarily a Namibian, a  member of the international community, who was fighting for his  country's independence against the occupying forces. Today, our  enemies have changed: They are called poverty, ignorance, and  disease, and we must fight them. Our country has many  resources: Uranium, copper, gold, and other metals, but we need  education to be able to really exploit this wealth. That is why  we opened a university last year, and why we are building many  schools and hospitals. This improvement in our society is vital.    [Kiesel] Since the beginning of last year, the port of  Walvis Bay, which was always occupied by South Africa, has been  returned to Namibia. What are your plans on this subject?    [Nujoma] As you know, Namibia occupies a strategic position  in this part of Africa. It provides access to the ocean for  enclaved countries like Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Botswana,  especially in view of the fact that we are working on big  highways, like the trans-Kalahari Highway. Walvis Bay is  already one of the most efficient ports in the whole of Africa,  and, by railroad, it is even linked with Kenya. The more  transport routes there are, the more we will be able to develop  trade and business, inside the continent itself.    [Kiesel] With regard to the development of the port, you are  in contact with Antwerp.    [Nujoma] Indeed, we went to visit the port of Antwerp on  Wednesday morning [18 May] and we have been very impressed by  the organization of labor. Moreover, we are very interested in  an agreement which would enable us to improve the training of  Namibians in this sphere. The Belgian Government has promised  us the necessary funds for a training program of this kind.    [Kiesel] Aside from this cooperation agreement, what are the  aims of your visit to Belgium?    [Nujoma] Namibia is a product of the international  community.  My colleagues and I have all experienced exile, especially in  Belgium, which is rather like our second home: Two SWAPO  [South- west African People's Organization] conferences were  held there in 1972 and 1986. From our early days, we were  supported here in Belgium by antiapartheid organizations and by  trade unions, then by the government. We have very good  friends, and this visit is an opportunity to revive the  excellent relations between our two countries. Just after our  independence, to express our gratitude, I invited King Baudouin  to Namibia. He accepted, but unfortunately did not have time to  come to see us. Moreover, we came here with proposals for  commercial agreements, and plans for joint-ventures between  private enterprises.    [Kiesel] What about the European aspect of your visit to  Brussels?    [Nujoma] From before we gained our independence, the  European  Community gave us its support, and it continued afterwards,  especially through aid for training. The EU therefore plays a  vital role with regard to us, and we want to continue these  relations in the most beneficial way.</p>

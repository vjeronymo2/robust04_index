			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Digital's narrower losses beat market estimates DIGITAL Equipment yesterday unveiled better-than-expected second-quarter results, with losses narrowing as the computer manufacturer cut costs and restructured its operations. Net losses for the quarter were Dollars 73.9m, compared with a net loss of Dollars 155.2m in the second quarter of fiscal 1992. Operating revenues of Dollars 3.7bn were up 6 per cent from Dollars 3.5bn on a year ago. Losses per share amounted to 57 cents, against Dollars 1.25, but Wall Street analysts had predicted losses of around 86 cents per share. Digital's share price rose Dollars 7 3/8 on news of the results to trade at Dollars 42 1/4 at the close. Net losses for the first half were Dollars 334.4m, against a loss of Dollars 629.1m last time, which included a Dollars 485.5m charge for a change in accounting for retirement health benefits. Total operating revenues for the period were Dollars 7bn, up 3 per cent from Dollars 6.8bn last year. Per share results were a Dollars 2.60 loss, against a loss of Dollars 5.05. 'We are encouraged with our progress toward the transformation of Digital,' said Mr Robert Palmer, president and chief executive. Mr Palmer recently announced plans to restructure the company into nine business units. 'Beginning in fiscal year 1994, these business units will have all of Digital's worldwide profit responsibility,' Mr Palmer said yesterday. Mr William Steul, vice-president and chief financial officer said: 'While we were encouraged by our improvement in overall operating results compared with last year, results from some countries outside the US remained soft.

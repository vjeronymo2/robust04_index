			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Portillo snubs probe into social security cuts MR MICHAEL Portillo has delivered a snub to the influential social security select committee by turning down its request to contribute to its inquiry into the government's long-term public spending review. In a letter to Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs the cross-party body, the chief secretary to the Treasury said he did not think it 'appropriate' for him to attend the committee to discuss a matter for which Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, had 'prime responsibility'. Mr Portillo said: 'As I made clear to the House, the public expenditure reviews will be the responsibility of the relevant departments.' The Treasury last night said it was 'very unusual' for ministers to appear before committees that did not directly cover their departments. Mr Lilley is due to appear before the committee next month, when he is expected to respond to questions on both the public spending review and the impact on the worst-off of extending value added tax to domestic fuel, as proposed in the Budget. The committee decided to conduct this separate inquiry earlier this month in spite of the reservations of some of its Tory members. It is understood that the body - which could be taking evidence at about the same time as the Commons is dealing with the VAT measure in the detailed discussions on the Finance Bill - has not yet decided whether to press further for the involvement of a Treasury minister in either or both inquiries. In his letter Mr Portillo also declined to make Treasury papers available to the committee. There were no published Treasury documents associated with the reviews and advice from officials 'has to remain confidential', he said. Announcing the reviews in February, the chief secretary indicated the government would look initially at health, social security, education and Home Office budgets. He said the government would be seeking to identify areas where better targeting could be achieved or from which it could 'withdraw altogether.' No spending was sacrosanct.</p>

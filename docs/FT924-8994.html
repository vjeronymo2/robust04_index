			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Travel: The warm comfort of Antarctica - Practical Traveller THERE WAS a time when only strong men ventured to Antarctica. Now, this vast and beautiful wilderness is far more accessible. Several companies, for example, are offering cruises on ships with ice-hardened hulls, the amenities of four-star hotels, cabins with en suite facilities, and zodiacs (small inflatable dinghies) for shore landings. Going to the Antarctic is still an adventure, but one that can be enjoyed in comfort. The only time it is possible to go, when the southern oceans are free from ice, is between October and March, the Antarctic summer. From Britain, passengers fly from London to Chile or Argentina with embarkation at Montevideo, Puerto Montt, Punta Arenas or Ushuaia. Landings are made, depending on length of voyage and weather, in the Falklands, South Georgia, South Orkneys, South Shetlands, Antarctic peninsula and, on the return journey, Cape Horn and Puerto Williams in the Chilean fiords. First in the field of passenger expedition ships was Clipper's World Discoverer (3,700 tons), which has taken people to the Antarctic since 1974. It is a small, comfortable, friendly ship, with the accent on giving passengers (maximum 139) a learning experience rather than a cruise - films and lectures of an evening rather than casino and cabaret. However, it has a fitness centre, sauna, small pool, beauty salon, cinema and library. Lecturers, who act as guides on shore, include polar historians, geologists, ornithologists and marine biologists; 16- to 23-day voyages cost from Pounds 4,756 to Pounds 8,466 per person depending on accommodation and length of trip. (London tel: 071-436-2931). Ocean Cruise Lines' (tel: 071-724-7555) Ocean Princess (12,200 tons) carries 460 people and provides more mass-appeal cruising. As well as a team of specialist lecturers, there is nightly dancing and cabaret, a piano bar and casino. It also has a library, gym, sauna, pool, health club and beauty salon. Prices for 20-22 days: from Pounds 2,295. Several tour operators use both these ships but provide their own natural history guides. Birdquest (tel: 0254-826317) takes small groups (maximum 12) on World Discoverer and they can act independently on board and shore excursions. Price for 25 days: Pounds 6,680 London return, or Pounds 5,840 Santiago return. Abercrombie &amp; Kent (tel: 071-730-9600) uses Ocean Princess and takes groups of about 30. A&amp;K also owns Explorer (2,398 tons), the smallest ice-strengthened passenger vessel in Antarctica, which carries the least number of people (96) to the largest ratio of specialist lecturers (12). In spite of its size, it has a sauna, library, gift shop and lecture hall-cinema. Prices for 16-23 days: from Pounds 4,128 to Pounds 6,297. To visit the far side of the Antarctic, south of New Zealand, Noble Caledonia (071-491-4752) offers cruises aboard Frontier Spirit (5,000 tons), an exploration vessel for 130 passengers. Sailings are from New Zealand via Terra Nova Bay, Ross Ice Shelf, McMurdo Sound and Ross Island. Prices, from Pounds 4,500 to Pounds 7,995 for a verandah suite, include return flight London-New Zealand, two nights in Auckland, two in Sydney and 22 on board. For the longest voyage of all (31 days), Quark Expeditions' (071-490-2211) 18,000-ton Russian ice breaker, Kapitan Khlebnikov, sails from Cape Town to Perth stopping in the Antarctic en route. The price, from Pounds 5,955 to Pounds 8,300, includes air travel London-Cape Town-Perth-London and 22 nights on board. Information about Antarctic cruises can be obtained from Paul Mundy (071-734-4404), the cruise specialist.</p>

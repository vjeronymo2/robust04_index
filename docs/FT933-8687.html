			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Spain waters down plan for wages curb SPAIN'S minority Socialist government yesterday stepped back from a potentially bruising battle with trade unions by withdrawing proposals for a total wage freeze next year. The retreat came less than a month after the idea was first launched and reflects deep cabinet disquiet about how tough an approach could be adopted in cutting wages and public spending in order to help drag the country out of recession. Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez is keen to get agreement from the unions and employers in the next few weeks on a three-year incomes policy that, initially, was to have included a total freeze on wages and dividends next year, and a rise below inflation in 1995. Unions quickly turned on the freeze and appear to have scared the government into relaxing the proposal. Mr Alfredo Pastor, deputy economics minister, said after meeting union leaders that the government would now be looking to hold private sector pay rises to 2.5 per cent next year. Union leaders welcomed the movement as 'intelligent' but would not say if they accepted that figure as a maximum. Mr Pastor was less explicit about dividends, though he indicated a similar small rise might be acceptable. He implied the government would hold to its promise to freeze civil service pay next year but left open what would happen to wages in public companies. The government appeared to be justifying its relaxed wages target by saying that a small rise would help boost domestic spending. Mr Pastor said GDP was expected to grow 0.7 per cent next year, nearly all accounted for by exports. Pay settlements in Spain are running at over 6 per cent so far this year. Mr Pastor said he expected inflation of around 3 per cent for 1994, a target the Spanish have been declaring and missing for nearly five years. July inflation figures out yesterday showed annualised price rises stable at 4.9 per cent, better than the markets had feared, but underlying inflation remained high at 5.9 per cent. Mr Gonzalez has evidently calculated that a concession on wages next year was worth paying to get a quick deal on incomes as informal inter-party negotiations on passing next year's budget begin to take shape. He needs a pay deal by the time the budget reaches parliament in autumn.</p>

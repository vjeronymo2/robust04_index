			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Strong first-half recovery at Norsk Hydro The strength of the recovery at Norsk Hydro was highlighted yesterday when the Norwegian energy, fertilisers and metals group unveiled a NKr1.93bn (Dollars 277m) net profit for the first half-year following a strong second quarter. Higher sales volumes, better prices and increased oil and gas production all contributed to the performance. In the first half of 1993, net profits amounted to NKr2.63bn but the figure was inflated by a NKr1.8bn gain from the sale of a 38.3 per cent stake in Freia Marabou, the Norwegian chocolate maker. The group's shares rose NKr8 to NKr258 before settling back to close NKr1 higher at NKr251. Hydro, which has just raised NKr4.7bn through a rights issue, said the result kept it on course for operating profits of NKr10bn in 1996. First-half operating income rose to NKr3.52bn from NKr2.39bn as revenues climbed to NKr35.2bn from NKr32.2bn. In the second quarter, operating income more than doubled to NKr1.93bn from NKr936m as revenues rose to NKr17.9bn from NKr15.8bn. All four divisions - oil and gas, light metals, agriculture and petrochemicals - went ahead in the second quarter. The biggest improvement came from the agriculture division where rising fertiliser prices, better productivity and higher volumes helped lift operating income to NKr544m from NKr99m. Poor weather at the start of the year pushed demand forward into the second quarter, the group said. Oil and gas operating income rose to NKr900m from NKr732m as output expanded to 2.9m tonnes of oil equivalent from 2.2m. Average oil prices at slightly under Dollars 16 per barrel were Dollars 2 lower than a year ago, but the impact was partially cushioned by a higher average dollar exchange rate. Firmer aluminium prices strengthened the light metals division, pushing up operating income to NKr305m from NKr85m. The petrochemicals division saw higher sales and better prices, lifting operating profits to NKr172m from NKr82m. Mr Alan Marshall, analyst at Swiss Bank Corp in London, said he expected full-year net income of NKr3.7bn, compared with NKr3bn last year. Lex, Page 18</p>

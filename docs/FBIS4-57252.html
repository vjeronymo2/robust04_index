			<p>BFN     [Text] Luciano Fouilloux, the Defense Ministry under  secretary for Carabineros affairs, has stated that there are  clear legal obstacles facing General Rodolfo Stange's return to  duty tomorrow as the Carabineros director general.    Interior Minister German Correa also referred to this  subject:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Minister, is the  government facing difficulties over the Stange case?    [Correa] No, the government is not facing difficulties.  Undoubtedly it is a complex matter but the government is very  solid, very strong. A government that enjoys the support of 58  percent of the citizenry can hardly face difficulties. The  government, moreover, has received broad support from all  sectors of the country regarding this subject -- except the  opposition, of course, which has politicized the subject.  Undoubtedly, the government has the support of all other  sectors of the country.    [Reporter] Do you believe the problem will be solved soon?    [Correa] I hope the problem will gradually be solved for the  sake of Carabineros and the country. [end recording]    Regarding debates over decrees, vacations, or other types of  leave, Fouilloux said that the government believes there are  ethical and moral aspects that make it inconvenient for Gen.  Stange to return to his activities.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Are there any  legal  obstacles to his return on Tuesday, 17 May?    [Fouilloux] There is a legal-administrative obstacle. There  is no doubt about that. His two months leave without pay --  which he requested and the government authorized -- has not  expired. Unless it is suspended or the government decides to  cancel it, there is an obstacle. I have reiterated this and  Carabinero representatives and even the experts who have been  advising Gen. Stange agree.    [Reporter] What will the government do when Stange resumes  his activities?    [Fouilloux] We do not know if he will resume his activities.    [Reporter] Is that not definite yet?    [Fouilloux] Well, as I have already stated, Gen. Stange has  issued a note expressing his desire to resume his activities on  17 May. On the other hand, there are those who do not want him  to resume his duties because they say there is an administrative  obstacle. We do not know what Gen. Stange will do on 17 May.

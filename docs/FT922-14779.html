			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Markets: Dull results cloud sunny economic forecasts - Wall Street THE FIRST quarter is over, the US economy is showing signs of life, but Wall Street is getting the jitters. Yet just two to three weeks ago, the economic picture was looking rosier. Evidence of an economic recovery could be found in improved February employment, personal income, industrial production and home sales data. This was backed by anecdotal evidence that corporate confidence was improving and business activity picking up. Although the brightening outlook failed to provide stocks with much of a lift, it at least kept investors happy as the market remained buoyant and share prices stayed close to record levels. This week, however, doubts about the strength and depth of the recovery in the economy and corporate earnings resurfaced, as did concern that an overvalued stock market may be heading for a correction. Investors also had one other potentially disruptive influence to consider this week - the declines in Japanese stock prices. Several years ago a week of dramatic losses in Tokyo might have created turmoil in New York, such was the extent of Japanese investment in dollar assets. The steady repatriation of Japanese funds in the last two years has reduced the US market's vulnerability to nasty shocks in Tokyo. That said, Japanese investors still have billions of dollars invested in US stocks and bonds, and Wall Street knows only too well that a financial crisis in Tokyo could yet trigger large withdrawals of Japanese money. Even if US investors were able to put aside their dark thoughts about Japan, there was enough at home for them to worry about this week. The first quarter reporting season approaches, and the market's complacency of the past month received a knock when several large companies warned that first quarter earnings would not be as good as hoped. Bristol-Myers Squibb led the way on Tuesday with a statement that first quarter sales were not as strong as had been forecast, although the drug group did say it still expected profits for the three months to show a modest improvement on a year ago. W R Grace followed suit the next day, the chemicals and energy combine warning that first quarter earning would be lower than the 36 cents a share it posted last year. The announcement shaved eight per cent off the stock price. Polaroid shares also took a hit when the company said its opening quarter profits would be below last year's, while Immunex stock plunged 25 per cent after the drug company stunned analysts who had forecast a profitable quarter by alerting them that a loss would be posted for the period. Discount warehouse retailer Price Co surprised the market with January-to-March earnings that came in well below analysts' estimates, prompting a wave of selling that wiped more than 20 per cent off the company's market value. Although it is too early to tell if a pattern is developing, the profit warnings and earnings disappointments suggested optimism about the first quarter may have been overdone. The message from the share price declines in Bristol-Myers, W R Grace, Polaroid et al was that any companies which produce first-quarter shocks will be treated harshly by investors. The market also had to contend with fresh revelations of trouble at giant Canadian property developer Olympia &amp; York. As the biggest owner of property in Manhattan, and a once favoured client of US banks, the news that O &amp; Y lacks the cash flow to make the repayments on its debts sent a shiver through the New York banking sector. Not surprisingly, the likes of Chemical, Bankers Trust and Citicorp were left with losses at the end of the week. Even the high-flying broking stocks had a tough time. The week opened brightly with the news that the flood of stock and bond issues during the opening three months of the year lifted fees at the big securities and broking houses to record levels in the first quarter. By Thursday, however, investors were asking how long the party could last. Amid talk that investors' appetite for new stock is waning and that corporate equity and bond issuance has peaked, shares in Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber, Morgan Stanley, Bear Stearns and other listed brokers nose dived.  -------------------------------- Monday       3235.24  +  3.80 Tuesday      3235.47  +  0.23 Wednesday    3249.33  +  13.86 Thursday     3234.12  +  15.21 Friday       3249.11  +  14.99  --------------------------------</p>

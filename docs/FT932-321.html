			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Palladium reaches 39-month high THE PRICE of palladium, a platinum group metal used mainly in consumer electrical goods and as a dental alloy, reached Dollars 132.15 a troy ounce in London yesterday - its highest level for 39 months. Traders say palladium is gaining ground because of very strong physical demand from Japan, almost certainly from the electrical sector, and from US electrical goods producers. Supply shortages have pushed the rate for leasing palladium to 11 per cent, the highest for over two years and well above the cost of money. High lease rates add to the pressure on physical supply because they encourage consumers to buy instead of lease the metal. Mr Neil Carson, marketing director, platinum, for Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group, pointed out that the Russians, who contribute about half the world's palladium, held the key to future prices. 'The Russians usually increase sales when the price rises but this time there has been no sign of them doing that,' he said. Palladium was a by-product of Russian nickel production and the country had little use for it, so it must be assumed that Russia had ample stocks. Mr Carson pointed out that electrical industry consumers, who accounted for 47 per cent of western world demand for the metal last year, 'capped' the palladium price when it reached between Dollars 150 and Dollars 200 an ounce by substituting other materials, though this was not easy and was expensive. The electrical industry bought 1.83m of the 3.9m ounces of palladium used in the western world last year, for use mainly in multi-layer ceramic capacitors found in products such as computers, video recorders and electric windows in cars, Johnson Matthey estimated in its recent market review. Demand for palladium in the western world was 70,000 ounces higher than supply last year, it suggested. Demand rose to 3.9m ounces, boosted by higher use in automotive catalysts (which now account for about 10 per cent of the palladium market) while supply fell to 3.83m ounces, mainly because of lower Russian sales.</p>

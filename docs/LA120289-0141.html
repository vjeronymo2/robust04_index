			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL AIRPORT COMMISSION PROPOSED  </P> <P> Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) has called for the formation of a multicounty  commission to study the feasibility of building a major commercial airport in  Southern California.  </P> <P> In a news conference held Thursday on an undeveloped ridge overlooking  Cristianitos Canyon in San Clemente, Packard said federal, state and county  officials must cooperate to find an acceptable site for a new airport.  </P> <P> Packard noted that officials in every county in the Southland are studying a  variety of solutions to meet growing air transportation needs. But, he added,  there has not been enough regional cooperation.  </P> <P> "We're all doing this in isolation of each other without a coordinated effort,"  Packard said. "I'm looking at the entire airport needs of Southern California.  We need to begin to coordinate the site selection process so we don't work in  counterpart, in ignorance of each other's efforts."  </P> <P> Packard's comments came during a tour of Cristianitos Canyon with San Clemente  officials, who have criticized suggestions that a medium-haul airport be built  in the unpopulated region northeast of the beach city.  </P> <P> Cristianitos Canyon, less than 3 miles from San Clemente, is one of five  airport sites being considered by an ad hoc group commissioned by the Orange  County Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> The county commissioned the Airport Site Coalition to study possible sites for  an airport to serve Orange County as part of a settlement over a controversial  plan to enlarge John Wayne Airport.  </P> <P> The other option proposed by the coalition is in Potrero Los Pinos, a hilly  part of the Cleveland National Forest.  </P> <P> In September, Packard held a similar press conference, condemning the  coalition's inclusion of the Potrero Los Pinos area as a possible airport site.  </P> <P> Packard opposed that plan for environmental reasons. He said an airport in the  national forest would ruin the pristine countryside, one of the last  undeveloped areas in Orange County. "As far as I can tell, this is as bad a  place as Los Pinos," Packard said. "I don't see any difference."  </P> <P> An airport in Cristianitos Canyon would also bring commercial aircraft  dangerously close to the San Onofre Nuclear Power Station, the TRW "Star Wars"  test facility and Camp Pendleton, Packard said.  </P> <P> The tour came less than two weeks after the Airport Site Coalition held its  final public meeting at UC Irvine. The coalition also is considering putting an  airport in South Camp Pendleton, March Air Force Base and Norton Air Force  Base. JAMES GOMEZ  </P></p>

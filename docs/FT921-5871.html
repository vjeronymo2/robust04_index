			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Observer: Imprudent It is the first time that anyone can remember that someone has tried to wind up the Pru, Britain's biggest investor. But there it is for all too see in the pages of The London Gazette, no less. The petition was presented on February 7th by Topbrand Electronic, which claims to be a creditor. It is understood that the matter has now been settled but the legal machinery has been set in motion so the man from the Pru will have to appear in court in Manchester on March 13th, or as soon as the petition can be heard. While the petition is clearly ridiculous, it is embarrassing for the Pru. It means that any one else owed money can pop up in court and support the winding up petition. It could be a legal field day for the crackpots. Which member of the Pru's legal department let this lulu slip through?</p>

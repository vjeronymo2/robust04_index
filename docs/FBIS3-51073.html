The managerial decision, which is known as "general leave,"  was ordered by the Navy command for the period from 24 December  to 2 January. Essential Navy services were not discontinued.    A government source said that the Navy was facing "serious"  economic problems, noting that "it has debts" and "had asked the  government for an advance, which was not granted."</p>

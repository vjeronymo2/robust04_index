			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Rules for priming pumps prove costly: Deborah Hargreaves on the reasons for big rises in petrol prices SHELL surprised the oil industry when it raised petrol prices this week, adding about 9p a gallon to the pump price of four star. It was followed yesterday by Texaco which increased prices for petrol - but not diesel - by the same amount, claiming that prices were moving back to a more realistic level after large cuts last month. Esso, the market leader, and British Petroleum were taken aback by the price rises. Both said they were monitoring the market but had no immediate plans to raise prices. A month ago Shell decided to slash pump prices by 18p a gallon - the biggest cut so far in petrol prices - after BP sparked a round of reductions with a 13p a gallon cut. Other leading oil companies followed the move. Those cuts were made on the back of a drop of Dollars 3 a barrel in world oil prices since October. Given that prices have since fallen by a further Dollars 1 a barrel, it would be surprising if companies were seeking to justify this week's price increases with the usual arguments about higher world prices. Nor do they blame changes in the dollar-sterling exchange rate (international oil trade is priced in dollars). Rather, Shell is unhappy that ruthless competition in the market has pared margins to the bone, making it difficult to pay for increasingly tough environmental measures. Mr David Pirret, general manager of Shell's retail division, said: 'In a tough marketplace where prices have to give Shell and its retailers adequate profitability to fund the increasing investment required to meet safety and environmental standards, prices now have to move back up.' Shell estimates that it costs Pounds 92,000 more to build a service station than it did 10 years ago because of tougher environmental standards. But intense competition among petrol retailers has kept returns to the industry low. 'Neither retailers nor oil companies are making enough money in this business to fund the environmental improvements needed,' said Mr Bruce Petter, director of the Petroleum Retailers Association. A Shell official said yesterday: 'There's no question about our regretting that December cut in prices. It was good for us.' This means that Shell increased its market share in an intensely competitive business. While oil companies are competing fiercely for market share between themselves, they are also facing an assault on their business from supermarkets and hypermarkets. Such businesses have doubled their share of the petrol market in the past two years, from about 6.8 per cent at the beginning of 1991 to about 15 per cent now. The ability of supermarkets to undercut oil companies has arisen partly from overcapacity in the oil refining sector. Some oil companies are running too much oil through their refineries, leaving them with a glut of petrol to sell cheaply to hypermarkets. It is a vicious circle that is bound to end up in a contraction of the service station market over the next 10 years. Some market watchers believe the UK will lose about 5,000 of its 20,000 sites in the next decade. This will partly be a result of the inability of some stations to invest in the type of environmental and safety standards required by government and European Community legislation. Shell estimates it costs Pounds 12,000, for example, to equip a new service station with twin-walled petrol tanks - an EC requirement being phased in over the next two years. In addition, companies have to spend about Pounds 14,000 to recycle the water used in the car wash, Pounds 4,000 on measures to stop tanks over-filling and Pounds 6,000 to remove old storage tanks, according to Shell. 'We want people to know that when the price goes up, it is also driven by the need for companies to remain profitable,' a Shell official said. The company plans to spend Pounds 250m over the next five years on revamping its petrol station network and franchising its stations. Mr Geoff Pyne, oil analyst at stockbrokers UBS Phillips and Drew, said: 'Margins in petrol retailing may be low now but to say that they are lower than the return made by other industries is rather a dangerous generalisation.' Tax accounts for almost 70 per cent of the cost of petrol to the consumer. Petrol prices are in fact slightly lower now than in 1960. According to figures from UBS Phillips and Drew, petrol prices were 47.4p per litre in 1960 and averaged 45.9p per litre last year. 'There is nothing to suggest excessive profitability by the oil companies,' said Mr Gilbert Jenkins, an independent energy consultant.</p>

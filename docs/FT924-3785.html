			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Abbey National raises Pounds 103m in free shares sale ABBEY NATIONAL yesterday raised Pounds 103m by selling off 28.97m shares, unclaimed or mis-allocated, from its 1989 flotation. SG Warburg and Kleinwort Benson bought the shares for 356p each and then placed them in the market at 360p. Kleinwort said the shares were sold very quickly to a number of institutions. The stock market took the weight of the shares well and Abbey National's price fell only 7p to 366p. The shares were owned by about 300,000 customers who had failed to claim their free allocation when the building society converted to a bank in July 1989. At that time, 5.6m members were allocated 100 free shares each with an offer price of 130p. Abbey National said it would donate Pounds 5m, representing 4.9 per cent raised under the placement, to its Charitable Trust for donation to selected charities. The remaining Pounds 98m would go down as profit or reserves but the financial accounting procedure has not been announced. Mr James Tyrrell, group finance director, said he had yet to decide whether to enter the money as an exceptional or extraordinary item. The bank was legally entitled to sell the shares after October 21 1992. The unclaimed shares were allowed to be sold after three years of flotation as long as three months notice had been given to those entitled to the shares. Abbey National last advertised to attract members to claim their shares on July 20 this year. That resulted in 165,000 people applying for the shares. More than 95,000 share allocations were confirmed. Despite the sell-off, customers who were entitled to the shares can still claim them - so long as they do so before December 1998. They will be entitled to the net sale proceeds of 360p per share obtained today and to receive net dividends after tax. Abbey National termed the unclaimed shares as 'one of the most interesting financial mysteries of our time.' About 30,000 of the shares sold yesterday had been mis-allocations - mainly as a result of members being issued duplicate shares. In one incident, a large number of shares sent out to members at the time of flotation were dumped into a skip which was then set alight. The shares had to be reissued which resulted in some people receiving two sets of shares.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Treasury report indicates stronger demand CONSUMER DEMAND is strengthening slowly but the outlook for jobs remains gloomy, according to the Treasury's latest monthly report of the economy. In a generally cautious assessment of recent economic developments, the Treasury points to higher car registrations, growth in the narrow measure of the money supply and anecdotal evidence of a boost to sales over Christmas as evidence that consumer activity is growing. The trend in unemployment, however, has deteriorated since the early summer, it says, with a particularly marked fall in service-sector employment towards the end of last year. The Treasury says that may reflect the sharp fall in confidence over the summer and in September, rather than movements in output. The report, the second of the Treasury's monthly assessments, prompted a strong reaction from City economists who had been hoping for a more analytical document. 'If this is the Treasury's idea of being more open, it's a complete shambles,' said Mr John Shepperd, economist at SG Warburg. Mr Gwynn Haache, an economist at James Capel said: 'Ninety-nine per cent of it is what we know already. It fails to say where the Treasury thinks the economy is.' The 45-page report is a round-up of recent economic statistics but offers little insight into Treasury thinking. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, introduced the report in the aftermath of Britain's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism last year. It was one of several measures designed to improve openness at the Treasury. The report gave no indication on interest rate moves.</p>

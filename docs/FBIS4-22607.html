			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Brown Persuades His Countrymen on </F> the Urals and Siberia. American Business Continues To Explore  the Russian Market"]    [Text] "We want to begin a new era of cooperation between  the United States and Russia based on growing possibilities for  trade and investment," as U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown  defined the goal of his visit to Moscow. And although it is  still early to speak about the approach of a new era, Brown's  mission can mobilize business connections of the two countries  which are lagging much behind the level of their political  dialog.    The American delegation included representatives from such  world-renowned companies and corporations as Motorola,  Occidental Petroleum, Litton Industries, Oil Capital Limited,  Macdermott International and Allen And Associations  International. In the opinion of the Clinton administration,  the flow of investments into the fuel-energy complex, space  science, the creation of telecommunications systems and the  production of medicines will allow the Russian to see more  graphically the fruits of reform and to accelerate their  implementation.    One of the tasks of Brown's trip, which is being called the  economic continuation of Bill Clinton's and Boris Yeltsin's  Moscow meeting, is to urge American investors to enter Russia  more boldly. The level of American investments in Russia today  comprises one billion dollars [$] out of a total volume of  American investments of $490 billion. By comparison, Americans  invested $239 billion in Europe, $68 billion in Canada, $26  billion in Japan and $13 billion in Mexico.    Testing the soil for possible investments in Russia, Brown's  team visited the Urals, the region where 80 percent of the  largest defense industries are concentrated. Of these already  250 have undergone conversion. The great possibilities of the  Ural region and its well know independent economic policy  attracted the Americans. It is no accident that in recent years  more and more foreign investments are pouring into the region  and that Western businesses are more often looking at it, justly  evaluating it as a prospective trade partner.    During the course of Brown's visit a number of agreements  were signed, one of which provides for opening American business  centers in a number of Russian cities, mainly in the Urals and  Siberia. These centers will not only help American firms  arrange business matters in a specific region, but will also aid  in the development of Russian firms which wish to cooperate with  American colleagues.    In addition, along with Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin, the  head of the U.S. Department of Commerce signed a statement which  views the main task as opening up access to the markets of both  countries.    While ongoing plans for Russian-American economic  cooperation  were being further worked out in Moscow, the end of COCOM was  officially registered in The Hague. However, as U.S. State  Department representative Michael [McCarey] stated, until a new  system of export control is created Washington will continue to  maintain a strict licensing plicy regarding trade in goods based  on high technology. Therefore it is no accident that in the  bilateral trade relations between Russia and America the  emphasis is on consumer goods. However, the list of prospective  products delivered to Russian from the U.S., which was drawn up  by the American side, includes machinery and equipment for the  oil and gas industry, fertilizers, equipment for the food  industry, medicines and medical preparations, medical equipment,  computers and many other items.    At the same time, the Russian market will not see American  high-tech products except for telecommunications. Therefore  Brown's mission has special significance. It would like to  prove that this is the first swallow [bird] of large-scale  Russian-American economic cooperation and not a smoke screen  intended to hide existing problems and contradictions in  bilateral cooperation.    The 52-year old Ronald Brown is a lawyer by education  and has the reputation of being "a strong and independent  advocate of American business interests. He arrived in Moscow  with his "team" of 29 large industrialists representing four  sectors: oil and gas, aeronautics, telecommunications and  pharmaceuticals.</p>

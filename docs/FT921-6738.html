			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / M6 to be widened after plan for private toll rival scrapped THE GOVERNMENT has abandoned plans for a privately financed toll motorway between Manchester and Birmingham. Instead it proposes to widen the existing M6 motorway from three lanes to four in each direction. The Transport Department said last night that the decision was taken 'for a variety of reasons, ranging from environmental to operational'. The turnaround was criticised by Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, who said the government's ideological commitment to privately financed roadbuilding had caused delays to essential road schemes. Mr Prescott said companies which had been asked to submit preliminary bids for the motorway 'must now be sceptical about other private road-building plans'. The British Road Federation said the revised proposals would not solve the need for extra motorway capacity between Manchester and Birmingham. If a private road was not to be built, a public-sector motorway should be provided in its place. The federation said that, at the very least, the M6 should be widened to five lanes in each direction. The Transport Department estimated that the extra lanes for the M6 between junctions 11 and 20 would cost Pounds 450m. The department hoped that the work will start in 1996 and last two to four years. The road would be widened by building another two lanes on one side of the existing motorway. The private road plan attracted four bids last year. Members of the groups included Balfour Beatty, Tarmac and Trafalgar House from the UK; Italstat, the Italian toll road operator; Cofiroute, the French toll road operator; and French contractors GTM International and SOGEA. The Transport Department yesterday announced that it would seek bids to build a privately financed motorway to the west of Birmingham. The road would link with the northern relief road, which is also to be privately financed, and create an orbital, mostly tolled, road around the city.</p>

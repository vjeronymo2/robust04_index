Reform is currently in a  stage of overcoming the strategic barrier. We must pay special  attention to social stability. We must stabilize commodity  prices, successfully combat corruption, promote clean  government, and control investment in fixed assets to create a  favorable external environment for reform. Local authorities  must carry out meticulous organization and study, promptly  resolve new problems appearing in the course of reform, reduce  risks, and work with one heart and one mind to ensure the smooth  progress of reform." This statement was repeatedly and  emphatically made by Li Lanqing, member of the Political Bureau  of the CPC Central Committee and vice premier of the State  Council, during his recent inspection tour of Zhejiang.    From 4 to 7 January, Li Lanqing, accompanied by Secretary Li  Zemin of the Zhejiang provincial party committee and Governor  Wan Xueyuan, inspected Zhejiang to find out about its grain and  edible oil prices, market supply, education reform, and fight  against smuggling.    During his stay in Zhejiang, Li Lanqing made a special point  of hearing the work report of Zhejiang's provincial party  committee and government. He pointed out: Zhejiang's general  situation is very good. The province has made notable progress  in its work in all areas. Achievements in its economic  relations and trade with foreign countries are particularly  impressive, with a growth rate among the highest in the nation.  It is very hopeful that the goal of achieving a level of  comfortable living may be attained ahead of schedule.    After an in-depth investigation, study, and tour of  Hangzhou,  Shaoxing, and Ningbo cities, Li Lanqing said: With the  promulgation of new measures for comprehensive reform, we must  pay particular attention to inflation. The key here is to  control price changes within a range tolerable to the broad  masses. There has been quite a large fluctuation in the price  of grain, edible oil, and vegetable. The State Council has  adopted a number of measures to cope with it. Localities should  also sacrifice some of their immediate, partial interests and  adopt macroeconomic regulation and control to bring to a  reasonable level the prices of commodities closely related to  the daily life of the masses, thereby creating a stable social  environment for reform.    Li Lanqing said: In the course of developing the economy, we  must not blindly build development zones. In building approved  development zones, we must pay attention to integrating them  with the renovation of old cities and enterprises. In building  small towns in rural areas, we must coordinate their planning  with the development of a type of farming that provides high  yields of fine quality with maximum efficiency, and with the  second take-off of our rural work. We must guard against  decrease in agricultural output and safeguard the development of  "vegetable basket project." As long as we have abundant  agricultural produce and sideline products, we will not be  thrown into panic, and things will be easier to handle.    During his inspection, Li Lanqing visited Hangzhou's  Moganshan Vocational High School, Xuejun Middle School, Hangzhou  University, and Zhejiang University, as well as held a  discussion meeting on educational reform with responsible  persons of 22 institutes of higher learning.    Li Lanqing asked leading cadres at all levels to truly  enhance their understanding on "respecting teachers and  attaching importance to education." He said: Educational work  was discussed rather comprehensively and thoroughly in 27  chapters in Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping. We should earnestly study, understand, and  practice the teaching. The saying "education is fundamental for  a program of lasting importance" should not be taken as merely  an empty slogan, but should be used for mobilizing the entire  party, society, and people to show concern, support, and  participation in educational undertakings. Li Lanqing expressed  his appreciation to Zhejiang provincial party committee for its  decision "not to delay payment of teachers' salaries and not to  issue IOU's to farmers."    Li Lanqing pointed out: Further upgrading teaching quality  and school efficiency are the two key issues in current reform  for higher education. Speaking on the placement of institutes  of higher learning on the "211" project, he stressed: It is not  necessary to rush into making an evaluation as this is a  development process. Apart from standards stipulated by the  State Education Commission, institutes of higher learning should  meet the following three criteria: First, institutes of higher  learning of any province (city) that has not implemented basic  education efficiently or not even paid teachers' salaries cannot  be placed on the "211" project. Second, institutes of higher  learning that have not undertaken major reform measures cannot  be placed on the "211" project. Third, institutes of higher  education should be encouraged to supplement one another with  their strengths and jointly establish the "211" project.    While holding a discussion meeting in Ningbo, Li Lanqing  spoke predominantly on vocational education. He said: While  implementing educational reform, we should ask the people not to  merely seek a higher college entrance rate and advise students  not to confine themselves anymore to the difficult path of  seeking entrance to colleges. We shoud advise them to embark on  vocational education, a "broad and sunny avenue" which will  provide them with equal opportunities to become qualified  personnel and contribute to society. He expressed the hope  that, through the development of vocational education, Ningbo  City would actively explore a new avenue for training qualified  personnel urgently needed in economic development and reform and  opening up. He was pleased at Ningbo City's efforts in  implementing the "Teachers' Law" and active research in measures  for solving teachers' housing problem. He encouraged the city  to make a resolution on accomplishing its tasks effectively.    On the issue of compulsory education in rural areas, Li  Lanqing stressed the need to work out a comprehensive program to  incorporate agricultural science and technology into the  nine-year compulsory education so as to train a new generation  of peasants who are better educated than their parents. During  his inspection of Zhejiang, Li Lanqing also called on customs  office employees in Hangzhou. He told them: The Zhejiang  provincial party committee and government have paid keen  attention to, and followed a correct ideological line in  understanding antismuggling work. From now on we should  strengthen ideological education on the need to crack down on  smuggling among the grass-roots cadres. We should tackle  smuggling in the light of fighting corruption and promoting  clean government, and should teach grass-roots cadres to develop  local economy and achieve prosperity through earnest operation,  not by engaging in smuggling.    Li Lanqing said: We have already checked the spread of the  evil wave of smuggling, and the country as a whole is relatively  quiet. However, we should never lower our guard. Antismuggling  is a protracted task. It is necessary to persistently and  relentlessly crack down on smuggling activities once they are  discovered. Meanwhile, we should strive to achieve periodic  results in fighting smuggling in various fields: 1) we should  raise the awareness of antismuggling among leaders and ordinary  people alike; 2) we should resolutely curb smuggling and trading  of smuggled goods; 3) we should step up efforts to investigate  and punish major and serious cases; and 4) all departments  concerned should coordinate with each other to improve  comprehensive management. Efforts should be made to resolutely  implement the principle of "on-the-spot arrests, coastal  blockade, road checks, market supervision, and severe  punishment" in dealing with smuggling activities and smugglers.    In conclusion, Li Lanqing said: As the reform has entered a  crucial stage in all fields, all localities should study issues  related to the change of operational guidelines and mechanisms  of commercial circulation and foreign trade enterprises.  State-owned commercial departments should develop a commercial  chain system comprising both enterprise groups and wholesale and  retail businesses. It is necessary to actively experiment with  the modern enterprise system among foreign trade enterprises in  a bid to strengthen their cohesive power, intiate perfect  incentive and supervisory systems, prevent the drain of talented  people, ensure more foreign exchange earning, and increase  economic efficiency, thereby enabling the foreign trade industry  to keep abreast of the development of a socialist market economy  as quickly as possible.</p>

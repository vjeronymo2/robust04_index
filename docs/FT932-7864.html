			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / People: Linx to listen carefully Linx Printing Technologies, the manufacturer of continuous ink jet printing equipment that issued a profits warning on Tuesday, has parted company with its sales and marketing director, John Shead. The parting was 'amicable' according to Linx chief executive, Derek Harris, but follows recognition that the group's sales strategy had gone astray in Europe. Replacing Shead is John Cetti, who has spent eight years building from scratch the European ink jet business of Videojet, a company based in the US but controlled by GEC of the UK. Videojet appears to have been among the companies taking market share from Linx and the other UK-quoted ink jet printer maker, Domino Printing Sciences  -which six weeks ago also issued a profits warning. While Linx and Domino may have run into trouble meeting their plans, they will both be aware of another UK competitor. Willett, a private Northampton company with sales of Pounds 50m, says sales of its wider range of products including ink jet printers are still growing in Europe, possibly as a result of selling through subsidiaries rather than through foreign distributors. Harris said Cetti's arrival is the first stage of a reorganisation in Europe that has yet to take a firm shape. 'We have to listen carefully to what John says now,' he says. Cetti will have responsibility for Linx worldwide sales and marketing operations.</p>

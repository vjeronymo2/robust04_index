			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Allders shares priced at 170p - Operating profits of Pounds 23m forecast by department store A PRICE of 170p a share was fixed yesterday for the flotation of Allders, valuing the department store and tax and duty free retailer at Pounds 174.9m. On forecast operating profits for the 53 weeks to end-September of Pounds 23m, before exceptional debits, the issue price gives a notional p/e of 12.4. This rises to 14 on a 52-week basis and applying a normal 33 per cent tax charge. The dividend of 6.1p directors would have recommended for the 1992-93 year would give a gross yield of 4.5 per cent. Dividend cover would have been 2.3 times. In future the group intends to pay interim and final dividends approximately in the proportion of one-third:two-thirds. Mr Harvey Lipsith, chief executive, said that after a tough 4 1/2 years the group could now look forward rather than back. Prospects were better now than at any time since the management buy-out in 1989, the prospectus says. Mr Tony Collyer, finance director, said the book-building process had gone well. Of the 102.9m shares, 50.7m are being sold, raising Pounds 86.3m. Of these, 65 per cent had been firmly placed with institutions and the rest had been placed subject to clawback from the public offer. Many existing shareholders decided to buy rather than sell in the offer, through a 'mix and match' arrangement, so only 3.44m existing shares were being sold. Sun Life Investment Management will emerge as the largest shareholder with a 10.9 per cent stake. The balance comprises new shares, raising Pounds 75m for the company and cutting gearing to about 10 per cent. Net assets per share after the float will be 81.2p a share. More than 20,000 people had already called the registr-ation phone line for a prospectus. Applications close on November 3, with the basis of allocation expected to be announced the next day and dealings due to start on November 10. COMMENT With nothing on the stock market comparable to Allders, and given the frothy state of the equity market, the pricing is sensible and should ensure the shares go to a premium. But the rating, roughly in line with the market as a whole and significantly below the stores sector, reflects investors' doubts about the company. Department stores are not popular, and Allders, with its bias towards household goods, is perceived as less than top class. Further, about half group profits come from the supposedly volatile duty free side. Allders must educate the City and demonstrate its abilities to grow before it can expect its shares to be awarded a higher rating.</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I was deeply touched by the March 13 episode of "Who's the Boss?," especially  the scene in which Mona is in the hospital and her deceased husband appears,  telling her of his love and that "he is always with her." I recently lost my  husband of 42 years and those were his last words to me before passing away. My  compliments to the writers for such sensitivity and to Katherine Helmond for  her warm portrayal.  </P> <P> Rose Canevari, Temecula  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL PANEL TRIES TO BLOCK TRAILER PARK  RAZING  </P> <P> A Los Angeles City Council panel Tuesday voted to help prevent the new owner of  a 27-unit Van Nuys trailer park from razing the park and replacing it with a  commercial development.  </P> <P> The Planning and Land Use Management Committee voted unanimously to support a  plan proposed by Councilman Joel Wachs to rezone the Woodley Trailer Park for  multifamily residential use to protect the park's low-income tenants.  </P> <P> The property at 7936 Woodley Ave. is zoned for light-industrial use, and  Yechezchel Lehavi, who bought the site in 1989, says he intends to develop it  for commercial or industrial use. The one-acre parcel, the site of a mobile  home park since 1948, is surrounded by industrial properties.  </P> <P> Wachs' proposal still needs full council approval.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, we are able to give you information offered  by the head of the North Military Department, notably for the  city of Cap-Haitian, to our correspondent on the spot. The  latest news regarding the situation in Le Borgne is that the  Army is allegedly in control of the situation, according to the  report given to our correspondent in Cap-Haitian by the military  head of the city.    Military units sent to the spot are allegedly in control of  the situation after chasing away a group of armed rebels,  supporters of President Aristide, according to statements by the  military commander of the North Department. No official report  has been provided, however, since the confrontations between the  military and the group of armed civilians led by the North  Department delegate, according to information provided by the  North Military Command. Our correspondent, Jean-Claude Larousse,  has details:    [Begin Larousse recording, in Creole] In Le Borgne, Boucan  Michel, the Haitian Army is in control of the situation after  several days of lavalas insurrection led by Marc Lamour, former  member of the Constituent Assembly in 1987, vice delegate under  the overthrown Aristide government. We learned from military  sources that the Army seized stocks of weapons, explosives, and  ammunition which were at the disposal of the terrorists,  according to the commander of the North Military Department,  Lieutenant Colonel Claudel Josaphat. The same sources also say  that many of the rebels were killed; they do not specify the  number nor mention whether the leader of the group, Marc Lamour,  was alive, under arrest, or in hiding during an Army raid early  last week.    Another source, however, said the only casualty on the  military side was a soldier who was shot in the foot. According  to the same source from the North Military Department, the  weapons that the terrorists had were guns, 40-mm grenade  launchers, AR-15 antitank rifles [as heard], and 9-mm pistols.  According to information circulating in Le Borgne, a lot of  damage was done after the raid.    Meanwhile, we learned that there were many arrests in Le  Borgne, Port Magot, and even in Limbe, including the Le Borgne  mayor elected 16 December. According to military sources, he was  charged with plotting against state security. It is very  difficult for a journalist, however, to find and verify  information on the development of the situation in Le Borgne.  Meanwhile, according to Lt. Col. Claudel Josaphat, the military  raid continues.    Let us point out that the incident began, according to  military authorities, on the evening of 7-8 April when two of  Marc Lamour's men attacked the outpost of Petit-Bourg in Le  Borgne, a region about 50 km west of Cap-Haitian.

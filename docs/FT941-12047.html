			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: China bank plans overseas branches The Agricultural Bank of China, one of the country's 'big four' commercial banks, is to open branches in Hong Kong, New York and Singapore, writes Tony Walker. The establishment of overseas branch offices will coincide with reforms of the bank's operations at home to divide its commercial business from its policy-lending responsibilities to a struggling rural sector. The bank will be split into two institutions to be known as the Agricultural Bank and the Agricultural Development Bank. The latter will provide soft loans to farmers. The Agricultural Bank will be expected to compete more effectively in a commercial environment under new banking laws that are expected this year. A Central Bank Law and Banking Law are aimed at defining more clearly the responsibilities of China's banks, and opening the way for further reforms of an antiquated banking sector.</p>

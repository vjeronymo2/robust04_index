			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CHULA VISTA  </P> <P> Charges against a woman who allegedly helped her boyfriend, who had been  wounded by police, escape from a Chula Vista hospital were dismissed Monday by  a judge.  </P> <P> The charges of kidnaping against Teresa Reyes, 24, of San Ysidro, were dropped  after Jon Lowry, a former security guard at the hospital, refused to testify,  citing his 5th Amendment right not to incriminate himself.  </P> <P> At the time of the Jan. 29 incident, Lowry told police that Reyes was visiting  her boyfriend, Michael Valadez, 27, of Spring Valley, in the hospital where he  was recuperating from a gunshot wound suffered during a drug raid.  </P> <P> Lowry told authorities at the time that Reyes said she had a bomb in a sack and  forced him to drive Valadez and her to Tijuana. He said he saw exposed wires in  the sack and did not look further.  </P> <P> At Reyes' preliminary hearing Monday, Deputy Dist. Atty. George Bennett moved  to dismiss the case, saying that Lowry was the only witness to the kidnaping.  </P> <P> San Diego Municipal Judge Richard Hanscom granted the request.  </P> <P> Lowry said he wanted immunity before testifying, but Bennett would not offer  it. Lowry had worked as a security guard for Wackenhut Corp., but quit several  days after the incident.  </P> <P> Valadez was sentenced May 8 to six years in prison on the escape charge and two  drug charges.  </P></p>

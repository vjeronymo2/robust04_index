			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING Q &amp; A: GARDENING;  </P> <P> HOW TO CONTROL INSECTS ON ORCHIDS  </P> <P> QUESTION: I'm growing orchids in my home and notice scale insects on the  leaves. Is there a safe control for these?  </P> <P> ANSWER: You can buy some Safer's Soap in your garden center and apply it  according to label directions. Or you can mix a teaspoon of liquid dish washing  detergent to 1 quart of water. Add 1 cup of rubbing alcohol and wash the leaves  with the mixture.  </P> <P> Use either a sponge or a soft toothbrush. The secret is to dislodge the  insects. Periodic washing of foliage does a great job preventing infestation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ideal Dwarf Squash for Mideast Cooking  </P> <P> Q: We don't have a large back yard for vegetables, but would like to grow some  dwarf summer squash, used in Mideast cooking. Is that possible?  </P> <P> A: Yes, anyone interested in Lebanese or Middle Eastern cooking should grow a  summer squash known as cousa or Lebanese zucchini, ideal for stuffing.  </P> <P> This variety produces heavy yields of zucchini 3 to 5 inches long -- greenish  white fruits on compact, bushy plants.  </P> <P> For just a few cents you can buy a packet of cousa squash and have enough to  supply you all summer. You can grow the vines in a container or on a trellis,  as well as in the ground.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fruiting Plants That Thrive Under Lights  </P> <P> Q: Is there any fruiting plant in the form of either a dwarf tree or shrub that  can be grown reasonably well in a living room under fluorescent light?  </P> <P> A: There are several species of citrus that can be grown indoors if given  sufficient artificial light. Calamondin (a cross between kumquat and sour  mandarin orange), limequat, orangequat and kumquat itself, are good choices.  </P> <P> You may want to ask for catalogues from suppliers of dwarf citrus.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trying to Find Plant That Repels Gophers  </P> <P> Q: A friend told me there is a plant that repels moles and gophers. I have had  critters in my garden and would like to try it. She cannot remember the name,  but I thought you might have heard of it.  </P> <P> A: Probably the plant you are referring to is caper spruge or Euphorbia  lathyrus. A source for seeds is J.L. Hudson Co., Box 1058, Redwood City, Calif.  94064. It has an irritating sap in the roots and this is believed to be the  clue to its repellent qualities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name That Flower That Bloomed Long  </P> <P> Q: I cannot remember the name of a long-lasting cut flower that I grew in my  garden last summer. It opened like a rosebud, changed to tulip-shaped blooms  and finally opened fully like a poppy. Blooms came in blue, purple, pink or  white with silvery green foliage. The label was something like "estomia" but I  cannot find it in catalogues nor can garden store clerks help.  </P> <P> A: You had a plant listed either as eustoma or lisianthus which was developed  from wild prairie gentian. Initially, botanists listed it under Eustoma  russellainum and also Lisianthus russelainus, so you may find it under either  first name. As cut flowers, they can last as long as two weeks, or more.  </P> <P> The Abrahams cannot answer questions individually, those of general interest  will be addressed in this column. Write to Doc and Katy Abraham, Los Angeles  Times, P.O. Box 579, Naples, N.Y. 14512.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> NEW COLUMN A twice-monthly question-and-answer column for gardeners starts  today, written by veteran gardeners Doc and Katy Abraham. The Abrahams have  owned and operated a landscape and florist business in Naples, N.Y., for 20  years and have written eight books on horticulture topics. The column will  address general topics of interest to Southland gardeners.  </P></p>

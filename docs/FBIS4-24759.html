			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 1 (XINHUA) -- The Fifth Asia-Pacific  International Trade Fair (ASPAT '94) is to be held here at the  China International Exhibition Center (CIEC) from June 7 to 13,  sources here said today.    About 3,000 participants from 29 countries and regions,  including China, Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Germany, India,  Japan, the Republic of Korea, Norway, Thailand, the United  States, and Hong Kong and Macao, will take part in the fair.    It is jointly sponsored by the China Council for the  Promotion of International Trade and the United Nations Economic  and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP).    On display will be light industrial products, machinery  equipment, electronic technology, communications equipment and  products, jewelry, ornaments, garments, traditional handicrafts,  and real estate projects.    The exhibition will cover more than 80,000 square meters.    A large trade delegation composed of high-ranking  businessmen  from Hong Kong will visit the fair and conduct trade talks.    During the fair, a number of symposiums will be held on  expansion of electronics trade, China's current economic  situation and investment environment, China's reform of its  foreign trade system and investment policies, and China's  financial and taxation reform.    The CIEC is understood to have invested 120 million yuan  (about 13.8 million U.S. dollars) in building a main exhibition  hall covering 50,000 square meters for the coming exhibition.    The holding of aspat'94 is to promote economic and trade  cooperation among the Asian-Pacific countries, develop national  economies, and explore ways for strengthening cooperation and  jointly getting prosperous in a new world situation among the  Asian- Pacific countries.    The theme of ASPAT '94 is "progress through cooperation".    ASPAT was first proposed in 1962 by the United Nations Asia  and Far East Economic Commission, which is the present UN-ESCAP.    ASPAT is aimed to expand and develop economic cooperation  and  trade relations among the Asian-Pacific countries, especially  among the developing countries, and to accelerate the economic  cooperation between the Asian-Pacific countries and the rest of  the world.    The first three ASPAT fairs were held in 1966, 1969 and 1972  in Thailand, Iran and India, and proved to be fruitful. The  fourth ASPAT fair, which was held in Beijing in 1985, was also a  complete success.</p>

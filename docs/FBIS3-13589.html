Besides his meeting with the Croatian leader, Prince  Hasan will inspect the Jordanian United Nations peacekeeping  force in the former Yugoslav Republic, which has recently been  beefed up.    The commander of the Jordanian UN contingent, who is also a  head of the UN peacekeeping mission, Ghazi al-Tayyib, and senior  officers received the crown prince.    His royal highness is accompanied by His Royal Highness  Prince 'Abdallah Bin-al-Husayn and Minister of State for Foreign  Affairs Talal al-Hasan.    The Crown Prince told reporters he was glad to have a second  opportunity to discuss with Tudjman efforts aimed at peace in  former Yugoslavia:    [Begin Hasan recording, in progress]...discussed with  President Tudjman at the gracious reception the ongoing  developments in the region. I would like to say how gratified  we are to see progress in the ongoing talks in Vienna. We are  deeply interested in the concept of a bicommunal community as a  first step leading to further cooperation between Croatia and  the Bosnian Muslims. And I certainly would like to say that the  containment of violence is very much the role to which, we,  through the United Nations, have committed ourselves to. [end  recording]    Prince Hasan also met the UN secretary general's personal  representative in former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, and  discussed the UN peacekeeping operation.    The crown prince left Amman earlier in the day on a two-day  visit and was seen off by senior officials.</p>

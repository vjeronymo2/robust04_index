			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Caution on Richemont proposals VOLUME in tobacco group Rothmans International, relisted yesterday after a one-day suspension, rose to 7.1m shares, the highest daily total for five years, as the market digested plans by its parent company Richemont to reorganise its Rothmans, Cartier and Dunhill subsidiaries. The shares jumped 20 to 743p immediately after being relisted but later fell back sharply to close 28 down at 692p on a mixture of profit-taking and cautious views of the group reorganisation. One analyst suggested shareholders might even vote against the deal and said: 'The deal has benefits but there isn't much more value created by it.' Another market watcher simply said that closer examination of the deal showed the shares to be overvalued at current levels. Similar caution was registered by holders of Dunhill and the shares gave up 22 to 383p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Commenting on North Korea's moves to test-fire a  missile at a news conference on 30 May, Chief Cabinet Secretary  Hiroshi Kumagai said, "The government has information on those  moves in that country." In this way, the Japanese Government  officially confirmed for the first time North Korea's moves to  test-fire the missile.    At the news conference, however, Chief Cabinet Secretary  Kumagai stated: "The government does not know details of North  Korea's plans to test-fire the missile. The government also does  not know whether North Korea's moves to test-fire the missile  are related to the issue of international inspections of its  nuclear facilities. I, therefore, would like to refrain from  making any further comment at the present stage."</p>

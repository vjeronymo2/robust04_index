			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: SAN DIEGO ENTERTAINMENT BRIEFS  </P> <P> Martha Clarke will not be bringing "The Garden of Earthly Delights" to the Old  Globe in May as scheduled. The much-heralded event by the iconoclastic director  -- a wordless theatrical realization of Hieronymus Bosch paintings of heaven  and hell -- seemed to signal an avant-garde departure for the Globe when it was  announced for the May 4-25 slot. The show, which blends theater, music, visual  art and dance, has played twice in New York as well as Spain, Italy and  Austria. A marketing director from Cal Perfomances at University of California,  Berkeley, said that, because of a disagreement about booking dates for Clarke's  production in San Diego, a West Coast tour was canceled. The Globe, which  offered "The Garden of Earthly Delights" as an alternate choice for "Blood  Wedding" in its subscription series, has not yet announced a replacement.  </P></p>

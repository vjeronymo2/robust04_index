			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (55): A new way to look at company finances WHILE multimedia applications have focussed on traditional areas such as training and 'point-of-sale' information, there are signs that the technology could move into mainstream applications. This month, UK software company Pegasus is launching a multimedia 'front end' for its accountancy software. The software for the 'front end' is derived from a package called Show Business, a program which can be used to build multimedia applications on top of Microsoft's Windows 3 environment. Mr Morel Fourman, managing director of Show Business developer Samore, says that the Pegasus 'front end' will bring a new dimension to accountancy software. 'The idea came from the need to present accounting information to senior executives,' he says. 'Traditionally, accountancy software has the databases and the reporting tools - by adding multimedia you can start to interpret the information they provide.' Mr Fourman goes on to say that the combination turns out ' by accident' to be an executive information system - and therefore gives senior executives a simple way to look at their company's financial position and make informed decisions. The Show Business software sets up 'buttons' on the screen which can be used to provide more information about an item in a display. An example would be a button on a total sales field which, when selected, would display a more detailed breakdown of the figures. The data used to create the sales figures is derived directly from the order-processing and invoicing processes in the accountancy software. The idea has already worked well in practice, says Mr Fourman. The UK Department of the Environment (DOE) has used the Show Business software to prepare data from a Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet for assessment under its Green House Programme. The Programme aims to channel funding to UK regions to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and involved the assessment of nearly 500 detailed 'bids' from regional authorities.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 21 TASS -- The Upper House of the  Russian Parliament has declined to include an item about the  country's federal budget for 1994 on its agenda today.    Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko told the  chamber that the Lower House, the State Duma which approved the  budget upon second reading, failed to forward it to the Upper  House.    The Federation Council speaker also informed the members  that  the Duma refused to hear the Upper House Budget Committee  Chairman Nikolay Gonchar who wanted to inform the Duma about  objections to some articles of the federal budget.    According to Shumeyko, the State Duma plans to return to the  draft budget before forwarding it to the Upper House of the  Russian legislature.    The Federation Council decided to hear Nikolay Gonchar's  report on Tuesday afternoon and call upon the Duma to take due  account of the proposals made by Federation Council members.    The debate about the proposed budget is nonetheless likely  to  take part when the chamber goes down to the "any other business"  item under pressure of the pickets outside the building who  demand prompt support for the defence industry.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> VALUE OF CHOLESTEROL TESTS CITED  </P> <P> Public cholesterol screening tests apparently encourage many people to seek  advice from their doctors and change their diets to cut their risk for heart  disease, researchers say.  </P> <P> A recent study found that about 40% of people who had high cholesterol levels  on public screening tests went to a doctor to follow up on the results and more  than 75% reported changing their diets.  </P> <P> Dr. Antonio Gotto of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston said his team's  study of more than 13,000 people may help rebut recent criticism about the  value and safety of wide-scale cholesterol screening.  </P> <P> In a study published recently in the American Journal of Cardiology, Gotto and  his colleagues looked at the effectiveness of cholesterol screening at a  variety of sites -- shopping malls, workplaces, health care centers, a  supermarket, a blood bank and a school.  </P></p>

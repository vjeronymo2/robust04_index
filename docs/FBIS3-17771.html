But then the atmosphere here too  clouded over thanks to the Washington leaders of the "civilized  society," who contrived to start a quarrel with both China and  Japan at once. Now Clinton's "third front" in the Pacific is  becoming apparent -- the DPRK.    It is a small state in terms of its potential and cannot, of  course, be compared with the two aforementioned very influential  Asian and world powers but, on the other hand, the acuteness of  the conflict here is far greater: Whereas in the first two  cases we are talking of an economic war, in the third the  rattling of sabers can be heard.    On 21 March IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency]  Director General Blix declared that his agency was not demanding  sanctions against the DPRK and that it did not possess any proof  that North Korea had violated an international regulation in the  sphere of nuclear technologies. But Clinton, as though wishing  at all costs to outdo everyone, including both the IAEA and the  United Nations, hastened to accounce that very day that he had  already made the decision to station Patriot missile systems in  South Korea.    But what, in fact, started it all? The Korean "nuclear  crisis" seemed to have been settled three weeks ago. A kind of  diplomatic deal had been concluded between official  representatives of the DPRK and the United States under whose  terms the DPRK was to admit IAEA inspectors to its nuclear  installations in "exchange" for the U.S. abandonment of the Team  Spirit maneuvers in South Korea and of the stationing of its  missiles there and, in addition, for consent to hold top-level  talks between Washington and Pyongyang in Geneva.    As for the DPRK, a group of international experts received  the appropriate visas and inspected all seven of North Korea's  stipulated nuclear installations 1 through 15 March. The  inspectors discovered nothing untoward attesting to the military  thrust of research. A slight argument with recriminations did,  however, occur: The North Korean side reckoned that the IAEA  experts had committed a number of violations of their previously  stipulated inspection methods. But the experts reckoned for  their part that they had not been granted sufficient  opportunities to take samples at one of the seven installations  -- the radiochemical laboratory at Yongbyon.    Who is more right here? Let us assume it is the IAEA  inspectors. This would mean that the DPRK fulfilled its pledges  in the deal with the United States not 100 percent but only 99  percent. Or maybe even just 85 or 75 percent. But what of the  United States? It did not fulfill its pledges. It canceled the  talks in Geneva, Team Spirit will very soon make the Korean  Peninsula resound with the clank of caterpillar tracks and the  explosion of shells, and they are threatening to deploy the  Patriots even in April. And Russia signs nuclear disarmament  agreements with such a partner?    It is totally absurd that the world press at once, as though  on a command, began demonizing not the United States but the  DPRK, portraying it as a rogue and disturber of the peace. Not,  alas, without the complicity of the Russian mass media.    China's position is characterized by soundness, clarity, and  prudence. As a state which has signed the Treaty on the  Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, State Council Premier Li  Peng declared at a news conference in Beijing 22 March, the PRC  does not support or encourage their proliferation. China  constantly advocates resolving the question of a nuclear  inspection in the DPRK by means of talks and does not approve of  the use of pressure. Because not only will this not help to  resolve the question, it will merely complicate and exacerbate  the situation on the Korean Peninsula.    The positions of Russia and Japan are not clear. Will the  former venture to demonstrate independence, as happened recently  in respect of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina? Is the latter  aware that, if the transoceanic "cowboy" is permitted to make  such a commotion in Korea, his "lasso" will tighten itself  primarily around Japan's own body?</p>

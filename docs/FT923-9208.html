			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Japanese claim soul of the islands with a Soviet face: A look at the backward and sharply contested South Kuriles A TREASURE trove of fish, gold and natural beauty, the South Kuriles' gently sloping hills rise up under the mist as in a Japanese print. On the ground, however, the islands which Japan wants back from Russia could not look more Soviet. As soon as you set foot on Kunashir, which is just 9km from Japan, a fish-processing factory greets you with a huge slogan saying 'Glory to the Working Class'. Rusting fishing boats and assorted rubbish litter a makeshift harbour. An outsize bust of Lenin is the main attraction of the local town's shapeless windswept square. The island was seized by Soviet troops in the closing days of the second world war, along with Eturup, Shikotan, and the Hobbemai group of islets. A neglected outpost of the Soviet empire for 45 years, the four islands are now at the centre of a bitter international dispute, with Japan making large-scale aid and investment for Russia conditional upon their return. While most of the 25,000 islanders, who came from all over the Soviet Union after the Japanese population was deported en masse, oppose the islands' return, most also favour extensive economic co-operation and open borders with a country they see as an instant source of wealth. (Today, the only Japanese presence on Kunashir is a 30-year-old teacher who is providing Japanese language courses via the local newspaper). Up to 30 per cent of the islanders would even welcome a handover. 'We should give the islands back to the Japanese and the sooner the better,' exclaimed Mrs Zoya Ashurova, a native of Shikotan who was visiting her conscript son on Kunashir. 'We live like beggars.' Travelling on a Russian cruise ship for two days and nights to reach the island from the closest bit of Russia - Sakhalin Island - underlined just how cut off the islanders are. Emphasising the impression that the Russians have been camping out despite Russification - which has extended to giving local volcanoes new names such as Ivan the Terrible - none of the islands has a harbour capable of accommodating the passenger ships which are the main form of transport from the islands. Some moderates fear that even giving up the two smallest islands could set a precedent for other claims on Russian territory. The islands are surrounded by some of the richest fishing grounds in the world. (In contrast to conditions for civilians, no expense has been spared for the military, who have their own port for navy vessels at Shikotan.) Dirt tracks substitute for roads (which cost four times as much to build than on the mainland), social services and telecommunications are primitive even by Russian standards and supplies of food are erratic and expensive. The luxury liner I sailed on, for example, was lined with dozens of cardboard boxes containing live chickens. Although many died on the way, their owner's intention was to set up a chicken farm on Eturup, the largest island. ('If I don't help him, who will?,' was how the ship's captain explained his decision not to charge for the service). For all the hardship, life on what Japan calls its Northern Territories still has its attractions. Mrs Liudmila Danilova, 45, left Russia's sordid Kuzbass mining region seven years ago to work in Kunashir's fish factory. 'The air is clean and the environment is beautiful. In the Kuzbass, the snow turns black five minutes after falling to the ground, and now that I am used to walking everywhere, the buses there seem stuffy,' she explained, saying she did not think the islands should be given up. Mr Valentin Fyodorov, the governor of the Sakhalin and Kurile region who fiercely opposes ceding any territory, has staked his promises of a better life for the islanders on a draft decree which, if signed by President Boris Yeltsin, would provide substantial tax benefits and deploy the military to build up infrastructure. As he admitted in a letter to President Yeltsin earlier this year: 'The socio-political situation of the Southern Kuriles has got even more acute at the present time, a fact which is no secret to the Japanese side and serves as an additional argument to strengthen its position in negotiations with Russia.' President Yeltsin, who visits Japan next month, has said the issue - which differs from other territorial disputes in so far as Russia's borders with Japan were never sealed in a peace treaty - should be resolved on the basis of justice and legality. Mr Mikhael Poltoranin, the deputy prime minister who is helping to prepare the trip, said in Tokyo yesterday that Mr Yeltsin would announce his support for the 1956 declaration in which Moscow agreed to return Hobbemai and Shikotan but that it would be difficult for him to hand over territory in the near future. This is because of a conservative wave sweeping Russia which makes it unlikely that the country will be parting with any territory in the near future. Even moderates fear that giving up the islands, even the two smallest ones, could set a precedent for claims on Russian territory. At parliamentary hearings last week military leaders reiterated that the islands were strategically important for Russia because they control access to the Pacific and because of the presence of US troops on Hokkaido island in Japan. Despite a thaw in relations which has translated into visits by Japanese groups to the tombs of their ancestors, Mr Nikolai Pokidin, Kunashir's mayor, says that he has given up waiting for the Japanese to bring money and know-how to the islands. 'We smile politely like they do, but the more we orientate ourselves towards the Japanese, the worse it will be for us,' he explained. 'They don't want the islands to develop. They want to show that the government and the people can't do anything here on their own and have to give them up.' He says his aim is to attract foreign investment from North America, Europe, and South East Asia to develop the fishing industry, plus unexploited areas such as tourism and so far untouched mineral wealth, which includes 500 tonnes of gold and silver. Despite the fact that rapid improvements are unlikely unless Japan ends its embargo on any finance for the islands ('this is our only means of leverage,' explained a Japanese diplomat), Mr Pokidin and others hope that market reforms will do the trick. 'The real problem is not which country these islands belong to but the fact that there has been no private property,' says Mr Givi Kesayev, one of Kunashir's budding entrepreneurs, who bought the island's first private fishing boat and plans to open a hotel next. 'Everything will be fine once the island has real owners.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> I recognize that there are some benefits that will be likely to accrue from approval of MMT use. In addition to the obvious economic benefits associated with reductions in petroleum use and in fuel prices, there might also be some favorable health and environmental effects. It is probable that, if MMT use were to result in reduced NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from motor vehicles, this would be accompanied by some site-specific decreases in ozone formation. The small decreases in cancer risks claimed by Ethyl are considerably more speculative and cannot be quantified with existing information. In any case, it is not possible for me to weigh any modest hypothetical decrease in cancer risk or limited site-specific ozone benefit against a risk of effects on the nervous system that could significantly decrease the quality of life for a large number of individuals. In addition, EPA is or will be taking a number of other actions under the Clean Air Act to reduce emissions of carcinogenic air pollutants and to limit ozone formation. <FOOTCITE>85</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 85 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, reductions in levels of carcinogenic particulates will accrue due to controls placed on diesel sulfur (55 FR 34120, August 21, 1990). Reductions in carcinogenic toxic emissions (and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions after the year 2000) will accrue as a result of regulations requiring the introduction of reformulated gasoline in 1995 promulgated under section 211(k) of the Act as amended in 1990 (59 FR 7716, February 16, 1994) and as a result of the Agency's vehicle-based refueling emissions regulations (59 FR 16262, April 6, 1994). EPA has already issued tighter tailpipe standard for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  as required under the new amendments, and future ozone state implementation plans will address other NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  control strategies. In addition, the recently-promulgated enhanced emission I/M program regulations for the first time establish a performance standard to reduce in-use NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions in the more serious ozone nonattainment areas. Regarding stationary source control strategies, other provisions of the Act call for a two million ton NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction from certain utilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the EPA analyses described in this decision and on the administrative record compiled by EPA as part of this decision, I have concluded that there is a reasonable basis for concern about the effects on public health that could result if EPA were to approve use of MMT in unleaded gasoline pursuant to Ethyl's application. I have also concluded that the actual and hypothetical benefits which could accrue from MMT use are insufficient to outweigh the concerns regarding potential adverse health effects. In circumstances where there is substantial uncertainty regarding the nature of potential health effects which would result if a fuel additive waiver were approved, the burden of resolving such uncertainties should fall on the waiver applicant rather than on the public. This policy is consistent with the general policy established by the recently promulgated health effects testing rule, which requires that manufacturers of new fuels or fuel additives complete all necessary testing prior to registration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, for the reasons set forth above, utilizing the discretion afforded me under section 211(f)(4) of the Act, I am today denying Ethyl's request for a waiver of the section 211(f)(1) prohibitions against the use of MMT in unleaded gasoline. As previously stated in this decision, should Ethyl wish to undertake research intended to alleviate the present uncertainties concerning the adverse health effects which could be associated with the use of MMT in unleaded gasoline, the Agency will work with Ethyl to resolve the details of the needed research. If Ethyl decides to undertake the research which is needed, and which would likely be required in any case to register MMT for unleaded gasoline under the Agency's recently promulgated fuel and fuel additive health effects testing regulations, EPA will reconsider granting a waiver to Ethyl at that time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has determined that this action does not meet any of the criteria for classification as a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866. Therefore, no regulatory impact analysis is required. This action is not a ``rule'' as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., because EPA has not published, and is not required to publish, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b), or any other law. Therefore, EPA has not prepared a supporting regulatory flexibility analysis addressing the impact of this action on small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is a final Agency action of national applicability. Jurisdiction to review this action lies exclusively in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, judicial review of this action is available only by the filing of a petition for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit within 60 days of August 17, 1994. Under section 307(b)(2) of the Act, today's action may not be challenged later in a separate judicial proceeding brought by the Agency to enforce the statutory prohibitions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: July 13, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Carol M.

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy On their own, yesterday's UK industrial output figures can be interpreted any way one likes. Those inclined to fret about consumer confidence may focus on the drop in production of footwear and clothing. Those who believe in robust growth can point to distortions from the rail strike and the explosion at the Milford haven oil refinery. But together with recent data on housing, CBI survey evidence and short-time working at Ford, the output data do suggest some slowdown in the pace of growth. Worries about higher base rates seem to be abating: indeed the money markets are shading down their expectations in this regard. The authorities' thinking may become clearer on Monday when minutes are published of the meeting at which September's base rate rise was decided. The aim appears to be the laudable one of preventing the output gap closing too quickly, which would unleash inflation, while still preserving the recovery. In that case, a modest deceleration of growth now would be welcome in helping the chancellor achieve the required balance. Amid all the bond market turbulence it is easy to lose sight of the way in which investors have given the authorities credit for the base rate rise. Equities have fallen 155 points since then, and the long bond yield is unchanged at just over 8.6 per cent. But the yield premium of gilts over US and German government stock has narrowed by 30 and 15 basis points respectively. That shows some faith in the value of Mr Clarke's pre-emptive strike.</p>

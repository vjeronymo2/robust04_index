			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> FANS BOO MAVERICKS ON THE COURT; SONICS BLAST THEM OFF OF IT, 117-70  </P> <P> One-sided games are not unusual these days in the NBA, especially since the  league added four expansion teams in the past two seasons.  </P> <P> But to have a veteran team lose by 47 points on their home court is still a  rarity.  </P> <P> It happened Saturday night at Dallas when 17,007 fans spent most of their time  booing the Mavericks during their 117-70 loss to the Seattle SuperSonics.  </P> <P> There were people who thought the Mavericks would be a contender this season.  But morale sagged when their best player, Roy Tarpley, was suspended because of  a drug problem.  </P> <P> After trailing only, 25-22, in the first period, Dallas hit rock bottom. In the  second half the Mavericks committed almost as many turnovers as they scored  points: 29 points and 25 turnovers.  </P> <P> The Mavericks, who shot only 36%, had the lowest half and the lowest total in  the NBA this season.  </P> <P> Rolando Blackman was 11 for 16. Without him the Mavericks would have been 16  for 59 (27%).  </P> <P> The 47-point deficit was the second-greatest in Dallas history, one point less  than 116-68 drubbing by Houston in 1981. The 70 points scored by Dallas was its  lowest at home in franchise history and was the lowest scored by a team in the  NBA this season.  </P> <P> The SuperSonics, who have been hearing boos at home for lackadaisical play were  led by Xavier McDaniel with 22 points. They are 7-6.  </P> <P> Chicago 104, Golden State 91 -- There are few things in sports as exciting as  watching Michael Jordan take control of a game.  </P> <P> A national television audience and 15,025 fans at the Oakland Coliseum Arena  saw Jordan take over in the middle of the third quarter Saturday and lead the  Chicago Bulls.  </P> <P> Jordan triggered a 16-3 run that brought the Bulls from four points behind to a  lead they never gave up.  </P> <P> During the rally, Jordan stole the ball, grabbed rebounds, threw perfect passes  and made acrobatic baskets.  </P> <P> It was the sixth game in a Western swing for the Bulls that began Nov. 14 and  will end tonight against the Clippers.  </P> <P> Jordan, who has had the flu and a knee injury, had his usual slow start --  making only one of his first nine shots -- but by the middle of the second  quarter he was his usual self.  </P> <P> On a day when 7-1 center Bill Cartwright was sidelined because of tendinitis in  a knee, the Bulls needed rebounding. Jordan had 14 along with nine assists and  29 points. After his poor start, he went 11 for 20 from the field.  </P> <P> And, when the Warriors, who have struggled without a center most of the early  season, pulled to 83-81 with 7:43 left, he scored eight points in a 21-10  closing rush by Chicago.  </P> <P> New York 125, Milwaukee 108 -- Gerald Wilkins scored 11 of his 23 points during  a 20-2 run by the Knicks in the second quarter at New York.  </P> <P> The Bucks led, 34-31, when Wilkins led the rally that gave the Knicks a 51-36  lead. The Bucks lost Jack Sikma in the second quarter. Sikma injured a thigh  and did not return.  </P> <P> Patrick Ewing sat out the fourth quarter and failed to reach 20 points for the  first time this season. He finished with 18 points and 13 rebounds.  </P> <P> Houston 85, Cleveland 75 -- All the injury-riddled Cavaliers had left by the  middle of the third quarter at Richfield, Ohio, were five substitutes, one of  whom was playing with a broken wrist.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers, already without Larry Nance, Brad Daugherty and Tree Rollins,  lost Mark Price and backup center Paul Mokeski with injuries in the third  quarter. The only center left was Chris Dudley, who has a cast on his left  wrist.  </P> <P> Atlanta 108, Boston 100 -- Moses Malone has had some big games, but this one at  Atlanta has to rank with his best.  </P> <P> Malone, a 34-year-old center in his 17th pro season, had 31 points and 18  rebounds to lead the Hawks to the win over the Celtics.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 111, Indiana 103 -- The Pacers were still celebrating a rare  victory at Boston by the time this game at Indianapolis started.  </P> <P> They trailed, 62-43, at halftime and when they settled down, it was too late to  catch up.  </P> <P> Sacramento 112, New Jersey 98 -- After putting Ralph Sampson on the disabled  list, the Kings won for the fourth time in 12 games in this game at Sacramento.  Sampson is scheduled to undergo rehabilitation on his injured knee.  </P> <P> Washington 107, Miami 88 -- Bernard King, playing mainly in the first and third  quarters at Landover, Md., scored 26 points to lead the Bullets to an easy  victory.  </P> <P> Charlotte 81, Minnesota 73 -- J.R. Reid had 18 points and 18 rebounds at  Charlotte and the Hornets beat the Timberwolves. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

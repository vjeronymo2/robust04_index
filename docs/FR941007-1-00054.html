			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agencies also have revised the lending test in response to comments that the December proposal placed undue emphasis on the geography of the borrower rather than on the borrower's individual characteristics. Under the revised proposal, while the agencies would continue to place a heavy emphasis on the geographic distribution of an institution's lending, they also would consider favorably loans made to low- and moderate-income individuals regardless of where the borrowers reside. The agencies would evaluate the number and amount of home mortgage loans to low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income individuals; the number and amount of loans to small business and small farms with annual revenues less than or equal to $1 million; the number and amount of loans to small businesses and small farms by size of loan; and, at the institution's option, the number and amount of consumer loans to low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income individuals. The revised proposal provides that distribution of borrower characteristics would be examined with particular reference to the institution's service area, but need not be limited to the institution's service area. Institutions would receive favorable consideration for lending to low- and moderate-income individuals and small businesses and farms outside of their service area, so long as they have not neglected these borrowers inside their service area. The agencies have also created an assessment criterion regarding an institution's use of innovative and flexible lending practices to recognize those programs and products that might have been cause for upward adjustments in the December proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agencies received numerous comments on the market share component of the lending test. Many banks and thrifts felt the market share test was misleading in that, among other things, it overlooked loans by institutions that do not have any reporting obligations under HMDA or CRA. Further, institutions could have had service areas that overlapped partially, but not completely, in ways that would distort the measurement of their lending performance under the test. Many also were concerned that if one bank increased its market share, another necessarily would lose market share; hence, the commenters suggested that the market share test could promote a price war among institutions trying to make loans in low- and moderate-income areas, potentially leading to unsafe and unsound banking practices. Banks and thrifts frequently stated that the lending test in the December proposal was a form of credit allocation. On the other hand, many community groups and government officials liked the market share test because it provided an objective and quantitative standard for measuring an institution's CRA performance. At the same time, a number of community groups expressed concern that the formula did not take into account qualitative differences among loans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of these comments, the lending test has been modified. The lending test would continue to give significant weight to the geographic distribution of an institution's lending; and, as part of the assessment context, examiners would consider, among other considerations described earlier in this preamble, the performance of other similarly-situated lenders where appropriate. In this regard, examiners would use market share and other analyses to assist in evaluating the geographic distribution of an institution's lending where such analyses would provide accurate insight. However, the proposed regulation does not require examiners to use any single type of analysis, and would not link a particular market share ratio, or any ratio, with a particular lending test rating.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In considering the geographic distribution of an institution's loans, the agencies, under the revised proposal, would evaluate the number and amount of an institution's loans in the low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income geographies of the institution's service area. They also would assess the dispersion of the institution's lending throughout its service area. In response to concerns expressed by some commenters that an institution might limit the size of its service area to obtain a better performance rating, the revised proposal would penalize an institution if too little of its lending were made inside its service area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While agreeing with the concept of including affiliate and third-party lending at the institution's option, many industry commenters criticized the December proposal_which would not have considered lending by chartered or non-funded affiliates_as unduly restrictive and inconsistent with the corporate funding practices of certain institutions. Also, some community and consumer groups expressed concern that institutions could use third-party lending to avoid their direct lending obligations and, in effect, ``buy out'' of their CRA obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

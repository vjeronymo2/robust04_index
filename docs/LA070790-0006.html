			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN SUFFERS SERIOUS BURNS IN FIRE  </P> <P> A 54-year-old woman was in serious condition at UC San Diego Medical Center  after a fire destroyed her apartment in Cardiff early Friday.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, two Encinitas firefighters who responded to the blaze have recovered  after succumbing to malathion fumes in the apartment.  </P> <P> The fire, which occurred in the 1300 block of Greenlake Drive at 1:25 a.m.,  spewed flames that were "already coming out the door and windows" when  firefighters arrived, said firefighters' spokesman Steve Marvin.  </P> <P> Phoebe Asher, who reportedly had been sleeping on her couch, was airlifted by  Life Flight to the hospital. The fire, which Marvin said was caused by  "discarded smoking materials," caused $80,000 in damage.  </P> <P> As firefighters investigated the blaze, two fell ill and were taken to Scripps  Memorial Hospital in Encinitas, where they were treated and released. After  calling the county hazardous materials unit, two broken one-pint bottles of  malathion were found.  </P> <P> Nursing Supervisor Tom Banaszak said Asher suffered burns over 34% of her body.  "In addition to the burns on her arms, she sustained inhalation burns,"  Banaszak said.  </P></p>

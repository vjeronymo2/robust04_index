			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Spectre of jobless army haunts Russia: The painful business of adjusting to new times must soon start THE fear stalking the corridors of power of the Russian government is palpable: it is of the rise of an army - an army of unemployed. Mr Feodor Prokopov, the young deputy Minister of Labour, refers to it often. 'We will see a very sharp rise in the autumn - perhaps up to 3.5m or 4m. Perhaps to 5m-6m by the end of this year. Now, it's nothing: a little over 100,000. But it will come'. The lack of unemployment in a system where production has fallen steadily, where many goods, especially military and capital goods, have no market and real incomes of the population have been sharply reduced, is only a mystery if one thinks of the former Soviet economy as capable of acting in a market fashion. It is not. Enterprises have retained staff at all costs - most of these costs being obvious in the Rbs800-900bn debt which they now owe to each other. Says Mr Prokopov:"You must understand the mentality. First, no manager has any experience of firing any number of workers. Second, managers are not so much managers in the western sense as members of the collective. This is a Russian as well as a Soviet tradition.' However, it is clear that time is running out, and that the painful business of psychological adjustment to new times must soon start. A study now being finalised for the United Nations International Labour Organisation shows that the real level of unemployment has been much higher than the public figures - in large part because workers, who receive full pay for three months after redundancy and a tapering scale of pay thereafter, often do not bother to register for an unemployment benefit which few receive. Soon, there will be no disguising it. Most managers covered in the ILO survey reported an intention to cut staff by at least 10 per cent this year. Thus the Government is trying to get in place a legal and institutional framework which will cope with the most obvious and poignant signs of economic crisis: men and women on the streets, without work. The legal basis  -an employment law - is now in draft stage, and is out for consultation with regional authorities and with the parliament. It is fairly uncompromising: for instance, it explicitly states that 'in a free economy neither the State nor private employers can guarantee employment for the citizens and the citizens must feel that they themselves have the responsibility to find themselves an occupation' In a later passage, it says that 'hiring and firing according to the business needs of the enterprise is the responsibility of the employers' - though it later includes a provision which makes it necessary for employers to inform the state, and the unions, in advance of mass redundancies (over 50). Mr Prokopov and his colleagues and advisers are wrestling with four main, and perhaps ultimately insoluble problems. First, they are seeking to guarantee a (very) minimum wage to all those who will lose their jobs. At present, their thinking is that this will be two-tier: 125 per cent of the minimum income (to rise to Rbs900 by May 1) for those who lose their jobs: 75 per cent of the minimum income for the long-term unemployed, for those looking for work for the first time and those whose employers has not contributed the statutory 1 per cent of the wage bill to the Employment Fund. This is low. An income 25 per cent less than a level defined as minimum is desperately tight. But there is no money for more: if unemployment rises too far, there may not even be money for that. Second, they are trying to put in place a network of unemployment benefit offices and training centres in a country which has not had the first and has the wrong kind of the second. Ms Molly Meacher, a British employment consultant working with Mr Prokopov, said that there is a lot of effort being put into this, but it is not yet clear who should be trained for what. Most training in the former Soviet Union is done in specialised institutes, where workers are given skills for life: retraining is barely known. The World Bank, with such countries as Germany, Britain and Sweden are beginning to mobilise help on this front, and met in the past fortnight to co-ordinate their responses. But it will be shambolic at first. Third, they want to encourage the unions and the management to act like independent bodies: for now, however, both look upward, to the state. The former official unions, still dominant, are - says Mr Prokopov - passive and confused: the managers have no experience in collective bargaining. The aim is to get bipartite bargaining going at local levels: and there is much interest in a a tripartite 'co-determination' system at national level. But more depends on the shopfloor than on the government. They face the immediate hurdle of getting the employment legislation past a parliament where large numbers of deputies are sure to object to inscribing in law that the right to work no longer exists: the law, like many others, may have to rely on presidential decree.</p>

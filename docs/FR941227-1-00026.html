			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) How should FRA address accountability and enforceability if the carrier does not meet the 99-percent standard? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If a performance standard were adopted by FRA, penalties might be assessed based upon actual performance by the railroad. Such a penalty would increase geometrically for each percentage point below the 99-percent performance level,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> $1,000 penalty assessment for performance at the 98-percent level; $3,000 penalty assessment for performance at the 97-percent level; $9,000 penalty assessment for performance at the 96-percent level, etc. Please comment on this sliding-scale approach. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) FRA has determined that a 100-percent verification of reporting for a major railroad is not practicable given the size of its current work force. Even 100-percent verification at a small facility might not be feasible. What is the minimum sample size that would be required before a performance standard should be applied? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The Association of American Railroads (AAR) acknowledged and agreed that most of its members already have internal control plans in place. Please describe these plans in detail. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) If FRA determines that a written internal control plan is in fact necessary, how would you modify the existing proposal? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Should the regulation indicate that the internal control plan be continuously updated and maintained? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Magnetic Media Submissions (Proposed Section 225.37) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule allows railroads the option of reporting data by way of magnetic media in lieu of paper forms. Please refer to proposed &sect;225.37. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Would substitute forms be acceptable for verification when a railroad submits magnetic media? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) What would be the railroad cost differentials for developing a new computer format or modifying an existing one? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Should ``railroad-designed formats'' for the various reporting forms be allowed? How would this be accomplished? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Definitions (Proposed Section 225.5) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FRA proposed several new definitions in &sect;225.5. Those new definitions warranting further discussion are listed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. ``Worker on Duty'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FRA proposed that a ``worker on duty'' be defined to include individuals who receive monetary compensation from the reporting railroad, or who are engaged in either (1) the operation of on-track equipment or (2) any other rail safety-sensitive function for reporting railroad as described in &sect;209.303. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, a ``volunteer'' would be sort of service for the reporting railroad without receiving direct monetary compensation from that railroad and are not engaged in either (1) the operation of on-track equipment or (2) any other rail safety-sensitive function for the reporting railroad as described in &sect;209.303. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

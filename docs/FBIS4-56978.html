			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, Army Commander General Nicolas de Bari  Hermoza Rios said relations between the Armed Forces and the  International Red Cross are "cordial," and that this  humanitarian organization "will be able to enter the theater of  operations in Huanuco when progress is made in the actions being  taken."    Gen. de Bari Hermoza, Army commander and president of the  Armed Forces Joint Command, made this comment after holding a  one and a half hour meeting with George Conmino, head of the  International Red Cross in Peru. The meeting was held from 1030  to 1155 in General Hermoza's office in the Army General  Headquarters in San Borja. After the meeting, Hermoza answered  questions from reporters:    [Reporter] General, what issues did you discuss with the  head  of the International Red Cross in Peru?    [Hermoza] The head of the International Red Cross just came  to visit. The visit was of the kind frequently made by this  organization to the Army. The conversation was very cordial,  and we recognize the important humanitarian work done by this  organization.    [Reporter] Did the president of the Red Cross ask you to  facilitate a visit to the zone in conflict?    [Hermoza] We always do everything we can to help the Red  Cross fulfill its mission. In the last two years, we have  granted 55 authorizations to its members to help them fulfill  their tasks in the country in visiting garrisons, police posts,  and in meeting with people under arrest. We have facilitated  all manner of things. The government even authorized them to  enter a number of prisons where terrorists are serving their  sentences.    [Reporter] Will the Armed Forces Joint Command be able to  guarantee their visit to the theater of countersubversive  operations in the Leoncio Prado Province, Huanuco?    [Hermoza] They have no restrictions. What worries me is  their security in the areas where the Army is clashing with  subversives. At any other time, there would not have been any  restrictions. But as the operations develop, they will be able  to enter the zone.    [Reporter] But they want to visit the site where the clashes  are taking place to verify if human right violations are  occurring.    [Hermoza] They did not state the need to enter the conflict  zone, for obvious reasons. Also, for security reasons they  cannot enter, for the time being.    [Reporter] The chief of the Huallaga Front, Antonio  Rodriguez  Riveros, questioned the work of the Red Cross and said they leak  "information" to the terrorist "commands."    [Hermoza] There is no evidence of infiltration or leaks. The  interviews are granted according to the situation in the area of  conflict.    [Reporter] What is the current situation in the Cuchara  "pocket" in Huanuco?    [Hermoza] An evaluation was made and the Huallaga Front  chief  reported it. Some policemen were wounded. Some of them were  evacuated to Lima yesterday.    [Reporter] What do you think of the proposal made by  Congressman Chirinos Soto that you remain as Army general  commander?    [Hermoza] I am thankful to Chirinos for his proposal. I  would like to tell the people, the media, that the soldiers and  policemen, beginning with their commanders, are the ones who  should receive permanent recognition. It is worth noting the  greatness with which they risk their lives and continue to fight  for the pacification of the country every day. A commander  needs only to fight by the side of his soldiers to carry out the  strategy ordered by the president of the Republic, who is really  the person leading us toward victory.    [Reporter] What is the human rights situation in the zones  where the clashes between the Army and the terrorists are taking  place?    [Hermoza] There are no violations. The Congressional Human  Rights Commission and the attorney general have gone to Huanuco.  The attorney general even appointed a special prosecutor. Any  investigation falls in the legal field. We have direct and  smooth communications with the International Red Cross. I would  like to say that human rights are a strategic need contained in  all the guidelines of the president of the Republic and of  national pacification.</p>

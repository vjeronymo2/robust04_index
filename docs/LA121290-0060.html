			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> TALLIS SCHOLARS IN PRISTINE FORM  </P> <P> For sophisticated seasonal joy, it would be hard to beat the concert by the  Tallis Scholars Sunday evening. The British vocal group offered an unhackneyed  gathering of high Renaissance glories for a large Chamber Music in Historic  Sites audience, thoroughly packing Westminster Presbyterian Church in Pasadena.  </P> <P> The program began with Palestrina, "Hodie Christus natus est," and the  sweepingly lyrical Mass "Ut re mi fa sol la." The motet emerged dry and rather  slow, but the 10 singers proved in perfect accord with the gentle, generous  music of the Mass, pristine in production and blend.  </P> <P> Interpretively, director Peter Phillips is an unexceptional centrist. That's  not surprising, considering that over the past decade his much-recorded and  well-traveled Tallis Scholars have indeed become the performance mainstream in  Renaissance sacred choral music. Singing one or two to a part, the Tallis  Scholars concentrate on unified textures, pure sound, supple lines and textual  point.  </P> <P> Phillips does not favor tempo extremes, but maintains momentum and direction  easily. He responds urgently to the demands of the word setting, and  distinguishes clearly between individual styles.  </P> <P> That was readily apparent on the second half, which opened with highly  contrasting settings of "Rorate caeli" by Francisco Guerrero, Jacob Handl and  William Byrd. The smooth, sublimated intensity of the Guerrero became an almost  shouted demand in the Handl, and settled into characteristic dark mystery for  the Byrd.  </P> <P> The Scholars' sensitivity to word-painting was demonstrated throughout, but  most obviously in the long narrative motet "Cum natus esset Iesus" by Orlande  de Lassus. Richly varied singing -- still maintaining the miracle of completely  independent linear nuance within complete ensemble integrity -- projected the  stylized drama of the visit of the Magi.  </P> <P> Settings of "O magnum mysterium" by Byrd and Palestrina, and short pieces by  Heinrich Isaac -- the disconcertingly odd "Ecce Virgo concipiet," a stylistic  and chronological loner on the program -- and Hans Hassler completed the  evening.

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Army lifts Kashmir siege: Peaceful end to month-long crisis THE Indian army lifted its month-long siege of Kashmir's holiest shrine early yesterday after armed separatists 'surrendered' to the state police, following a negotiated settlement. Officials said 65 people, including an unspecified number of militants, left the marble buildings of Srinagar's Hazratbal shrine in two groups between 1am and 2.30 am. Brigadier S P S Kanwar said the government had instructed the army not to interrogate the people who left the marble buildings of the shrine. 'We noted down their names but we did not screen them nor have we interrogated them as per the agreement,' Brig Kanwar said. The militants' demand to be interrogated by local police rather than the army had been a considerable obstacle to ending the standoff, Kashmiri politicians close to the guerrillas say. Brig Kanwar's remarks were at variance with Indian Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao, who said earlier there had been no compromise with the militants. The siege has exacerbated a four-year-old uprising against Indian rule in the Himayalan state, the only Moslem-majority region in mainly Hindu India. However, life in Srinagar and many parts of the valley remained disrupted yesterday, as militants refused to call off a strike imposed two weeks ago to protest against the siege of Hazratbal. Hundreds of men, women and children tried to break the army cordon to enter the shrine, considered sacred because it houses a holy relic believed to be a hair of the Prophet Mohammed's beard. Leaders of the all-party Huriyat Conference, a powerful organisation representing militant groups, held an emergency meeting last night, and said that members of the Moslem clergy had been called in to verify the authenticity of the relic. In 1963 when the hair disappeared for almost two weeks, thousands of Kashmiris marched through Srinagar.</p>

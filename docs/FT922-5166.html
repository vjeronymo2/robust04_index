			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Celestion Audio and Kef both sold to SE Asian Kinergetics TWO OF the most famous names in British hi-fi were sold yesterday to a south-east Asian-controlled company. Celestion Audio was sold by its parent, Celestion, for Pounds 4.7m including Pounds 1.6m of debt and Pounds 500,000 of goodwill. The new owner is Kinergetics Holdings (UK), 50 per cent held by a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Gold Peak Industries with the remainder divided between Kinergetics Research, a US audio maker (with 40 per cent) and PL Banner and Associates, a UK venture capital company. Kinergetics Holdings also bought Kef Audio, the loudspeaker manufacturer, from the receiver yesterday. The price was not disclosed. Mr Paul Banner, Kinergetics Holdings chairman, said: 'These are old English brand names which could have been marketed better in certain parts of the world.' He said there was scope for higher revenues in North America and south-east Asia. Celestion and Kef are among the companies that have maintained the UK's high reputation among specialist hi-fi buyers. The sale leaves Celestion to concentrate on its other businesses in lingerie and swimwear. 'In a business the size of ours, we have to focus,' said Mr Charles Ryland, chief executive. 'There is a tremendous opportunity in our textiles business, primarily with Marks and Spencer.' The deal will cut gearing from a year-end figure of 42 per cent to about 20 per cent, said Mr Ryland. Gearing would be cut in half again by the end of the current year in December. Earnings per share would rise slightly. Mr Ryland said that the disposal of the audio division was not related to its poor performance last year when it recorded an operating profit of Pounds 76,000 on sales of Pounds 13.6m, compared with Pounds 1.2m on Pounds 15.6m in 1990. Celestion Textiles achieved an operating profit of Pounds 606,000 in 1991 on sales of Pounds 19.8m, down from the previous year's Pounds 1m. Between 85 per cent and 90 per cent of sales are to Marks and Spencer.</p>

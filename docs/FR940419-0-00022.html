			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the PHA's submission, including the certifications, each Field Office is allowed to decide, on its own discretion, whether or not to require the submission, technical review and approval of any further information. In order to expedite processing, the Field Office's Housing Specialist will distribute simultaneously to each of HUD's technical offices (in accordance with the recent reorganization at the Field Office level) the PHA's submission to determine as soon as possible if any technical reviews are necessary. The Field Office is responsible for performing the reviews to assure compliance with applicable requirements and development within the approved development cost limits, while at the same time keeping the number of technical reviews at a minimum. Under this rule, there is a target period of 50 days from the time the PHA indicates it wants to acquire a specific property and when the Field Office approves or rejects the request; after approval notification, the PHA has an additional 10 day target period to close on the property. Properties involving extensive rehabilitation, lead-based paint testing and abatement, historic preservation requirements and/or an uncompleted environmental assessment, may require extension of the target date. The payment of Single Family Property Disposition (SFPD) customary extension fees is considered an eligible public housing development expense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule provides guidance on the factors that a Field Office is to consider in deciding whether or not to require additional submissions for review and approval. The Field Office is to take into account the total development cost of the proposed project, and the management and development capabilities of the PHA, including the PHA's performance rating under the Public Housing Management Assessment Program (PHMAP) at 24 CFR part 901. The Field Office can, at its own discretion, accept all PHA certifications that required compliances will be met, except the environmental assessment; by law, only HUD can certify compliance with 24 CFR part 50. If the Field Office is satisfied with the PHA submission, including its certifications, additional submissions and technical reviews will not be necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These changes to HUD's development review process are a part of the overall effort that the Department is undertaking to promote decentralization. More authority is entrusted to the Field Offices to exercise discretion with respect to the activities of PHAs that they deal with on a close and regular basis. PHAs are themselves empowered to act without the prior approval of the Assistant Secretary and with the potential for more informal consultations with the Field Office. The end result is anticipated to be a more streamlined and efficient property acquisition process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule further specifies that the limited proposal procedure under &sect;941.404(n) for scattered site properties would also be followed for acquisition of HUD/VA/RTC properties. PHAs may identify such properties to consider for acquisition as described below in the succeeding paragraph. Section 941.404(n) is amended to include these properties within its scope, and to include the list of certifications discussed above. The unnumbered closing paragraph of &sect;941.404(n) is revised to reflect the Department's streamlined review procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Purchase of HUD-Owned Properties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

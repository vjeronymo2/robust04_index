			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Clinton warns of unstable Europe: US seeks early accord with EC states on tougher measures against Bosnian Serbs PRESIDENT Bill Clinton of the US yesterday warned that the Bosnian Serb assembly's rejection of an international peace plan for Bosnia, in defiance of possible air strikes by the US and its allies, threatened the stability of Europe. He expressed his 'great disappointment' at the assembly's decision, adopted by an overwhelming majority of 51 votes to 2 with 12 abstentions early today and called on the international community 'to unite and to act decisively.' The president said he had instructed Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, to be 'insistent' during his current tour of European capitals that tougher and collective measures be agreed soon. Mr Christopher vowed to concentrate efforts to end the war exclusively on punitive measures against the Serbs and said he was no longer pursuing a United Nations peace plan. Speaking in Bonn after meeting German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, Mr Christopher said the failure of the Bosnian Serb parliament to back the peace plan meant that option was now closed. The White House later said that a new UN Security Council Resolution would be required if further action in the form of air strikes or other military measures were to be taken. Meanwhile, the Security Council held urgent consultations in an atmosphere of deepening crisis as members weighed the various options in response to the Bosnian Serb assembly's rejection of the peace plan. As a first response, the Council was expected to approve a resolution designating Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, and the Moslem enclaves of Zepa, Gorazde and Tuzla, as 'safe areas' which would be patrolled and, if necessary defended, by UN troops. Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian Moslem foreign minister, claimed in Washington yesterday that 40,000 people would be 'massacred' in the besieged town of Zepa if the international community did not intervene in Bosnia's civil war. Bosnian Serb forces have refused to allow a team of five UN military observers to visit Zepa to investigate Bosnian government charges that a full-scale Serbian assault had been launched. Serbia last night announced it would cease all but humanitarian supplies to Bosnian Serbs. 'Reasons no longer exist for further assistance in money, fuel, raw materials etc,' the Serbian government said in a statement carried by the Belgrade-based news agency Tanjug. Earlier Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Lord Owen urged Serbia to seal its border with Bosnia, thus depriving the Bosnian Serbs of further weapons and other supplies. In spite of their shared anger at the Bosnian Serb assembly's decision, Mr Christopher and European Community ministers were unable to reach agreement on how best to step up pressure on the Bosnian Serbs at a meeting in Brussels. Both sides insisted on the need for a united response and left open all military options. But there were differences in emphasis that may require until next week to sort out. Britain and France, in particular, strongly oppose any lifting of the international embargo on arms sales to Bosnia and also have reservations about air strikes against Bosnian Serb supply lines, although they have not ruled them out as a last resort. The EC countries' position was broadly summed up by Lord Owen, the Community's mediator, who described the Bosnian Serb assembly's decision as 'a dangerous folly', but cautioned against hasty military action. 'It is a matter of pressure, relentless pressure. Do not rush in with bombs,' he said, although conceding that the time for military measures had been brought a step closer. He insisted that the Serbian leader had the power to reverse the decision by depriving the Serb military of essential arms and other supplies.

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Phoenix Timber gives details of Pounds 3m refinancing plan Shares in Phoenix Timber fell 1 1/2 p to 12 1/2 p after announcing further details of its refinancing under which it is raising Pounds 2.94m to cut borrowings. The Co-operation Retirement Benefit Fund has already subscribed Pounds 1.44m in Pounds 1 loans at par. These are now being offered to existing shareholders on the basis of Pounds 1 nominal for 10 shares held at a price of 111p each. Some Pounds 1.5m is being raised by a rights issue of 5-for-8 and 125 for Pounds 16 nominal loan notes at 8p per share. The issue is underwritten by CRBF. At the same time the 25p shares are being split into 5p ordinary and 20p deferred which are considered valueless. As a result of the moves CRBF may end up with more than 30 per cent but the Takeover Panel has waived the need to make a full offer. Mr John Bushell, Mr Charles Benham and Mr Robert Ainsworth are leaving the board. Mr Duncan Saville, who is a director of CRBF, and Mr Lars Ahrell are to become directors. CRBF said that it considered its investment to be long term and it intends to maintain the listing.</p>

			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Fears of capital controls EUROPEAN exchange rate movements were comparatively calm yesterday because of the mid-August holiday in some centres, but several currency analysts spoke of concern about the prospect of capital controls being introduced on the Continent, writes James Blitz. The French franc weakened by about a centime at the start of yesterday's trading, piercing the FFr3.54 level to the D-Mark. It closed at FFr3.544. The Danish krone was relatively calm, ending at DKr4.1311 per D-Mark, having been at DKr4.1566 earlier in the day. In spite of the thin trading in European currencies, some analysts said they had been deluged with calls from US and Asian customers who were concerned about the prospect of capital controls being reintroduced in France. They said alarm had been raised by President Mitterrand's comments at the weekend, talking about the need to fight 'plots of money'. This followed remarks last week from the French and Belgian governments about the need to control capital flows. One analyst said yesterday: 'I can never remember a time when I have received so many calls in one day on a single issue.' Mr Steve Hannah, chief economist at IBJ International in London, said the reimposition of capital controls was extremely unlikely. But the move, he said, would bring such a strong downturn in European asset markets that investors might hedge their positions in any case. Sterling performed quite strongly against the D-Mark, gaining  1/2 pfennig at DM2.5025. The pound has lost about 2 percentage points on its trade weighted index in the last week amid speculation that the UK would cut interest rates. But, according to an analyst, a 1 percentage point cut in UK interest rates has now been fully priced into the market. The dollar weakened sharply against the D-Mark yesterday afternoon in Europe, dropping at one stage to a low of DM1.6845. It closed in London at DM1.6865, nearly 2 1/2 pfennigs down on the day. In New York it ended at DM1.6869. Some dealers were mystified by the move, coming after July's industrial output figures which showed an expected monthly rise of 0.4 per cent. Others said it was a delayed reaction to the dollar's weakness against the yen, which continued yesterday. In spite of heavy intervention by the Bank of Japan, the yen climbed to a new post-war high of Y100.80 against the dollar at the start of European trading. It slipped back to close at Y101.05, but there was little doubt that the Japanese currency would reach the Y100 level before too long. In New York it finished at Y101.57. Some analysts expressed surprise that the yen was climbing so far in spite of talk of a cut in the Japanese discount rate and lethargic economic activity. In the past week, Japanese call money has fallen to 3 1/16 per cent from 3 1/4 per cent.</p>

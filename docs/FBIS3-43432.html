Also last week, there were reports of Cameroon  gendarmes crossing into Nigeria and raiding villages. Now the  Cameroon Foreign Ministry says about 500 Nigerian soldiers have  landed on two islands in the Gulf of Guinea and have been  occupying them since Monday [3 January]. The two Islands,  Diamond and Jabane Islands, are officially Cameroonian  territory. On the line to Yaounde, Herbert Saleh asked  Cameroon's deputy foreign minister, Francis Nkwain, what he  thought the Nigerian soldiers were up to:    [Begin recording] [Nkwain] You know that we have a very long  border with Nigeria, from Lake Chad to the Atlantic. But this  area which is close to the sea has been giving some problems for  obvious reasons. It is a fishing ground and also beneath the  water there we have a little bit of petrol. Things like that  might be exciting the people. So we do not know because we have  been discussing all these. So what we did was to register our  protest in the normal way and in the spirit of good  neighborliness.    [Saleh] You said you registered your protest. What have the  Nigerians done? Have they responded?    [Nkwain] No, that is what I am saying that we registered our  protest the day before yesterday by issuing the usual note to  the Nigerian ambassador and he sent it home. And the reaction  to it is that the foreign minister of Nigeria accompanied by the  minister of industry are to arrive today with a message from  President Abacha to President Biya.    [Saleh] So they are coming to resolve the issue?    [Nkwain] I think so.    [Saleh] So what can you tell us about the two islands which  you say are occupied now by the Nigerian troops. Who lives  there?    [Nkwain] The two Islands concerned are Jabane. One is  called Jabane and the other one is called Diamond. They are  islands on which some fishermen live but the fishermen are of  the Ibidip. That is they are of Nigerian origin. They have  always lived there. You know that this area is part of Alaja  area that was southern Cameroon. And that is before our  independence and it was treated as Nigeria and so anybody could  live anywhere. But after the new maps were drawn, the people  continued to live where they were living. And we in Cameroon are  not opposed to their living there. As long as they recognize  that they are living on Cameroon grounds, they can go on doing  whatever they were doing and they will be doing it right into  the future, no problem. But as long as they know that the law  which operates there is Cameroon law. Now and again some of  these actions come up because of pressure from them that they  want to be Nigerians and that they don't want to obey our own  local laws.    [Saleh] I understand that Cameroon has sent troops to the  island. Is that correct?    [Nkwain] No, it is not a question of sending troops to the  island. You cannot hear that there is a strange presence on  your territory and just leave it. So obviously, the troops  which supervise the area will make adequate movements to contain  the situation but I do not think that there has been direct  confrontation so far.    [Saleh] Do you have any idea what the Nigerians might be  doing there now.    [Nkwain] We cannot... [pauses] I cannot say I have any idea.  The report only said that they were landing by ship and by  helicopter. It could be part of an exercise -- a training  exercise. It could be anything. It could also be an act of war.  It could be an act of occupation. But all these, I think, will  only be clearer when we the two sides have examined the  facts.[end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Pshenichnikov] </F>   [Text] Oslo May 25 TASS -- The Norwegian Government has  recently decided to breathe new life into its waning economic  relations with Russia.    ITAR-TASS has learned from trustworthy diplomatic sources  that the Norwegian Government has decided to cancel the strict  rule in trade with Russia, which had been in force so far,  according to which the Russian Government was required to issue  like guarantees in reply to Norwegian financial guarantees to  credits granted for various joint economic ventures. The  Norwegian cabinet of ministers plans to submit for the  parliament's endorsement a proposal not to demand any reply  financial guarantees from Russia. Henceforth, Norwegian  businessmen will trade with their Russian partners relying only  on the guarantees provided by their own country.    On the initiative of the Foreign Ministry, the norwegian  Government plans to ask the parliament for permission to  allocate 500 million krones (almost 68.5 million dollars) to  guarantee the credits that will be granted by Norwegian  companies to East European and CIS nations without any reply  guarantees. Pride of place in this crediting policy is given to  Russia. Moreover, the cabinet will ask for 100 million krones  (13.7 million dollars) for the so- called "losses fund". In  other words, this will be money that one "could lose" if trade  with unreliable partners.    According to various sources, the parliament, most likely,  will not object to this decision.

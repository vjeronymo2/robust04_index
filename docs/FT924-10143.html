			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 100m motorway developments Construction giant TARMAC has been given a Pounds 100m boost by the Department of Transport with a clutch of key motorway contracts. The two largest contracts - worth almost Pounds 80m - call for the widening of busy stretches of the M6 in Cheshire and London's M25. The Pounds 52.5m contract on the M6 includes the construction of a viaduct - almost a mile in length - alongside the Thelwall Viaduct, crossing the Manchester Ship Canal and the River Mersey. Six miles of the M6 will be widened from three to four lanes on the approaches to the viaduct between the M56 and M62 interchanges. Nine bridges will also be built over or under the motorway and a bridge over a railway line will be widened. Work begins later this year and the project will take 3 1/2 years to complete. One of Europe's most congested stretches of road - the five miles of the M25 between the M4 and M40 junctions close to Heathrow airport - is to be widened from three to four lanes. Work on the Pounds 24.5m contract will start early next year and it is expected to take about 12 months to complete. Widening will be kept within the existing M25 boundaries by converting the hard shoulders to traffic lanes and building new hard shoulders. Tarmac has also clinched a Pounds 2.5m contract for repairs and maintenance on the M3 motorway between junctions 4 and 5 near Fleet in Hampshire.</p>

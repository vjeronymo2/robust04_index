			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Ladbroke to unveil return to casinos with results details Ladbroke, the hotels, bookmakers, and DIY group, is expected to announce its return to the UK casino market next week, 15 years after being expelled from the business. The group is believed to be planning to announce the acquisition of three London casinos for about Pounds 50m when it reveals its interim results on Thursday. The purchase has been the subject of some speculation, with uncertainty over approval from the Gaming Board of Ladbroke's fitness to run casinos. The company was forced to give up its casinos in 1979 after allegations of malpractice over its attempts to win business. One industry source said he would be 'astonished' if the acquisition was not unveiled on Thursday, adding that that the company would be 'stupid' to go ahead with the acquisition unless it was confident it could get gaming board approval. Changes in the law since 1979 could work in Ladbroke's favour. Previously, companies would be licensed. Now, however, individuals are licensed. The retirement earlier this year of Mr Cyril Stein, chairman at the time of the expulsion, leaves Ladbroke with a new management to apply for licenses. Ladbroke is understood to be in discussions with leisure operator, Mr Trevor Hemmings, over the exact price for his City Clubs group. It is expected to pay at least Pounds 50m for the up-market Maximes, middle-market Golden Horseshoe, and the popular Charlie Chester's casinos. Analysts said this appeared to be a high price for a company with sales of about Pounds 100m and pre-tax profits estimated at Pounds 5m. However, the acquisition was merely a means to an end, said one analyst: 'I have been expecting Ladbroke to overpay for a London casino for some time.' Ladbroke's ambitions to expand in the growing international casino market could be hindered by its chequered past. Returning to the UK market, where the gaming regulations are seen to be strict would give the group credibility abroad. Analysts are expecting Ladbroke to post pre-tax profits on Thursday of about Pounds 50m for the first half, against Pounds 62.5m last time.</p>

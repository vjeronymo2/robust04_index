His colleagues appreciated the gesture as a moral act, but  agreed with the view that such a step is totally uncalled for  and even dangerous under the present circumstances, considering  the uneasy situation in the departments of the ministry.    The cabinet heard and approved a report read by the minister  of internal affairs about recently increasing incidents on our  western borders, related to the attempts of private companies to  violate the embargo against former Yugoslavia, especially by  exporting oil products.    Prime Minister Lyuben Berov and three of the cabinet  ministers are scheduled to propose the necessary measures for  increased controls, particularly over officials in charge of  exercising the controls on exports to former Yugoslavia.    At today's session the Council of Ministers decided to  expand  the functions of the Power Engineering Committee.    The exports, imports, and distribution of natural gas are  and  the gradual discontinuation of uranium extraction and partial  processing are already within the committee's competence. An  guideline on determining the 10 categories of agricultural land  in connection with changing their purpose was also adopted at  today's session.    Minister of Health Tancho Gugalov is in charge of the  donation amounting to $520,000 granted by the Japanese  Government for draftng a program on the reorganization of the  health sector.    The government further approved Bulgaria's participation in  the Partnership for Peace Program by special resolution based on  a report submitted by Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov and  Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov. The cabinet authorized  the signing of the [word indistinct] document proposed by NATO  on the subject. A specially appointed working group is in  charge of drafting specific proposals on our country's  participation in the Partnership for Peace program.    Today the cabinet ministers were obliged to leave the  conference hall for a recess, because of the inspection  following an anonymous call about a bomb being placed in the  Council of Ministers building.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Yeltsin gives reform team power to act RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin yesterday began to fulfil his long-delayed pledge to reconstruct the Russian state and its economy. Claiming victory in Sunday's referendum gave him - and no other - the moral right to act in the peoples' name, he started the process of adopting a new constitution and gave licence to his most radical ministers to initiate financial stabilisation. 'These reforms now have popular protection,' he told a meeting of the representatives of the 89 regions, cities and republics of the Russian Federation - a line repeated by his ministers at a later cabinet meeting. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the deputy prime minister in charge of regional policy, said after the cabinet met that 'the presidency is the first institution of the new Russian state to be legitimised'. Mr Yeltsin invited regional leaders to send two delegates each to what amounts to a constituent assembly at the end of May or beginning of June to adopt a constitution - the draft of which he presented to them at yesterday's meeting. It proposes a presidential republic in which the regions and autonomous republics enjoy wide independence and to which, according to Mr Shakhrai, none of the leaders gathered in the Kremlin offered any principled objection. This method of bringing in a constitution to replace the old, amended, Soviet era law bypasses the existing parliament which was warned yesterday by the president to 'submit to the people's will or to confront the people head on'. In a sign that some of the anti-Yeltsin deputies have taken just such a lesson, Mr Andrei Golovin, head of the centrist Smena (Change) faction said yesterday: 'We are legislators and cannot ignore the obvious fact that the people supported these reforms and expressed confidence in the parliament.' This followed a statement on Wednesday from Mr Nikolai Travkin, a deputy and leader of the Democratic party, to the effect that he would resign because his electors had called for the re-election of parliament - and called for others to do likewise. The cabinet discussion of the first quarter's economic results was an occasion for the reformist ministers - a besieged group before the referendum - to reassert their authority. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy premier in charge of finance, asserted he would not pay for any new social programmes. According to Mr Andrei Illiaronov - the former deputy head of the reformist Centre for Economic Reform, just named as chief adviser to Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister - Mr Fyodorov clashed with Mr Victor Gerashchenko the central bank chairman as the latter refused to accept that the issue of credits caused the high monthly inflation rate, currently between 15-20 per cent. Mr Anders Aslund, the Swedish scholar who is one of the senior foreign advisers to the government, said that, with these views so much at variance with the government 'it would be very strange of (Mr Gerashchenko) were to stay in such an important post'. Mr Sergei Vassiliev, head of the Economic Reform Centre, confirmed that Mr Georgy Khizha, the conservative deputy premier, would be sacked soon and that there would be other changes in the cabinet to favour the reformists.</p>

			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Japan's Political Crisis: 'Salarymen' welcome defeat of party fixers 'IS IT really true? I hope it is,' exclaimed a Tokyo office worker last night after hearing that the vote of no-confidence in the government had been passed by parliament's lower house. 'I'm surprised, but this is the way it should have been,' beamed another middle-aged office worker heading home from the Ginza, the neon-covered night spot in central Tokyo. While most Japanese have been complacent about the behaviour of the country's tightly-knit political sphere, the recent turmoil has managed to grab the attention of the usually apathetic electorate. 'I'm shocked to hear the news, but I don't know who I'll vote for yet,' said student Miss Rieko Kojima, 20. The tax evasion scandal which broke late last year involving Mr Shin Kanemaru, former kingmaker of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, angered ordinary Japanese. Frustration has mounted especially among office workers, who are feeling the effects of the downturn in the economy through cuts in bonuses, overtime pay and who fear the demise of the life-time employment system. Mr Hideo Ichikawa, a 36-year-old office worker, was not shy to hide his anger. 'Of course Mr Miyazawa has to take responsibility. We salarymen are sick of all this.' Mr Susumu Sugisaka, 32, a banker said: 'The LDP are useless. I'll never vote for them again.' However, many voters still doubt that the LDP's power base will crumble. Mr Hisayoshi Yamashita, a taxi driver, does not believe that any party other than the LDP will rule the country, but has voted for the socialist party all his life 'just to keep a balance.' And although many Japanese are turned off by the LDP, there are few realistic alternatives. Even Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former finance minister who was at the centre of yesterday's turmoil, is regarded with some reserve. 'They may seem to be saying different things, but fundamentally they're probably the same,' said Mr Tadamitsu Yamasaki, 55, a doctor. 'Is he really going to bring in change?' asked one office worker, while a brokerage official raised doubts over Mr Hata's partnership with Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a Kanemaru follower turned reformer. And while some office workers, especially after their cups of sake in the Ginza, last night remained as apathetic as ever, others indicated that they may not be too eager to give up the current stability for fundamental political changes. 'As long as the economy doesn't get really bad, I'm happy to vote for the LDP as long as they repent their corrupt ways,' said a 42-year-old real estate agent. Relationships which have been nurtured over the years are also not going to diminish immediately. 'I'm going to vote for the LDP candidate,' said a 62-year-old shop owner. 'I've known and voted for him for 20 years.'</p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> MINEKO GRIMMER'S SCULPTURES AS ENTRANCING AS EVER  </P> <P> In the eye of the storm that was Los Angeles' 1987 art fair, a small sculpture  made of modest, natural materials stopped the glitz-saturated crowd in its  tracks. An oasis of calm formed around the work, a hushed aura that revived the  battered senses of the fair's visitors.  </P> <P> The restorative powers of Mineko Grimmer's work were, perhaps, even bolstered  by the fair's surrounding array of bloated intentions. But it would be hard to  imagine any context in which Grimmer's work wouldn't slow one's breath, relax  one's pace and draw one's undivided attention to the subtleties of sound and  shadow.  </P> <P> "Palisade," Grimmer's current, site-specific installation at the Mesa College  Art Gallery (through June 8), is, characteristically, fully entrancing. As  Grimmer states in the show's accompanying video and catalogue -- both as finely  crafted as the art they describe -- her work is part sculpture, part kinetic  art and part performance. It is a graceful, elegant environment that "performs"  itself, with each moment of its life span distinct and unrepeatable.  </P> <P> In "Palisade," evenly spaced, raw wood beams about 9 feet tall form an  enclosure in the shape of an incomplete circle. Inside the defined space sits a  square, shallow trough of water, framed in wood and surrounded by a carpet of  small, smooth pebbles. Stretching diagonally across the pool, from one corner  to its opposite, Grimmer has suspended two piano wires. Beneath the wires and  aligned perpendicular to them, sits a length of brass rod on a thick wooden  stump.  </P> <P> From waist to shoulder height, slender bamboo rods jut inward from the beams of  the palisade's exterior wall. Each protrudes at a slightly different angle, and  they coalesce in the center as an airy, floating thicket. Just above the  highest of these bamboo rods hangs the heart of the installation, a pyramidal  mass of pebbles and ice, hung with its point downward.  </P> <P> As the block melts, water and stones fall through the bamboo thicket into the  pool below, occasionally hitting one of the wires or the rod along the way.  Each such block lasts four or five hours, and, in the course of each day's  performance, the elements of the installation collaborate with time,  temperature and chance to compose a unique musical score.  </P> <P> Water drips gently over the bamboo, becoming audible only as it joins the  larger pool, and sending ripples to the corners of the trough and reflections  to dance on the palisade walls and gallery ceiling. Single stones tap their way  through the bamboo before their simple splash, sometimes preceded by the  prolonged twang of a piano wire. When a cluster of pebbles releases itself, the  pace intensifies, the rhythm grows more complex and the silence afterward, more  pronounced.  </P> <P> Silence plays as great a role as sound in Grimmer's work, as it does in the  work of composer John Cage, whom she cites as an influence. In both artists'  work, silence is less an empty interlude than a malleable form, one that  quickly becomes charged with anticipation and filled with the ambient sounds of  everyday occurence that, typically, pass unnoticed.  </P> <P> Chance, another mainstay from the shared vocabulary of Cage and Grimmer, guides  "Palisade" with a free, invisible hand. Every day the gallery is open, the  frozen stone mass is replaced, and every few days, the stones that have fallen  into the trough are gathered again, but even following this cyclic maintenance  of the work, no two moments of its life are ever the same, either visually or  aurally. The basic structure of "Palisade" remains a constant, as does the  force of gravity that helps activate it, but the evolving shape and sound of  the work are left to the variables of temperature, humidity and, most of all,  chance.  </P> <P> Random gestures and patterns have appeared with some frequency in the art of  the past century, but even in the work of such worshipers of the chance  occurence as Duchamp or Arp, chance has been more of a medium than a message.  It has been integral to the process of a work's creation, but usually not to  its fixed, finite and static product. In Grimmer's work, chance presides  throughout the entire duration of a work, for the work itself is continually  in-process.  </P> <P> Grimmer's choice of the palisade form, traditionally used for defensive  enclosures, takes on added meaning in light of her work's relationship to  chance. The palisade's wooden stakes embrace an inner realm where chance and  spontaneity reign. They distinguish -- and protect -- this realm from that  beyond, the everyday world of order, control and rational thought.  </P> <P> Visitors to the environment that is "Palisade" tend to stand at the opening of  the circle of posts, on the brink between the two realms, but it is toward the  inner world, that of the delicate spirit and spontaneous soul, that Grimmer  pulls us, rapt and willing.  </P> <P> The formal simplicity of "Palisade" has its own, deep-seated appeal. Grimmer,  born and raised in northern Japan and now living in Los Angeles, respects the  purity and honesty of her raw, organic materials. They are as true to nature as  the cyclic quality of "Palisade," where ice melts into water then is frozen  once again, where stones are gathered together, left to disperse, then gathered  again.  </P> <P> The rich, meditative quality of stones in traditional Japanese gardening  infuses Grimmer's work with an added layer of significance.  </P></p>

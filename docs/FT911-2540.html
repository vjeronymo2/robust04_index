			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Allies ask Kurd guerrillas to let refugees return ALLIED military commanders yesterday urged Kurdish guerrillas not to hinder civilians who wish to return to the town of Zhako where a protected refugee camp has been set up. Maj-Gen Jay Garner of the US army hosted a meeting at his Zakho headquarters with a dozen peshmerga (Kurdish guerrilla) leaders. British, French and Dutch officers also attended. 'Weasked them to come in and discuss the return of their people,' said Maj-Gen Garner. 'A peshmerga checkpoint was refusing to let people return.' Kurdish leaders deny that they have a policy of preventing refugees from leaving the mountains on the Turkish border and going to Zakho, but they acknowledge that they are still concerned about the presence of some 50 Iraqi policemen in the area. President Turgut Ozal of Turkey said it was essential for the allies toremain in northern Iraq to give confidence to the returning Kurds. 'If the allied powers do not maintain their presence in northern Iraq, the Iraqi Kurds will start running again as soon as they see an Iraqi soldier,' he told the Iranian news agency. Mr Erik Suy, the special United Nations envoy, said it would be difficult to reach agreement on a British proposal for a UN police force to replace the allied troops in northern Iraq. 'It is a very beautiful idea,' he said. 'But if the United Nations has to provide sufficient security, they have to be better armed than a policeman. It will be very difficult to get agreement, since we need a decision of the Security Council, and I don't know if there is enough consensus there.' Britain, however, hopes to obtain broad Security Council agreement for its plan without the need for a formal resolution, diplomats said yesterday. Following discussions with representatives of the US and France, which support the initiative, Sir David Hannay, the UK ambassador to the UN, planned to broaden the consultations last night to include the Soviet Union and China. Both of these permanent members are traditionally wary about UN intrusion into a state's domestic affairs. China takes over thecouncil presidency tomorrow under the monthly rotation system. There areprecedents for deploying UN civilian police in trouble spots without the prior adoption of a Security Council resolution, according to UN authorities. They cited Cyprus and Namibia. British officials said it was envisaged that Iraq should pay for the proposed UN police force in the north out of its future oil revenues. A Kuwaiti soldier stops an Iraqi at the Abdali refugee camp on the border with Iraq from boarding a bus on the journey to Iran. Iran will take 2,000 such refugees and many were left behind.</p>

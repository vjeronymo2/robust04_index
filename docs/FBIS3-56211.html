			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 13 TASS -- The first deputies' group  has been registered in the State Duma along with the nine party  factions, under the name, "New Regional Politics". Chairman of  the Oil-Workers Union Vladimir Medvedev is the leader of this  group in the lower chamber of the newly elected Russian  parliament.    Yuriy Voevoda told ITAR-TASS that the group has 65 members.  It consists mainly of representatives of industrial circles  with Medvedev at their head. Former Secretary of the Central  Committee of the Soviet Communist Party Aleksandr Dzasokhov, who  gathered around himself regional representatives, including  those from the North Caucasus, added another twenty or so  members to the group.    So far the group's members are united by the slogan, "Strong  regions - a strong federation". But many of the deputies  interpret this phrase, first voiced by Boris Yeltsin, in  different ways. Some of the deputies think it is their duty to  force the reduction of the percentage of overall income  transferred by local governments to the center down to thirty  per cent.    Voevoda and his allies think that the regions should use  their own resources to solve their internal problems, perhaps by  attracting funds from the international community. The  districts who have free economic zones on their territory, like  the Kaliningrad region and in the Far East, see this option as  being a possibility for their own areas.    It is obvious that State Duma deputies are going to lobby  the  parliament for the interests of their home districts. Voevoda,  for example, intends to use the support of his deputies' group  to enact a law declaring a special status for the Kaliningrad  region, so that the region can become "an object of  international law for the resolution of all its problems without  asking the centre for permission". The Kaliningrad region's  difficult location, which is territorially cut off from Russia  proper, makes it necessary for it to develop its own independent  policies concerning the surrounding states in order to establish  optimal border, transport, and energy systems, Voevoda asserted.    He said that part of the deputies' group intend to have  another look at specific articles of the federal treaty and will  push to make that document an integral part of the Russian  Constitution.    The "New Regional Politics" group can be classified as  centrist. Therefore, the "regionalists'" position will have the  power to seriously influence the adoption of decisions in the  parliament, depending on whether the group aligns itself with  the "left" or the "right" blocs on any given question.</p>

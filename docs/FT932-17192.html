			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (22): Doubts about local processing - Cocoa producers fear a ban or levy on the export of beans ONE OF the most striking indications of the impact of economic reform on the agricultural sector is the surge in cocoa production. The latest estimates put the 1992-3 crop at 135,000 tonnes, which even at today's depressed prices will earn over Dollars 90m, making the commodity the country's largest source of non-oil export earnings. It is nearly twice the level of 1986, the first year of the structural adjustment programme which aimed to reduce dependence on oil wealth and boost agriculture. Despite the falling prices on the world market, prices paid in naira to Nigerian farmers have increased in recent months, as the crop has become a valuable source of scarce foreign currency and a hedge against devaluation of the naira. What concerns producers and exporters, however, is the prospect of a ban or a levy on the export of beans, intended to encourage local processing of the beans and add value to the exported product. Early this year, the government denied that it would impose the export ban, first slated for January 1991; and the anticipated levy of Dollars 250 on exported raw beans did not feature in January's 1993 budget. But the issue has been prominent for four years now, and few people in the business believe that they have heard the last of it. The argument for banning or penalising the export of raw cocoa, and encouraging local processing of cocoa butter, liquor, cake and powder, is that adding value to a raw material export helps to diversify and develop the economy. But the experience of Nigeria so far, and of other processors at origin, suggests that the odds are against success. To compete with the industrialised world, Nigeria and other cocoa producers must overcome the problems they have experienced with processing at origin, such as lack of capital and machinery, transfer of technology, trade barriers, a limited domestic market, and lack of flexibility in blend and quality. World processing at origin peaked in the 1980s, and has now fallen below 30 per cent of world totals. The result of a Dollars 250 per tonne levy at today's prices would be to kill off the export of raw beans, a business which provides direct or indirect employment for 4m people, according to an academic study in the 1980s. It is not clear whether the benefits to Nigeria of cocoa-processing, even it were a success, outweighs the value of exporting raw beans. The value of the processed product is still tied to the world's raw cocoa price, and therefore earnings are just as vulnerable to price fluctuations as the export of beans. Over-supply of cocoa beans in recent years has depressed the world price, and has translated into over-capacity and disappearing margins in processing, even among the biggest and most efficient plants in Europe. The processing industry would not lead automatically to a net gain in foreign currency, because of the costs of importing equipment and technology. While it would encourage some industrial development and the growth of skilled people, it would probably reduce the number of those who are employed throughout the cocoa business, because bulk handling and machinery would cut out some of the labouring jobs, both at source and at the docks. Nigeria's export finance bank, Nexim, has invested Dollars 200m of soft loans in the processing industry, credit which is not available to exporters of raw cocoa. Yet processing in Nigeria has yet to reach 15 per cent of the volume of its cocoa crop. Real productive capacity of cocoa processing is about a quarter of the official total installed capacity, quoted at over 100,000 tonnes. The older factories run far short of installed capacity, because they lack equipment, expertise and the capital to buy beans. Their real combined output is no more than 26,000 tonnes, according to industry analysts, and three new plants coming on stream in the first half of 1993, including the Stanmark factory owned by Cadbury Nigeria, will add a further 38,000 tonnes of real capacity. The prospect of an export ban is not the only factor holding back cocoa production. Cocoa farmers in Nigeria have benefited from deregulation and the abolition of the parastatal marketing board in 1986. They now get the best price for their beans in the world from exporters or their licenced buying agents. Both multinational and local exporters see the potential to expand the country's cocoa-bean exports. If Nigerian farmers improved the quality of their trees by using hybrids, and used fertiliser more efficiently, production would rise significantly, exporters say. But they go on to warn that, as long as they suspect that a ban or a levy on bean exports may be imposed, private investment will be limited.</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'CLOUDS HAVE DISAPPEARED'; JAPAN'S MARKETS EXPECTED TO REGAIN STEAM  </P> <P> Japan's financial markets, overshadowed for months by uncertainty about Emperor  Hirohito's health, are expected to rise this week after his death Saturday,  dealers and traders said.  </P> <P> "The psychological clouds hanging over the markets for months have now  disappeared," said a stock analyst at a major securities house.  </P> <P> The markets have been restrained in recent months on fears of sudden declines  after the emperor's death, he said.  </P> <P> Japan's stock, bond and commodity markets were closed for their half-day  sessions Saturday, but will open for business as usual today along with the  foreign exchange market.  </P> <P> Most stock traders said institutional investors may temporarily refrain from  active trades out of respect for the late emperor.  </P> <P> Some brokers suggested last week that the Tokyo market's 225-share Nikkei  index, which hit a record high of 30,397.51 last Thursday, could fall about 300  points after Hirohito's death.  </P> <P> But after a brief decline in stock prices, the market should rally and rise to  new highs, they said.  </P> <P> "I am more than 100% sure that the market indicator will soon renew its highs  to celebrate the new era," a trader at another brokerage said.  </P> <P> The death of the emperor should boost profits for paper-related companies,  because of the printing of fresh calenders bearing the name of the new imperial  era, which could help their shares.  </P> <P> Foreign exchange dealers said the emperor's death will have little impact on  currency trading in Tokyo today.  </P> <P> "Market operators are not likely to be active on Monday out of respect for the  late emperor, but trading will not be especially limited," one dealer said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CRITICS' PICKS: 'DESPERATE PASSAGE'  </P> <P> In 1986 skipper Lee Stanley took seven inmates from Camp David Gonzales, the  toughest youth camp in California, on a 10-day cruise -- it took him four years  to get the permission to do so -- and then filmed it. The impact of the  excursion on these troubled young men is deeply moving; even more so is the  prologue, in which we find out how they are doing a year later.  Thought-provoking material.  </P> <P> (KTLA Monday at 8 p.m.) Kevin Thomas  </P></p>

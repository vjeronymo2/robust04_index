			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>   [Text] Brussels, May 24 (AFP) -- The Netherlands  criticised France and Britain here Tuesday [24 May] for  threatening to withdraw their troops from Bosnia-Herzegovina, a  Dutch NATO source said.    He quoted Dutch Defence Minister Rebus Ter Beek as saying  that threats of unilateral withdrawal jeopardize the safety of  other nationalities making up the United Nations Protection  Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia.    Ter Beek made his criticism at a meeting of defence  ministers  of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.    German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe said the meeting  expressed agreement that there should be no more unilateral  decisions or statements about troop withdrawals from Bosnia.    The ministers also agreed that any discussions of troop  withdrawals should be conducted in private, and made public in  the media only when final decisions were made.    Ter Beek asked British Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind to  ensure that Britain made no more withdrawal threats.    Last week France, followed by Britain, said it could  withdraw  troops from Bosnia unless there was new progress towards peace  there.    Ter Beek addressed his remarks only at Britain because  France  was not represented at the meeting of defence ministers, not  being a member of NATO's integrated military structure.    But the Dutch source said the criticism was intended equally  for Paris. France has about 6,800 troops in ex-Yugoslavia, and  Britain about 3,000. The Netherlands also has about 3,000  troops in the UNPROFOR force.    Ter Beek also urged a more equitable sharing of UN  peace-keeping costs around the world, saying that the  Netherlands was paying more than its fair share relative to its  size.    He put the Dutch peace-keeping bill, mainly in Bosnia, at  350  million guilders (about $185 million).</p>

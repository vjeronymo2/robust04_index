Asked by a reporter from the Press Agency of  the Slovak Republic why they did not ask for the protection of  the policemen present, Vojtech Bugar said that the policeman  whom he addressed said to him to gather 10,000 policemen and  then he would oblige him.    Apart from slogans in support of Vladimir Meciar and the  government, citizens who gathered in front of the parliament  building chanted various appeals such as: Tomorrow we will take  to the streets.    Approximately 300 people gathered in Primacialni Square in  front of President Kovac's residence tonight, calling on him to  resign.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): First Tec trainee charter announced BIRMINGHAM Training and Enterprise Council will be the first of the 82 Tecs in England and Wales to introduce a trainee charter. This will set out the rights and obligations of those taking part in training programmes. Organisations providing such programmes for the Birmingham Tec will find that agreement to observe the charter is a contractual requirement, a Tec official explained yesterday. Drawing up the charter, the text of which is circulating in Birmingham training circles, is part of a general effort to raise training standards in the city. It is also a response to specific complaints from trainees about standards. This, last year, led Birmingham Tec to cancel contracts with Acafess and Cobalt UK, two local training companies. The text of the charter to be introduced by Birmingham explains that it has been drawn up after talks with trainees. It specifies that each trainee should have a personal training plan agreed with the training organisation. The charter sets out the right to continuous assessment and states that details of the trainees' hours of work, holidays and payments should be given in writing. It makes clear that the training should be undertaken 'by experienced and qualified staff' in 'a safe and properly equipped training and working environment'. In return the trainee, under the terms of the charter, agrees to regular attendance and good timing and accepts the obligation to notify the training organisation in advance of any absence, including that for job interviews. The trainee is expected to show 'responsible behaviour'. A complaints procedure is also built into the charter. First, a trainee should take up any grievance with the training organisation. If this is not met the trainee is advised to contact the Birmingham Tec.</p>

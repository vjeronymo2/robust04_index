			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OPERATOR FINED OVER ODORS AT LANDFILL  </P> <P> The owner of the Bradley Landfill in Sun Valley was ordered Thursday to pay a  $2,450 fine and donate $10,000 to a university after the firm was convicted of  allowing obnoxious odors to be released from the dump last spring.  </P> <P> The sentence was imposed by Municipal Court Commissioner Joseph Spada after the  landfill's owner, Valley Reclamation Co., pleaded no contest to permitting the  illegal odor emissions, Los Angeles City Atty.  </P> <P> James Hahn said.  </P> <P> Valley Reclamation was ordered to donate $10,000 to the UCLA Occupational  Health Center for use in training health technicians about asbestos exposure,  according to Hahn's office, which filed the complaint against the landfill  operator.  </P> <P> The misdemeanor case stemmed from the installation of a gas collection system  at the landfill last May. The city attorney's office said the odors were  released because the operator failed to adequately rebury decaying garbage  unearthed during the digging of trenches for the system.  </P></p>

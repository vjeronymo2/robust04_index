			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The analysis of the current political situation  and preparations of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  [HZDS] for parliamentary and communal elections were the main  points of today's meeting of the National Presidium of the HZDS  in Spisska Nova Ves. More from Pavol Sveton:    [Begin recording] [Sveton] [passage omitted] We have learned  from the press secretary, in the course of the HZDS National  Presidium discussions, that Vladimir Meciar has offered his  resignation from the position of chairman of the HZDS, this  being based on yesterday's developments in the parliament.  However, members of the presidium have expressed their full  confidence in him. At the following press debate, Vladimir  Meciar, among other things, said:    [Meciar] The movement has confirmed that it is entering into  opposition and will not enter into any government coalition that  is now being formed. The movement is dissatisfied with the  president's activities, with the method he has of carrying out  his duties, and with the way he has damaged the interests of the  state and the good name of the Slovak Government. At the same  time, the movement expresses its concern about the internal  situation, among the citizens and elsewhere in that the stage is  becoming more fragmented rather than consolidated. Can you  imagine the big fight that is about to start, for example, in  connection with who will propose the prime minister? Peter  Weiss [chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left (SDL)]  thinks it will be him and forgot to notice that, behind his  back, a coalition was formed of Milan Knazko [chairman of the  Alliance of Democrats of the Slovak Republic], Ludovit Cernak  [former chairman of the Slovak National Party], and Jan  Carnogursky [chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement],  which has gotten more votes than Weiss. Problems are arising in  the personnel situation.    In any case, the movement recommends and the government  wants  to apply this recommendation that, after my resignation on 14  March, the whole government will resign. We do not recommend  that members of the government accept the president's request to  continue exercising their duties. The president grossly  offended members of this government by accusing them of  corruption. This has spread throughout the world today. He  cannot ask that these people who were so grossly accused and  offended accept such appointments. He alone must bear the  responsibility and consequences. [passage omitted].    Concerning negotiations with other political parties, the  HZDS is of the opinion that the leadership of the SDL,  particularly Weiss and Milan Ftacnik [deputy chairman of the  SDL], is untrustworthy. It broke all agreements that were  prepared for this action. It will take a very long time for the  trust of our parties and movements to return for a resumption of  mutual negotiations, and there is a big question mark over its  ever becoming possible.    I will return to the parliament together with Olga  Keltosova,  minister of labor, social affairs, and the family, and Justice  Minister Katarina Tothova. We shall use all of our capabilities  to become a strong opposition party. [end recording]</p>

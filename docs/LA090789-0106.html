			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRODUCTIVITY RATE REBOUNDS IN QUARTER  </P> <P> American workers posted a modest productivity improvement in the second quarter  of the year with significant gains by factory workers leading the way, the  government said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The Labor Department said productivity in the non-farm portion of the economy  rebounded at a revised annual rate of 0.7% in the April-June period, up from  the 0.2% gain reported in preliminary data last month and much better than the  1.3% decline in the first quarter.  </P> <P> The department said unit labor costs -- a key inflation indicator -- increased  at an annual rate of 4.9% in the quarter, down from the 6.2% jump reported for  the first quarter but nonetheless a sign of persistent underlying inflation.  </P> <P> Analysts said the small productivity gain was consistent with the recent  slowing of the economy's growth rate.  </P> <P> But they said poor performance in the non-financial corporate sector -- a  category including most service industries, in which productivity fell and  labor costs rose at a rapid 11.1% annual rate -- suggested that inflation was  still around.  </P> <P> "The future in overall productivity growth is not encouraging" because the  service-producing sector makes up roughly 80% of the economy, said Allen Sinai,  chief economist for Boston Co. Economic Advisors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Output Increases  </P> <P> "The 0.7% increase is a low number but consistent with the cyclical problems  that typically occur as growth slows down," said economist Roger Brinner of  DRI-McGraw Hill. "Employers are reluctant to trim their work force so that when  the economy downshifts you have to expect a dip in productivity growth."  </P> <P> The second-quarter improvement came as output grew at an annual rate of 2.4%  while hours worked expanded by 1.7%.  </P> <P> Gains in productivity -- output per hours worked -- are seen as vital to  economic growth at times of near full employment and tight labor markets in  skilled jobs.  </P> <P> Improved productivity in manufacturing also helps U.S. competitiveness in world  markets. Workers in manufacturing posted a productivity gain of 2.9% at an  annual rate in the second quarter, up from the 2.4% increase reported in the  preliminary data.  </P> <P> The Labor Department said hourly compensation rose at an annual rate of 5.6% in  the quarter, but consumer inflation continued to more than erase the wage  gains. Real hourly compensation -- hourly compensation minus consumer inflation  -- fell 0.7%, the department said.  </P> <P> The preliminary data had put the hourly compensation increase at an annual rate  of 5.5% and the decline in real wages at 0.9%. In the first quarter, hourly  compensation rose at an annual rate of 4.8% and real wages declined 0.6%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Lean and Mean' Sector  </P> <P> The 2.9% annual rate productivity gain in manufacturing in the second quarter  followed a 2.1% gain in the January-March period. Unit labor costs in  manufacturing fell at an annual rate of 0.4% after increasing at an annual rate  of 1.0% in the first quarter.  </P> <P> "We have a lean and mean manufacturing sector," said Sinai. "This is really  something to cheer about in the continued strong performance in productivity  and cost control in the manufacturing sector."  </P> <P> The second-quarter manufacturing gain came as output rose at an annual rate of  2.9%. The number of hours worked held steady after rising at an annual rate of  1.1% in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Factory workers saw their real wages fall at an annual rate of 3.7% in the  second quarter, with inflation stripping away an increase of 2.4%, at an annual  rate, in hourly compensation in manufacturing, the Labor Department said.  </P> <P> A separate figure that includes the farm sector of the economy showed that  productivity rose at an annual rate of 1.3%, as output climbed 1.9% while hours  worked rose by 0.6%. The report attributed that gain to improved productivity  by farm workers.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP WEEKEND;  </P> <P> CAMEO FLOUNDERS, FINDS GROOVE, ROCKS THE HOUSE  </P> <P> Friday night at the Celebrity Theatre was shaping up about as well for Cameo as  Super Bowl Sundays have for the Denver Broncos.  </P> <P> Nathan Leftenant, one of the veteran funk band's core trio of singers, was out  sick, leaving the remaining 11 members to face a sea of empty orange chair  backs in a 2,500-seat hall that looked at least two-thirds empty. Cameo hit the  stage and spent 20 minutes wandering through a grooveless desert marked by a  whanging metallic guitar solo, a muscle-bound drum solo, and song snippets too  meager to establish a firm, funky direction. The singing sounded pretty iffy,  too. The fans, meanwhile, sat on their hands.  </P> <P> At this point, a lot of bands would have decided it was time to turn in a real  cameo job and hurry through the motions to end the misery. But a band doesn't  last 13 years, as Cameo has, without having a certain amount of gumption. In a  fine show of leadership, Cameo's strapping, muscular, Gorgon-haired main man,  Larry Blackmon, broke the band down to the basic elements of funk -- a  hammering drum beat and booming bass -- and rallied the fans to their feet.  </P> <P> Blackmon had come off as something less than sincere early on when he greeted  the dormant audience by saying: "Thank you for having us, we're enjoying every  minute of it." Manners count, Larry, but it's obvious that any host who throws  an under-attended party is going to feel less than ecstatic. In what ought to  be a great lesson to showmen and politicians everywhere, Blackmon won the fans  over and jump-started the party by leveling with them.  </P> <P> "There's only a few of us in here, but it's as if the whole place is filled, as  far as we're concerned," he said -- then backed up his words with charging  energy as he exhorted the crowd with the help of a hard-core beat. With the  fans up and dancing, Cameo stretched out the number, "Back and Forth," and  firmly established the long-absent groove.  </P> <P> The elements came together from there. A few more tough funk numbers dug the  foundation deeper. Then Cameo was free to slow the pace a bit. "She's Strange,"  mysterious yet still funky, was a nice departure. So was a ballad turn by guest  vocalist William Morris. Morris provided the touch of melismatic pop-soul bel  canto one doesn't get from Blackmon or his co-vocalist, Tomi Jenkins  (Blackmon's idiosyncratic nasal twang sounds like a cross between John Lee  Hooker going "how how how" and Sly Stone drawling into his vocoder).  </P> <P> The second half of the 75-minute show did feature some nice ensemble vocal  work, as well as many of the catchy little synthesizer hooks that are a Cameo  trademark. Drummer Buster Marberry's bludgeoning approach was ill-suited to  some songs that called for subtlety, but he was perfect for the all-out funk of  the show-closing hits, "Word Up" and "I Want It Now." Aaron Mills' bass thumped  with such a convincing percussive thud that he might have been shooting mortar  shells rather than notes, and every man in the lineup showed a willingness to  embody the funk as well as play it -- especially Charlie Singleton, the lanky,  rock-oriented guitarist whose black paramilitary garb made him look like a  deserter from Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation army.  </P> <P> On its records, craftsmanship, rather than inspired songwriting, has made Cameo  a reliably strong-selling act. This show underscored another attribute that has  allowed it to keep a high-ranking spot in R &amp; B: a determined work ethic  and a desire to rock the house under any circumstance.  </P></p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Commercial lease reform is urged CHANGES in the law governing the renewal of business leases to reflect the state of the commercial property market were called for yesterday by the Law Commission, the government's standing body on law reform. The commission put forward proposals to improve the workings of part two of the 1954 Landlord and Tenant Act which gives business tenants the right to renew the leases of the premises they occupy. The commission recommends that tenants should no longer have to launch routine court proceedings simply to safeguard their renewal rights. The present procedure lays down a tight timetable for lease renewals. Unless a new lease is agreed within four months of the notice bringing the current lease to an end, the tenant must start court proceedings or lose his renewal rights. Court applications are made in a large number of cases, then withdrawn when the parties subsequently reach agreement. More than 20,000 applications were made in county courts last year, but only 20 per cent went through to final judgment. The commission says that this waste of time and money could be avoided by allowing landlords and tenants to agree extensions of the negotiating period. Landlords at present can apply to the court for the rent to be increased during protracted renewal negotiations, but tenants have no right to ask for a revised rent even if the market level has fallen. The commission wants tenants to have equal rights to allow the legislation to respond to a market in which rents have dropped sharply. In return, however, tenants should no longer be entitled to a discount on interim rent where the eventual renewal of a lease is not in doubt. Mr Trevor Aldridge, QC, a law commissioner, said the recession made the 1954 act even more important. 'There is strong pressure in the market for shorter leases of commercial property,' he said. 'This means there will be more renewals under the present procedures. The changes will save time and money.' Business Tenancies, Law Com No 208. HMSO. Pounds 13.10.</p>

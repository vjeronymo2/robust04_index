			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Labour floats plan for recovery partnership IN the document Making Britain's Future, Labour proposes a wide-ranging and radical programme of change as the basis for addressing the decline in the industrial base through partnership between the government and industry. These are the main proposals and questions on which Labour will be consulting over the next 12 months: New commercial structures How can stakeholders in a company such as employees best be represented in its governance? What is the best balance of power between executive and non-executive directors? Should the UK follow the model of the European two-tier board structure, where an executive board responsible for management is accountable to a supervisory board representing stakeholders? There should be incentives for longer-term equity ownership, including a review of the tax regime. The law on takeovers should be reformed 'to improve the stability of industrial companies and to reduce the diversion of funds into acquisition rather than investment'. The burden of proof should be on the predator company to show that a hostile takeover is in the national interest. Bankruptcy law needs overhauling. What lessons can be learned from the US system of filing for protection against creditors forcing closure? There should be an inquiry into auditing standards and accountancy conventions. Research and development should be treated as capital investment rather than revenue spending. An investment drive Could building societies have a role in mobilising savings for investment in industry as well as property? An industrial investment unit should be set up at the Department of Trade and Industry. Pension fund law should be reformed to provide greater accountability of managers to trustees. What changes in the law would facilitate greater investment by pension funds in productive capacity in Britain? How could they develop portfolios that contained more direct investment in British industry? Should capital allowances be used to encourage backing for long-term investment and product development? Could investment in research be increased by enhancing the existing allowances with tax credits? What new institutions are needed to promote more direct investment in industry and bridge the investment gaps left by banks? How can private-sector finance be attracted in to public-sector projects to strengthen the infrastructure? A training levy should be imposed on companies which do not invest in skills. Strength to the regions There should be a network of regional development agencies to support local companies and co-ordinate inward investment. How could banks and financial institutions develop decision centres at regional level with real freedom to work with regional agencies? Should agencies be able to float their own bonds? Getting government backing There should be a statement on how new policy affects industry. Within the European Community, Britain must resist the transfer of resources away from research and development, transport and infrastructure to agriculture. Greater use should be made of the European Investment Bank.</p>

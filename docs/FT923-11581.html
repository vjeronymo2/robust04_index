			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Honecker may return soon Mr Erich Honecker, the former East German leader, may soon be returned to Germany, where he faces arrest on charges associated with 49 deaths on the former East-West German frontier, writes Christopher Parkes in Bonn. Chancellor Helmut Kohl said there had been 'visible movement' and that a solution could be found soon, but he could not say when Mr Honecker might be sent back from Moscow. The former communist chief fled to Moscow in March, 1991, and was given sanctuary in the Chilean embassy there last December. The German Foreign Ministry said talks between the Chilean and Russian governments had reached the point where there were signs of a solution. Mr Honecker's lawyer said reports that he could be expelled this weekend were 'bare-faced lies.' Mr Honecker would not leave of his own free will, he added.</p>

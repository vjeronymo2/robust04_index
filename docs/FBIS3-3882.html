The Japanese are here to discuss Japan's reparations to  Taiwan soldiers drafted by the Japanese Government to fight  abroad during World War II, when Taiwan was still under the  Japanese occupation.    Big differences remain between the two sides, with the  Japanese side only willing to discuss six issues, including the  amount of the soldiers' back salaries, their bank deposits, and  insurance payments still due them, Liu said after the meeting.    Given that the Japanese Government has said it would  compensate only 20 times the face value of the bank deposits,  and the Taiwan side is demanding a 7,000-fold return, more  rounds of talks will be needed to bridge the huge gap, Liu said.</p>

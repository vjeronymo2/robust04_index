			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian  Democratic Union) welcomed his Ukrainian counterpart Vitaliy  Radetsky at the Defense Ministry with military honors this  morning. Radetsky has started a three-day visit of the  Bundeswehr in Germany. He wants to continue the dialogue on  security policy that Ruehe initiated with a visit to Ukraine  last year. At the time, the two ministers signed an agreement  on military cooperation between the Ukrainian and German Armed  Forces.    Immediately after the welcoming ceremony, the ministers  began  their exchange of views on the continuation of the contacts.  They also discussed the development of a European security  structure and cooperation between Kiev and NATO. Ukraine  belongs to the 14 East European countries that have voted in  favor of close military and political cooperation with the  Western alliance as a result of the NATO initiative Partnership  for Peace. In the next few days, Radetsky will also visit  Bundeswehr units in Nirvenich and Hemer.</p>

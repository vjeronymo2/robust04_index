			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / RAF will scrap three squadrons in Germany THREE squadrons of frontline RAF jets based in Germany are to be scrapped and a further squadron redeployed to Britain, the Ministry of Defence announced yesterday. The decision will reduce the number of operational strike Tornado GR1s by about 36. All four squadrons are based at RAF Laarbruch. The cuts come on top of government plans under the defence review, Options for Change, to close two of the four RAF bases in Germany. Options for Change also proposed reducing the number of Tornado GR1 squadrons with nuclear and conventional roles in Europe from 11 to six. The ministry said the cuts would pave the way for re-deployment to RAF Laarbruch of Harrier jets and support helicopter units now based at RAF Gutersloh.</p>

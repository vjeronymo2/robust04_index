			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: Pernod Ricard up 30% to FFr389m PERNOD-Ricard, the French drinks group, mustered a 30 per cent increase in net profits to FFr389m (Dollars 81m) during the first half of the year but has cautioned that its growth may be slower in the second half. Mr Patrick Ricard, chairman of the group whose products include Pernod and Orangina, the fizzy fruit drink, described the interim performance as 'very good', but said the economic slowdown in France, as well as the recessions in the UK and US, could affect the group in the second half. However, he stressed that Pernod still expected to meet its target of boosting growth by twice the annual inflation rate - now at 3 per cent in France - for the full year. A strong performance from Orangina was a key catalyst of Pernod's growth in the interim period. Consolidated sales fell by 3.5 per cent to FFr6.9bn, but sales rose by 9.3 per cent on a comparable basis. Operating profits rose 11.6 per cent to FFr651m over the first six months of 1991, when the group was hit by the disruption caused by the Gulf War.</p>

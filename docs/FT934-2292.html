			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / SPD-union plan for chemicals Germany's embattled chemical industry, facing soaring costs from tough environmental legislation, was yesterday offered a new plan to secure its long-term future. The opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the 800,000-strong chemical workers' union, IG Chemie, published a joint paper seeking to reconcile the demands of strict environmental controls with the need to preserve jobs in the sector. Key recommendations include the simplification of environmental legislation, acceleration of planning procedures to speed up the introduction of environmentally-friendly products, and a clear timetable for the introduction of tougher rules on the avoidance and disposal of harmful waste products. At the same time, the SPD remains firmly committed to tougher environmental controls, including the use of criminal legislation to prosecute offenders. The joint paper, published with top-level support from Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD leader, and Mr Hermann Rappe, leader of IG Chemie, the chemical workers' union, amounts to clear recognition of the unique problems facing the industry because of Germany's strict environmental legislation. The SPD, which is heavily involved in policing the industry through its control of a majority of Germany's 16 federal states, wants to introduce new environmental tax reforms aimed at promoting 'ecological and economic innovation'. IG Chemie is clearly concerned at the employment implications for the industry, and stresses instead the need for a working group involving other groups to define the precise aims of such new tax reforms. Both sides agree that the problems of the German chemical industry are not simply a result of excessive costs arising from the whole range of environmental standards, but rather a reflection of inadequate research and investment in environmentally-friendly techniques. They argue that the German chemical industry will only be able to compete successfully on the international market if it remains at the forefront of environmental technology. But they agree on the need for a reduction of red tape. 'What is required is an increase in transparency, and acceleration of procedures,' they say. 'One aim might be the creation of a single volume of environmental legislation.' They also propose an enquiry to identify the most serious bottlenecks in new investment in the industry.</p>

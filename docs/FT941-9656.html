			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Riding to the future on a Hong Kong Harley: Simon Holberton meets a motor-cyclist from Harvard nicely placed in preparing a colonial transition David Chu was warming to his subject. Looking down from the coffee shop of the sumptuous American Club, atop the 49th floor of Exchange Square in Central, he said: 'See that red car parked there - it's just to the left of it.' He was identifying his custom-made Harley Davidson motor-cycle, for which he had paid nearly USDollars 30,000 (Pounds 20,000) last year. 'I have three Harleys,' said Mr Chu, who describes himself as a 'small property developer'. He was born in Shanghai, educated at Harvard and is a US citizen. He is also one of the most important people in Hong Kong. With 29 other residents of the colony and 27 mainland officials, Mr Chu is a member of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), an elite group appointed last summer by Beijing to prepare for the Chinese takeover of Hong Kong in 1997. 'What the PWC is doing will have profound implications for the government of Hong Kong after 1997,' said Mr Chu. 'Anyone interested in Hong Kong's future should take a look at the PWC.' He has a point. The only formal structure China had designed to manage the last days of British rule is the Preparatory Committee, not due to come into existence until 1996. Its main purpose is to select Hong Kong's chief executive, the governor, and decide who will occupy to the top jobs in the colony's civil service. With the collapse in UK-Chinese co-operation over Hong Kong, Mr Chu says Beijing has been forced to bring forward preparation for the takeover. This was signalled by the formation of the PWC last summer. With the satisfaction of a man who knows he is in the right place at the right time, Mr Chu said: 'We are providing the 'advice' for the Preparatory Committee.' The committee's sub-groups now meet virtually every month in Beijing, while the Hong Kong cohort meets at least as often in the colony. It has divided itself into five sub-groups: political structure, economics, security and social welfare, culture, and law. When Mr Li Peng, China's prime minister, meets Hong Kong advisers at the beginning of next month, another cohort of PWC members might be announced. Its membership is expected to grow, partly to counter the accusation that the current Hong Kong group is made up of plutocrats currying favour with the colony's future landlord, and partly to share the increasing workload. The strategy of the UK's governor, Mr Chris Patten, over the committee has been to question its legitimacy as a body representative of Hong Kong opinion, and to deny its members access to the government and official information. Mr Chu admitted that, without the co-operation of the Hong Kong government, the work of the PWC will be more difficult. He likened the enterprise to flying a Boeing 747 without a pilot: 'We've got to borrow old manuals and interview retired pilots. But I am fully confident that the 747 will take off without problems.' By contrast, while the colony's Legislative Council wrings its collective hands over how to deal with Mr Patten's democracy legislation, the PWC works on its alternative for Hong Kong post-Patten, This includes 'advice' on Hong Kong citizens' travel documents, on the books their children will read in school and on how they will elect representatives to LegCo. LegCo will vote on the first stage of Mr Patten's democracy proposals this month, probably February 23, and is expected to pass them unamended. Mr Patten will then lob his second bill into the unsure hands of the colony's legislators the following month. Meanwhile, the PWC proceeds towards its July deadline for producing an outline of Hong Kong's post-colonial political structure. On this issue, it is fairly clear where the committee is heading. It favours 'proportional' representation for the 20 LegCo seats meant to be popularly elected, and small groups of voters for the 30 'functional' constituencies which are to represent business and professional interests. Mr Patten, though, advocates first-past-the-post elections for the popular poll, and large groups of voters for the functional constituencies. Mr Chu says proportional representation is the 'fairest' way to elect politicians as it would give the 'fullest participation in the colony's politics to individuals and parties'. Mr Patten demurs. Before he left for Australia last week, he said proportional voting was meant to dilute the strength of pro-democracy groups in LegCo. Mr Chu says the aim of the committee is to stay close to the LegCo system which existed before Mr Patten arrived in mid-1992. Pro-democracy advocates such as Mr Martin Lee and Miss Emily Lau fail to understand that, in opposing China, they will achieve nothing, Mr Chu says: 'I believe that, by acting with finesse, we will get a better deal than by opposing Beijing.' He is dismissive of suggestions that the PWC is an exercise in 'united front' tactics by the Chinese Communist party, in spite of the deputy director of the united front department of the party being a mainland member of the PWC. 'Whether China is using united front tactics on me I don't care. I'm concentrating on influencing China so that it does good things for Hong Kong.'</p>

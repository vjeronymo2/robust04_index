			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc rethinks merger Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, could modify the terms of a proposed merger with Institut Merieux, following the suspension of production of a blood product by the vaccines group, the company said. Pasteur Merieux Serums et Vaccins, a division of Institut Merieux, said on Wednesday that it was suspending production of placenta albumin because of a decision by the French health authorities to introduce extra precautions in collecting human placentas, which are used to produce placenta albumin. Pasteur Merieux will take a provision of about FFr100m (Dollars 16.9m) to cover the suspension. As a result, Rhone-Poulenc, which owns 51 per cent of Institut Merieux, will see its net profits reduced by about FFr70m this year. It is expected to report full-year net profits about 30 per cent lower than the FFr1.52bn of 1992. Rhone-Poulenc, which was successfully privatised by the French government last month, said that a decision would be taken by the middle of the month about whether to alter the terms of an agreement to increase its stake in Institut Merieux from 51 per cent to 100 per cent. Under the terms of the agreement, which was announced at the beginning of October, it was to offer minority investors 77 group shares for every five shares in Institut Merieux. At the end of August, Institut Merieux had a market capitalisation of FFr13.2bn.</p>

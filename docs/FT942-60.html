			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Political crosswinds catch Cathay Pacific - Operating problems are putting profit margins under pressure For an airline which is the envy of its peers as one of the few international carriers still making a profit, Cathay Pacific is carrying a lot of troublesome baggage. Its pilots are agitating for more pay. Spiralling costs and growing competition are squeezing returns. And the airline has been caught in a political row between China and Taiwan, resulting in a reduction of flights and forcing Cathay to publicly denounce adverse speculation about its future as Hong Kong's de facto flag carrier. Last month, amid mounting stock market concern about Cathay's role under its present ownership after Hong Kong reverts to Chinese control, Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, took the unusual step of circulating a letter from the chairman of John Swire, largest shareholder of Cathay's owner Swire Pacific, which instructed him to 'kill this fantasy'. There is a growing suspicion among analysts that after 1997 Cathay will have to take on influential Chinese shareholders. At present the airline is controlled by Swire Pacific, a conglomerate whose credentials are impeccably British. Swire Pacific owns 51.8 per cent of Cathay. Citic Pacific, the Hong Kong-listed subsidiary of Beijing's investment agency, has 12.8 per cent: and China Travel Services and China National Aviation Corporation have 5 per cent each. Unfortunately for Cathay, it will take more than an open letter - however strongly worded - to dispel its operating problems. 'The airline industry is such a terrible one to be involved with. There are so many factors that are out of the management's control, and airlines are so susceptible to downturn in demand,' says Mr Gary Baker, research head at Smith New Court in Hong Kong. Cathay is hoping to exercise greater control over wage costs, although inflation and union pressure appear to be eroding its efforts. The threat of industrial action is blinking on the horizon as management attempts to thrash out an agreement with pilots. At issue are pay and productivity. Cathay wants to increase the hours worked by pilots to 700 a year, up from the present 648. Cathay claims it is getting an average of slightly less than 600 hours a year out of its pilots. The pilots are themselves disgruntled, and fighting for more money. The airline's highest paid pilots, with around 20 years' experience, receive packages worth a shade under HKDollars 4m (USDollars 517,000) a year - among the highest in the world - but newcomers, joining on the 'B scale' salaries introduced last April, are earning almost half that of the older hands. The problem with alienating staff - as Cathay found to its cost last year, after 15 days of industrial action shaved some HKDollars 240m off profits - is that in the service sector clients remember surly faces and cynical voices. But the biggest threat to profit margins is spiralling costs. The airline has taken steps to defray operating costs by despatching computer and accounts processing operations to Sydney and Guangzhou. Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, has warned that the airline's financial performance this year is unlikely to be much better than in 1993, when profits fell 23.8 per cent to HKDollars 2.29bn. In the longer term, airline deregulation in Asia is an obvious threat, clearing the way for more competition. So too is the greater capacity afforded by the colony's pending new airport. The recently launched Virgin Atlantic service between Hong Kong and London is just the tip of the iceberg  -the expanding Asia-Pacific is a market most airlines will want to penetrate. Elsewhere, the airline has been more a victim of circumstance. When the Taiwanese government imposed a ban on tours to the mainland in March - following the murder of 24 Taiwanese on a cruise of Qiandao Lake - Hong Kong was badly affected. The ban on direct Taiwan-China flights means that the colony is the main point of entry for Taiwanese visiting the mainland. The Taiwanese government lifted its veto in May, although package tours taking in 'high risk' locations remain under boycott. Cathay Pacific has been forced to axe 46 flights. According to Ms Eisha Cheng, aviation analyst with Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong, the cost to Cathay was HKDollars 1m in lost revenue for each flight. However, Cathay sends some 4,680 flights a year between Hong Kong and Taiwan. The real hit will only come if in some way the Taiwanese become afraid to travel to China, forcing Cathay to continue cancelling flights.</p>

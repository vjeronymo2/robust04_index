			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prince Sultan Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz Al Sa'ud, </F> second deputy prime minister, defense minister, and aviation and  inspector general, by unidentified correspondents at the King  Faysal airbase; date not given--recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] [sentence indistinct]    [Al Sa'ud] The important thing is that youth--university  graduates who believe in God--have joined the armed forces. I  am very happy to see that.    [Correspondent] Your Highness give us more details on the  recent announcement on the establishment of a military base in  the south?    [Al Sa'ud] First, the announcement was not made recently; it  was made two years ago. Studies and surveys have already been  done. If a number of foreign stations and radios have linked  the announcement the current situation in Yemen, it is false  reporting. The announcement was made two years ago; surveys  have been completed. The base will open next year, God willing.    [Correspondent] Will Your Highness please expand on the  problem of the Iraqi refugees? Although the kingdom has spent  around two billion Saudi riyals since the setting up of the  refugee camps in Rafhah, foreign media has nevertheless been  saying that the Kingdom mistreats the Iraqi refugees. How do  you answer that?    [Al Sa'ud] Anyone who feels sorry for them should take them  to his own country.    [Correspondent] What about compulsory conscription? Is the  idea going to be revived?    [Al Sa'ud] We do not need it; our youth have shown more than  enough enthusiasm. We have to accommodate the young enthusiasts  first.    [Correspondent] Did the Ministry of Defense benefit during  the Gulf war from the Saudi brothers who volunteered to serve in  the army?    [Al Sa'ud] A lot. It has benefitted a lot; many of them  joined military academies.    [Correspondent] What about al-Yamamah project?    [Al Sa'ud] It is still on track.    [Correspondent] What about relations with Iran, who has  asserted that the Kingdom mistreated the pilgrims?    [Al Sa'ud] Pilgrims were never mistreated. We hope that our  relations with Iran will be excellent. This is the policy of the  custodian of the two holy mosques.    [Correspondent] What about prisoners from Gulf Cooperation  Council countries still held by the Iraqi regime?    [Al Sa'ud] This matter is being examined by the UN Security  Council. We hope with God's help that every man will return to  his country. Thank you.    [Correspondent] Your Highness, when will the academy move to  the new building?    [Al Sa'ud] Work is progressing normally; the academy will  move there in two years' time.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For example, EPA currently has only estimated information on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GSE and limited primary data concerning commercial aircraft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations in Ventura and Sacramento. These reports could also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide data on certain ground access vehicles that are directly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the control of airlines. These sources are presently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unaccounted for in today's proposal due to insufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information. <FOOTCITE>75</FOOTCITE>  Therefore, baseline reports could provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional detail and precision, albeit at the expense of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional administrative burden for commercial airlines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information that could be requested for such baseline reports is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed in ``Reporting and Recordkeeping'' below. EPA requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on the desirability of requiring airlines to submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline reports, and on other possible alternative methods for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishing a reasonable baseline emissions inventory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 75 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See the Technical Support Document, available in the rulemaking docket, for further information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency further proposes to modify the stationary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source-related approach just described in order to ``lock in''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional emission reductions that are expected to result from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other non-FIP requirements such as the commercial aircraft fleet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modernization that will occur in response to FAA noise reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. According to the Air Transport Association, <FOOTCITE>76</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these requirements could generate a 40 percent reduction in VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions by 2000 from 1990 levels, when the requirements are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fully implemented. This represents the maximum period of effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for these requirements, however, since the affected aircraft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be retired eventually even in the absence of specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. EPA estimates that the emissions reduction benefit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting from noise reduction requirements declines to zero by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2010 because of such expected retirement schedules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 76 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See letter from R. Kettler, ATA to R. Wilson, EPA, dated December 27, 1993, available in the rulemaking docket. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To ensure these potential emission benefits occur, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency proposes to modify the stationary source approach for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developing the commercial aircraft baseline inventory and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seasonal emission limits as follows. The target for basin-wide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions will be the lower of either the emissions level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated from the percentage-reduction-from-1990 schedule being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed for the stationary source cap program, or the emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level that is expected to result from non-FIP regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements such as the fleet modernization under the noise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction requirements (i.e., emission improvements accompanying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the retirement of older, dirtier aircraft). The Agency requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on this ``lock-in'' approach and potential alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would ensure progress and attainment under the FIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The two tables below present examples of the proposed ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> season emission inventory limits for VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in the South  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Coast area. The emission limits in these tables are presented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for illustrative purposes and for the purpose of facilitating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public comment only. They do not represent the final values from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the enforceable emission performance targets will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> derived, since EPA will continue to refine the baseline emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inventory, aviation activity projections, and the effect of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noise-driven fleet modernization based on information received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the comment period. <FOOTCITE>77</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 77 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A detailed derivation of the emission limits for all areas is contained in the Technical Support Document, which is available in the public docket. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

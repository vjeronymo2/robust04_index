			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by former Labor Minister Herbert Ehrenberg: "A </F> Low-Interest Growth Program Via the Bundesbank; The Economy  Needs an Additional Push of Investments; The Financing"]    [Text] Most projections for economic development in western  Germany assume stagnation of the gross national product, with  slight divergences up or down. In the annual economic report, a  growth rate of 0.5 to 1 percent is projected. But a further  increase in unemployment by 400,000 is expected. At present,  some 6 million people in Germany are without a private-sector  job.    Despite this dramatic employment situation, there is no  willingness in Bonn or Frankfurt to take effective measures to  promote growth. The Bundestag Budget Committee saddled the  federal finance minister's austerity budget with an additional 5  billion German marks [DM] and, against this background of weak  growth and poor employment prospects, the Bundesbank states that  "at the moment and in the foreseeable future" it does not want a  change in its policy of stability. So, must the 6 million  people without a regular job resign themselves to their fate,  and must many of the (still) employed continue to fear for their  jobs?    This is not inevitable, economically. The economic and  finance policy tools still contain possibilities to strengthen  the presently hesitant economic growth in such a way that, in  the medium term, a noticeable reduction in unemployment is also  attainable. For that, only a few financing taboos must be  broken, and the wage policy must be released from its role as  scapegoat.    Depreciation relief, innovation and capital assistance are  useful tools for improving economic development, but their  application depends on the general economic and business  climate. The means for promoting growth include one tool that  always works: Strengthening and accelerating public investments  which lead directly to an increase in orders in the construction  industry, in machine and systems building, in measurement and  control technology, and in building commercial vehicles.    There are plenty of projects to improve the infrastructure,  the environment, and employment which must be carried out  urgently:     -  Despite increasing congestion on the German  autobahns, extension of rail traffic is progressing only slowly;  the rolling stock and the rail network of the Reichsbahn [east  German railway] in particular must urgently be modernized and  enlarged--but at Deutsche Waggonbau AG (one of the few  productive east German enterprises), only 7,000 of 25,000 jobs  still exist.    -  The installation of equipment to reduce air and  water pollution progresses slowly, and the clean-up of toxic  soils is done predominantly through job-creation measures (which  continuallay under go cuts)-- while, at the same time,  production and personnel capacities in machine and systems  building are under-utilized.    -  In united Germany there is a need  for 2.5 million additional housing units, and in the new laender  there is enormous demand for the rehabilitation of cities and  housing--but in December 1993, almost 110,000 construction  workers were unemployed.    These are measures, easily multiplied, which must be  implemented in the coming years if environmental stress is to be  reduced, the transportation grid is to be improved, and the  creation of slums is to be averted. Faster tackling of these  projects would not start an "economic flash in the pan," but  rather would trigger employment-effective growth which would  also strengthen smaller businesses via more effective  infrastructure. The under-utilized production capacities and the  reserve of unemployed workers would limit tendencies toward  price increases. The question of financing remains difficult,  but it is not unsolvable. Despite the frighteningly steep  increase in public indebtedness in the past four years, united  Germany was fifth from the bottom on the list of public debt  ratios (in percentage of gross national product) among 19 OECD  countries; public debt in the United States and in Japan  (economically so admired here) was more than one-third higher.    The German capital market would be rich enough for  additional  credit financing of public investments, but the interest  payments present great problems. These problems could be  resolved through new regulations by the Federal Government and  the Bundesbank:     -  The Bundesbank will transfer over DM18  billion to its owner, the Federal Government. Of this amount,  only DM7 billion are earmarked for the 1994 budget; the  remaining DM11 billion are to be used for debt repayment. This  stipulation from the 1980's is economically obsolete in 1993/94.  In the deepest postwar recession, not yet overcome, the  repayment of old debts is not a priority. [sentence as  published] To use these funds to ease the interest burden of  debt-financed investments and/or as investment subsidies to  laender and communities would make more sense with regard to  employment and stability. Only by reducing unemployment can one  avert hindering future consolidation efforts because of  diminshed revenues caused by the economic situation. One hundred  thousand fewer unemployed bring a DM3.5 billion relief to public  finances.    -  The Bundesbank should not have to balance its books  according to the lowest cost principle because of regulations  oriented toward protecting creditors. It has no creditors to be  protected but, because of this regulation, it has accumulated  "hidden reserves" in the amount of DM60 billion to DM70 billion.  A gradual market evaluation would free up large amounts for  investment financing, without any risks.    Alternative: Introduction of a time-limited levy on private  capital assets, analogous to the 1949 levy on mortgages and  profits from credits, raised to finance the "immediate  assistance law." In economic terms, it would make better sense  to stabilize the Bundesbank profits through appropriate use.</p>

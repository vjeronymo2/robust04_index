			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: First Greece state sale oversubscribed THE GREEK Ministry of National Economy raised Dr7.17bn (Dollars 32m) through the partial-privatisation of its monopoly sugar producer, Hellenic Sugar Industries, according to the ministry's advisers, Reuter reports from London. It was the first public flotation of a state-owned company in Greece and paves the way for the privatisation of OTE, the telecommunications company, due later this year. 'We are delighted with the outcome of the first public offering in Greece's extensive privatisation programme,' Mr Stephanos Manos, Greek minister of national economy, said in the statement issued in London. The public offering of 4.652m bearer shares at Dr1,200 was more than five times oversubscribed and the private placement for employees and sugar beet producers more than one and a half times over-subscribed, the statement said. Following the part-privatisation, the state-owned Agricultural Bank of Greece holds 70.48 per cent of HSI. 'Following this success, we look forward to the privatisation of OTE later this year with a great deal of confidence,' Mr Manos said. HSI has five factories and produces over 310,000 tonnes a year. It had 1992-93 pre-tax profits of Dr6.318bn.</p>

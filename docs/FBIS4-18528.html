			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Semih D. Idiz] </F>   [Text] Public attention in Turkey may be focused elsewhere  at the present time. But there are mounting signs of increasing  cooperation between Turkey and Iran, especially, but not  exclusively, in the security field which is an area of mutual  concern for the two countries given the overall developments in  the region that the two countries find themselves in. Ankara  has at the same time been monitoring the gradually worsening  economic situation in Iran. It has taken particular note of the  fact that these difficulties have prompted this country's  relatively liberal and certainly pragmatic President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani in recent days to call on expatriate and  particularly qualified Iranians around the world who have exiled  themselves from their country.    In a development that was unique as far as this country is  concerned, Rafsanjani called on these expatriates to return home  and contribute to the welfare of Iran.    A high-level official in Ankara told TURKISH PROBE earlier  this week that Ankara had no interest in exploiting these  difficulties of Iran or seeing others exploit them. Quite to  the contrary, he said it has always been the case that Turkey  wants good political and economic ties with a stable Iran  because it is important for key countries in the region like  themselves to have a say in matters and developments pertaining  to the region.    "Turkey and Iran are two important countries in this part of  the world that have parallel interests in many cases. This  makes it necessary that they consult constantly and cooperate  closely on a host of issues which they have a much closer  insight into than countries from outside the region and from  other parts of the world," this official said.    One delicate subject that has required continued close  consultation and cooperation between the two countries is, of  course, that of Iraq.    This subject is made even more delicate since Turkey is  firmly within the Western camp in terms of many, if not all, of  the factors concerning Iraq. Iran, with its deep antipathy for  the West that it suspects so much is, of course, in a radically  different category in this case.    But both Turkey and Iran have nevertheless found common  ground on one issue and have spelled out their views on this in  clear terms.    What they do not want to see is an independent Kurdistan in  northern Iraq, where the political vacuum is still continuing,  and where there is a semblance of stability only because of  Western involvement in the region.    But the West's overzealous involvement -- which Turkey is  ironically but not illogically also a part of -- is also the  cause of concern in both Ankara and Tehran that key countries in  the West may be secretly planning to establish just such an  independent Kurdistan.    It was this fear that prompted Turkey and Iraq, together  with  Syria, to set up a tripartite consultative mechanism on northern  Iraq at the level of foreign ministers in November 1992. All  three countries have restive Kurdish minorities and are aware  that developments in northern Iraq have close bearing on their  vital interests given that there is always the possibility that  these developments may spill over to their territory.    In Turkey's case, of course, this fear has been amply  justified given the developments in Southeastern Anatolia.  Through this tripartite mechanism -- which was last activated  in early February this year -- Turkey, Iran and Syria wanted to  signal that they had a say in regional matters and that they  would ensure that their influence was felt when it came to these  matters.    What they have been saying at the end of every meeting of  the  tripartite mechanism is, in effect, that no Kurdistan that is  sandwiched between these three countries can hope to survive  without endorsement from Ankara, Tehran and Damascus. But such  tripartite cooperation between these countries also requires  that bilateral cooperation is also enhanced among themselves if  the three-way consultative mechanism they have set up is to  really have any meaning and effect ultimately. This bilateral  cooperation, however, is what has been elusive more often than  not, especially in terms of Turkey's separate ties with Iran and  Syria.    This is also why some recent developments in ties with Iran  that have not received much publicity are of importance for  their broader implications.    Until very recently there was a widespread belief in Turkish  public opinion that Iran was one of the countries sponsoring the  Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is outlawed in Turkey  where it has been waging a bloody separatist war.    The belief was that with the latent tensions between the two  countries because of their diametrically opposed systems --  Turkey being a secular parliamentary democracy and Iran being  run by the Islamic Shariah law -- Tehran was using this as a  card against Ankara.    This belief has not completely disappeared as yet and crops  up every now and again and is probably only dormant because the  public's focus in Turkey is elsewhere at the moment. But an  editorial in January in the English language TEHRAN TIMES --  which is known for its closeness to President Rafsanjani whose  administration's views it is believed to express -- had given a  clear intimation as to how Iran was beginning to see this whole  Kurdish matter and particularly its place in it ties with Turkey.    The editorial had suggested that the time had come for  Turkey  and Iran to combine their efforts to find a peaceful solution to  their increasingly difficult problems with Kurdish minorities  "Regional countries (should) set aside their differences and  work out a practical peaceful solution to this common problem,"  it had said, adding that regional countries "should stop using  the Kurdish card" against each other.    It was significant that the TEHRAN TIMES editorial had come  just prior to the February meeting on northern Iraq of the  foreign ministers of Turkey, Iran and Iraq in Istanbul. It was  also noteworthy at this time that neither of the sides allowed  the death of nearly 20 Iranian villagers in February by stray  cluster bombs from Turkish F-16 jets in a cross-border raid on  the PKK's Zhalah camp in northern Iraq near the Iranian border  to sully the positive atmosphere that was developing at that  moment.    Although initially angry at this development which led the  Iranian press to lash out at Turkey, Tehran nevertheless  conceded it had been a mistake, and Ankara for its part had  agreed to provide compensation to the villagers' bereaved  families. The matter was subsequently considered closed by both  sides.    The latest development in this ongoing positive climate that  has been growing between the two countries was the returning by  Iran to Turkey of PKK militants who had strayed to its territory  following operations by the Turkish security forces in the Agri  and Igdir regions.    No precise date has been given by official sources in Turkey  as to when this development had taken place; but the  announcement earlier this week that a letter had been sent by  Turkish Minister for Interior Nahit Mentese to his Iranian  counterpart Mohammad Besharati thanking him for this development  indicates that the returning of the PKK militants took place  very recently.    Using noticeably sugary language, Mentese said that the  returning of some members of the PKK to Turkey was "the  expression of not just the cooperation on the question of  security but also of the brotherly ties between the governments  of the two countries."    Expressing optimism that this positive development was just  a  harbinger of the further enhanced cooperation of the two  countries on the security issue, Mentese ended his letter by  thanking Mohammad Besharati for his personal contribution to  this positive outcome and indicating his desire to see him in  Turkey in the shortest possible time.    Mehmet Agar, the Turkish chief of security, was reported as  also having sent a letter to his Iranian counterpart prior to  Mentese's letter to Besharati, expressing similar views and  hopes for enhanced cooperation between the two countries in the  security field.    All of this appeared a concrete example of the new mood  prevailing in Tehran that first started to reveal itself in late  December 1993 when the Iranian Deputy President Hasan Habibi  visited Ankara following a period of tension between the two  countries over the PKK issue.    It was also a far cry from what relations in the security  cooperation area were just over a year ago when the then  Minister for Interior Ismet Sezgin was accusing Tehran in so  many words of supporting such Islamic terrorism in Turkey as the  killing of Ugur Mumcu, a prominent investigative journalist and  staunch upholder of Kemalism and in particular its principle of  secularism.    Iran, of course, had denied the charges levelled at it on  this score, and the truth of the matter is that Ankara could  come up with nothing that would stand up in court to  substantiate its charges.    The negative climate that had attended these developments  had, however, prevailed for the better part of 1993 and had  adversely affected relations between the two countries.    The clouding of relations had happened at the very moment  that the two countries needed strategic cooperation to help  stabilize regional flash points, not just in Iraq, but also in  the Caucasus, another part of the region where the two capitals  have close interests and are watching the Armenian-Azeri  conflict and the Russian position in this closely.    Thus a breakthrough in the security field, such as the  reported return of PKK members, portends well as far as the  prospects of laying the groundwork for a more realpolitik  approach by both Ankara and Tehran to each other.    Officials in Ankara are adamant that Ankara always extended  a  warm hand to Iran but was hampered in the past because of what  was considered by the Turkish public as tampering with Turkey's  secularism and territorial integrity by Tehran.    If there is now to be more genuine cooperation in the  security field it is inevitable that this should lay the  infrastructure for enhancement of overall relations between the  two countries in other fields.</p>

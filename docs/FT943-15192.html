			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Arts: Nightingale and the Rose - Opera Posthumously, Oscar Wilde has furnished the stories for any number of operas besides Salome. Elena Firsova's new one-act piece, which opened the Almeida Opera season on Friday, is at least the fourth treatment of The Nightingale and the Rose. You could read Wilde's story aloud several times in the 75 minutes Firsova takes to tell it; but her intricate chamber-score is so delicately, rapturously, expiringly romantic that we hearkened to it all without complaint. There are far too few events in the tale to make a stage action - and the crucial one is scarcely stageable. Lovelorn Student needs red rose to win Girl, but there are only white and yellow ones in his garden; in honour of love, a Nightingale presses its breast against a rose-stem and sings its heart out until it dies, pierced by a thorn, and the rose turns red; Student is chucked by Girl anyway, and decides to take up metaphysics. Instead of inventing extra episodes, Firsova has chosen to set the parable as a chain of 'lyric scenes', in intimate, poignant focus. A grave little chorus of Roses (some doubling as other flora and fauna) comments and assists; the Nightingale - high soprano, of course - borrows three sonnets from Christina Rossetti for her achingly protracted swan-song. Firsova's chamber-ensemble of single strings and winds tingles with highly wrought feeling, celesta and marimbas, deep-shuddering drums and gongs. There is passionate discourse from an unorthodox string quartet, with a strong and perfectly apt whiff of Szymanowski. (Excellent Almeida Ensemble conducted by David Parry.) Singers impersonating plants tend to look silly, too much like primary-schoolers in a pageant; the director Caroline Gawn and her designer Julian McGowan take the curse off them by letting them be slightly comic. Gawn has found no convincing solution to the problem of representing the thorny avian Liebestod with an ample soprano and her green-faced cohorts, but I doubt there is one. Instead, with Carol Smith's exquisite singing as the Nightingale - clear, sweet, elegant, every phrase completely felt - the problem simply melts away. Rachael Hallawell's upmarket Essex Girl is a delectable cartoon. As for the Student, Philip Sheffield creates the ultimate gangly, preening swot, starry-eyed and scatterbrained: a great bonus to the production, and as sensitively sung as he is funny ('farfelu', the French would say). This young tenor is full of curious promise. Further performances tonight and July 16, 18 &amp; 20.</p>

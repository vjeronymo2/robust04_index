			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TRADING in FT-SE futures was volatile with independent traders 'wrong-footed' by changing market direction writes Joel Kibazo. Dealers were first caught out at the beginning of the session, after the March contract on the FT-SE opened at a disappointing 2537 following the poor overnight close on Wall Street. However buying from several houses soon left independent traders short, triggering a squeeze which sent March forward to 2549. Mid-session selling by the big institutions not only caused a retreat in March but also left dealers with long positions which were only cleared as market waited for Wall Street's opening. When New York came in lower than expected, the March contracts once against turned south but the unexpected turnaround on Wall Street again left locals in London out in the cold. March closed at 2547, some 8 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6. Turnover was just over 4,000 contracts. In LTOM trading was lower Volume at 26,676 was down on Thursday's impressive 36,401. The Euro footsie was the busiest option trading 2180 contracts. Amongst stock options Hanson traded 1747 contracts, followed by Glaxo Holdings.</p>

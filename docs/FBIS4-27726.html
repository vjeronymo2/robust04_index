			<p>BFN     [Unattributed commentary: "Both the Khmer Rouge and Their  Newspapers Must Be Eliminated"]    [Text] Both the Khmer Rouge elements and their newspapers in  Phnom Penh have continued to claim that the government [RG] is a  warmonger and does not want peace. Now, it has been shown  clearly, through the roundtable meeting, who the warmongers are  and who does and does not want peace.    Three planeloads of government officials went to attend the  meeting as if to beg the Khmer Rouge for peace, but the Khmer  Rouge refused to accept peace through negotiation.    The government accepted an unconditional cease-fire in place  to begin at noon on 15 June before holding any further talks.  But Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan rejected it, claiming that  foreign troops are still in Cambodia. At the same time, he  demanded the dismantling of all national institutions from the  monarchy, government, and National Assembly down to village  committees.    Should we agree to dismantle the national institutions that  we have built with the assistance of the international community?    Both the Cambodians, who own this country, and the  international community will certainly not agree to this.    Therefore, we have only one alternative, that is, to  continue  the war to smash the Khmer Rouge, which is just a paper tiger.    We have said earlier that only by using war against war can  we achieve peace. That is, if the roundtable fails due to the  Khmer Rouge.</p>

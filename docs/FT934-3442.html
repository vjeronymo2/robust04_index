			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Republics face threat of reprisals: Contenders line up for next Sunday's democratic parliamentary elections Senior Russian politicians yesterday threatened reprisals against leaders of republics who have called for a No vote in Sunday's referendum on a draft constitution for Russia. Fears are growing that the draft will not be adopted and that a new period of political instability will result. At the same time, a statement from the leadership of the rebel Russian republic of Chechnya, the most extreme of the anti-Moscow republics and the only one which has banned all voting on Sunday, said President Boris Yeltsin had made a declaration of war by threatening to tighten border controls and cut rail communications. Chechnya, under General Dzhokar Dudayev, has declared complete independence and is a centre of anti-Russian agitation in the north Caucasian region. However several other republics, led by Tatarstan, insist on the right of sovereignty and most party leaders have come out against the constitution. The warnings of reprisals, and of chaos if the referendum were not passed, reflects intense concern within the Yeltsin camp that the constitution will not be adopted. It requires a 50 per cent vote on a turnout of at least 50 per cent of the voters - a result originally considered attainable but now, in the face if widespread apathy and even hostility, thought to be in danger. Mr Sergei Filatov, Mr Yeltsin's chief of staff, warned the presidents of Russia's republics who have called for a No vote that the armed forces, security forces and interior ministry were 'seriously concerned' by the opposition to the constitution, especially by the leaders of Tatarstan, Bashkortostan and Tuva. A government reaction to this opposition was now being prepared, he said. 'Those who are making war on the constitution. . . . should take care of the unity of the Russian federation, or we shall lead our state to catastrophe.' Mr Nikolai Medvedev, head of the president's department for relations with the Russian regions, warned still more pointedly: 'Even after the tragic events (of October 4 when the Russian parliament was shelled by the army) they are not behaving responsibly in what they say (and). . . . they are answerable before their consciences and the state, as state officials.' Mr Yegor Gaidar, head of the liberal group Russia's Choice, said in a newspaper interview that the constitution 'bears the stamp of the events of October 3-4' and that it was far from perfect. 'All the same, I'm deeply convinced that the risk of it's not being adopted is incomparably greater than the risk form its imperfections.' Mr Anatoly Sobchak, mayor of St Petersburg and a leader of the Movement of Democratic Reforms, which supports the constitution, said he feared the referendum would not be passed. 'The constitution has not been properly presented, no explanatory work on he necessity to adopt it has been done and the overwhelming majority of voters either know nothing or too little about it,' he said. Western observers, now gathering in Moscow to review the progress of the voting on Sunday, generally believe it is 'within the bounds of the democratic arena' - in the worlds of Mrs Herta Daubler-Gmelin, a German Social Democrat deputy. However, they stress that it will work only if the parties and the political class refrain from extreme methods and support reform.</p>

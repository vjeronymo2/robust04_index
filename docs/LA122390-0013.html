			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: QUIBBLES &amp; BITS  </P> <P> . . . Special effects get hairier and hairier: Sources tell us that  state-of-the-art Industrial Light &amp; Magic has developed a traveling matte  process that creates the illusion of hair to cover actors' bald spots. ILM  isn't commenting.  </P> <P> . . . Did we see the same movie? Warner Bros. is running a TV spot selling  "Bonfire of the Vanities" as a wacky buddy comedy -- with no hint of the racial  conflict that fuels much of the film.  </P></p>

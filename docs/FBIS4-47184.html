			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Raimonda Rameliene: "C. Jursenas: `There is No </F> Government Crisis'"]    [Text] "I get the impression that there is a certain  confusion in the ranks of our dear and respected friends on the  right. It appears that signatures for referendums are being  successfully gathered and that everything is all right. At the  same time, they are throwing various accusations back and forth  and are resorting to various means, as if they (the rightists)  were not convinced how one referendum or the other will come  out. Or perhaps they already know the outcome, and are therefore  rushing about in confusion in advance," Seimas chairman C.  Jursenas stated yesterday at a press conference.    According to Jursenas, amendments to the Referendum Law are  being actively attacked now. What is overlooked, however, is  that it is difficult to organize any kind of referendum on the  basis of the currently valid Referendum Law, which dates back to  the Soviet era. "Especially interesting is the attempt" to set  the president and the Seimas against each other, which is being  done by one faction (the Christian Democrats--R.R.) with its  memorandum. This memorandum proposes to the president that he  make use of specific regulations and articles of the  Constitution, especially article 58, which outlines how the  president can dismiss the Seimas prematurely. "Some are doing  one thing, others are doing something else, but the efforts  point in the same direction as they attempt to introduce  confusion and set people against each other, in the hope that  something might after all come of it," Jursenas said in speaking  about the activities of the rightists.    Regarding the amendments to the Referendum Law, the Seimas  chairman once again stressed that according to the Constitution,  only the Seimas can adopt constitutional laws, whereas only  regulations, not laws or their instructions, are adopted by  means of referendums. In addition, the president's powers cannot  be expanded beyond the limits outlined in the Constitution. One  would have to change the Constitution itself if the goal were to  implement the aforementioned actions. Up to now, no such  amendments have been received.    Commenting on Landsbergis' assertion regarding a  governmental  crisis in the country, C. Jursenas noted that talk about a  crisis had started back at the end of October 1992, after the  first round of elections.    In the speaker's opinion, the rightists had instigated a  crisis artificially in 1992: the Supreme Council was still able  to work successfully. But some people wanted a government  constituted differently and they ended up hurting themselves.    C. Jursenas said that he saw no government crisis at this  time: the Seimas, President, and government are working actively  and intensively. Of course, when the country's economic and  social situations are difficult, the reaction of some government  representatives is inadequate. This is why such broad  conclusions are being drawn from this reaction as well as from  the fact that certain Seimas members are flustered. With  reference to the government as a whole, however, there is no  crisis; the impression that there is one is being artificially  inflated, relying on the fact that life is hard. Why is it hard?  Because the current government inherited the kind of situation  that cannot be changed in a year. Finally, a mandate was given  for four to five years, so an accounting will come when these  years have passed. "We'll talk about all these matters in 1996."    And with respect to this government, the Seimas chairman is  "more or less pleased." If something needs to be changed, it  will be changed. This is already foreseen and presents no  problem.</p>

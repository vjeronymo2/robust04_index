			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Havana GRANMA in Spanish of 14 December  1993 on page 2 reports that, although the economic situation  prohibits the building of new day-care centers, resolution 203  of November 1993 provides for day-care centers for children ages  2 through 5 to be established in sugar- and agricultural-related  work centers. According to the article, State resources budgeted  for food services and raw materials may not be applied to day  care; rather, the work centers must provide for day care from  their own resources. If a center does not have the means to  establish day care, then food services will be suspended. Health  services for the children include a guaranteed supply of potable  and boiled water, according to the article.</p>

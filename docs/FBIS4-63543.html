			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan ("LRAGIR", "YERKIR" dailies), 05/19/94 --  The Azeri delegation retreated to Baku from Moscow negotiations.  Nevertheless, Russian President's Envoy Kazimirov believes, this  negotiations were a great success since Azerbaijan has already  declared its acceptance of the agreement in general. Azerbaijan  didn't sign the agreement because of "several poorly developed  and incorrect topics."    The experts were amazed by the unexpected harsh approach of  Russia to this problem. The commander of peace-making forces  Kondratyev declared that Russia is not going to organize another  meeting for Ministers of Defense. Continuing the declaration he  said that if Azerbaijan refuses to sign this agreement, Russia  will stop its mediation efforts for peaceful resolution of the  problem.    Azerbaijan still didn't join the agreement by yesterday late  in the evening. Nevertheless, it's clear that Baku will have to  accept the agreement despite "several omissions," and most  probably, Mamedrafi Mamedov will put his signature on this  document in Baku.    According to "YERKIR", the Azeri Councillor on external  policy Vafa Gulizade declared on 17 May that "the Azeri position  is the same, and Karabakh conflict is to be resolved within CSCE  framework." According to "ITAR-TASS," Gulizade rejected the  information on Azerbaijan only accepting the Russian project,  which stipulates stationing Russian troops in the conflict zone.  He said this information is baseless, and commented on this as  an attempt of pressing on Azerbaijan.    "We are not against collaboration with Russia, but the  Armenian-Azeri conflict became international, and can only be  resolved within CSCE framework, which member Russia is,"  Gulizade said.</p>

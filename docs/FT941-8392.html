			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Travel: Paraguay, pickled in its own history - The country turned to democracy only last year. Progress remains slow The cab reeked of alcohol. The driver, a squat, stubble-faced man with halting Spanish, must have been hard at the bottle. As he groped around the unfamiliar territory of Castilian vocabulary - like many Paraguayans, Guarani, not Spanish, was his first language - a vodka-like odour drifted through the soupy air. It was punishingly hot. The tarmac of the airport car park was sticky underfoot and a ridge of sweat formed a liquid moustache over the driver's lip. I had just arrived. Half-an-hour earlier, I had been in the temperature-controlled comfort of an international jet. From the air, Asuncion, the capital, looked like a nature reserve - a vegetal mass of trees, palms and creepers with the odd tiled rooftop peeking from the undergrowth. A slow, brown river sludged its way through a break in the trees, and a network of earth-red tracks spiralled off from a skeleton of tarmaced road. On the ground, things did not look much different. Plant life was sprouting from every crevice, cabbage-sized flowers burst from crumbling brickwork, trees arched precariously over roadways, and matted creepers gyrated round lamp posts and crawled along pavement cracks. It was as if someone had founded a capital city in the Kew Gardens hot-house. We pulled into a petrol station, where it emerged that my first assumption about Paraguay had been wrong: the cab driver had not been drinking. The vodka smell odour was coming from the car's engine. Like many Paraguayan vehicles, the taxi ran on alcohol. 'Some people drink it, too,' he said. We drove on at snail's pace through the botanical garden-cum-city. Everything moved slowly. People sauntered, cars meandered. Even the insects buzzed drowsily through the air. Asuncion, unlike most other speed-crazed Latin American cities, was dozing in the heat. It is not surprising that Paraguay should be different from its continental counterparts. Like a country in a jar - isolated for decades from the rest of South America - it has been pickled in its own history. Post-independence events began with one Gaspar Rodriguez de Francia - 'El Supremo' to his friends - who pursued a policy of absolute isolation. From 1814 until 1840, no one was permitted to enter or leave. There was no external trade. In 1865, isolationism gave way to expansionism when Mariscal Francisco Solano Lopez, a Paraguayan Napoleon, embarked on a suicidal escapade known as the War of the Triple Alliance. Tiny Paraguay took on the combined might of Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay - and lost. More shockingly, of its pre-war population of 800,000, only 194,000 survived. Of these, a mere 14,000 were men, a small but willing group which set about the task of re-populating the nation. There was still time for at least one further crazed turn of history's wheel: the near 40-year dictatorship of General Alfredo Stroessner, a man who seized control 15 years before Americans landed on the moon. Only last year did Paraguay join the rest of the continent in taking a stab at democracy. All official references to Stroessner are supposed to have been removed, but some bus companies - evidently a little below speed on recent events - still advertise routes to streets named after him. Such historical shenanigans have left Paraguay a little dazed. Its people are among the poorest and shortest-lived in South America. One quarter of them live abroad. The country has virtually no industry; its main exports are soya and cotton. If traces of its dictatorship are still in evidence, so are elements of its more distant past. Scattered around the south of Paraguay, some three hours' drive from Asuncion, are remains of several Jesuit missions, deserted since 1767 when the holy order was banished from the region. These so-called 'reductions,' where Indians lived with priests in self-sufficient communes, began gradually to pose a threat to the state, which relied on Indians for slave labour. Missions were often attacked; some communities were constantly on the run. I stumbled across some present-day Jesuits in an out-of-the-way museum and spent the following day with them clattering over the sweltering Paraguayan pampas in an ancient, bright orange Jeep. The Jesuits, all training to be priests in Belo Horizonte, were on holiday in Paraguay, killing time before a month-long Jesuit get-together in southern Brazil. Holidaying Jesuits - one had an antique-looking camera slung over his shoulder, another washed down his steak lunch with a couple of beers - did not fit my preconceptions of religious self-contemplation and withdrawal from earthly affairs. I wondered where they got the money from. 'That's the beauty of a vow of poverty,' said Tim, a meek-looking fellow who appeared more suited to a quiet English vicarage than the rigours of Latin America. 'You never have to worry about money. You just ask for whatever you need at the beginning of the month.' His advice on priestly budgeting was always to request a third more than needed - to compensate for unholy South American inflation. We set off in the Jeep early one morning, yelling over the din of the engine. Fat bugs streamed through the air towards us like fighter jets, splattering on the windscreen and leaving a trail of multi-coloured streaks on the glass. The landscape, swathes of brick-red earth and explosive greens, might have been uninhabited save for tell-tale streams of rubbish flung out of bus windows or dumped by the side of the road. In San Ignacio Guazu, home to a stoop-backed Irish priest whose years in South America had not dented his creamy accent, was an old Jesuit workshop where Indians once were taught to write their own language. The attached museum contained extraordinarily delicate carvings fashioned out of wood by Indian craftsmen, who scaled up miniatures of saints and religious icons brought by the Jesuits from Europe. They are some of the few that have survived the rigours of Paraguay's stormy history and the humidity of its stormy climate. Back in Asuncion, the waiter in an American-style diner was holding forth on Paraguay's latest novelty - democracy. He was standing behind a semi-circular bar lined with bottles of ketchup and other doubtful-looking sauces. 'I was born in a dictatorship. I grew up in a dictatorship. And I grew old in a dictatorship,' he said, measuring out his phrases in even portions. Outside the diner, as if in response to his soliloquy, a tree full of insects began to chirp, like an electric generator. 'It's going to take us a while to learn what democracy is all about,' the waiter continued. He had an anecdote prepared. 'Take my neighbours.' It transpired that the people who lived in his street had taken to playing loud music at inconvenient times. 'Twenty-four hours a day they make that racket,' he said, ladling out another phrase. 'But whenever I go over to complain, they tell me: 'We're living in a democracy now. We can do what we like'.' He paused for dramatic effect. 'That's not democracy. That's stupidness.' The insects stopped buzzing. 'It's going to take us a while to get this thing right.'</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Strike doubles loss at GM Firth A STRIKE at its steel rolling mill, Spartan Redheugh, was principally blamed by GM Firth (Holdings) for a doubling of its pre-tax loss, from Pounds 712,000 to Pounds 1.5m, in the half year to September 30. The knock-on effect on its steel stockholding subsidiary, one of the mill's principal customers, together with high interest charges and 'what was probably the worst market for steel since the 1930s', all contributed to the loss. Mr Michael Wilkinson, the chairman, said that accordingly the group's principal aim in recent months had been to resolve the strike and significantly reduce borrowings. Although Spartan's ability to expand was restricted by a shortage of working capital, that position would be eased when the new bank facilities were in place, he said. Borrowings had fallen from Pounds 14.6m on April 1 1992 to about Pounds 6.6m at present. Turnover dropped to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 23.4m). Losses per share were 4.46p (1.85p) and again there is no dividend. Last week it was disclosed that Mr Roger Shute, president of BM, the industrial holding company, had bought a 4.4 per cent stake in Firth.</p>

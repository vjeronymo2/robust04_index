			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHILL EASES ITS ICY GRIP BUT EFFECTS ARE STILL FELT  </P> <P> Although sunshine bathed California on Christmas, chilly temperatures gripping  the state for a sixth day left thousands of homeowners coping with frozen water  pipes and farmers tabulating freeze damage to crops.  </P> <P> "It was a record-breaking cold system," Jerry Steiger of the National Weather  Service said Tuesday in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "Most of the cold air now is moving eastward. . . . It looks like we're going  to warm up." Temperatures plummeted to record lows in some cities again on  Tuesday. Sacramento Airport's 22-degree reading broke the record 27-degree low  reached on Christmas Day 1982, and the 22 degrees in Bakersfield was the  coldest Dec. 25 since a 24-degree reading in 1937.  </P> <P> Other record lows included 35 degrees in San Francisco, 29 at Moffett Field and  34 at the Alameda Naval Air Station.  </P> <P> The high temperature at the Los Angeles Civic Center Tuesday was "a balmy 68,"  said Steve Burback, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides  forecasts for The Times.  </P> <P> He predicted a high of 70 degrees for today, with light winds, and a low  tonight of about 40 degrees. Thursday should be a few degrees warmer, he said.  </P> <P> The cold snap cracked thousands of water pipes, leaving about 12,000 people in  the Santa Cruz Mountains without water.  </P> <P> "It's a real pain," said Sophie Russell, 61, of Ben Lomond, who has been out of  water since temperatures plummeted to 10 degrees Saturday night. She was among  the 75% of the San Lorenzo Valley Water District's customers expected to be  without water until today.  </P> <P> A warming trend was predicted for the rest of the week, but agricultural  officials said it was too late for crops damaged by the frigid air mass dubbed  the "Arctic Express."  </P></p>

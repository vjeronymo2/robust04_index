			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / International Company News: DAF in final talks to secure Fl 200m loans DAF, the loss-making Dutch truck-maker in which British Aerospace has a 16 per cent stake, is in final negotiations to secure loans of Fl 200m (Dollars 110m) from a Dutch and a Belgian bank as part of efforts to strengthen its balance sheet. The company, which recorded a net deficit last year of Fl 394.5m, compared with a loss of Fl 228m a year earlier, said yesterday it was also looking at 'various other opportunities' for additional financing, which could bring the total injection of new cash to Fl 300m. DAF is expected to conclude agreements with the Dutch National Investment Bank and the NMKN commercial bank of Belgium within the next few weeks. The National Investment Bank loan, for Fl 100m, is expected to be subordinated from the Dutch government. The NMKN loan, also for Fl 100m, will also carry some guarantees from the Belgian government. The latter is concerned for the welfare of DAF's manufacturing presence in Belgium, notably its Westerlo axles plant near the Dutch border which employs 2,000. With most European trucks markets continuing to be depressed, speculation was being discounted last night that BAe might use any strengthening of DAF's share price arising from the refinancing to dispose of its own holding in DAF. DAF's financial performance is the weakest of the leading European truck-makers, largely due to its dependence on the UK truck market, which has suffered the steepest slide into recession since 1945.</p>

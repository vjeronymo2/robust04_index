			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> L. A. RETREATS FROM DECISION OVER LOPEZ DUMP;  </P> <P> LANDFILL: IN ABANDONING ITS PLAN TO COMPLY WITH STATE LIMITS, THE CITY COUNCIL  SAID THE CITY ALREADY IS TRYING TO SCALE BACK DUMPING.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council backed away Friday from an earlier decision to  voluntarily comply with state limits on operations at Lopez Canyon Landfill,  accepting the city Bureau of Sanitation's assertion that it already is making  efforts to scale back dumping.  </P> <P> But several council members made it clear that they would not support a  proposed expansion of the northeast San Fernando Valley dump until alternative  methods of trash disposal are fully studied.  </P> <P> "We shouldn't rely on urban landfills any more," Councilman Joel Wachs said.  "We need alternatives. That may cost us money, but it's a price worth paying."  </P> <P> State authorities have tried to reduce the city's use of the dump, which gets  two-thirds of the city's residential trash. But the city won a restraining  order from a Superior Court judge who accepted arguments that the city cannot  do so. Since then, the city had promised to comply voluntarily with some of the  overturned state restrictions.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in another room at City Hall, a continued public hearing on the  proposed expansion of Lopez Canyon, the only city-operated dump, drew questions  and criticism from politicians and neighbors. The Board of Public Works hearing  began Monday night at the Lake View Terrace Recreation Center.  </P> <P> Lopez Canyon had been scheduled to close in 1992. However, the Bureau of  Sanitation last year announced plans to double the landfill's size and extend  its life through at least 2002.  </P> <P> "When the city of Los Angeles breaks its promise about Lopez Canyon Landfill,  more than landscape is lost," said a statement by Assemblyman Richard Katz  (D-Sylmar), which was read at the hearing Friday by one of his aides. "Homes  were purchased and lives were planned based on the promise that Lopez Canyon  would be closed in 1992."  </P> <P> Neighbors recited a litany of problems at the dump, ranging from polluted water  runoff to children becoming ill from landfill gas emissions. They said that if  the city cannot prevent these problems now, it should not be allowed to enlarge  the dump.  </P> <P> "There simply is too much trash generating too much gas too close to a  residential community," said Rob Zapple, who lives in nearby Kagel Canyon.  </P> <P> An environmental impact report on the expansion, including answers to concerns  raised during the two hearings this week, will be completed within three weeks,  according to the Bureau of Sanitation staff. The City Council will vote on the  expansion proposal in the spring.  </P> <P> From the beginning, neighbors were unhappy with the expansion plans. They  became even angrier when they learned that two landfill workers had fainted  last spring after inhaling toxic gas from a pocket that they accidentally  unearthed.  </P> <P> The state Waste Management Board stepped up its review of the landfill after  the accident. In July, it ordered the city to scale back dumping at Lopez  Canyon to levels agreed to in a 1978 permit. The city had been operating under  less restrictive conditions in a 1983 report, which the city contends amended  the 1978 permit.  </P> <P> Wachs and Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who represent dump neighbors, asked that  the City Council instruct the sanitation bureau to voluntarily comply with the  state order, even though city attorneys were challenging the order in Superior  Court.  </P> <P> Council members approved the Wachs-Bernardi measure at the end of July, then  changed their votes after city attorneys asked them not to act while the court  appeal was pending. In September, the city won a temporary restraining order  against the state limitations.  </P> <P> The council voted Friday to take no action on the Wachs-Bernardi call for  voluntary compliance, effectively reversing the council's earlier support of  their request.  </P> <P> On Friday, Bernardi grilled Bureau of Sanitation Director Delwin A. Biagi about  how well the city is complying with its pledge of partial voluntary compliance  the state order. Biagi responded that the city has cut back the number of  trucks dumping in Lopez Canyon, has stopped dumping on a piece of U.S. Forest  Service land next to the dump and is preparing a new area for dumping so that  it can limit the height of the present trash mounds.  </P> <P> Although Bernardi and Wachs said they were disturbed that garbage mounds at the  dump remain taller than the level stipulated in the state's order, Wachs said  he was glad that the city had taken some steps to comply.  </P> <P> "I hope we've learned we shouldn't have to wait to be forced to do something,"  he said. "We should do it because it's right to do it."  </P> <P> In a separate action Friday, the council approved spending $2.1 million to dump  refuse from the Bureau of Street Maintenance and the Department of Recreation  and Parks in private landfills around the county. Finding other places to take  bulky waste such as grass, tree trimmings and broken asphalt leaves more space  at Lopez Canyon for residential garbage.  </P> <P> The $2.1 million was transferred from a contingency fund already in the Bureau  of Sanitation budget.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Conscience of the Fatherland Senator Andres </F> Soliz Rada; place and date not given]    [Text] In the face of the gloomy prospects that await the  labor sector, Andres Soliz Rada, journalist, political analyst,  senator, and secretary of doctrine and training for Conscience  of the Fatherland (CONDEPA), predicts that the Capitalization  Law "will be at loggerheads" with the Popular Participation Law  because the former brings the country back to the days of the  "tin barons" while the latter is "unquestionably revolutionary."  One eliminates sovereignty and the other "allows the people to  set their own course."    [PRESENCIA] How do you see the future of the Bolivian labor  movement?    [Soliz] Organized labor is in crisis all over the world. The  globalization of the economy, the implementation of neoliberal  policies, the freedom to hire, robots, automation, and  scientific and technological advances have resulted in the loss  of tens of millions of productive jobs, even in highly  industrialized countries. These factors have also led to  hypertrophic growth in the services sector and the informal  economy.    The result of the current social equation is disturbing:  "The  more modernity, the less employment." All indications are that  wage earners in our time belong to the last generation of  workers who have benefited from job security, social security,  compensation, and paid vacations. Neoliberalism has no heart.  Either you accept the employer's conditions or you have no job.  There are countless legions of unemployed workers, including  professionals, who are waiting to fill what few job openings  there are. This cataclysm has had perverse effects on the  Bolivian labor movement, especially since Decree 21060 of 29  August 1985, which shifted the axis of the national economy from  hydrocarbons, mining, and the still weak nontraditional exports  to the various aspects of drug trafficking.    [PRESENCIA] What does drug trafficking have to do with  Decree  21060?    [Soliz] Although that criminal activity has obvious roots in  the Banzer and Garcia Meza dictatorships, 21060 promoted the  acceptance of bank deposits "without tracing their origin." The  brains behind the operation, Jeffery Sachs, has "narcotized" the  Bolivian economy, with all the imaginable consequences, ranging  from the movement of former miners to the Chapare, to the  infiltration of cocaine proceeds into political structures. That  was the origin of scandals such as those of Huanchaca (involving  the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement), the narcovideos  (involving Nationalist Democratic Action), and the narcophotos  (involving the Movement of the Revolutionary Left). The ensuing  commotion obviously shook the foundations of the Bolivian Labor  Federation (COB). Only now have its leaders begun to realize  that their survival depends on their ability to bring together  emerging sectors, such as trade associations, informal workers,  hometowns, drivers, and craftsmen, without neglecting the  interests of workers who still depend on a regular paycheck.    In short, the future of the COB depends on its ability to  expand its sphere of influence, on the one hand, and to raise  the banner of national defense, on the other hand, so that the  "Tupacamarization" of Bolivia can be contained.    [PRESENCIA] What are you referring to?    [Soliz] To the sinister capitalization law governing former  state enterprises that have now been turned into mixed  corporations. It will allow such entities as Bolivian Government  Oil Deposits (YPFB), the National Smelting Enterprise (Enaf),  the National Telecommunications Enterprise (Entel), and the  National Railway Enterprise (Enfe) to be captured and  "vampirized" by foreign capital. In the name of modernity,  Bolivia is returning to the days of Patino, Hoschild, and  Aramayo, who sucked the wealth out of the country and put it in  foreign banks. The neoliberal doctrine is supposed to solve the  problems of the third millennium with postulates from the 18th  and 19th centuries: those of Adam Smith and Robert Malthus.    YPFB, the Mining Corporation of Bolivia (COMIBOL), Entel,  Enfe, Enaf, and Ende will be administered by transnationals. Our  weak symphony orchestra will be transformed into a musical group  in which each member will beat the drum at his own rhythm.  Entel's foreign board of directors will decide whether it is  worthwhile to install electricity facilities in Provinces of La  Paz, Pando, Tarija, or Santa Cruz. Its decision will depend on a  calculation of immediate profits, not on national interest. If  the parameters of the World Bank or the Inter-American  Development Bank (IDB) had been followed, Bolivia would not have  built its Cochabamba-Santa Cruz highway. YPFB's foreign board of  directors may decide to sell our gas to Brazil through Argentine  pipelines, or to sell it to Chile over the objections of the  Foreign Ministry.    In short, the self-determination that we won with the  revolution of April 1952 will have been forfeited for the  benefit of the new foreign "barons" of the former state  enterprises.    [PRESENCIA] What implications does the Popular Participation  Law have for the labor movement?    [Soliz] It is a chink in the system's armor that the popular  movement should take advantage of. From a conceptual point of  view, this law has an unquestionably revolutionary content. By  recognizing the legal status of ayllus [tribes],  tentas, captaincies, cabildos [town  councils], and farmworkers' unions, it has taken a tremendous  step toward eliminating one of the greatest injustices  perpetrated over the five centuries of external and internal  colonialism. This legal instrument is, at the same time, the  antithesis of the Capitalization Law. The former tends to allow  the people, joined together in municipal jurisdictions and  neighborhood boards, to set their own course and their own  priorities; the latter eliminates sovereignty and allows the  exploitation of natural resources to benefit foreign interests,  as has been occurring for the last 500 years. The former seeks  to encourage citizens to plan for their future; the latter  allows huge hypodermic needles to suck the lifeblood out of the  country, with no benefit for Bolivians, as has occurred with  silver, quinine, rubber, tin, and petroleum. The interests  created by the two laws will be at loggerheads with each other  over the next few years. The Capitalization Law is part of the  New World Order that seeks to destroy the countries of the Third  World. The Popular Participation Law can be an instrument for  defending the fatherland, limiting efforts to shrink even  further our sparse population, repopulating the provinces, and  eliminating corruption. Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas, to  the extent that he does not become more of a tool of the  neoliberals, and Deputy Remedios Loza are the symbols of Popular  Participation. Fernando Illanes and other plutocrats are the  paradigms of the Capitalization Law. In that context, the COB  must stand firm for the Popular Participation Law, fight to  eliminate its negative aspects, and extend its scope so that it  can serve as a point of departure for the COB and other  political organizations in the popular sphere, such as CONDEPA,  to move forward in the construction of the Productive  Revolution, the Moral Revolution, and Participative Democracy.    [PRESENCIA] How do you explain these concepts?    [Soliz] Bolivia cannot allow its future to depend on food  donations or on the precarious profits of drug trafficking; it  must achieve self-sufficiency in food. This was achieved in  Tiwanacu, in the Inca Empire, and in the Jesuit missions. It was  also part of the Bohan Plan, proposed by the United States to  Bolivia in 1942, during World War II, for the purpose of  assuring food supplies.    If we Bolivians do not carry out our own moral revolution,  this postulate will become a pretext for foreign intervention  and domination. The superstate installed by the DEA [Drug  Enforcement Administration] needs no further comment. I would  like to note, however, that along the lines of our moral  revolution, I have submitted two bills that the parliamentary  oligarchy refuses to discuss: The Fortune Investigation Law and  the Law Against Impunity. The latter advocates the elimination  of the statute of limitations on crimes against the state. Under  the SAFCO [Administrative and Financial System for Government  Control] Law, the statute of limitations is now 10 years. Given  the current legal framework, the deals made as a result of the  Capitalization Law will soon be immune from any scrutiny. The  Popular Participation Law was proposed by CONDEPA, as stated in  "The Book of the Endogenous Model," which we published last  year. In that publication we also planned the conversion of the  current inefficient, verbose, 18th-century parliament into an  assembly of producers made up of all the economic and cultural  sectors in the country.    [PRESENCIA] What does the current social protest stand for?    [Soliz] The people organized and turned into a vanguard by  the COB have responded to attempts to demobilize them by staging  hunger strikes, for the purpose of reducing hunger. People have  risked their lives; they have faced death and repression to  reduce the "terrible dependency" recognized by the president of  the Republic himself. The active involvement of Aymaras,  Quechuas, Guaranis, Amazon ethnic groups, and Mestizos in  national affairs is the only possibility we have to avoid  swelling the ranks of the slaves of the 21st century. That is  why we are passionately in love with interculturalness and its  incipient possibilities. This diversity is not an obstacle, but  a creative component in a Latin America that has been united  defensively so that it will not be excluded from the unknown  world that is approaching.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Weinstock seeks aid for aerospace LORD WEINSTOCK, chief executive of GEC, yesterday said that Britain has been 'outmanoeuvred' by foreign governments in the aerospace business because of its unwillingness to collaborate with industry. He told the Commons trade and industry committee that while Britain discussed government help for industry, other countries 'just did it'. He added that the government must intervene to help Britain's aerospace industry to avoid 'continuing industrial decline'. Lord Weinstock said the most efficient help would be through technology demonstrator programmes, in which the cost of building the first example of a new technology was shared between industry and the government. Mr Anthony Edwards, chief executive of Dowty Aerospace, part of TI Group, said help was needed for such projects as the next generation of landing gear for ultra-large passenger aircraft. 'The dialogue (with the government over assistance) is now more constructive, but it is still dialogue,' he said. Mr Alex Ferry, general secretary of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, warned that skilled workers who lost their jobs in the aerospace industry would be tempted to seek careers elsewhere. They would not be available if industry wanted those skills again. Lord Weinstock also criticised Ministry of Defence procurement policy which had meant that foreign companies were now involved in most contracts. He argued that the ministry might save some money by buying from a foreign contractor, but the real cost was picked up by other government departments. He said that the French government put in 'hundreds of millions' of pounds to help its industries, and argued that spending on defence contracts should be regarded as spending on technology development.</p>

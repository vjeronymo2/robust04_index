			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Sainsbury posts rise in underlying profits: Charges and reorganisation at UK's largest grocery retailer halve reported figure J. Sainsbury, the UK's largest grocery retailer, shrugged off the gloom that beset its January trading statement to announce an increase in underlying profits, and a stabilisation of gross margins after the price skirmishing of recent months. Its reported pre-tax profit, on an FRS 3 basis, was halved from Pounds 732.8m to Pounds 368.8m, after charges of Pounds 38.7m following its decision to begin depreciating buildings; a Pounds 341.5m property write-down; and Pounds 28m reorganisation and redundancy costs at head office. Stripping out those items, however, pre-tax profits would have increased 6 per cent to Pounds 777m - including a Pounds 7m property gain - beating Sainsbury's forecast in January of a 'small increase'. Mr David Sainsbury, chairman, said gross margins fell 0.4 percentage points in the second half - a result of the 'Essential for essentials' campaign, involving price cuts on 300 own-label products. He added: 'Although the competitive environment is still very tough, we currently expect gross margins to be maintained at around their present level.' His comments failed to convince the stockmarket, however, with Sainsbury's shares falling 3p to 388 1/2 p. Mr Sainsbury said the price competition had been triggered not by surplus space in the grocery market but by rivals Asda and Gateway cutting prices. That had led to a repositioning of margins, but would not escalate into an all-out price war. After a slow start, he added, the 'Essentials' campaign had delivered volume increases averaging 20 per cent on featured products. Group sales for the year to March 12 rose 9.3 per cent to Pounds 11.2bn. Sales in Sainsbury's supermarkets increased 7.1 per cent, with new space contributing 6.5 percentage points. After inflation of 1.5 per cent, like-for-like sales fell 0.9 per cent overall. Operating profits grew only 2.3 per cent to Pounds 732.2m, reflecting the lower margins. The Savacentre hypermarkets lifted sales 8.1 per cent to Pounds 659m, and trading profits 11.8 per cent to Pounds 40.6m. Sainsbury's Homebase, the DIY chain, saw total sales increase 16 per cent to Pounds 328m, with operating profits up 34.3 per cent to Pounds 23.9m. In the US, sales at Shaws supermarkets grew 6.7 per cent to Dollars 1.9bn (Pounds 1.3bn) and profits almost 50 per cent to Dollars 46.5m. Mr Sainsbury said the group would consider further acquisitions in the US, and would reduce the proportion of capital spending on its UK supermarket chain in favour of the other businesses. Earnings per share, after exceptionals, fell from 28.5p to 8p, but the final dividend increased from 7.3p to 7.6p, lifting the total 6 per cent to 10.6p. Lex, Page 22</p>

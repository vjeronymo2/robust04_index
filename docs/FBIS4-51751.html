			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 3 KYODO -- Japan pledged Tuesday [3 May]  to provide Egypt a total of 3.97 billion yen in grant-in-aid to  cooperate in its projects to repair a tunnel and to improve  medical services, the Foreign Ministry said.    Japan's new Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, who is on a  four-  nation Middle East tour, exchanged documents on the Japanese  assistance in Cairo with Egypt's Minister for International  Cooperation Yusuf Butrus-Ghali, the ministry said.    The aid consists of up to 3.06 billion yen to cooperate in  Egypt's project to rehabilitate the Ahmed Hamdi Tunnel [spelling  as received] linking mainland Egypt and Sinai Peninsula, and 913  million yen for a project to improve medical services in the  hospitals in Upper Nile, it said.    The latest aid for the project to rehabilitate the tunnel is  part of the 7.58 billion yen Japan has already pledged to  provide over a four-year period beginning 1992, the ministry  said.    The Ahmed Hamdi Tunnel was built in 1983 but its condition  is  deteriorating because of the corrosion of concrete, it said.    The 913 million yen will be used to purchase basic medical  equipment for six public hospitals in Luxor city and the Qena  Governorate, it said.</p>

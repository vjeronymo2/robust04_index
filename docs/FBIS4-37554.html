			<p>BFN     [Text] Commenting on the interview that AL-SHA'B had  conducted with Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati, the  Iranian interests section office in Cairo has clarified that  Iran denies all the reports that it is sending weapons to Bosnia  in violation of the international resolutions.    The office reiterated Iran's declaration of support for the  oppressed Bosnian Muslim people on all levels and added that the  embargo on weapons to Bosnia to defend its rights is unfair and  that Iran is seriously demanding the lifting of this embargo.</p>

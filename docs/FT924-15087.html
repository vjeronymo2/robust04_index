			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz cuts output MERCEDES-BENZ, the car and truck subsidiary of the Daimler-Benz group, is reacting to slack world economic conditions by extending the Christmas and New Year holiday for its domestic workforce from four days to seven and is not ruling out short-time working in 1993, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt. Daimler-Benz also announced it had acquired a 5 per cent stake in South Korean automotive company Ssangyong Motor. The move follows a co-operation agreement between Mercedes Benz and Ssangyong signed in January 1991. Under this deal, Ssangyong will produce about 50,000 Mercedes MB 100 vans a year under licence from 1994. Mercedes-Benz said in June that it was reducing its workforce substantially through early retirement, the ending of temporary employment contracts, and non-replacement of those leaving. As a result, the German plants will employ 10,500 fewer workers at the end of the year than in January, when the workforce totalled 185,000. Mercedes has already said car output would drop this year by 35,000 to 543,000 units as a result of slower sales at home and uncertainty over exports.</p>

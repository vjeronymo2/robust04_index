			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Bronwen Maddox article: "Half of Country `Is Damaged by </F> Acid Rain'"]    [Text] Buildings and wildlife in half of the UK are being  damaged by acid rain, says a government report published  yesterday.    Scientists say the contraction of the coal industry will cut  the area affected by nearly nine-tenths early next century.    The estimates, prepared for the Department of the  Environment, show that western and northern parts of the UK,  including much of Wales and Scotland, are particularly affected.    Mr. Robert Wilson, chairman of the report's research group,  said the soils and rocks of these areas contained little  alkaline material to counteract the acid.    Last week in Geneva the UK agreed to the terms of a UN  protocol to curb the sulphur dioxide emissions which help cause  acid rain and come largely from coal-burning power stations.  Under the agreement, likely to be signed later this year, the  UK must cut emissions to 50 percent of 1980 levels by the year  2000, and to 30 percent by 2005 and 20 percent by 2010.    Ministers have been assured that the power generation  industry's switch from coal to gas means that the UK can meet  the new obligations.    Environmentalists such as the pressure group Friends of the  Earth have criticised the UK for refusing to sign an earlier  sulphur protocol which expired last year.    The report employs the "critical loads approach" that the UK  has urged international conventions to follow. This takes  account of the environment's sensitivity as well as the extent  of pollution when assessing the impact of acid rain.    The report says that some damage to Scottish heather and to  salmon and trout stocks in Wales can be attributed directly to  acid rain. However, it adds: "It is harder to link damage to  tree health directly to air pollution -- the causes are complex."    About 10 percent of pollution recorded by the study was  found  to come from other countries.    Even if sulphur emissions were curbed sharply some areas,  such as the southern Pennines, "would never recover from layers  of deposits since the Industrial Revolution", the report says.    Negotiations on a protocol to curb nitrogen oxides, which  are  emitted from vehicles and other sources, are expected to take  several years.

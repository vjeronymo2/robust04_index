			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFRIKANERS AGAINST APARTHEID AREN'T RARE  </P> <P> Scott Kraft's excellent article on Andre Brink on April 17 has one significant  misstatement. He says that Brink, as an Afrikaner, is a rarity in  anti-apartheid literature.  </P> <P> Fortunately, Brink has many peers in his Afrikaans community.  </P> <P> A generation ago, when Afrikaans authors began to seriously attack the  shibboleths of their society, the novelists earned the collective title Die  Sestigers, or Men of the Sixties. One could name a dozen writers, including  Prof. J. M. Coetzee of Pochefstroom University who won the coveted Booker Prize  in England. Athol Eugard is both a playwright and novelist.  </P> <P> Nor were they all male. The sentimental novel about apartheid in Afrikaans was  written by Elsa Joubert. Entitled "Poppy Nogena," it traces the endless trials  and tribulations of a black domestic battered hither to yon by government  regulations. It was a sensational bestseller in Afrikaans, was translated into  English and became a successful play.  </P> <P> Whatever their past sins, Afrikaners are redeeming themselves as a moral people  in their churches, their politics and their literature. Andre Brink is a fine  example and Kraft does him justice. But he is not a rarity.  </P> <P> NED MUNGER, Professor of African Politics, Caltech  </P></p>

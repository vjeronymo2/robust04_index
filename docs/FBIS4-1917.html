			<p>BFN     [Text] Chengdu, April 3 (XINHUA) -- In Sichuan Province  more than 85 percent of industrial materials and 95 percent of  daily necessities can be bought from various markets, according  to local government officials.    In 1993 the total transaction volume at the province's more  than 8,600 markets reached 30.2 billion yuan (about 3.47 billion  U.S. dollars), up by 29.53 percent over 1992.    The majority of these markets are engaged in both retailing  and wholesale business, and there are also some specific  exchanges relating to commodities such as means of production,  metals, grain and meat.    Local officials attributed the boom of markets to  preferential policies offered by the provincial government with  regard to financial assistance, land-use and taxation.    During the past two years, the province devoted some 1.2  billion yuan (about 137.9 U.S. dollars) to building up various  forms of markets.    The governments at all levels are also putting emphasis on  taking macro-control over the management of markets to get rid  of activities such as unfair competition, fraud and  counterfeiting and make their development more healthy.</p>

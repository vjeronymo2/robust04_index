			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Observer: Banking on Basle? Central bank governors from the G-10 countries today turn their minds to the difficult task of selecting a successor to Gerry Corrigan as chairman of the Basle committee of international banking regulators. Corrigan is stepping down after leaving his job as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, but there has been no clear front-runner in the search for his successor. Some hot money is on Tommaso Padoa Schioppa, deputy director general of the Bank of Italy, who has already had a stint at the EC in Brussels. His appointment might provide some consolation for his failure to get the job of governor, which was handed to Antonio Fazio in May this year. Other international banking mandarins are whispering that the Dutch are vying for a fresh grab at the top seat, though Corrigan's predecessor, the late Huib Muller, was also from the Netherlands. Brian Quinn, executive director responsible for banking supervision at the Bank of England, might be considered an obvious candidate for the job. But his chances have certainly been damaged by the fuss over the BCCI affair. The fact that the first two Basle chairmen, Sir George Blunden and Peter Cooke, were both from the UK, will also not help.</p>

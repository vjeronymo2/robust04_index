			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Prices spiral must not be allowed to return Sir, I was disturbed to read that Nigel Rudd, chairman of Williams Holdings, blames the low inflationary environment for making it difficult for him to increase prices ('Markets aground on a reef of cautious results', September 20). Isn't that the whole idea? Are we not trying to build a stronger economy by forcing businesses to achieve profit growth through improvements in productivity, quality and design? Has the strategy of trying to raise your prices faster than everyone else not been likened to a dog chasing its tail enough times for people to see it for the fraud that it is? Let lower inflation give Mr Rudd confidence to invest in the future by being able to budget for costs with greater certainty, and let his businesses succeed through value added from investments in training and technology. The ridiculous situation of raising prices to combat rising prices must not be allowed to return. Robin Abbi, 4 Jerome Court, The Limes Avenue, London N11 1RF</p>

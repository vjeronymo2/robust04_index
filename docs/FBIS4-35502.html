			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 31 May (MENA) -- Syrian Foreign Minister  Faruq al-Shar' has said that his country, like other Arab  countries, is upset and hurt at the fighting between the  brothers in Yemen.    He said in press statements today that all recent  indications  pointed to the fact that Yemen was on the brink of a dangerous  situation.    He said: We believe that the use of wisdom and intelligence  and concern over Yemeni unity should prompt the Yemeni leaders  to stop the fighting immediately.    He noted that Syria was hoping the Arab countries would be  able to resolve this problem, and urged the Yemeni brothers to  preserve their unity.    The Syrian foreign minister said that the issue of fighting  in Yemen is a hot issue and that many speakers touched on that  matter today during the sessions of the Non-Aligned Movement's  ministerial conference. It might also be discussed later during  the conference.    He said that the brothers in Yemen, whether in the north or  the south, want Syria, along with some other Arab brothers, to  provide good offices. He pointed out that there is no Syrian  initiative in this regard but Syria is working to stop the  fraternal violence in Yemen.    On the resumption of the Middle East peace talks, especially  on the Syrian-Israeli track, al-Shar' said that before Secretary  Christopher returns to the region and we hear the response of  the Israeli side to the Syrian ideas, which stressed that the  beginnings of a new and serious peace process on the Syrian  track depends on full Israeli withdrawal to the 4 June 1967  lines, a new and united stand should be reached regarding  resumption of negotiations in Washington.    Answering a question on the possibility of Syria accepting  an  Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights over a period of three  years, al-Shar' said: We will not talk about these details  until after Israel agrees to the principle of full withdrawal.    To a questiion regarding announcements by the Israeli prime  minister that Syria is not committed to peace, al-Shar' said: I  believe he is talking about Israel and not Syria. Everyone  knows that Syria is fully involved in peace. We have been  saying this for the past two years and we have affirmed that the  absence of progress in the Washington peace process goes back to  the Israeli stalling in the negotiations.</p>

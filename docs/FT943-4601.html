			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / MPs demand closer scrutiny of royal spending Senior officers of the royal household responsible for the Pounds 20m of taxpayers' money spent each year on Buckingham Palace and other residences occupied by the Queen and her family face closer scrutiny by MPs. A report by the Commons public accounts committee published yesterday rejects voluntary arrangements under which information about the use of the money is made available. It calls for 'public visibility' of the Pounds 20m a year of public money involved, with the National Audit Office having an automatic right of access to the relevant documents. The committee recommends that the royal household should be required to publish an annual report and accounts, instead of merely having to submit them to the Department of National Heritage. It concludes that there is 'no objection to placing the officials of the royal household under comparable systems of scrutiny and control to public servants when dealing with public money'. Apart from Buckingham Palace the Pounds 20m is used in connection with Kensington Palace, St James's Palace, Clarence House and Marlborough House Mews, Windsor Castle, Windsor Great and Home parks, and Hampton Court Mews and Paddock. Members of the committee were critical of the arrangements for administering the net income from public admissions to Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle - expected to amount to Pounds 25m in the next four years. The money, which will go towards the cost of restoring the parts of Windsor Castle severely damaged by fire in 1992, is administered by Royal Collection Enterprises. Mr Michael Peat, director of finance and property services in the royal household, denied having censured Mr Robert Sheldon, the former Labour minister and chairman of the committee, for wanting to study the accounts. Mr Peat likened the decision of Royal Collection Enterprises to give money towards the restoration of Windsor Castle to a charitable donation. Committee of Public Accounts 40th report.

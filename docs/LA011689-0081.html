			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOT CORNER FOR MEMORIES;  </P> <P> MARKET RIPE FOR ANNIVERSARY SERIES OF BASEBALL STATUES  </P> <P> World Series mania might be over until next season but some fans are taking  their enthusiasm into extra innings.  </P> <P> William K. Alley, president of Hartland Plastics in Hartland, Wis., says there  has been a "tremendous rash of orders" for the company's 25th anniversary  series of statues of such immortals as Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle and Ted  Williams.  </P> <P> "The company is behind in the initial orders," he said. "We're playing  catch-up."  </P> <P> Alley, an attorney who has "two kids at the baseball age," bought the company 1  1/2 years ago as "a fun thing."  </P> <P> "I really want to rejuvenate the craftsmanship-workmanship aspect of this," he  said. "The company has about 20 workers who hand-make, hand-paint and  hand-assemble about 500 statues a day -- an exact reproduction under the  direction of Frank Fulop, the original designer."  </P> <P> It was their quality that set the 7- to 8-inch-tall originals apart from most  memorabilia of the '50s and early '60s.  </P> <P> Hartland Plastics, a contract manufacturer for other companies, added the  baseball player statues as a product line, at Fulop's suggestion, to fill in  slack periods between job orders. The firm hired local sculptors to go to  Milwaukee Braves games to sketch players who had signed royalty deals with  Hartland. Not surprisingly, the first players cast were Eddie Mathews, Henry  Aaron and Warren Spahn.  </P> <P> Hartland's original statues -- made from 1958 to 1963 -- are favorites among  collectors of baseball memorabilia. They merit two classified column headings  in Sports Collectors Digest, the enthusiasts' bible.  </P> <P> In one ad, $165 is asked for a Mathews statue, in another, a Nellie Fox with  the original box is priced at $395. A mint-condition Dick Groat, which had a  run of only about 5,000 statues, can bring $500 or more. The 18 players in the  series originally sold for $3.95 to $5.95.  </P> <P> The company abandoned its line of figurines in 1963, switching to makeup  compact cases for a cosmetics firm.  </P> <P> Bob Lemke, the publisher of Sports Collectors Digest, is one serious collector  who is happy that the firm is making the reproductions.  </P> <P> "The original statues are priced out of the range of most collectors," he said.  "This is the next-best thing. It will have no effect on the market for the old  ones. If anything, it increases the interest in the originals. Those who can  afford to buy the originals will do so. Those who can't will be able to buy the  new ones."  </P> <P> Max Himmelstein, owner of a baseball memorabilia shop in Tarzana that trades in  the originals, agreed that the replicas won't hurt the market for the older  statues.  </P> <P> "Topps baseball cards reissued their set of '52 cards and it didn't affect the  price of those," he said.  </P> <P> He has seen the first reissued statue, Ruth.  </P> <P> "It looked real nice, well-made," he said.  </P> <P> The new statues have a pencil-eraser-sized stamp on the back, just below the  players' belts, marking the 25th anniversary. The plastic is whiter than the  originals and Alley said he has gotten some phone calls on that.  </P> <P> Alley was more worried about calls from irate collectors, but he has received  only a "few complaints, and about 700 positive letters."  </P> <P> The letters were a nice boost to Alley, who wasn't sure whether the limited  offering of 10,000 copies of each statue at $23.75 would fly.  </P> <P> Now, says Alley: "Please don't print our address -- we're swamped."  </P></p>

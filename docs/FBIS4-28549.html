			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By M. Krishnamoorthy] </F>   [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, Wed -- Britain will be asked to  clarify the statement by its Trade Minister Richard Needham that  pressure would grow on his government to retaliate if Malaysia  continues with its policy of not awarding government contracts  to British firms.    Acting Foreign Affairs Minister Datuk Abu Hassan Omar said  today Wisma Putra [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] had been  directed to check with the British Government as soon as  possible.    Abu Hassan said the clarification was necessary because  Needham had led a trade delegation with an interest to invest in  and trade with Malaysia.    "I do not think Needham came here with the intention of  seeking to lift the ban on contracts to British firms.    "I think he was here to promote British trade and investment  with Malaysia," Abu Hassan said after being briefed by a Wisma  Putra official.    When asked if the Malaysian Government was considering  lifting the ban, he said that the matter would have to be  studied in the light of recent developments .    We need to see their sincerity of wanting to do business  with  us and at the same time monitor the British media and its  reports on Malaysia."    The issue of lifting the ban, he said, was being studied by  the government.    "Malaysia welcomes British businessmen's interest to invest  in the country. It is a step in the right direction.    "The Government also is happy to have British companies  invest in joint ventures with Malaysian companies and at the  same time we welcome the transfer of technology from Britain,"  he added.    Needham flew into Kuala Lumpur for the second time in two  weeks last Saturday. He was here on May 23 for the Pacific  Basin Economic Council (PBEC) meeting during which he delivered  a letter from British Prime Minister John Major to Prime  Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed. [passage omitted on  Needham speaking to REUTERS]    During his visit, Needham, who met Dr. Mahathir and several  other cabinet ministers with a British trade delegation, had  repeatedly said there were no indications that the ban would be  lifted and that the issue was not discussed.    Needham had said the issue of the ban on government  contracts  for British firms was also not brought up by the British  businessmen in their discussion with Dr. Mahathir as their  priority was seeking more investment opportunities in Malaysia.    But in an about-turn yesterday, he told REUTERS that he  expected the ban to be lifted, possibly within the next six  weeks.    "They've said in principle they're going to take it off. If  I  kept asking when, it won't progress anything. If I had to guess,  I'd say between one week and six weeks," REUTERS quoted him as  saying.    When asked if it was true that the ban would be lifted  within  six weeks Abu Hassan said: It's Needham's views." [passage  omitted]    Dr. Mahathir had said last month that the Government was  reviewing the ban following the removal of Andrew Neil, editor  of London's SUNDAY TIMES, which was in the forefront of the  attack against the [Pergau Dam] deal.</p>

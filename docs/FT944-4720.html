			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Observer: Acorns and oaks Not many places you can get 10 per cent interest on as little as a fiver these days. Of course, there's a catch. The myriad hoarders of small sums in glass jars and bedroom drawers around the Irish Republic have created a shortage of small coins. Which is apparently a serious business over the hectic Christmas period. So the short-changed banks are now offering a 10 per cent bounty for one and two pence coins, counted and bagged and with a minimum value of IPounds 5. Canny leprechauns should start collecting now - for Christmas 1995 . . .</p>

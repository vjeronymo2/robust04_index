			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 6 Apr (MENA)--Chief Palestinian negotiator  Nabil Sha'th has said that the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations  are facing difficulties "but we are seeking a solution to them."    In a statement today, Sha'th said the Palestinian forces are  not ready to enter Gaza and Jericho. He said they will first  come to Egypt from several Arab countries.    The Palestinian official called on the donor states to meet  their obligations now, not after the signing of the agreement.  He said the Palestinians need cash to finance arrangements for  the entry of the Palestinian police into Gaza and Jericho.    Sha'th said Norway is the only country to pay for the  Palestinian police. It has paid $2 million. The other donor  countries have not met their obligations, he said.    Sha'th said the water issue will be discussed at the  Civilian  Affairs Committee in the next round of negotiations.    Nasr Yusuf, a PLO military commander, has stated that the  vanguards of the Palestinian police force, who were scheduled to  enter Gaza and Jericho, will not now go there due to problems  facing the negotiations.    He said there has been no agreement on the final size of the  police force or the timetable for its entry into the self-rule  areas.    Yusuf said the Israelis are linking agreement on the start  of  the negotiations with the signing of an agreement on the  implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of  Principles [sentence as received].    The Palestinian official denied that the two sides agreed  that the Palestinian police force should consist of 9,000 men.    In a related development, MENA has learned that difficulties  appearing at the last minute prevented Israeli officers from  handing over Israeli police barracks to PLO representatives in  Gaza.</p>

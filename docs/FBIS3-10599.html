Approximately 1.5 million quintals of tubers and vegetables  will be picked this month in Havana Province, including a  significant quantity of potatoes, while in April some 2 million  quintals of agricultural products are expected to be harvested.    These measures were adopted to prevent these agricultural  products from reaching other destinations. These measures  include the control of the fleet of trucks that will participate  in the Agro-94 campaign, preventing them from taking other than  assigned routes. These measures will not be limited to the  outskirts of Havana, but will be extended to all of the  capital's distribution and collection areas up to (La Placita).    During the meeting, Palmero Hernandez said that black market  proliferation must be stopped. He added that certain elements  are dedicated to profiting at the expense of the people.</p>

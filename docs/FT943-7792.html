			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Schools: From angst to anthropology - Marilyn Bentley looks at the value of time-out after A-levels For many British 18-year-olds, August is the cruellest month, when two As can mean the difference between a course in anthropology and one in advanced-level angst. It is no surprise that increasing numbers of school-leavers prefer to take time out after A-levels, before the next stage of their education. The self-reliance and maturity gained in a well-spent 'gap-year' can stand young people in good stead whether they go on to academic study or directly into employment, and at 18 they can still afford to be adventurous. Rosamund McDougall edits The Gap Year Guidebook (Peridot Press, Pounds 7.95) and says: 'There is no question about the favourable response of universities towards young people who have done something other than straightforward school studies.' Her book gives a cross-section of opportunities available for travel, short-term employment, voluntary projects, and additional training, from the practical to the exotic, but McDougall emphasises the importance of sensible preparation. Planning effective use of the time requires application and, as with the selection of a higher education course, it pays to begin researching early. It is easy to be carried away by romantic images. Voluntary work in developing countries and long-distance expeditions have a strong appeal to the idealistic young, and some charities will make good use of student labour. Health Projects Abroad channels aid to Tanzania through a volunteer scheme, on which students could find themselves building medical facilities, bricklaying, or plastering alongside local workers. Volunteers are expected to raise Pounds 2,450 in sponsorship money to cover travel, subsistence and insurance, plus a contribution towards the programme. Schemes such as this provide indelible experience for participants. But they are not for the faint-hearted. Regardless of the reputation of the agency or charity chosen, students must do their own homework. McDougall also advises scepticism about environmental expeditions to remote and sometimes hostile regions. Some organisations are merely travel agencies offering thinly-disguised eco-tourism. The Expedition Advisory Centre at the Royal Geographic Society, Kensington Gore, London SW7 publishes Joining an Expedition (Pounds 5), a helpful guide for those with a genuine interest in fieldwork. Studying French in Antibes sounds a more conservative option than protecting African Pangolins in Zimbabwe, but it can pay dividends. Katherine Brand, who runs Cultural and Educational Services Abroad, finds that gap-year students are demanding longer language courses, with a recognised qualification at the end. Young people understand the value of languages as a core skill, and are more serious about acquiring them. 'It used to be 'let's rush off to India',' Brand says. 'Now they want to study, not just for fun but to help their CV, and because they won't have the chance to work on their languages until after their main course of study.' French is still by far the most popular option for native English speakers. The Diplome d'Etudes de Langues Francaise, a public examination recognised by the French Ministry of Education, offers an all-round grounding in French and takes, on average, 12 to 18 weeks to achieve. The diploma is made up of six unit credits which may be taken singly or in combination at each examination session, and students who do not pass all the units while in France can retake in the UK. Using a gap year to enhance or acquire a skill can help finance travel later on. Leith's School of Food and Wine runs cookery courses for people who want to work in ski resorts, on yachts or in private villas. There is a four-week beginners' course (Pounds 1,140) covering basic cooking techniques, and more demanding courses of 10 to 11 weeks at beginners', intermediate and advanced standard. They can be taken singly or in combination. The 11-week beginners' course (Pounds 2,575) would prepare someone for ski chalet work. The intermediate level (Pounds 2,835) teaches more sophisticated cookery and includes some experience of ordering, costing, and cooking for large numbers. Students can also do placements in restaurants, and work on large charity functions for 300 to 400 diners. The advanced course (Pounds 3,000) introduces students to catering management and service, as well as more exotic cuisine. There are practical and written exams at the end of each course. The full year's tuition for Leith's diploma in food and wine costs Pounds 7,500. Young people are unlikely to encounter ski slopes or boeuf en croute through Community Service Volunteers, but working for the benefit of the community brings its own satisfaction. Volunteers may find themselves working in hospitals, schools, or community projects, or assisting disabled people to live in their own homes. They receive Pounds 22 per week pocket money plus board and lodging. Information: Health Projects Abroad, HMS President, Victoria Embankment, London EC4Y 0HJ.

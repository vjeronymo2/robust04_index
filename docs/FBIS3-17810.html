It is  hard to establish to what extent they are true and to what  extent they are false: The heads of the Korean mission and the  Korean security services (the latter are very active in the  Siberian wastes on an entirely official basis) establish their  own procedures there. For example, two women journalists from  THE WALL STREET JOURNAL and a South Korean television crew  looking into the problem were snubbed as "emissaries of  imperialism." Others were taken around "showcase facilities"  which had been seen many times and had to listen to prepared  texts about the happy citizens of their brilliant land being the  freest people on earth.    Nonetheless, your IZVESTIYA correspondent managed to peep  behind the scenes of the customary theater presentation.  <H5>  How It All Began </H5>   The first intergovernmental agreement between the USSR and  the DPRK on joint timber logging on the territory of the Russian  Far East was signed exactly 27 years ago, in March 1967. There  was a great deal of politics in that agreement, but very little  economics.    And although it was pure ideology, we turned a blind eye to  the fact that the Korean comrades often behaved in a manner that  was far from fraternal. Timber industry supervisors suddenly  discovered that Korean workers were secretly chopping down  trees, obtaining the resin, and sending it home. There were no  agreements sanctioning this kind of activity. Local people and  hunting inspectors were increasingly encountering blatant  poaching by Korean loggers. They were using barbaric methods to  kill musk deer, Manchurian elk, and sable and they were laying  waste the celebrated mountain cranberries of Verkhnebureinskiy  Rayon...    For the entire 27-year period the forest protection service  has been keeping records of gross breaches of the forest  management rules by Korean loggers. They fail to clear felling  areas of leftover wood, they destroy new growth, and on only one  occasion in all these years have they planted a small area with  young trees....    One wonders why in heaven's name we concluded the treaty in  the first place.    North Koreans As Saviors of the Industry [subhead]    Strange as it may seem, the most zealous advocates of the  extension of the intergovernmental agreement on joint DPRK and  Russian timber logging in the Far East are the leaders of  Verkhnebureinskiy Rayon, where this predatory logging goes on.  Their main argument is that, if the Koreans leave, the rayon's  timber industry will soon die out because there is no one to  take the place of the foreign state's citizens in this difficult  taiga work. So I was told by rayon administration chief Petr  Titkov, who was himself a timber worker in the recent past and  worked for some years alongside Koreans in the "Urgalles"  association, which represents the Russian side in joint activity  under the intergovernmental agreement.    What economic foundation would Verkhnebureinskiy Rayon lose  with the departure of the Koreans from the taiga forest lots?  Last year the "Urgalles" association, through which all  economic arrangements are made with the "Gastarbeiter" from  North Korea, paid 1.5 billion rubles [R] in taxes into the  federal, kray, and rayon budgets. Some R446 million remained in  the rayon, which is one-tenth of all budget appropriations. A  trifling amount of money these days. But clearly we cannot  expect even that amount this year. This sad conclusion can be  drawn from the results of the work of native loggers since the  beginning of the year.    Their daily round wood production schedule is 4,548 cubic  meters. But they are producing only 1,400-1,500 cubic meters  per day. That is the amount being produced, for example, by the  De-Kastrinskiy timber logging operation. It employs around 600  Russian loggers, whereas the North Korean timber logging  association employs over 6,000.    This answers the question why the rayon bosses are in favor  of a treaty which places the country in bondage: A mass of  problems far removed from the practice of joint timber logging  is being resolved in Chegdomyn, Urgal, and Novyy Urgal by the  almost free workforce from the DPRK. For example, Korean  workers are constructing the Urgal railroach branch  administration building, and local people hire them to dig truck  gardens, repair apartments, erect garages, dachas, and barns...    "Our workers will fleece you real bad," a rather drunk  "native" of Chegdomyn told us candidly, "whereas this bunch --  give them a bowl of soup each or a bottle of moonshine and, boy,  will they work!"    Denial of Rights and the Rights of the Korean Individual  [subhead]    ...It is a common sight in these parts: Emaciated people in  short jackets and Kim Il-song caps, with "great leader" badges  on their chests, roaming the streets of the settlements,  tormented by the continual fear of starvation. Their silent  suffering does not concern the local Russian officials one bit.  The latter have no concept of the fact that it is a grave sin  to exploit people who are dependent on you, taking cynical  advantage of their dependence. If they have to explain  themselves to their own or foreign journalists they have a pat  formula: What we are doing is building relations with the North  Koreans on a purely economic basis. As for delicate matters  such as human rights, they are the Foreign Ministry's concern.    With the connivance of the kray and rayon authorities, North  Korea has long since constructed its own strongholds, like  states within a state, living in accordance with their own  totalitarian laws. Remember 18 months ago, when photographs of  prison cells erected behind the high fences of North Korean  encampments were all over the Russian and foreign press?  Runaway timber loggers told journalists about the sophisticated  torture that went on there, about the severe punishments meted  out for the slightest offense.    The North Korean security service is not only operating in  Chegdomyn and Verkhnebureinskiy Rayon, but is rampaging all over  Russia with impunity. For example, its officers carried out a  search of a Russian woman's apartment in Khabarovsk, suspecting  her of hiding a Korean who had run away from timber logging.    These patently illegal actions take place with the consent  of  our law-enforcement organs. Their DPRK colleagues evidently  have some kind of agreement, the text of which is secret. All  we do know is that our militia is helping the North Korean  security service to catch runaways, who are increasing in  numbers with each passing year. When caught they are  immediately handed over to Korean "comrades," and what happens  then is shrouded in mystery. There are currently more than 50  people on the run.    There is one very worrying element: There has been a sharp  fall in the amount of timber cut, while the Korean side is  ordering more and more galvanized iron from "Urgalles" to make  coffins for people killed in "accidents." Formerly any incident  of this kind would have been carefully investigated by our  technical experts and the findings of a forensic medical expert  on the cause of death would have been required. Now the  procedure has been "simplified": No examinations are carried  out, the bodies are kept in a refrigerator, and they are then  taken home in a special freightcar.    We made a considerable effort to arrange a visit to the  North  Korean hospital where loggers are treated, but our way was  barred as if it were a top-secret strategic facility. V.  Cherepanov, a surgeon from Chegdomyn hospital, who has access to  the hospital, said that conditions in the "hospital" were  squalid, to put it mildly: Water has to be brought in, the  toilets are outside, the premises are primitive, are there are  hardly any medicines....    It should be borne in mind what kind of diet the citizens of  the "brilliant land" have. A senior party official from the  DPRK timber logging mission recited a long list of all the  things their workers allegedly receive: Every month around five  kg of meat, nearly 30 kg of rice and fresh vegetables each,  fish.... Knowing that in Khabarovsk a kilogram of fresh  cucumbers currently costs more than R5,000 and tomatoes around  R10,000 and that in Chegdomyn the price is nearly twice as high  as that, we wanted to know where the Korean comrades got the  vegetables from.    "We have our own wonderful hothouses, which provide  abundant crops," came the reply.    In Chegdomyn we learned that nothing had been grown in  hothouses for two years and the Korean workers were not even  getting their national dish -- "kimchi," highly seasoned cabbage  -- and their diet consisted of rice alone....    ...The intergovernmental agreement on joint timber logging  in  the Russian Far East between our country and the DPRK expired on  31 December. So far a new one has not been signed. But if it  is considered economically expedient to continue thos  cooperation, our country, which loudly proclaims itself  democratic, is simply obliged to stop foreigners doing whatever  they like on our fatherland's territory.</p>

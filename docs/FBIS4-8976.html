			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Lech Walesa said that amendments to the  Constitution would mean not only new parliamentary but also new  presidential elections. This was in response to a proposal to  amend the Small Constitution tabled by the government coalition  deputies who want the Sejm, not the president, to have the last  word on appointing members of the government.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Katarzyna Kolenda] In an  interview for Lithuanian television, Lech Walesa said that he  had to give an example for the future because, according to him,  the rules of the Constitution should not be changed according to  the political situation.    [Walesa] The president guards the Constitution, and if he is  elected and has agreed to a Constitution, this Constitution  cannot be changed in the midddle of the presidential term of  office. The system cannot be changed in the middle of the term  because then an honest president has to prevent this from  happening by using all available means.    [Kolenda] The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] has officially  invited the president to take part in the meeting of its  parliamentary floor group.    [Kwasniewski, SLD leader, identified by screen caption] I am  ready for these talks. Everything is up to the president  because it is better to keep talking. [passage omitted]    [Kolenda] Both sides declare that the talks are the only way  of solving this conflict, the conflict that has been going on  for some weeks. It is known unofficially that the president and  the coalition have set conditions that exclude any meeting.  Everything points to the fact that a solution to the conflict  and an appointment of the new finance minister are still far  away. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The beleaguered tanker Exxon Valdez will probably be towed into San Diego Bay  for repairs on Sunday after tests are made to determine whether the ship is  leaking any more significant amounts of oily discharges. The Exxon Shipping Co.  and the state of California have agreed that the ship cannot leak any more  before entering the harbor, but the state has said it will be "reasonable"  about leakage and the Coast Guard has said it will permit any discharge that  can be contained by cleanup equipment surrounding the ship. Oily discharges  have come sporadically from the ship's hull since it was towed here from Alaska  after a collision with a reef that dumped 11 million gallons of oil along a  once pristine shoreline.  </P></p>

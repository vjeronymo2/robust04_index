			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Boot bucks sector trend with 19% rise to Pounds 6.4m TAXABLE PROFITS of Henry Boot &amp; Sons, the Sheffield-based construction and property group, rose by 19 per cent to Pounds 6.36m in 1990 to provide a rare profits advance in what was a very difficult year for most construction groups. Turnover declined to Pounds 131.03m (Pounds 136.13m), but earnings rose 15 per cent to 76.1p (66.1p) per share. The company proposed a final dividend of 18p to make a total of 25p. This compares with 21p in 1989. Mr Jamie Boot, managing director, said the group had a much lower exposure to residential and commercial property markets than many construction companies which have suffered as a result of falling demand in these markets. Boot has no borrowings. At the end of 1989 Boot had cash of about Pounds 9m. This position is thought to have remained largely unchanged at the end of last year. The company, of which the Boot family owns just over 50 per cent, said the construction market had of late become more difficult. It warned that it was unlikely 'that the past level of growth in earnings will be maintained in the foreseeable future'.</p>

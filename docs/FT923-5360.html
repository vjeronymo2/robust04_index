			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / People: Back to bits and bytes The hectic pace and unpredictability of the computer industry can prove addictive. Terry Radford, a 46-year old veteran of Olivetti, Sperry Univac (now Unisys) and Apricot, is returning to the world of bits and bytes after a spell in charge of the European operation of Ampex, a US supplier of video systems to the broadcasting industry. Recently appointed general manager of Data General's UK and Irish operations, he likens it to 'coming home'. 'It took me a whole morning to settle in'. Data General, one of the pioneers of the minicomputer industry, has had a rough ride over the past few years but Radford believes the company is over the worst: 'It has got its product strategy and production costs right while others still have to make that transition'. It now specialises in 'open' systems, which follow broad industry standards rather than proprietary designs, and has recently won orders from Customs &amp; Excise and the Department of Employment. Open systems come as second nature to Radford. At Apricot (now ACT) he is still remembered as 'Mr Unix' (after the most popular open systems design), and as someone who did a lot to put Apricot on the open systems map. Now his principal task is to restore Data General's lustre in the most challenging circumstances. 'What I have to do is to persuade customers that it is fashionable again to buy from Data General' is how he puts it.</p>

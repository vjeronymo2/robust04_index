			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HANDYMAN Q&amp;A: HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> TOO MUCH AIR PUMPED WHEN OPERATING WELL  </P> <P> QUESTION: I use a shallow-well jet pump for watering my garden. The problem is  that it pumps too much air. The point is located 20 feet below the surface and  there's always about 8 feet of water standing in the pipe.  </P> <P> I attached a 30-gallon tank to the pump to hold reserve water for priming the  pump. Every week I must release 10 pounds of air from the tank. Why am I  getting all the air?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Since you mention that there's a point at the end of the well piping, I  assume you have a driven well and not a drilled or dug well. The pipe that's  driven is the pipe through which the water flows.  </P> <P> The problem with removing the pump and measuring the water level is that it's  being measured under static conditions. When the water is being drawn up the  pipe, the level will drop.  </P> <P> You can check the level of water in the pipe when it's being pumped by  connecting a vacuum gauge to the suction line after the check valve. The gauge  is calibrated in inches of mercury. One inch of vacuum will pull up water 1.13  feet.  </P> <P> If the gauge reads 20 inches, the pump is lifting water 22.6 feet. This  includes the effort needed to overcome the friction of the water against the  inside wall of the pipe.  </P> <P> If all the joints are tight, then your problem appears to be caused by a low  level of water when the pump is running. As the water is pumped, the level  descends to the strainer at the end of the point and sucks air from around the  pipe. Although there's no guarantee that it will work, you might try driving  the point down another 5 to 10 feet.  </P> <P> You should not have to prime the sump each time it's used. If priming is  necessary, then there's either a leak in the suction line, a faulty check  valve, or possibly both.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Removing Linoleum to Uncover Floor  </P> <P> Q: We would like to refinish the hardwood floor that's under the linoleum in  our kitchen. Is there an easy way to remove the linoleum?  </P> <P> A: Unfortunately, there is no easy way. If the hardwood floor consists of oak  strips and was originally smooth, then the linoleum was probably glued directly  to the floor.  </P> <P> Begin by cutting the linoleum into 12-inch strips with a utility knife. Be  careful to set the blade depth so you don't cut into the wood. Use a long-edged  trowel to pry up the linoleum strips. A heat gun will help soften the adhesive  as you go. Eventually, you'll remove all the linoleum and some of the adhesive.  Portions of the linoleum's felt backing, however, will stick to the adhesive  that remains.  </P> <P> If your hardwood floor had open joints or crevices, it was probably leveled  with a quick-setting, plaster-like compound before the linoleum was applied. In  this case, prior to lifting the strips, pound on the linoleum with a flat  object to crumble the leveling compound and facilitate lifting.  </P> <P> After removing the linoleum, you'll have to sand the floor. Be aware that up  until about five years ago, the felt backing of linoleum contained asbestos.  Have a sample analyzed.  </P></p>

She  was also selected Foothill Conference Coach of the Year last season.  </P> <P> She will take over a Mt. Sac team that has struggled to records of 12-18 in the  1987-88 season and 10-19 last season. But Looker has high hopes for the  program.  </P> <P> "It's going to improve," Looker said. "In the long run, it has the potential to  win league and do well in state competition."  </P> <P> Looker expects to improve the Mounties through recruiting.  </P> <P> Former Los Angeles Rams defensive lineman Doug Barnett has been named women's  softball coach at Azusa Pacific University.  </P> <P> Barnett, 29, replaces Laura Wood, who resigned to pursue other opportunities in  her home state of Washington.

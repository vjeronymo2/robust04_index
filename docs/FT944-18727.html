			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / IMF thrown into disarray over plan to lift reserves: G7 officials blame fund managing director for breakdown of negotiations The world's system of international monetary co-operation was thrown into crisis last night after members of the International Monetary Fund failed to agree on plans to boost the world's monetary reserves by Dollars 23.5bn (Pounds 14.8bn). An acrimonious meeting of the IMF's policymaking interim committee ended with a vague agreement to raise the ability of IMF members to borrow from the fund in times of trouble. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, who played a key role in the negotiations, said the outcome was 'disappointing'. Mr Clarke had pressed other IMF members to accept a selective issue of the IMF's own reserve asset  -known as the special drawing right - to boost their international reserves. 'One or two key players who had presented standards of high principle' had blocked agreement, the chancellor said. As a result, the big industrial countries had been unable to boost the monetary reserves of poor developing countries and the mainly former communist states, including Russia, that had become IMF members since 1981. Mr Clarke said there was little chance of reviving the scheme. Also lost were plans to boost the systemic transformation facility, set up by the IMF to give financial help to former communist countries. The interim committee was plunged into what one official described as a 'flaming row' after developing countries refused to accept proposals from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations that they should accept a selective increase in global reserves of SDR16bn. The developing countries said that was inadequate and pinned their faith on Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, who had long campaigned for a general increase of SDR36bn, benefiting all members. At the end of the meeting, G7 officials said much of the blame for the breakdown lay with Mr Camdessus. Some officials said the status of the IMF as an international financial institution could be undermined by the seemingly arcane dispute. The officials said Mr Camdessus had caused poor developing countries to believe that there was more on offer while the G7 proposal was the 'only show in town'. The managing director appeared unwilling to reflect the views of the industrial countries that have a clear majority of votes on the Fund's board. G7 officials said Mr Camdessus had alienated Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary and representative of the fund's biggest shareholder, through his constant campaigning for a larger general SDR increase and failing to back the G7 view. However, Mr Camdessus was unrepentant at a midnight press conference. He denied it was his job to represent G7 views and insisted he would not be resigning from his post. Yesterday's meetings began hopefully enough. The discussions in the interim committee followed the unanimous agreement of the G7 on Saturday, although it emerged that France had accepted the UK-US plan only grudgingly. The SDR issue - the first since 1981 - was specially structured to benefit 37 countries, including Russia, that had no SDRs in their reserves. It was also designed to strengthen the reserves, and hence the import capability, of developing nations. Conference reports Page 7 Lloyd Bentsen Page 19 Observer Page 19</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Cacophony of calls on state burden Sir, While Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz's analysis of European competitiveness is typically penetrating (Personal View, November 17), his assertion that 'with the notable exception of Unice, nobody is talking about the size, cost and burden of the state in Europe's economies' is astonishingly blinkered. Many other business representative organisations, including chambers of commerce, have been lobbying for years for deregulation, reduction in public spending and withdrawal of the state. National governments, similarly, have been pressing for deregulation, following a trail blazed by the UK. Indeed in May, Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, supported a call by Gunther Rexrodt, Germany's economic minister, for deregulation. Furthermore, at a European level, the Corfu summit established, under Bernard Molitor, a group charged with putting forward proposals for lifting the burden of legislation, while the Commission is establishing a standing committee for administrative simplification. Unice is no lone voice. There is a cacophony of calls for less burdensome state that the Commission should not ignore. Richard Brown, deputy director general, The Association of British Chambers of Commerce, 9 Tufton Street, London SW1P 3QB</p>

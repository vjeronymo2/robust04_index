			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Record shows mutuality no handicap Sir, Perhaps as the chief executive of the oldest mutual life assurance society in the world - The Equitable, founded 1762 - I might be permitted to join the debate on mutuality. Mr Instone's comments (Letters, September 19) are unsubstantiated. An inspection of the published tables of the results of with-profits policies will show a domination by mutual offices. It is ironic that he comments on the difficulty of devising a voting structure for policyholders of a mutual. That may be true but at least they do have a voice and are not subordinated to the interests of proprietors. The Equitable can offer more than 230 years of living proof of the successful application of the mutual concept. Our sole aim is, and always has been, to deliver services and benefits at cost to our policyholders. The advantages of that dedication are evident from our record. We have the lowest costs in the industry, we have the most advanced systems, we attract the highest amounts of annual premium new business, we have the lowest lapse rate, our 'maturities' are consistently in the top few across all products and durations, surrender values are 'competitive', etc. All of that has been achieved without raising a penny from outside sources. It is fashionable to knock the concept, but a society run on mutual grounds concentrating wholly on benefits to members and not answerable to outside interests and influences can be one of the most effective forms of incorporation. It is far from being the handicap envisaged by Mr Instone. R H Ranson, managing director and actuary, Equitable Life Assurance Society, Walton Street, Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire HP21 7QW</p>

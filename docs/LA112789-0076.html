			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUOTABLE  </P> <P> "My colleagues . . . are all moaning about the high prices for works of art and  the changes in the tax laws that have had a great impact on museums and the  building of collections. But I don't think it's totally negative. What does a  museum do? It rethinks priorities. Where will it put its attention if this  continues? On younger artists -- a very good thing because the works are still  reasonable in price."  </P> <P>  -- Richard Koshalek, director of Los Angeles' Museum of Contemporary Art, in  Artweek.  </P></p>

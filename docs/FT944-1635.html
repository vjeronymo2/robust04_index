			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Bond prices in Tokyo ended the week little changed in a market that has become directionless as traders await developments. The benchmark 10-year government bond ended the week at 96.84 yielding 4.595 per cent, compared with 4.62 per cent a week earlier. On Friday, bonds moved in the opposite direction to stocks, rising in early trading, then sliding back towards the close. The easy credit stance of the Bank of Japan continues to mitigate against higher interest rates in the near term. By the end of the week, the BoJ had injected Y1,100bn into the money market, including Y300bn in loans to commercial banks. The total, which was on the high side of market expectations, included about Y190bn in three-month CDs issued at 2.34 per cent, which found a ready market with short-term fund managers who see little chance of a rate rise. On Friday, outgoing BoJ governor Mr Yasushi Mieno called for the injection of sufficient liquidity into the economy for banks to trade the non-performing loans that are the legacy of the bursting of the 'bubble economy'. Mr Mieno also said Japan's current account surplus must be reduced by correcting the imbalance between savings and investment in Japan. Mr Yasuo Matsushita, his successor, is expected to tread much the same path.</p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / A bulletin from Gordon Pepper THE red Queen commanded Alice to believe 12 impossible things before breakfast every morning. The financial markets are less ambitious: they cling to only one impossible thing, but they cling to it with a passion. The efficient markets hypothesis is often demonstrably untrue; but it is taken as the basis for rules which have put hitherto respectable men in prison. Some hypothesis. It states simply that market prices reflect all the information available at any given moment - a tautology; but it goes on to draw some very strong conclusions, which as any logician will tell you is a very dangerous thing to do with a tautology. The hypothesis implies that markets can only be efficient, and thus price assets correctly, if all information is instantly available to all traders at all times. This has led to fierce regulations, demanding what can be summed up in a word, transparency. Hence the laws against insider trading, and the argument over disclosure of trading information which is holding up the European directive on investment service, and which so long delayed the merger of the London futures markets. Hence the Blue Arrow affair; and hence, too, the flight of investment professionals to over-the-counter markets; and much else. It's all so logical that it's a wonder how we ever got on without it. Yet we did get on without it, as Professor Gordon Pepper points out in a fascinating and refreshingly lucid paper* for the Capital Markets Forum. He reminds us that the after-market in new issues was blatantly managed by the issuing houses in pre-Big Bang days, and were applauded for their efforts. They were thought to be preserving orderly markets. The government still does something rather similar with privatisation issues, and nobody raises an eyebrow. The same eyebrows, however, shoot up when the government changes the regulations under which privatised utilities work. Muse about that contrast for a moment, and you may arrive for yourself at the central insight of Prof Pepper's paper: that there are two quite different classes of information in the market. One information set covers the operations of companies, and the economic forces acting on them. A quite different set concerns trading positions in the market itself. Prof Pepper broadly accepts that the first class should be displayed transparently - though as company chairmen agonising over the timing of a profits warning know very well, it can be awfully difficult to distinguish a fact from a queasy feeling. It is during this uneasy time, as he points out to my delight, that insider traders can actually perform very useful functions, by feeding their well-informed hopes and fears into the price. When it comes to trading information, however, Prof Pepper takes the opposite view: he argues that the knowledge, say, of a large forced seller in the market actually unsettles trading, reduces liquidity, and can push prices a long way from what would be justified on the fundamentals. This is surely a matter of everyday market experience. It helps to explain the choppy price movements in Tokyo, where an instinct that bargains are now available fights rumours that this or that strapped bank will have to sell, regardless. Prof Pepper's analysis also helps to explain the central difficulty with the efficient market hypothesis: the fact, accepted by every investment house which buys chart analysis, that prices do not simply respond to information shocks about the fundamentals, but display clear trends, resistance points and the rest. This is the work of trading information, not fundamentals. It is a pity that Prof Pepper does not go on to suggest rules to fit his analysis, but merely warns that regulations based on efficient market theory can be badly flawed. But regulators should study his paper, and hope for more in his forthcoming book. *Obtainable from Capital Markets Forum, 2 Harewood Place, Hanover Square, London W1R 9HB.</p>

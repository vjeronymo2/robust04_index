			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Books: Rape - or murder DEGREE OF GUILT by Richard North Patterson Hutchinson Pounds 14.99, 548 pages HANDS ON by Andrew Rosenheim Mandarin Pounds 5.99, 282 pages THE LAST STATION by Jay Parini HarperCollins Pounds 14.99, 290 pages DISAPPEARANCE by David Dabydeen Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 7.99, 180 pages IN A hotel room in San Francisco, America's most famous modern novelist lies dead. Next to him, still clutching the gun that killed him, a beautiful woman struggles to rearrange her clothing. She is a nationally known TV journalist and she has just fended off a rape attack, the kind of attack associated with the likes of Mike Tyson or William Kennedy Smith. She has been forced to kill to protect her honour - or so she claims, and who is going to argue with her? Yet there is no evidence of sexual arousal in the victim and the scratches on the woman appear to have been self-inflicted. She certainly could not have fired the gun the way she explained it to the police. Was she really attacked or is she only faking? And if she is faking, why? Step forward Californian lawyer Christopher Paget, world renowned as the man who uncovered a Watergate-style scandal a few years back and forced the resignation of America's President. Paget is the man to defend the woman on a murder charge, if anyone is. He knows her very well, after all. They enjoyed a brief fling 15 years ago and have a son to prove it. But is the mother of his child really to blame for the killing, and if so, how much to blame? The degree of guilt is impossible to judge in a case like this. It is a subject that has been extensively aired in real life recently and the author makes no secret of his debt to the Kennedy Smith trial and the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas sexual harassment case. He tells a good story, though without the dramatic flair of a Scott Turow. But it should make a splendidly slick movie in due course. The victim in Degree of Guilt was America's most famous living novelist. In Hands On, a second novel by Andrew Rosenheim, the victim is America's most famous living poet, a four-times married old reprobate who is the father of computer whizz kid Robert Madison. Robert has abandoned a professorship at Harvard for a job at Oxford, where he is the Artificial Intelligence guru for an electronics company, charged specifically with the task of teaching a computer to write. The author is obviously talking from the heart because he himself came to Oxford as a Rhodes scholar and stayed to become Director of Electronic Publishing at OUP. He is as well placed as anyone to make a computer write, one day. Meantime he is indulging in a little wish fulfilment with a blackly comic tale of computer programming and corporate life in the electronics world. It is an engaging piece of work. Madison eventually persuades the computer to write poetry indistinguishable from his father's, thus revenging himself for the old boy's bad behaviour during his childhood. One could name a few novelists in the same spirit, whose stuff has clearly been written by computers for years . . . Happily, Jay Parini would not be among them. His historical novel The Last Station won a small prize in America a couple of years ago and deserves to succeed here as well. It tells the story in six different voices of Leo Tolstoy's last days, as seen by the various factions warring round him - his wife, daughter, doctor, secretary, chief disciple and hanger-on - and last, but not least, as seen by Tolstoy himself. Parini has used historical records whenever possible, but where there are holes in the narrative he has cheerfully plugged the gap himself. The result is a very plausible study of Tolstoy's terminal decline, beginning with unhappy days at Yasnaya Polyana and continuing via his sudden departure from home to his last illness and death at Astapovo station, surrounded by more than a hundred journalists from around the world. The story is perfectly well known, but Parini manages to bring it alive again, as if the reader is there, rather than simply reading about it, which is a much harder trick than it looks. David Dabydeen's Disappearance is an allegory of England in decay, as seen through the eyes of a young Guyanan working on an engineering project near Hastings. The Guyanan's job is to shore up a cliff and so prevent a village from crumbling into the sea. He makes friends with his landlady and learns much from her about the failings and inadequacies of his adopted land. It is all so very different from the mother country he had admired from afar, as a youngster in the Caribbean. Even the sea wall is suspect, after he has completed it. The author's message is uncompromising, but he writes well, even lyrically. Guyanan himself, he has chosen to make his own home in England, so perhaps the country is not quite as hopeless as he depicts it here.</p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALICE KAHN: A BIRTHDAY PARTY TAKES THE CAKE  </P> <P> Like a mythic figure somewhere between Mother Goose and the Good Witch of the  North, Dear Abby came for us. "What should I call you?" asked my 10-year-old  daughter, Hannah. "Should I call you Abby or Dear?"  </P> <P> "Call me Abby, honey," said Pauline Esther (Popo) Friedman Phillips, a.k.a.  Abigail Van Buren. She sat not in a golden coach or a pumpkin shell but in a  huge white stretch limo with smoked-glass windows and a bar and a phone and a  television set and a VCR.  </P> <P> "This is so cool!" Hannah whispered in my ear as we drove off into the Beverly  Hills sunset.  </P> <P> But what do you talk about with Dear Abby? Perhaps I should just turn to her  and say what's on my mind:  </P> <P> DEAR ABBY: My mother died before my daughter Hannah was born. She was such an  indulgent grandma, always sending my older daughter, Emma, beautiful little  dresses and toys, even if she couldn't afford them. I know it sounds  irrational, but I keep dreaming she'll come back and do something special for  Hannah. Am I nuts?  </P> <P> FAIRY-TALE BELIEVER  </P> <P> Abby had written to me. Not because I wrote to her, but out of the blue --  wonderful letters saying kind things about my column. I called and asked to  take her to lunch, but she was busy churning out the six columns a week a  working girl must do to pay the limo bill. Now, Hannah and I are her dinner  guests. We follow her into an elegant French restaurant. I realize that Emma  will kill me for this later.  </P> <P> Rows of young waiters, like a Busby Berkeley chorus line, fall in with, "Good  evening, Mrs. Phillips" and "Nice to see you, Abby." We are seated in her  private dining room, which looks out over the dimly lit scene. "This way, we  can still watch the couples smooching," she says.  </P> <P> I'm reminded that she was no sob sister when she entered the old boys' world of  journalism in the '50s. She made it on saucy one-liners, like her response to  the reader who wrote, "What's the difference between a wife and a mistress?"  "Night and day," Her Dearness responded.  </P> <P> Perhaps others, besides her hairdresser, know the secret of how Abby, who  turned 71 on the Fourth of July, still looks like a girl of 50. As she sits  between Hannah and me, I note her blue-and-white silk dress and matching coat,  her pearl-and-diamond necklace, her purple pumps and purple Chanel bag, and the  perfect red nails on her tiny white hands.  </P> <P> Hannah struggles to eat the huge filet mignon, even after she has brushed aside  the yucky stuff called foie gras. I am enjoying my duck in raspberry sauce,  which at 24 bucks a pop ain't chopped liver. I'm acquainted with Abby's  biography because my older daughter had done a report last year on the famous  Sioux City twins -- Abby and her sister, Esther Pauline (Eppie) Friedman  Lederer, a.k.a. Ann Landers.  </P> <P> I tell Abby that we have a few things in common besides the fact that her dad  from Minsk and my dad from Pinsk came to Midwestern America and opened movie  theaters. Like her, I didn't start writing a column until my late 30s and, like  her, I began with the San Francisco Chronicle.  </P> <P> "When I went to the Chronicle, I didn't even have a Social Security number,"  Abby says. "I said I'd gladly do it for free, but they insisted I be paid."  </P> <P> I suggest, "They'd take it for free today."  </P> <P> Every question I ask Abby turns out to be a cliche. "What did you think of  Nathanael West's 'Miss Lonelyhearts'?"  </P> <P> "Honey, everyone always asks me that."  </P> <P> Hannah asks the questions nobody has ever asked before: "Are those real  diamonds? . . . Is that really your chauffeur? . . . Are you friends with any  movie stars that you like?"  </P> <P> Singing waiters arrive bearing a special chocolate Charlotte cake with a candle  in it for Hannah's "birthday," which was actually three months ago. It is just  the kind of dramatic deed my mother would have done.  </P> <P> Sated with cake, Hannah announces: "This is the fanciest restaurant I have ever  been to. This is the longest dinner I have ever sat through."  </P> <P> We leave. The coach awaits us. The chauffeur-cum-bodyguard takes us to Rodeo  Drive and follows us as we stroll. Cameras roll as celebs and long-legged  ladies enter a Leroy Neiman gallery opening. A few doors down, there's another  bash for an artist whose oeuvre consists of paintings of Brooke Shields on  motorcycles. A man gets out of his Rolls-Royce and says to us, "Three girls out  on the town?"  </P> <P> Abby takes Hannah's hand and leads her up Rodeo on a docent's tour through this  big-ticket Disneyland. Then she kisses us good night and sends us to bed.  </P> <P> Later, I tell Hannah, "I wish I hadn't had wine. It seemed like such a dream."  </P> <P> "But it was like a dream to me too," she says. "Did you see her rings? We're  talking big ones."  </P> <P> Hannah may remember the sparkly things -- the chandelier in the restaurant and  Abby's diamond earrings. But when I think back to that night in Beverly Hills,  I'll remember Mama.  </P></p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Observer: Behind the facade There's often, if not usually, more interest in what a company chooses not to say when publicly announcing the appointment of a new non-executive director than in the facts it takes pains to make known. Take for instance Malcolm Parkinson, at 45 the first Pro-Ned-sponsored recruit to the board of builders' merchants James Latham. 'A marketing specialist' who has 'forged a distinguished career', purrs the stock exchange announcement, going on to recount how he built up the do-it-yourself chain B &amp; Q, then moved on to help defeat Dixon's unwelcome bid for Woolworth Holdings before becoming chief executive of the same. End of official story. But surely all that was more than five years ago. Is not this the same Parkinson who quit Woolworths in November 1987 for a Pounds 150,000- a-year job as a director of Benlox, the tiny engineering group which he and merchant banker Peter Earl used to attempt a ludicrously ambitious takeover of Storehouse? After Benlox's Pounds 2bn bid flopped, Parkinson launched the Retail Corporation, with Pounds 10m by way of backing, which aimed to set up a nationwide chain of garden centres. That tumbled into receivership a year ago. So what might be the moral? Don't listen to professional publicists, for one thing. And keep announcements of non-executive board appointments as brief as possible - name, age and current occupation are all that's required.</p>

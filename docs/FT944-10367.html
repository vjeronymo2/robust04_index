			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Water company turns off party funds Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, one of France's largest construction and utilities groups, said yesterday it was halting political contributions following a series of corruption investigations which have shaken French business and political circles. The announcement is the most significant move so far by French companies which are seeking to defuse allegations of corruption. It could push other large business groups to adopt a similar policy ahead of next spring's presidential elections. Generale des Eaux, the principal rival of Lyonnaise des Eaux, said yesterday it was reviewing its position on campaign financing. Utilities and public works companies are the largest corporate contributors to political campaigns. Through their subsidiaries, some of them have been linked to investigations of illicit financing of political parties. Subsidiaries of Lyonnaise des Eaux, have been investigated in a case which forced the resignation in July of Mr Alain Carignon, the former communications minister. Mr Carignon faces charges of receiving funding for his political campaigns from a subsidiary of Lyonnaise des Eaux in return for public works contracts in Grenoble, where he is mayor. Lyonnaise des Eaux denies any wrongdoing. Mr Jerome Monod, chairman of Lyonnaise des Eaux, said yesterday that laws relating to company contributions to political parties were complex and unclear. He had decided 'to suspend all contributions to political parties until new laws are promulgated to clarify appropriate conduct in this area'. The move reflects concern among leading French business groups. 'It shows a defensive attitude,' says Mr Francois Morin, director of Lerep, the economic and political research institute. 'The large utilities groups have been destabilised by the climate of corruption.' The utilities groups are taking other steps to redress their image. Generale des Eaux is drawing up a code of ethics relating to the conduct of company officials in seeking public works contracts. It said yesterday it favoured legislation either to prevent the direct financing of individual candidates or restrict party financing to the national level. The National Federation of Public Works is preparing a code by which its 6,000 member companies would promise not to offer bribes to win the FFr150bn (Pounds 18bn) of public contracts they carry out each year. Bouygues, a large construction group, has resisted the proposal and the implication of previous wrongdoing, comparing the proposal to 'a motorist promising, from tomorrow, to obey the highway code'. However, the spate of corruption investigations which have prompted two ministerial resignations and seen leading businessmen placed under investigation, has prompted calls for stronger action. An all-party parliamentary committee is discussing banning direct corporate funding of political parties. At present, a 1990 law limits to FFr500,000 the amount that a company can donate to a political party. But the payment of donations through subsidiaries has enabled groups to make much larger overall contributions. In the 1993 parliamentary elections, for example, Lyonnaise des Eaux donated about FFr7.7m to political parties.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Vision of unity for embattled central America - A commitment to freer trade and integration among six poor republics THE SIX small, poor republics of central America, still suffering the fallout from more than a decade of ruinous civil wars, huge foreign debts, and injudicious economic policies, made an important commitment last week to economic integration. The six presidents signed an agreement on Friday which will set them on course for free trade within the area and lay the foundations for deeper political harmonisation - for those that want it. It reflects the view of politicians and the business community that greater economic integration is essential if central America's 30m inhabitants are to avoid being swamped economically by extra-regional competitors. While short on binding measures or concrete commitments, the agreement is an important statement of intent to strengthen regional integration in the new realities of central America. The deal comes in the form of a protocol to the original 1960 General Treaty on Central American Economic Integration which created the Central American Common Market. The new model of integration with a common external tariff of 20 per cent replaces an import substitution one based on high external tariffs. With the exception of Panama, all the countries have already adopted this new regime. The presidents also undertook to speed up the removal of the last of the internal non-tariff barriers that have been erected over the past decade or so. Objections by Costa Rica to anything beyond merely trade initiatives forced the core group of four - Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua (Panama is something of a special case) - to make 'voluntary and gradual' the protocol's implementation. Panama has only recently thrown its hat in with central America and is expected to move more slowly on integration. Mr Rafael Rodriguez, the secretary general of Sieca, the technical body which has drafted the nuts and bolts of the agreement, admitted that he would have liked deadlines for the commitments in the protocol, but denied that its voluntary nature would diminish commitment. 'It is not a strait-jacket,' he said. 'There is an element of flexibility.' While the Costa Rican government insisted it supported free trade in the region, it would not accept a customs union, the free movement of labour or a commitment to a single currency. 'If we allowed free movement of labour, a million Nicaraguans would cross over our northern border to seek work,' Mr Roberto Rojas, the Costa Rican trade minister said in an interview recently. Nor did Costa Rica, which receives 50 per cent of its fiscal revenue from import duties, wish to lose control over its collection, implied by a customs union, where any central American port would act as a point of entry to the region. During the 1980s, civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua, trade barriers, and mutual hostility between Nicaragua's left-wing Sandinistas and the region's right-wing military-dominated governments contributed to a drop in intra-regional trade from a peak of Dollars 1.1bn in 1980 to Dollars 450m in 1986. This year trade flows are expected to pass Dollars 1bn. But the new vision of integration is not just about trade. Recently El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala, abolished passport controls for their citizens, and plans are well advanced on connecting stock markets and allowing banks, brokerage houses and other financial institutions to operate in each other's country. The region's governments, which by happy coincidence are at the moment cut more or less from the same ideological cloth, are endeavouring to co-ordinate macro-economic policy, adopting realistic exchange rates and the tight fiscal policies recommended by the international financial institutions. Greater co-ordination on trade issues has already born some fruit. The five central American nations were the first to get together behind a plan to withhold 20 per cent of coffee exports to push up world prices, which came into effect on October 1. Central America has also been told repeatedly by the US that its chances of reaching a free trade agreement would be greatly increased if it could negotiate en bloc, despite Costa Rica's efforts to cut its own deal. Similarly the bloc has already negotiated so-called asymmetrical agreements which favour central America with Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico, and talks are under way with the Caribbean community. But while the grand conflicts of the 1980s are nominally over, or have diminished to the occasional combat, the region's impoverishment continues to fuel unrest, which could undermine integration. 'If we can solve these problems, we can make a quantum leap,' says Mr Gert Rosenthal, the Guatemalan secretary general of the Santiago-based Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. 'If central America is to compete in the world economy it must integrate its economies.'</p>

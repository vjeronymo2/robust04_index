			<p>BFN     [Text] Konin, 30 Apr--The strike in the brown coal mines  will be suspended beginning with the second shift on 30 April.  This decision was made on Saturday morning in an agreement  concluded between the Brown-Coal Mines Solidarity's National  Strike Committee and the government, represented by Marek Pol,  minister of industry and trade.    The strike action will be halted after joint decisions are  reached by the Trilateral Commission on the national demands put  forward by the strike committee and after the government  presents a timetable for implementing these demands.</p>

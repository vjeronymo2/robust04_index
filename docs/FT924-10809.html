			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: GM shares slip again on dividend fears GENERAL Motors, which is expected today to report third-quarter losses of up to Dollars 850m, saw its stock slip for the second day running yesterday as investors brushed off better results from two non-automotive subsidiaries and focused on fears of a dividend cut. The shares fell Dollars 1 to close at Dollars 31 3/8 , partly reversing the rises which began last week when rumours first circulated that Mr Robert Stempel, the chairman, would be forced to quit. Mr Stempel resigned on Monday. The GM board is expected to name Mr John Smale, leader of the non-executive directors, as chairman on Monday when it holds its regular monthly meeting. Analysts are speculating it might discuss cutting GM's dividend, which stands at Dollars 1.60 a share, to preserve cash. GM's three non-automotive subsidiaries yesterday reported third-quarter figures. GM Hughes Electronics, the aerospace group, saw earnings rise to Dollars 155.2m, or 41 cents a share, from Dollars 38.2m, or 10 cents, last year on revenues of Dollars 2.88bn, up from Dollars 2.75bn. Factors cited for improved earnings included cost controls, acquisition of a missiles business from General Dynamics, a one-time gain from the establishment of a joint venture and the absence of a special charge in 1991. EDS, the data systems business, reported net income of Dollars 167.3m, up from Dollars 145.5m, on revenues which rose Dollars 336m to Dollars 2.06bn. It said this was spurred by strong growth in its non-General Motors business. General Motors Acceptance Corporation, GM's financial services arm, reported net income of Dollars 301m, down from Dollars 346m a year ago. Amid signs GM is preparing further cost-cutting, Mr John Rock, general manager of the Oldsmobile division, said he was working on a plan which could involve the disappearance of the Oldsmobile name and its replacement with a new marque for the division. However, Mr John Rock has conceded his plan had yet to be approved by top management. Separately, General Electric, the diversified industrial group, denied press speculation Mr Jack Welch, its chairman, had held talks with GM about joining the company.</p>

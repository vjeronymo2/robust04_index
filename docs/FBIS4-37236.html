			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 20 Jun (MENA) -- Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  today met with Lakhdar Ibrahimi, the UN secretary general's  envoy to Yemen, who is currently visiting Cairo.    Ibrahimi stated after the meeting that he is continuing the  dialogue with the brothers in Egypt in view of Egypt's role in  the area and its interest in what is happening in Yemen. He  said that he briefed Musa on the outcome of his talks with the  Yemeni parties in Cairo, adding that they discussed the future  prospects in Yemen.    Ibrahimi said that his talks with the two Yemeni parties  last  night confirmed that a cease-fire is an urgent matter. He  expressed his deep regret that no cease-fire was achieved in  Yemen despite the fact that the two sides have accepted and  recognized its importance.    The UN envoy said that the two Yemeni sides recognize the  importance of the existence of a mechanism to supervise and  consolidate a cease-fire in Yemen. He noted that no agreement  has been reached yet on the formation of such a mechanism to  undertake such a duty. He expressed the hope that all the  parties will continue their contacts with the brothers in Yemen  to urge them to quickly agree on the establishment of this  mechanism to enable it to carry out its role. He reiterated  that a cease-fire is the basis for achieving any progress in  solving the Yemeni crisis. The UN envoy wondered how fighting  among brothers can continue like this, stressing that no one  approves of the war there.    Ibrahimi said that he will leave Cairo tomorrow to submit a  report to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    Asked about the possibility of a meeting between the two  Yemeni delegations in Cairo today, Ibrahimi said he does not  think that such a meeting will be held.    He emphasized that Egypt and the United Nations fully agree  that a cease-fire must take place and the fighting must stop in  Yemen.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The American Friends  Service Committee in a statement June 14 called for a peaceful  solution to the Korean question. It said the U.S. authorities  must give the top priority to the welfare and interests of the  70 million Korean people with regard to the problem of the  Korean peninsula.    Urging the United States to declare no more that it regards  military action as a policy option on the Korean peninsula, the  statement said it must admit that dialogue and negotiation are  the most reasonable and just means of ironing out its  differences with the DPRK.    It said attention must be drawn to the danger of the nuclear  weapons possessed by nuclear states including the United States  and steps be taken for a total elimination of nuclear weapons.    All parties concerned must, above all, prevent the  recurrence  of the destructive war in Korea, it said.    It warned that international "sanctions" will only increase  the tension. We consider a permanent solution to the question  is dialogue, not the means of arms, it said.</p>

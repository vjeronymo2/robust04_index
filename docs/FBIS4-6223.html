			<p>BFN     [Text] Manila, April 15 KYODO -- Okinawa Governor Masahide  Ota said Friday [15 April] the conversion of the former United  States naval base at Subic Bay into a commercial and industrial  free port is a good example for Okinawa to follow.    Ota, who is on a six-day visit to the Philippines, told  reporters during a visit to Subic that he "envies" its  conversion, which followed the U.S. withdrawal of forces from  the port in 1992.    Subic Bay was once the largest U.S. overseas naval base.    Ota said he could foresee a bustling commercial and  industrial free port in Subic 10 years from now, adding, "I  really envy the successful conversion of the Subic naval base  into a commercial district."    Subic is about 70 kilometers north of Manila.    The Okinawan archipelago in southern Japan, still plays host  to a strong U.S. military presence.</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Glaxo It is a measure of Glaxo's vulnerability that the repetition of an already-known story should send the shares sliding against a rising market. That the US regulator has asked Glaxo to withdraw claims made for Zantac, its big selling anti-ulcer drug, is embarrassing. But regulatory raps for over-zealous marketing are not uncommon. Asking the company to write to doctors clarifying the position is the usual sanction. Glaxo was forced to do as much in the UK last year over claims made for its respiratory drug Serevent. Unless the company is foolhardy enough to stand its ground without supporting medical data, the spat should not escalate into a more damaging disagreement. The episode might weaken Glaxo's defence of Zantac in the US next year against generic competition. Since the drug accounts for nearly half Glaxo's sales and a rather higher proportion of profits, that is legitimate cause for concern. Some of the therapeutic benefits which are used to justify Zantac's premium price have been called into question by the regulator. With the US healthcare industry in a penny-pinching mood, that could tip the balance in favour of cheaper alternatives. The threat is not new, but Glaxo has to prove it can ride out the challenge. In happier times, though, that would not send the shares into a spin. Even UK approval for a new asthma drug yesterday could not lift the gloom. With the market more interested in cyclical stocks - and while the shape of US healthcare reform remains unclear - buying Glaxo on good news is likely to remain a thankless task.</p>

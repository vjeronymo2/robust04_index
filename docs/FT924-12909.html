			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Counsel named to probe BNL loans scandal MR WILLIAM BARR, the US attorney-general, tried yesterday to head off growing criticism of the Bush administration's alleged involvement in the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) Iraqi loans scandal by appointing an independent counsel to investigate the Justice Department's entire handling of the case. However, the move falls significantly short of the formal request made on Thursday by the Democratic majority of the House judiciary committee that a special prosecutor be named to handle the BNL issue. Mr Al Gore, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, on Thursday claimed the BNL affair and the Bush administration's alleged cover-up was bigger than the Watergate scandal. Mr Barr said that Mr Frederick Lacey, a retired judge from New Jersey, would supervise the preliminary investigation and report back on whether a special prosecutor should be appointed. Under US law Mr Barr has 30 days to reply to the congressional demand for a special prosecutor. Mr Barr said the naming of the 72-year-old Mr Lacey would not preclude the appointment of a special prosecutor. Congressional critics said the attorney-general, a close aide to President Bush, was merely trying to stall until the presidential election had been held. Senator David Boren, the conservative Democratic chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, on Wednesday demanded the appointment of a special prosecutor after disclosing that the CIA had deliberately concealed information about BNL from federal prosecutors with the 'strong advice' of the Justice Department. Yesterday, Senator Boren reacted to Judge Lacey's appointment by saying 'clearly his appointment is not a satisfactory substitute' for the appointment of a special prosecutor independent of the Justice Department. As a result, he said, the Senate intelligence committee would continue to require sworn depositions from Bush administration officials. The US attorney-general said he believed allegations of criminal wrongdoing by members of his department were unfounded and blamed the need to appoint Mr Lacey on 'media sensationalism'. He said he was 'saddened' by the need to take the step. Mr Barr also said he was setting up a special Justice Department task force to pursue the BNL case, including the prosecution of Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former BNL Atlanta branch manager who was accused of single-handedly orchestrating Dollars 5bn of illegal Iraqi loans. More than Dollars 2bn of these helped fund weapons projects. The task force, to be supervised by a Justice Department prosecutor, would also investigate the possible complicity of executives in BNL's head office in Rome.</p>

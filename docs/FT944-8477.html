			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: BAe blows its trombone British Aerospace has a new toy: a 'flexible trombone'. That is the name for the rights issue the company unveiled yesterday as part of its improved bid for VSEL. It is called a flexible trombone because BAe will be able to use to it raise anything between Pounds 178m and Pounds 535m, with the exact amount depending on the extent to which VSEL shareholders opt for cash or BAe shares. Moreover, if BAe increased its offer again, it would be able to do so without going back to its underwriters for approval - though it would seek retrospective permission from shareholders. BAe's management is clearly happy blowing its new trombone. It means it can make as much noise as GEC can, despite its rival bidder's huge cash pile. If GEC ups its bid, so can BAe. The trombone also means that, if BAe fails to win VSEL, it can still pocket the first Pounds 178m. That will come in handy, since BAe will soon need to restructure its loss-making turbo-prop business. Whether BAe shareholders should be happy is another matter. Yesterday's improved offer is near the limit of what is sensible. Because BAe will be able to set its tax losses against VSEL's profits, earnings per share will be enhanced by about 10 per cent in the first year. But if the cost of buying the trombone is taken into account, the earnings enhancement will be virtually wiped out. Moreover, in subsequent years, acquiring VSEL would be roughly earnings neutral: the tax advantages would be balanced by the fact that VSEL is a wasting asset. Once the industrial benefits of a merger are taken into account, the bid probably just about stacks up. But if BAe seeks to use its trombone to make a bigger noise, shareholders should plug their ears.</p>

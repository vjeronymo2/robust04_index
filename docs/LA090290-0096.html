			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUTHOR! AUTHOR!  </P> <P> Thank you for Max Jacobson's delightful "Bangkok Eateries" on July 29. As a  totally incurable part-time expatriate and amateur explorer of places not in  anybody's guidebook, I can usually find the writers who picked up their  knowledge on a tour bus or on a see-the-world-in-14-days package.  </P> <P> Then there are some absolutely exceptional writers such as Jacobson.  </P> <P> I was amazed by his ability to put so many aspects of the Thai experience into  words. It's obvious he thoroughly understood the experiences he was sharing  with us and enjoyed them.  </P> <P> I hate to cause problems within your organization, but any way you could lure  him away from your dining editor on a more regular basis? (And then turn him  loose a few more places from, say, Beijing to Bali?) Fabulous article! Thank  you.  </P> <P> WILLIAM TIMLIN  </P> <P> Cypress  </P></p>

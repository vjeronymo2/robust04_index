			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAN LOOKS FOR HELP ON WHOM TO RESPECT  </P> <P> Cheers to Jim Murray for his article addressing the issue of sports journalists  vs. athletes. Mr. Murray's story could not have had a better exclamation point  than to turn over the page and read the list of 24 baseball players in the  $3-million-a-year club.  </P> <P> I try not to patronize the endorsed products of the celebrity "jerks."  </P> <P> My wish is that more sports journalists would have the courage to let us fans  know just who the really appreciative "good guys" are and give us a little more  insight into the long list of the ungrateful. If so, then perhaps more of us  could vote at the cash register, and this whole thing might get back into  perspective.  </P> <P> JIM MUNCH  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

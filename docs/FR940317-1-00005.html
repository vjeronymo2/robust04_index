			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 955.42(f), of the marketing order provides authority for the Committee to impose a late payment or an interest charge or both, on any handlers who fail to pay assessments in a timely manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 18, 1993, the Committee met to discuss, among other things, the difficulty it has experienced in collecting assessments from some handlers. It reported that during the past season approximately 20 handlers paid assessments late. When this occurred, handlers who paid their assessments on time were placed in an unfair situation compared to those handlers who failed to do so. The delinquent handlers were able to use the money which was due the Committee for other financial obligations and thus eliminate interest charges on money that they might otherwise have had to borrow to pay those other financial obligations. This money could also have been invested to earn interest for the delinquent handlers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the meeting, the Committee determined that it was important to encourage all handlers to pay their assessments promptly, thereby eliminating these inequities and avoiding additional and unnecessary collection costs. The Committee recommended the following proposal. If a handler does not pay all of the handler's assessments 30 days after the date of billing, the unpaid portion of the account would be considered delinquent and subject to interest charges at the rate of one percent per month. Handlers would be charged interest charges on unpaid assessments and interest charges on any unpaid interest charges until the late obligation is paid in full. The Committee assesses handlers on a monthly basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee believes that the proposed interest charge is high enough to discourage handlers from delaying assessment payments. Thus, this proposal is expected to encourage all handlers to pay their assessments in a timely manner, and facilitate the collection of funds to pay expenses necessary for the maintenance and functioning of the Committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A period of fifteen days is provided for all interested persons to submit written comments. The Committee would like the proposal to be effective as soon as possible so that efforts to encourage timely payments can be implemented early in 1994. All comments timely received will be considered before issuing a final decision on this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 955  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Marketing agreements, Onions, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR part 955 is proposed to be amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 955_VIDALIA ONIONS GROWN IN GEORGIA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

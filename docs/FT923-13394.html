			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / International Bonds: Matsushita prepares first Dollars 1bn global launch MATSUSHITA, the Japanese electronics group, was yesterday preparing to launch a global bond issue of at least Dollars 1bn, the first global issue by a corporation. The deal has been expected for some weeks, but yesterday bankers met to discuss the pricing and maturity, and the launched is likely today. Global bonds are registered securities which trade simultaneously in the US, Eurobond and Far Eastern securities markets. The style of borrowing was pioneered by the World Bank and has been followed by other sovereign and supranational borrowers, but never by a company. The Matsushita bonds are likely to be launched at an indicated yield spread over US Treasury bonds, with the issue price and coupon fixed after launch. A 10-year maturity, priced to yield 42 to 45 basis points more than Treasuries was anticipated. Lehman Brothers and Credit Suisse First Boston have been mandated to jointly lead-manage the transaction. Matsushita recently lost its top credit rating from Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, but retains the top grade from rival agency Moody's. The US Treasury bond market retained a weak tone yesterday after falling heavily on Friday. Heavy issuance last week in both the Eurobond and US corporate bond markets has left unsold paper. Against this, Matsushita will offer a wider yield spread than the World Bank, which last week launched a five-year global bond yielding just 5 basis points more than Treasury bonds. Elsewhere, the European Investment Bank struggled to breathe life into the Eurolire market, launching a L500bn 10-year issue, lead-managed by Banca Commerciale Italiana. The deal attracted buying from Italian investors, who pay no withholding tax on bonds issued by supranational agencies, of which Italy is a member. The 11.25 per cent bonds were priced at 101.875, but by the close in London the paper was quoted at 99.88 bid, just outside full fees of 1.875. Abbey National launched a Dollars 200m three-year issue, aimed primarily at retail investors in Switzerland. The paper was price to yield 42 basis points more than treasury bonds of similar maturity. Standard &amp; Poor's has lowered National Westminster Bank's long-term debt rating by one notch from AA+ to AA.</p>

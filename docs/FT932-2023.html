			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Where the EC must go next THE COPENHAGEN summit occurs when the agonising struggle to ratify the Maastricht treaty on European Union appears to be drawing to a close. This, the culmination of years of effort, is a considerable collective achievement for the European Community. But the world has moved on since economic and monetary union was planned. So too must the EC. The summit has, for the most part, the right agenda. The EC must now respond with a mixture of heroism and common sense. Its main task is to make itself appear more relevant to the lives of its citizens and the fate of its troubled continent. Just when many hoped it had come of age, it is mired in difficulties: blunderings in Yugoslavia, squabbles with the US, friction over imports from eastern Europe, popular resistance to the Maastricht treaty and, above all, the economic malaise. Poor economic performance underlies everything else. Failure to respond to German unification by allowing either a temporary float of the D-Mark or upward realignment was a signal error. Partly as a result, the EC is not only in recession, but in the third year of below-trend growth. More may be to come. Macroeconomic mistakes, however large, are not the principal economic problem of the EC. With aggregate unemployment expected to reach 11 1/2 per cent of the labour force, the debate about Eurosclerosis is back. This follows 20 years of dismal labour market performance. While employment in the private sector rose by 30m between 1973 and 1991 in North America, it rose by a mere 3m in the EC. The Copenhagen summit will look at the EC's role in the world economy, at relations with eastern Europe, at enlargement and at security policy. It will not find many solutions. But the EC's heads of government will have taken the first essential step, particularly when they discuss the paper from Mr Delors on the EC's structural economic crisis. What is needed, with the Maastricht debate over, is appreciation of the EC's difficulties and a clear sense of priorities. THREE IMPORTANT TASKS The pillars of the European Union are an unsatisfactory structure. Democratic accountability of EC institutions remains inadequate, particularly because of the virtually non-existent links to the national parliaments. Country voting weights are illogical. Nevertheless, the EC cannot afford another ratification process similar to that for the Maastricht treaty. It must limit itself, instead, to the essential and the practicable. There are three important tasks: to make the workings of the EC and, above all, of the council of ministers more transparent and accountable; to make 'subsidiarity' work; and to equip itself with institutions that will make enlargement feasible. The size of the qualifying majority in voting will need to be changed. So too will voting weights in the council of ministers. At present, the five largest member states have some 84 per cent of the EC's population, but only 63 per cent of the votes. After taking in four Efta members, these countries would still have 78 per cent of the population, but about half the votes. The disproportion would be made still worse by enlargement eastward. Being so influenced by its smaller members, the Union would possess neither legitimacy nor effectiveness, particularly in foreign and security policy. A small high-level commission should be empowered to develop proposals for institutional reform. Continued efforts to develop the European Union's role in foreign and security policy remain desirable. The EC's mistakes in Yugoslavia reveal what has to be done, rather than the desirability of quietism. First of all, Germany must be turned into a responsible partner in European security policy. This does not necessarily mean a German seat on the Security Council. However painful to British and French amour propre, an EC seat might ultimately be a better idea. But first the EC would have to be reformed, since the revolving EC presidency has demonstrated itself unequal to the task of elaborating and implementing EC-wide positions. The immediate external task for the EC is to support democracy and the transition to a market economy throughout the continent. The EC promoted the stability of democratic western Europe by both increasing its wealth and binding its peoples together. The same opportunities should be offered to its immediate neighbours, especially those struggling to escape the ruins of communism. The improvements suggested by the Commission to the agreements with eastern European countries are a start. But the EC will have to go further. It must, for example, review its reform of the common agricultural policy, largely to increase opportunities for eastern European agriculture. Yet the EC's primary challenge is to adapt to a global economy that is changing rapidly precisely because its own ideas about markets and liberal trade are being adopted worldwide. The risk now is that the EC will give up the battle and turn inwards. Successful completion of the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations remains vital. But even this would prove a temporary victory if economic dynamism and high employment were not regained. Policies affecting the labour market fall largely within the domain of the member states. But the EC has a role, partly because it has been given one in both the Maastricht and previous treaties, but more fundamentally because without a measure of agreement in this area different national policies will lead to internal friction and growing protectionism, endangering liberal external trade and the single market. FLEXIBLE APPROACH TO CONVERGENCE A new consensus must be formed, to allow member states to combine their core social commitments with liberal trade and higher employment. Five fundamental principles need to be proclaimed: first, the cost of financing the welfare state should not be loaded on the wages of relatively unskilled workers; second, education must be better integrated within active policies for the labour market; third, assistance to workers should not be given in ways that are likely to reduce the incentive of employers to hire them; fourth, normally healthy adults should not be paid to be idle if they can be subsidised to work, instead; and fifth, obstacles to the development of small and medium-sized businesses, the principal potential source of additional employment, should be drastically curtailed. Meanwhile, EC macroeconomic policy must stop making it more difficult to introduce needed reform into the labour markets. Against the current gloomy background, strict adherence to Maastricht guidelines for fiscal policy looks simply perverse. In 1993 only Luxembourg will hit the general government borrowing target of 3 per cent of GDP, while the EC-wide aggregate will be more than double the target. Combined with continued monetary stringency, attempts to tighten fiscal policy would merely aggravate the overall problem. The EC must treat the convergence criteria flexibly. This may mean postponing Emu until at least 1999. That would merely make reforming the ERM, in order to reinforce the solidity of its core and increase flexibility on the periphery, still more important. In the meantime, those who choose both to accept the disciplines of the hard ERM and resist changes in the system to make it more flexible should tolerate those outside the system, provided they are trying to expand domestic demand. The EC, soon to be the European Union, remains the heart of any effort to secure a prosperous and secure future for Europe and a creative role for it in the world. It cannot afford the luxury of despair; it cannot afford to turn its back on its own problems; and it cannot afford to ignore its global responsibilities. The euphoria of 1990 is gone. Now should come a new sense of realism and purpose. The EC must relaunch itself. The Copenhagen summit is where it should start to do so.</p>

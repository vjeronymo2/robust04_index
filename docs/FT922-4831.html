			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Trader passed on accused broker's 'rumours' A FORMER head of UK equity trading at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, agreed yesterday that he had described as 'rumours' and 'stories' information he had been given by a stockbroker now accused of attempted market rigging. Mr Timothy Medland, now a stocktrader with Swiss Bank Corporation, was a prosecution witness at the trial at Knightsbridge Crown Court of Mr Peter Marks, a director of Branston and Gothard. Mr Marks has pleaded not guilty to a charge under section 47 of the Financial Services Act of making a misleading, false or deceptive statement to induce share dealing. The prosecution alleges that, as part of an attempted 'bear raid', Mr Marks told Mr Medland on October 12, 1990, that Maxwell Communication Corporation would be filing for bankruptcy that day - knowing it to be untrue. The conversation took place between two others in which Mr Marks agreed to sell two blocks of 100,000 MCC shares to Goldman Sachs. Cross-examined by Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, for Mr Marks, Mr Medland said the information had been presented to him by Mr Marks as 'a statement of fact'. He agreed that Mr Marks had ended by asking him if he had any comment and had appeared to be looking for information. Mr Medland also agreed that when giving evidence in the case at magistrates' court he had called what Mr Marks had told him 'rumours'. He also accepted that when he had reported the matter to Mr Eric Sheinberg, Goldman Sachs managing director in New York, he had spoken of 'stories . . . circulating . . . that (MCC) have gone under'. Mr Richard Lines, an investigator with the Stock Exchange insider dealing group, said that when interviewed Mr Marks had said he had merely been passing on to Goldman Sachs a story he had heard was 'going the rounds'. Mr Lines said that Mr Marks had said that he had not known if it was true, but had telephoned Goldman Sachs, with which his firm had dealt before, because it was known to be a big buyer of Maxwell shares. The trial continues today.</p>

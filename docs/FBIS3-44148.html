			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yusuf Khazim: "Somaliland Sets Up Its Army; </F> Referendum on Independence To Be Held in July"]    [Excerpts] London--The "Republic of Somaliland" has decided  to hold a referendum in July on its independence from Somalia.  It has also announced the establishment of the first vanguards  of its national army, 6,000-strong, and the nucleus of a  national police force.    In this context, a "Republic of Somaliland" delegation  begins  a series of meetings in London today, Monday. [passage omitted]    Interior Minister Musa Bihi Abdi [name as transliterated]  told AL-HAYAH yesterday that Somaliland's independence has  become a reality, "and we will explain to British officials the  latest developments in our country. We will also seek their  recognition of our independent state, as well as development and  economic aid. Our people have decided on independence through  conferences held by tribal chiefs and leaders in Somaliland,  which enjoys security and stability. We currently have a  government, the second since the announcement of the republic, a  legislative council (parliament), and senate. And we have  recently announced a national charter, which sets a date for a  referendum on independence in July. And the parliament has  recently approved the committee assigned to draw up a draft  constitution for the country." [passage omitted]    Bihi admitted that "undisciplined armed elements" still  control the airport of Hargeysa, capital of Somaliland.  However, he played down the effect of this on the central  authority's role. He said: "We were faced with the same problem  last year with undisciplined elements which were in control of  Berbera port, which is now under our control. We are currently  working to regain the airport peacefully. We are aware that the  groups controlling the airport are running this vital facility  well, and we are in contact with them."    The Somaliland interior minister criticized the United  Nations and its second operation in Somalia, UNOSOM-2. He said:  "It is obstructing our efforts to consolidate our independence.  This is why we have rejected and continue to reject the UN  attempts to dispatch forces to our country and to impose its  rules on us." He said that his country's government has invited  several states and regional and international organizations to  supervise and observe the impartiality of the referendum. He  stressed that "the referendum will be conducted on the date set,  even if the United Nations refuses to supervise it."</p>

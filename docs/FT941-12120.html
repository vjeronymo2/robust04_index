			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Mirror group pension scheme receives Pounds 32m Mirror Group Newspapers pension scheme has received Pounds 32m from three securities houses in an out-of-court settlement to their legal dispute over assets lost in the Maxwell scandal, it was announced yesterday. The last-minute agreement is the third in recent weeks in which financial institutions have agreed to return assets to pension schemes formerly controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. It raises hopes that a large portion of the Pounds 440m missing from all the schemes will be returned. The settlement, following a week of negotiations, avoided a complex and expensive High Court trial that had been due to begin yesterday. Invesco Asset Management and Capel-Cure Myers of the UK, and US-based Lehman Brothers agreed to settle with the trustees, but did not admit liability. All parties signed a secrecy agreement preventing publication of details of the settlements. But it emerged later that Lehman Brothers had paid the trustees Pounds 15m, Invesco Pounds 11m and Capel-Cure Myers Pounds 6m. Trustees of the Mirror group pension scheme had filed a writ seeking Pounds 88.7m from the three securities firms, along with Bank of America and Credit Suisse. It later filed a writ seeking an additional Pounds 150m from the firms for damages. Last month, Bank of America paid Pounds 25m into the pension scheme to settle claims against it, and the case against Credit Suisse for most of the Pounds 31m outstanding is due to come to court in October. Invesco and Capel-Cure Myers both acted as fund mangers for the Mirror group scheme's assets before the death in November 1991 of Mr Maxwell, while Lehman Brothers received assets as security for stock lending transactions with some of Mr Maxwell's private companies. The deal also allows the pension scheme to receive Pounds 8m in cash from liquidators for Bishopsgate Investment Management (BIM), the Maxwell-owned fund management company that handled the bulk of the combined Maxwell company pension scheme assets. BIM had been in dispute with Invesco over ownership of a securities portfolio. So far, the Mirror group scheme has recovered Pounds 65m for pensioners. The sum will reduce the amount that Mirror Group Newspapers will have to pay into its pension scheme over time. In its interim results last summer, the group set aside roughly Pounds 174m to meet long-term pension liabilities. Mr Colin Cornwall, chairman of the trustees, said the actual shortfall could not be determined until after an actuarial valuation. Earlier yesterday, Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell, the late publisher's sons, and four other former senior Maxwell employees all pleaded not guilty to criminal charges brought by the Serious Fraud Office.

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Judge fails to attend Nadir case PROCEEDINGS at a pre-liminary hearing for the trial of Mr Asil Nadir, former chairman of Polly Peck International, were held up yesterday when Mr Justice Tucker, the judge presiding over the case, failed to appear. The judge's place was taken by Mr Justice Pill and the court adjourned after less than an hour. The Lord Chancellor's Office said it had been thought inappropriate for administrative reasons for Mr Justice Tucker to attend the hearing.</p>

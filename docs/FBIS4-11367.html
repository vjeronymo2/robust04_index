			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alvaro Alvarado; from the "RPC Television News" </F> newscast]    [Text] The Papa Egoro Movement today reiterated its  decision not to support any political group linked with the  country's past or present. The Papa Egoro Movement bases its  political independence on what it considers the crisis in which  the country finds itself and which has been generated, in its  opinion, by the attitude of the traditional parties that have  governed Panama. Raul Leis, secretary general of the movement,  maintains that they respect the initiative of some political  parties to seek unity.    [Begin Leis recording] We must greet that type of  initiative,  rather than attack it. We must greet it with respect. It is a  democratic, free initiative of the parties. Sincerely, however,  we see it as having a very fragile basis, because it is not  based on a specific government platform or on a genuine effort  at rapprochement, but is rather an anti-effort, a position  against another party. The Papa Egoro Movement has always had a  position that is not anti anything, but rather a pro-Panama  position. [end recording]    Leis ruled out the possibility that the Papa Egoro  Movement's  position is directed at favoring the PRD, because there is no  connection between the two parties. During the news conference,  Mariela Arce announced the holding of an event as homage to  mother earth, which has been organized by the Papa Egoro  Movement for this coming Saturday, 23 April, in Parque Urraca  beginning at 1400. This event anticipates the participation of  a large number of national groups that will participate with  presidential candidate Ruben Blades and his orchestra as well as  his government team.</p>

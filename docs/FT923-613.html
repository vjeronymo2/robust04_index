			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Nigerian air force crash kills 163 A NIGERIAN air force C-130 transport aircraft crashed soon after take-off from Lagos, killing all 163 people aboard, officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Abuja. Many of those killed in the crash late on Saturday were believed to be middle-ranking army, navy and air force officers attending a Nigerian Command and Staff College course at Jaji, in northern Kaduna state, and some of their instructors. 'The plane nose-dived three minutes after take-off into a swampy area,' said an official in Abuja, the capital. It was heading for Kaduna. It was Nigeria's worst air force crash since independence in 1960. Boycotts and fraud charges soured the final round of Nigeria's presidential primaries, Reuter reports from Lagos. Police arrested at least 50 people on electoral malpractice charges during Saturday's polls in 10 states, boycotted by nine of the 12 Social Democratic party (SDP) candidates.</p>

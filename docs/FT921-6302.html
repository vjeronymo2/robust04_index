			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Europe's wild east IN TSARIST times a stone on the main road through the Caucasus marked the south-eastern limit of Europe. The lands beyond were part of Asia. Since then, Europe has quietly expanded. All the ex-Soviet republics except Georgia (disqualified by civil strife) have now been admitted, with remarkably little discussion, into the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), which thus includes the Transcaucasian republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan, as well as the four central Asian ones and Kazakhstan. The same goes, even more astonishingly, for the North Atlantic Co-operation Council (NACC), a kind of annex in which Nato tries to make its former adversaries feel at home without offering them any guarantees. These arrangements reflect an awareness among Nato countries that they are no longer threatened by one big neighbour's hostility, but rather by the fall-out (metaphorical or literal) from conflict among and within a whole host of neighbours, old and new. War between former Soviet republics can neither be ruled out nor contemplated with equanimity. The west has an interest in preventing it. The war that threatens to break out most imminently is between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Within the territory of Azerbaijan lies an enclave, Nagorno-Karabakh, populated mainly by Armenians. These have proclaimed their independence, but (shades of Croatia) have run into armed resistance from the Azeri minority within the enclave. The latter are supported by the government of Azerbaijan, the former by their kith and kin in Armenia. So far the main fighting has been in and around the enclave, but it could escalate at any time into war between the republics, especially if further Armenian advances trigger the downfall of Azerbaijan's president. Armenian diaspora If that happened, matters might not stop there. Armenia, a Christian country, has traditionally looked to Russia or the west for protection. Before the first world war many Armenians lived in the Ottoman empire, on what is now Turkish territory. Most of them perished in the genocide of 1915-16, while the survivors fled to the west, where today (especially in the US) there is an active and influential Armenian diaspora. The Azeris, on their side, are closely linked to Turkey by language, to Iran by religion (they are Shia Moslems), and to their immediate neighbours in Iranian Azerbaijan by both. In Turkey public opinion takes the Azeri side, while Russians, west Europeans and north Americans seem more disposed to accept the Armenian version of events. Iranians might instinctively support fellow-Moslems, but Armenians in Iran have been well treated, by both imperial and Islamic regimes, and the Tehran government has no interest in encouraging Azeri separatism. Joint mediation Last autumn the presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan attempted a joint mediation which looked promising, but failed. Now Iran's foreign minister is trying his hand. The leaders of Turkey and Armenia have so far behaved on the whole with statesmanlike moderation, seeking to overcome rather than revive past hatreds. But the Turkish prime minister did recently warn the US against siding with Armenia in the event of war, suggesting that if it did so Turkey 'could not stand idly by'. Turkish troops have been moved close to the border. Nato cannot be indifferent to the danger of a war in which one of its members (Turkey) might be involved on one side, while the physical survival of a nation on the other side (Armenia) might be in danger. But Nato as such is hardly equipped to mediate. That task is best undertaken by the CSCE, which last week sent a mission to the area and is now inviting both sides to make use of its disputes settlement procedure, adopted a year ago but so far untested. The conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia is only one of the potential disputes arising from the break-up of the Soviet Union that could threaten international peace and security. The emphasis for now must be on negotiation. But if the CSCE concludes that a political solution is impossible without the despatch of peacekeeping troops, this too should remain an option.</p>

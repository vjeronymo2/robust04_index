			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: Pechiney reshapes packaging unit PECHINEY, the French state-controlled aluminium and packaging group, is to buy the metal interests of its international arm, which is listed on the Paris bourse. The Finance Ministry has given its go-ahead for Pechiney International, 25 per cent-quoted on the stock market, to sell its aluminium smelting and trading businesses to its parent, Pechiney, owner of the remaining 75 per cent of Pechiney International's shares. The project aims to improve Pechiney International's lacklustre share price performance by separating it from the volatile aluminium industry  - where prices have plunged recently - and to reduce debts, which at FFr16bn (Dollars 2.86bn) are nearly 1.2 times shareholders' funds. Pechiney International's aluminium and trading assets could be worth between FFr5bn and FFr7.4bn, according to Salomon Brothers, the US securities house. Pechiney International, which groups most of the company's foreign interests, will end up with 85 per cent of its turnover in packaging, where it is the world leader, and the rest in aerospace components. Aluminium and trading accounted for 17 per cent of Pechiney International's FFr44.9bn sales last year, with 70 per cent in packaging. The Pechiney parent company, itself 80 per cent state-owned - and most of the rest held by state financial institutions - will accordingly end up with all the group's aluminium activities. Clearance for the scheme is a mark of the state's support for the strategy of Mr Jean Gandois, whose second three-year mandate as chairman comes up for renewal in July. He has been preparing the asset reorganisation over the past six months. It is also the latest example of the French government's growing pragmatism over the financing of its extensive industrial portfolio, coming after the recent sales of small stakes in Elf Aquitaine, the oil and gas group, and Credit Local de France, the local authority bank. Pechiney International was floated on the bourse three years ago to raise cash for the purchase of American National Can, the leading US packaging group, which Mr Gandois bought as a cash-earner to counterbalance the cyclical aluminium business. At the time, the government disapproved of the financial gymnastics of creating a subsidiary just for the purpose of raising equity capital. However, it was a legal way for Pechiney to get round the freeze which then existed on privatisations and nationalisations. Since then, the government has relaxed that rule, with a decree last year allowing state-owned companies to sell up to 49 per cent of their capital to private investors. The reorganisation could well pave the way for Pechiney International to issue more equity capital, analysts said yesterday.</p>

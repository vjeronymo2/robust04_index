			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The prime minister said the cabinet decision  requiring the Defense Ministry to buy weapons through barter  deals involves only certain possible cases, and this is meant to  benefit the national economy.    Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said that the policy on weapons  purchases is just a matter of principle involving certain cases  where it is possible for Thailand to negotiate with its trading  partners to sell its products in exchange. The prime minister  thinks that the Commerce Ministry should be allowed to take part  in the negotiation since the Defense Ministry is not very good  at it.    [Begin recording] [Chuan] The minister in charge of the  deal, such as the defense minister when it concerns the Defense  Ministry, would look after the matter.    [Unidentified reporter] Was the decision adopted by the  cabinet motivated by the issue of commissions?    [Chuan] Not directly. It was not directly aimed at barring  the business of brokers. It rather concerns the case of the  Defense Ministry buying weapons from a country which, we think,  can buy our products in exchange.    [Reporter] Did the Defense Ministry bring up possible  problems which may arise?    [Chuan] The Defense Ministry often told us that it is not  enthusiastic about trade.    [Reporter] Even though it could prevent the paying of  commissions [words indistinct]?    [Chuan] I think that is a different matter. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GETTING THERE IS SIMPLE  </P> <P> Rocky Mountain National Park is in north-central Colorado and can be reached  from the east by car on U.S. 34, U.S. 36 and Colorado 7. Highways 36 and 7 both  reach Boulder, but the narrow, winding Colorado 7 offers beautiful views of  southeastern portions of the park.  </P> <P> The park also can be reached from the west by U.S. 40, which connects with 34.  Estes Park is about 65 miles north of Denver, 91 miles south of Cheyenne, Wyo.  </P> <P> Campgrounds in and around the park are abundant. Estes Park is a quaint village  catering to visitors who do not like to camp. It offers many accommodations and  restaurants.  </P> <P> Perhaps the area's most famous hotel is the Stanley Hotel (333 Wonderview Ave.,  Estes Park), which was the inspiration behind Stephen King's novel, "The  Shining." Room rates are between $60 and $120 a night all year. The hotel also  offers two luxury suites for $150 a night. For more information, call (303)  586-3371.  </P> <P> Alpine Trail Ridge Inn, 927 Moraine Ave., Moraine Route, Estes Park, offers  more moderate accommodations from May 1 to Oct. 15. It is at the entrance of  the park. Fran Grooters said her hotel offers hiking packages and trail  information. Nightly room rates are from $46 double to $86 for six. Call (303)  586-4585.  </P> <P> For more area hotel and restaurant information, call the Estes Park Chamber of  Commerce at (303) 586-4431.  </P> <P> Recommending hikes in the park is difficult due to the wide variety available.  Kent and Donna Dannens' book, "Short Hikes in Rocky Mountain National Park," is  helpful for inexperienced visitors. It is $4 at the park's visitor centers.  Maps given at the park's entrances also mention the area's most popular trails.  For less-traveled paths, ask about hikes out of Grand Lakes in the southwest.  </P> <P> For more information about Rocky Mountain National Park, call the National Park  Service at (303) 586-2371, or write: c/o Superintendent, Rocky Mountain  National Park, Estes Park, Colo. 80517-8397.  </P></p>

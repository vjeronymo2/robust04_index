			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Monju fast breeder reactor at crucial stage Japan's first fast breeder nuclear reactor is due to go critical today - the stage where a nuclear chain reaction becomes self-sustaining. The Monju reactor in Fukui, eastern Japan, has been under development since 1985 at a cost of some Y600bn (Pounds 3.8bn). It is to be one of the main pillars of Japan's plutonium programme. The launch of Monju, named after a Buddhist saint, comes almost 20 years after similar facilities in the UK and France, and as international concern about nuclear proliferation is increasing. Some analysts fear Monju's launch will give North Korea an excuse to produce plutonium, while some US critics have suggested Japan wants to build up its own nuclear arms. The Japanese government has indicated its long-standing commitment to its nuclear fuel recycling programme, originally established in the 1950s. Japan, which lacks its own source of energy, has regarded plutonium, as the 'dream energy source'. But faced with increasing international pressure, the glut in uranium, the high cost of using plutonium, and protests from local residents in building new nuclear reactors, government officials have recently suggested that it would postpone some of its plutonium development programme.</p>

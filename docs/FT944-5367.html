			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Goldilocks and the coffee shop - An essential part of south-east Asia street culture They called him Goldilocks, even though his head had not a hair on it and shone like a newly-peeled onion. Goldilocks was the barman at the Vatican, a corner coffee shop in Kuala Lumpur. Indians would come in and park their ample backsides on the small wooden bar stools. 'Hey, Goldilocks,' they would shout, heads wobbling and arms flailing the air. 'Give me a Johnny Walker Black Label, on the rocks. Roger, over and out.' Goldilocks, dressed always in a pair of baggy blue shorts and a white singlet, would spring into action. His clogs would slap, slap, slap across the greasy floor. He would pour the whisky while taking the top off a bottle of beer and straining coffee through what looked like a bull's scrotum. He would launch into a window-breaking shout for an order of chicken rice from his brother at the far end of the room. He would reach up to pull down a tin on a pulley and string, stuffing notes in, taking change out. The Chinese-run corner coffee shop is a central part of south-east Asia street culture. Those without taste and the nouveau riche might rendezvous in hotel lobbies - but real people meet, do business, drink and eat at the coffee shop. The traditional lay-out is simple enough. At the entrance, on the left-hand side, is a battered old desk with jars of pickled ginger and sweets on it. Behind it sits the towkay, or boss man of the establishment. He, like everyone there, has a singlet and blue shorts. He might be scraping the soles of his feet or cleaning his ear with what looks like a miniature chimney brush. He watches every move in the place. Occasionally, he launches into a demonstrative clearing of his passages, making expert use of a nearby spittoon. Every so often, he opens a drawer and counts through wads of banknotes, his abacus clicking away. You go to a table. These are marble, with bentwood chairs ranged round them. Immediately, someone takes your order. It is never written down but shouted, at a fearsome pitch, across the room. Those new to the experience have been known to fall off their chairs in shock. A number of stalls are littered round the place. On one side, a lady with weight-lifter legs works at a giant, flaming wok, turning out plate after plate of noodles. One order is finished. The wok is scrubbed with a bamboo brush and water. Oil is heated, garlic and spices thrown in. The noodles follow, an egg is cracked and, all in one lyrical movement, the shell lands expertly in a far-away slops bucket. The Americans might think they invented fast food. The Chinese have been doing it for hundreds of years. At the other side a small man, with slicked-down hair and a cigarette dangling from his lip, lifts a cooked chicken from a hook. The Chinese cannot understand the western predilection for carving meat off the bone. A cleaver chops down the bird, from backside to neck. Each side is split again. Then, while taking three orders and carrying on a conversation with a friend about last weekend's horse racing, the cleaver jumps at lightning speed, cutting portions which are swept on to plates, along with a helping of chilli, for chicken rice. A separate waiter takes orders for drinks. Home-made barley water is a favourite - served hot to balance what is going on internally with the steamy outside temperature. Coffee is served in thick, chipped cups. The aficionado pours the contents into the saucer to let it cool, then slurps away like a contented cat. Pause to listen and the sound is devastating. The hiss of noodles being sucked into a hundred mouths. Kids screaming, food orders being fired off like machine-gun bullets, trucks and buses hooting past outside. The toilet is out at the back, through the kitchen area. You notice grandma sitting in a corner, taking the roots off a bucketful of bean sprouts while rocking a baby swinging from the ceiling in a sling. Sons and daughters crouch over basins full of washing up. An old man is mending the chain on his bicycle. Corner coffee shops might be rough and ready - but they are cheap. A decent lunch costs about Dollars 1.50. South-east Asia is developing faster than any other region in the world. The hammer of progress is flattening many of the older coffee shops, turning them into multi-storey car parks or shopping complexes. Coffee shops in Singapore have been refurbished and air-conditioned. Cleanliness has replaced character. No old men in shorts and singlets there. To appreciate real coffee-shop culture and food, go to Penang in Malaysia or small towns like Ipoh, about three hours drive north of Kuala Lumpur. The Kedai Kopi Kong Heng in Ipoh is one of the oldest such establishments in the country, and one of the noisiest. People come from miles around to taste its hor fan - a rice noodle served with thinly-sliced prawn and chicken. The Vatican - no one knows how it came by its name - is still on the corner in central Kuala Lumpur but Goldilocks is no more. He is probably serving Black Label at the great coffee shop in the sky and listening to a voice saying 'Roger, over and out.' The Vatican: on the corner of Lebuh Pasar Besar and Jalan Hang Kasuri, Kuala Lumpur; Kedai Kopi Kong Heng: on the corner of Jalan Leech and Jalan Station, Ipoh.</p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Water regulation YESTERDAY'S consultation paper on the future supply of water in the UK is the latest in a series of papers to be published by Mr Ian Byatt, the director general of the Office of Water Services (Ofwat). The papers have been produced in the run-up to next year's periodic review of the regulatory regime for the water industry which will set the pricing formula until 2005. The publication of these papers has been a commendable demonstration of glasnost. Mr Byatt has set out the conceptual problems he faces in regulating this most monopolistic of industries. The water companies, environmentalists and consumers have all been invited to join the debate and given data on which to make informed judgments. This openness has well illustrated the exceptionally difficult problems faced in regulating the water industry. One of the most intractable is the requirement imposed on Mr Byatt to allow the water companies to make a reasonable return on capital. This requirement - not imposed on other regulators - was deemed necessary if the companies were to raise over Pounds 30bn needed to modernise the industry. The definition of a reasonable rate of return led to an early clash between Ofwat and the companies. Mr Byatt proposed a target of 5 to 6 per cent; the companies say they need 9.5 per cent. A further complication arises from the division of duties between Ofwat, which regulates water prices, and other bodies which regulate water quality. Directives from the European Community and standards set by UK bodies such as the National Rivers Authority can impose big additional costs on the water industry. Mr Byatt is responsible for keeping water bills as low as possible, without being able to control the dominant factor pushing up costs  -ever-increasing environmental standards. He has usefully brought into the open the question of whether environmental standards are unnecessarily high and too expensive. However, some responses from the industry appear to have merit. It has criticised yesterday's paper for a premature judgment that meters curb the growth in demand for water, arguing that preliminary trials have been inconclusive and the results of the Department of the Environment's fuller study will not be available for several months. It has complained too that the arguments in last month's paper were guilty of circularity in defining the value of the companies' assets. Yesterday's paper should not, therefore, be the last to be published by Ofwat before the periodic review. Further reports are needed in which Mr Byatt summarises the responses to his original position papers and gives an evaluation of their arguments. Both investors and consumers deserve to learn of Mr Byatt's response to these rebuttals, and how he proposes to bridge the gap before he completes his review.</p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAIN IS GONE FOR MADKINS, BUT SKILLS COMING BACK  </P> <P> It was one year ago this coming Tuesday that Gerald Madkins steered a moped  through the UCLA campus, heading toward Westwood Village to see a movie.  </P> <P> He never made it.  </P> <P> Instead, he spent the night -- and the next several weeks -- in the UCLA  Medical Center. Madkins and his moped collided head-on with a car, leaving the  UCLA basketball player with multiple fractures of his pelvis.  </P> <P> While in the hospital, Madkins wondered if he would walk again, never mind  dunking in Pauley Pavilion. Would he be able to make it up and down the stairs?  </P> <P> "If you saw his X-rays, you'd look at them and say, 'Oh . . .,' " said Gerald  Finerman, the Bruins' team physician. "Half of his pelvis was rotated probably  about 90%.  </P> <P> "This was a big-time injury."  </P> <P> But Madkins, whose pelvis was held together for several months by a pair of  metal plates, seems to have recovered.  </P> <P> He has been playing basketball for several months, focusing his attention on  next season.  </P> <P> Will he be the same player he was before the injury?  </P> <P> "I think there's a good chance," Finerman said. "It's hard to be cavalier and  say he'll be as good as he was after sitting out a year. But his fracture is  well-healed. It's in excellent position.  </P> <P> "He hasn't had much in the way of (pain). We're very hopeful that he'll be able  to return to his full capabilities."  </P> <P> Coach Jim Harrick is hopeful, too, but he wonders about Madkins' mental  adjustment.  </P> <P> "Your back stops hurting after a year," Harrick said. "Are you going to swing  the golf club 100%? Are you going to cut loose?"  </P> <P> Not to worry, Madkins said. He'll be ready to go when training camp opens on  Oct. 15.  </P> <P> Harrick rides a moped.  </P> <P> "I take it to the grocery store and places like that," he said.  </P> <P> So, when he heard that Madkins had been involved in an accident, his first  thought was that it probably wasn't serious. "I thought he might be a little  skinned up," Harrick said.  </P> <P> He soon discovered the worst: Madkins and his passenger, Sheri Carpenter, were  headed southbound on Circle Drive West at about 25 m.p.h., according to the  story Madkins told police, when the moped ran head-on into an oncoming car,  which was traveling at about 10 m.p.h.  </P> <P> According to the police report, the driver of the car had just moved into the  area the day before, "was not familiar with (the street)" and "may have been  partially or totally in the opposing traffic lane."  </P> <P> Physical evidence, the report said, suggested that the moped, which Madkins  borrowed from teammate Kevin Walker, fell and slid prior to impact, indicating  that Madkins attempted to maneuver out of harm's way.  </P> <P> Madkins doesn't remember much about the accident, but he told police at the  scene that he turned his head briefly to say something to Carpenter, then  turned around to see headlights approaching.  </P> <P> Carpenter, whose right knee was shattered, doesn't remember anything about it.  </P> <P> "I remember Gerald calling to say, 'I'll be there in half an hour,' " said  Carpenter, a high school friend of Madkins' who was visiting from Merced. "The  next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital."  </P> <P> Madkins remembers a tremendous pain across his stomach.  </P> <P> A week later, during a four-hour procedure, Dr. Eric Johnson inserted the metal  plates to hold the fracture in place. Abdominal muscles, which had been pulled  away from the bone, were sewn back. One of the plates, which is about eight  inches long, still runs along the inside of Madkins' pelvis. The other was  removed last May.  </P> <P> Harrick was dumbstruck by the extent of the injuries.  </P> <P> "I got sick to my stomach," he said. "I could have cried."  </P> <P> Madkins, who played fewer than 18 minutes a game as UCLA's third guard in the  1987-88 season but nevertheless was named to the Pacific 10 Conference  all-freshman team, was projected as a three-year starter.  </P> <P> Harrick considered him the Bruins' best athlete and UCLA trainer Tony Spino,  who formerly worked for the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Assn.,  compared Madkins' court sense to that of former Bucks Sidney Moncrief and  Junior Bridgeman.  </P> <P> "He sees the floor like nobody we have," Spino said.  </P> <P> With Madkins, Harrick said, UCLA probably would have won about five more games  last season. As it was, the Bruins were 21-10 and reached the second round of  the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament while basically using only  two guards, Pooh Richardson and freshman Darrick Martin, in the last half of  the season.  </P> <P> Madkins plays almost every day at Pauley Pavilion -- without pain, he said --  and two nights a week in a summer league at Cal State Los Angeles. Next month,  he will tour Morocco with a team representing Amateur Sports Development, a  non-profit group that sponsors cultural tours for amateur athletes.  </P> <P> Madkins practiced with the Bruins at the end of last season and, while limited  physically, said he developed a greater appreciation for basic fundamentals,  which he hopes will improve his play.  </P> <P> He admits to being out of shape, but when asked if he is limited in any way by  the injury, he said: "There's nothing I can't do. I'm going all out. I'm  falling on the floor. I don't think I'd go out there if I had any hesitation."  </P> <P> Madkins said he plans to be in the starting lineup when UCLA opens the season  Nov. 25 against Santa Clara. The Bruins' signing of Mitchell Butler, a 6-5 high  school All-American from Oakwood School in North Hollywood, hasn't changed his  mind.  </P> <P> "If he beats me out," Madkins said of Butler, a three-time Southern Section  player of the year, "it's my fault and I'm going to accept it and sit down. But  I expect to have the job.  </P> <P> "If Gerald Madkins does what he has to do, he'll be in the starting lineup.  That's the bottom line."  </P> <P> Harrick said Madkins' condition would be a major factor in determining UCLA's  fate next season. "I have a sixth sense that his ability to come back is going  to be the key to whether we're good or very good," Harrick said.  </P> <P> The 6-3, 185-pound Madkins averaged under six points a game as a freshman, but  made almost 60% of his shots, including 45% from three-point range, and 83% of  his free throws.  </P> <P> Harrick described him as a "marvelous athlete," a valued leader and UCLA's best  defender.  </P> <P> "He's got some skills you can't coach into a guy," Harrick said. "You know,  instincts that you can't coach into an athlete -- about passing and  penetrating, and just playing. You can't coach some things. Players are just  born with them."  </P> <P> Madkins, of course, almost lost those abilities when he skidded across the  pavement. Since the accident, he said, he has ridden on a moped only once. A  friend gave him a ride up a hill.  </P> <P> "I was only on there for about 30 seconds, but my girlfriend almost bit my head  off," he said. "She gave me the weirdest look -- like I was the silliest man  she'd ever met."  </P></p>

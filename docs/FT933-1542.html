			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: BM agrees committed loan facility with banks BM GROUP, the construction equipment combine which over-extended itself through acquisition, has signed an agreement with its bankers for a committed loan facility until the end of 1994. It has cost Pounds 7m to arrange, and this will be added to exceptional costs of Pounds 42m already forecast for the 1992-93 accounts. The financial accounting date is June and results for the year are expected to be announced in November. Interim pre-tax profits were halved to Pounds 8.6m. The shares, which peaked at 425p in October 1991, rose 1p to 23 3/4 p. Mr Howard Sutton, chief executive, said the disposal programme was expected to cut debts, which exceeded Pounds 100m, substantially by the end of 1994. It was planned to refinance the debt by then on more normal terms. The restructuring would leave a viable company capable of servicing the reduced debt, he said. The business plan did not assume an upturn in the economy. In exchange for the committed facility the group's 12 banks took security over some of its assets, imposed tighter covenants, and are charging a higher interest margin.</p>

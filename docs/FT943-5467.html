			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich defies afternoon bourse downtrend Apart from an unusually detached Zurich, bourses mostly backtracked yesterday on the lower dollar and a retreat from an early rally in US treasuries, after dealers reassessed what appeared to be a smaller than expected rise in US payrolls, writes Our Markets Staff. ZURICH concentrated on domestic corporate developments and rallied 1.7 per cent. The SMI index rose 43.6 to close near its best level of the day at 2,672.0, a rise of 3.5 per cent on the week. Roche certificates rose SFr190, or 3.1 per cent, to SFr6,270 in reply to its its better than expected first-half results - the first time it has presented six month figures. Analysts commented that stock now looked as if it was heading back towards SFr6,500 after its spell in the doldrums. The mood spilled over to the other pharmaceutical stocks, pulling Sandoz SFr11 higher to SFr684. Ciba added SFr7 to SFr808 in spite of downgrades from Swiss Volksbank and CS Investment Research after its flat first half figures earlier in the week. UBS was supported by Thursday's news of improved trading income in July and August, adding SFr27, or 2.3 per cent, to SFr1,199. CS Holding rose SFr6 to SFr557. Nestle closed SFr25 higher at SFr1,237 on heavy foreign buying. PARIS closed more than 2 per cent below its best, and 2.6 per cent down on the week as French investors became preoccupied again with interest rates. The CAC 40 index ended 14.54 lower at 2,020.37 after a day's high of 2,064.35. The market's earlier strength had a lot to do with provisional sales data from the French car industry, showing an 18.9 per cent increase on a year ago and a 14.7 per cent rise in the first eight months. Even after falling in line with the market in the afternoon, Peugeot rose FFr7 to FFr864 on the day and the tyremaker, Michelin, by 20 centimes to FFr238.50. The best rise of the day came from La Rochette, the paper and pulp group which climbed FFr3.75, or 7.1 per cent, to FFr56.75 after the broker, Detroyat, changed its opinion to positive on the loss-making wood pulp and paper group, citing the speed and depth of recovery in its sector. FRANKFURT was looking happier, both on the session and in the post-bourse, before the second thoughts on Wall Street about the US jobs data. After Thursday's post bourse slide to 2,185.78 it recovered to 2,204.71, 2 per cent up on the week, before peaking at 2,215.75 in the afternoon. Turnover eased from DM6.4bn to DM6.1bn. After that, it was mostly downhill as bund futures dropped through the 91.00 support level. The Ibis-indicated Dax resisted a deep reversal on the French pattern, but still lost a few points to 2,197.38. On the session, carmakers saw profit-taking after rising earlier this week on the back of strong first-half figures from Daimler-Benz. BMW fell DM7 to DM819 and Daimler itself by DM2.50 to DM838.50. MILAN hosted another a quiet session, unmoved by political developments and still waiting for action on the budget, and the Comit index dipped 0.98 at 685.03, leaving it little changed on the week. Montedison was an exception, losing L35, or 2.5 per cent, to L1,378 on news that the company had valued its shares at L1,208 for the purposes of an exchange of shares that will play a part in the fusion of Finanziaria Agroindustriale back into Montedison. Olivetti, under heavy pressure in recent sessions, bounced L28 higher to L2,143 after news that it would cut the prices of its personal computers by 12 per cent over the next few months, following price cuts by rivals. Among the banks, BCI lost L9 to L3,692 amid continuing arbitrage business between the ordinary share and the rights to its capital call. AMSTERDAM was encouraged by the lower than expected US non-farm payroll data, and the AEX index finished 3.03 higher at 419.14, after peaking at 420.77 in the immediate aftermath of the figures. The index fell 0.4 per cent on the week. VNU was the day's highlight for the second successive session after Wednesday's better than expected first half figures. The share peaked at a new intraday high of Fl 203.00 before settling back to close Fl 2.20 higher at Fl 198.20. MADRID took its loss on the week to 2.1 per cent as the general index closed 3.17 lower at 303.95. DUBLIN continued to celebrate the Irish Republican Army's laying down of its arms, the ISEQ overall index closing 17.29 higher at 1,932.79, 3.6 per cent higher on the week, on the possibilities that the peace dividend might offer. Equities rose in spite of a slight decline in Irish gilts.

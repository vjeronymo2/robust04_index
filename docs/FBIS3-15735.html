			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Nizhniy Novgorod Television Network in  Russian at 1735 GMT on 17 February carries its regular "Dramatis  Personae" program, which features an interview with Nizhniy  Novgorod Oblast Governor Boris Yefimovich Nemtsov. Asked by the  anchorwoman about the results of British Prime Minister John  Major's visit to Nizhniy Novgorod, Nemtsov replies that this was  the first such visit in the centuries-old history of Nizhniy  Novgorod. No Western leader has visited Nizhniy Novgorod since  1221.    Nemtsov continues that this is the first time that he has  seen a person from the West coming not just with promises, but  with a concrete program supported by concrete millions of  pounds. This program includes implementation of three major  projects in Nizhniy Novgorod. The first project concerns  investments into enterprises which have gone through the stage  of privatization, but found themselves broke. This project is  expected to get 4.8 million pounds. The second program concerns  specialists who do not have enough skills in market economy, but  need them very much. This training program will be funded by  about 1 million pounds. The third is a program aimed at  establishment of something like an all-Russian automobile  alliance in Nizhniy Novgorod.    As for the political significance of the visit, Nemtsov  believes that the British prime minister saw for himself that  the money spent on technological aid to Russia was not wasted.  The program of privatization of truck transportation and the  land reform program have been developed with the support of the  money provided by the British Government. Both programs are  being implemented in Nizhniy Novgorod, and they will become  models for all of Russia, in the opinion of the Russian  government.    Speaking about an expected visit of the Russian prime  minister, Nemtsov says that Nizhniy Novgorod has been waiting  for that visit for two years already, that he invites the prime  minister every time he sees him, but this time it seems he will  come to Nizhniy Novgorod on 10 March. According to the  anchorwoman, the mass media has been writing a lot about an  alleged opposition between Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin lately. As  far as Nemtsov knows, there is no such opposition between them.    Speaking about the recent visit of former Finance Minister  Fedorov to Nizhniy Novgorod, Nemtsov says that Fedorov came at  his invitation. He is a State Duma deputy and heads the  commission for finances and banks. Nemtsov says that the  purpose of Fedorov's visit was to get acquainted with the  process of formation of local budgets, with the state of economy  on the regional level, and to learn more about the work of  commercial banks. In addition to that, Fedorov was interested  in the notorious problem of the automobile building plant,  because it was Fedorov who initiated the inspection at that  plant.    There was a presentation of the cellular phone system in  Nizhniy Novgorod that day. Speaking about its importance for  Nizhniy Novgorod, Nemtsov says that Nizhniy Novgorod is the  first provincial Russian city that got the cellular phone  system. First, it will provide a possibility to make calls from  absolutely anywhere and get connected to any place in the world.  Second, it finally broke through the monopoly of one phone  service for many years. Third, he hopes the quality of service  will be much better, because there is competition now. This is  a very expensive service, but the city has paid nothing for it.  Investments of a million and a half dollars have been made into  the development of the communications system in Nizhniy Novgorod.    Speaking about the lavish attention given to the forthcoming  elections of a new mayor of Nizhniy Novgorod, Nemtsov says that  it is understandable, because the mayor will head both the  legislative and the executive branches of power in the city.  The difficulty is that people will have to choose between two  very worthy candidates -- Bednyakov and Krestyaninov. This is a  very rare situation. Nemtsov says that Nizhniy Novgorod  residents know both candidates very well, and they will be able  to make their choice. He says that he knows both of them  personally, and he will vote for Krestyaninov.    The city faces very serious problems because of the  developing process of privatization. Nemtsov believes that  there should be very rigid control over that process and over  those who are involved in that. That control can be exercised  by deputies, the independent mass media, the opposition, and the  authorities. Nemtsov thinks that Krestyaninov understands the  significance of the organs of representative power, and he will  have no problems with higher-ranking authorities either.  Besides, obvious problems of the city, such as transportation,  crime, roads, cleanliness, etc., which are not as attractive as  opening ceremonies of exhibits, are the problems that should  nonetheless be dealt with every day. Nemtsov thinks that  Krestyaninov could do that efficiently and calmly. Besides, he  says that he is a normal man, and he can openly say that  Krestyaninov is his friend, he is proud of that, and people may  consider it the main reason why he is going to vote for him.</p>

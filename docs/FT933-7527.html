			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries reach new highs on surprise trade data AN UNEXPECTEDLY wide June trade deficit and strong demand for longer-dated securities pushed US Treasury prices to new highs yesterday. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/4 at 100, yielding 6.197 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was  3/32 firmer at 100 5/8 , to yield 3.896 per cent. Technical factors, including a shortage of 30-year bonds which was squeezing prices higher, continued to sustain the long end of the market. Bonds were also aided by strong demand from investors seeking longer duration on their portfolios. The day's economic news, a widening in the merchandise trade deficit for June to Dollars 12.1bn, up from Dollars 8.4bn, was also bullish for market sentiment. The deficit, the widest since October 1987, was primarily the result of a sharp fall in exports, and indicated that the economy continues to weaken. Analysts said the deficit data suggested that second quarter real gross domestic product growth would have to be revised downward. JAPANESE government bonds were sold off sharply in London trading as the yen slid against the US dollar, dampening any hopes of a cut in Japanese interest rates. The Japanese government bond market closed lower in Tokyo, and then continued to tumble in London trad-ing. The yield on the bench-mark No 145, which started the day at 4.095 per cent in Tokyo, closed at 4.125 per cent in Japan and then rose further in London to 4.19 per cent. Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, emphasised on Wednesday that there were no plans to cut the Official Discount Rate. However, any remaining hopes of an easing evaporated in the course of yesterday as the yen weakened against the US currency and many investors decided to take profits. There had already been rumours that a big Middle Eastern investor was selling Japanese government bonds, which depressed the market, but dealers said the selling pressure became more intense as the US Federal Reserve bought dollars against the yen. ATTENTION in the European government bond markets focused largely on Germany and the Bundesbank's much-awaited announcement of the M3 money supply figures. German M3 money supply grew at an annualised rate of 7.5 per cent in July, against 7.0 per cent in June. Although the July figure was well outside the Bundesbank's stated target range of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent, it was below market expectations and the bund market initially greeted the news with a sigh of relief. Economists had forecast a high M3 money supply figure for July on the grounds that it would be distorted by the recent intervention, related to the crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism at the end of July. However, the market subsequently sold off when the Bundesbank said that the effects of intervention would appear in next month's money supply figures instead. As a result, the market's hopes of an interest rate cut at the Bundesbank council meeting next Thursday were severely dampened. The Liffe bund futures contract slipped from Wednesday's close of 97.22 to end at around 97.17 yesterday, having traded to a 97.34 high. UK government bonds fell up to  3/4 of a point at the long end as investors took profits after the market's substantial rally. Dealers said the market is still mulling over comments made by Mr Michael Portillo on Wednesday, which appeared to rule out the chance of an imminent cut in the base rate.</p>

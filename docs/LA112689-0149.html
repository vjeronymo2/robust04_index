			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIALS OPT NOT TO SET UP CRECHE IN SECULAR DISPLAY  </P> <P> Allegheny County officials have decided not to set up a Nativity scene  surrounded by reindeer and Santa Claus, even though the U.S. Supreme Court says  a secular display is permissible.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court ruled in July that the county's traditional Nativity scene  crossed the constitutional boundary between church and state. But the court  upheld the city of Pittsburgh's right to display a Jewish menorah, which stood  alongside a Christmas tree in the City-County Building.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court said placing secular items around the Nativity scene would  make the display acceptable. Given that choice, the county chose to not display  the creche at all.  </P> <P> "You have to ask yourself, how much do you want to junk it up? Then who do you  offend?" said Maura Minteer, manager of the county's Bureau of Cultural  Programs. "Do you put in a reindeer and a blue Smurf? I'd just as soon not do  it."  </P> <P> As in past years, the county will erect a 12-foot Christmas tree in the  courthouse Wednesday, along with wreaths and poinsettias, Minteer said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a Jewish group in the Pittsburgh area is asking the city to  reconsider its decision not to place a menorah on the steps of the City-County  Building this year. The menorah marks the celebration of Hanukkah, which begins  at sundown Dec. 22 and lasts eight days.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh Solicitor Dan Pellegrini said the city agreed not to display the  menorah if the county could not place the creche in the courthouse.  </P> <P> The group Chabad, which began erecting the menorah in 1980, since has held  talks with Mayor Sophie Masloff's office. Charles Saul, attorney for Chabad,  said he last met with city officials Nov. 13 and is awaiting a decision.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court decision stemmed from a 1986 lawsuit filed by the American  Civil Liberties Union and several city residents who objected to the Nativity  display and the menorah.  </P> <P> The Holy Name Society, a Catholic organization that owns the creche, also does  not want to see the display surrounded by secular items.  </P> <P> The society is working with County Commissioner Lawrence Dunn to find an  alternative downtown location for the creche.  </P></p>

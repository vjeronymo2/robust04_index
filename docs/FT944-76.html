			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Now you've a right to be told the truth - Disclosure of Investment Charges / Alison Smith reports on the new disclosure rules for insurance salesmen Many people are baffled by the intricacies of life insurance, pensions and investment policies. But too little knowledge can lead to serious errors when making important financial decisions. Faced with a sales agent or adviser discussing types of investment or the merits of endowment policies, understanding what you might be buying and its potential cost is crucial. Now, after years of wrangling between the financial services industry and assorted regulators, a new regime has been set up which will require sales agents to volunteer more information about the policies they sell and how much it costs customers to buy. It applies from tomorrow - January 1. What difference will this make to me? From here on, sales agents must hand over a short, stand-alone paper - called a 'key features' document - setting out the main points of the policy and its charges. This should mean that customers are better able to decide if they really want the policy - or if it is too expensive compared with the potential benefits. And seeing in print what you get back if you surrender a long-term policy early - often, less than you have paid in  - could make you think again about making such a commitment. But aren't these financial matters too difficult for anyone except actuaries to understand? This might be true of some products, but you do not have to be particularly numerate to make sense of what you are told. Market research suggests that even people who said they were not good with numbers - or found buying life insurance nerve-wracking - could understand most of the main points in the key features paper. Will its figures tell me how much I will get from a policy? No. They simply give examples of what you would get back after, say, 10 years - and assuming particular rates of growth. What is the point of these numbers, then? All life companies will have to use the same rates of growth for their illustrations. So, if you are prepared to get details from several companies instead of accepting what just one tells you, it gives you a common basis for comparing the impact of their charges. In practice, of course, the investment performance of different companies varies. Doubtless, sales agents will be only too happy to explain how well the policies they are recommending have performed in the past. But their explanations should also make the point that past performance is no guide to the future. Will I get a better deal as well as more information? It depends what you buy. The greatest emphasis has been on improving the return to the customer with a long-term policy who gives it up after a few years. Generally, this has meant finding ways of spreading the commission paid for the sale more evenly over the life of the policy so that the customer's initial payments are not so taken up just with paying for the advice. In some cases, as surrender values have improved, the value at full-term also has risen. This is because the amount invested in the first years has increased, giving a larger fund to grow over the period. In other cases, taking lower charges out of the premiums in the early years means that more is deducted later on, and the maturity value comes down slightly. Research commissioned by the regulators suggests that the new regime will increase competition - and there are signs already that this is putting more pressure on commissions and charges, with some life companies cutting their margins slightly and reducing their costs. Is it all worthwhile? Given how commissions have risen since the end of the industry-wide agreement about the maximum commission that could be paid, then certainly it is an important step in the right direction. There is another, more general, advantage as well. This new regime has been one of the driving forces behind moves by many life companies to make their policies more flexible and able to take account of changes in customers' circumstances.</p>

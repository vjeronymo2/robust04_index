The wife of one of those apprehended informed AKHIR KHABAR  that the security forces had asked 'Abbas al-Qaysi, a  Amman-based Fatah-Revolutionary Council leader and former  prisoner, to report to them. Meanwhile, they searched his house  and detained him, along with others, most of whom were veteran  prisoners who spent many long years in jail. They had been  freed in early 1990.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P>  Hotel Queen's Counsel: Leona Helmsley has hired Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard  law professor who helped clear Claus von Bulow of attempted murder, to handle  the appeal of her tax evasion conviction. Dershowitz says Helmsley's image as a  tempestuous shrew is undeserved.  </P> <P> Helmsley, 69, was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $7.1 million for  cheating on her taxes.  </P> <P> Hit List: LaToya Jackson, Roseanne Barr, Demi Moore and Kim Basinger led Mr.  Blackwell's 30th annual list of worst-dressed celebrities Wednesday. The  acid-tongued critic also flung 1989 fashion darts at Princess Anne, Emily  Lloyd, Cher, Daryl Hannah and Paula Abdul and gave a shared dishonor to Madonna  and Sandra Bernhard. Jackson, a pop singer and sister of Michael Jackson, will  be the "Cher for the '90s" who is "more fashion freak than biker chic . . . in  leather and chains," said Blackwell. Television's Barr was zinged as a "bowling  alley reject" and Batman's Basinger was a "parading peep-show (who) should be  banished to the bat cave."  </P> <P> The Eagle Flies: Quarterback Randall Cunningham didn't get his Philadelphia  Eagles to the Super Bowl but members of one church think he's super. He stunned  them by showing up at Sunday services with a $100,000 donation for the  500-member church. "They were rejoicing," said Elva Smith, of St. John Baptist  Church in east Camden, N.J. Cunningham isn't a member of the church but has  attended often. The church will use the money for construction and a local  outreach program.  </P> <P> Smoke-Out: Social activist Dick Gregory, jailed Monday for intentionally  trespassing in the Smoke Connection, a Milwaukee shop that sells drug  paraphernalia, paid bail and was released Tuesday.

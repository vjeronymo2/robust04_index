			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Nikonov, doctor of historical </F> sciences and chairman of the RF [Russian Federation] State Duma  Subcommittee on International Security and Arms Control:  "Partnership in the Name of NATO?"]    [Text] In the course of the recent heated discussion  which took place at the plenary meeting of the State Duma  regarding the prospects of Russia's joining in the "Partnership  in the Name of Peace," one of the deputies called this program a  "Partnership in the Name of NATO." Judging by the audience  reaction, the misquote was to the liking of many, reflecting the  Duma's cautious attitude toward this program.    The matter here is far from being one of conservatism or  anti-Western sentiment of a significant portion of the deputy  corps. It is difficult to expect a different reaction when the  parliamentarians learn of Russia's joining in the "Partnership"  as being an accomplished fact by reading about it in the  newspapers. However, I will try to express in brief their doubts  and questions.    1. Is the West not trying to use the "Partnership" to help  fill the vacuum formed in Eastern Europe after the USSR, and  later Russia, rejected the "Brezhnev doctrine," agreed with the  unification of Germany and withdrew its troops from this region?  After all, the non-expansion of NATO was one of the conditions  for many of these unilateral steps.    2. It is understandable why NATO needs the "Partnership,"  but  it is not quite understandable why it is needed by Russia. There  are no real external threats from which it would be protected by  participation in the program. Or is it necessaty for defense  against the territorial aspirations of certain Baltic states?    3. For the countries of Eastern Europe, the "Partnership" is  a step along the path to NATO, a sort of understudy membership  in the North Atlantic block. Under such conditions, can we speak  of Russia's participation in the program on an equal basis,  since it turns out to be in the NATO dressing room together with  Romania and Lithuania? And why act as the understudy, when  Russia has the power to play for primary membership, to which it  will hardly be accepted in the near future.    4. NATO was created and acted primarily as a means of  containing communism. The world has changed. Would it not be  better today to use the mechanism of the CSCE [Council for  Security and Cooperation in Europe] to ensure European security,  supplementing it with cooperation in the military sphere, and  also to present prospective guarantees of security to the  countries of Central and Eastern Europe on the part of Russia  and the West?    5. Will the "Partnership in the Name of Peace" not inflict a  serious decline upon the military-political integration within  the framework of the CIS? The Commonwealth countries will  participate in the program in an individual order, and this may  not always correspond with their obligations within the CIS.    6. What are the possible domestic political consequences of  the "Partnership" for Russia, and primarily for the export  capacities of our VPK [military-industrial complex]? After all,  the countries of Eastern Europe will still gravitate more toward  the Western arms markets. Moreover, the "Partnership" is not  free. Each country pays for participation in it from its own  budget. The deputies have not yet seen an estimate of the cost  of Russian participation.    7. Have the domestic political consequences of joining in  the  "Partnership" been evaluated? We cannot exclude the possibility  that the unfavorable attitude toward NATO retained in the  consciousness of many people will evoke an upsurge of  nationalist rhetoric, which will play into the hands of forces  which are far from being reformist.    Of course, we may also view matters from another  perspective.  What would happen if Russia does not take part in the  "Partnership?" In this case, can it change something in the  realization of the program itself or achieve anything other than  self-isolation? The latter question is of key importance, since  the acceleration of Russia's integration into the all-European  structures and the strengthening of international stability are  associated with the realization of the "Partnership." It is  quite obvious that the State Duma will strive to achieve real  participation in ratification of the agreement. Two paths of  further action are emerging for the executive power. First, to  ignore the legislators and move into the "Partnership."  Technically this is possible if we present the "Partnership in  the Name of Peace" as the framework of an international program,  and not as a treaty which requires ratification. However,  politically this is fraught with subsequent complications. The  second means, which is more complex, is to try to convince  public opinion and parliament of the expediency of the  "Partnership in the Name of Peace" for Russia, and not only for  NATO.</p>

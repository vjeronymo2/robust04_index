			<p>BFN     [Text] Almaty, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng arrived here from Bishkek this afternoon for an official  visit to Kazakhstan, the fourth leg of his tour of Central Asia.    President N.A. Nazarbayev presided over a grand ceremony at  the airport to welcome Li, the first top Chinese leader to visit  Kazakhstan.    Li has toured three other Central Asian nations, including  Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan.    Li's entourage includes his wife Zhu Lin, Ismail Amat, state  councillor and minister in charge of the State Nationalities  Affairs Commission, and Qi Huaiyuan, director of the Foreign  Affairs Office under the State Council.    A written statement by the Chinese premier was released upon  Li's arrival at the airport.    Li, describing China and Kazakhstan as "joined by the same  mountains and rivers along a common border of over 1,700  kilometers," said that the ancient "silk road" was written into  the annals of Sino-Kazakhstan friendship and today's Euro-Asia  continental bridge closely links the two peoples.    After the establishment of diplomatic relations, such ties  have gained satisfying expansion, Li noted, saying that  President Nazarbayev's visit to China last year "made important  contributions for the promotion of friendship between the two  peoples."    According to Li the two countries have wide prospects for  developing bilateral relations and the Chinese Government  attaches great importance to the growth of its relations with  Kazakhstan. "There is a sincere hope to develop a long-term,  stable, and friendly relationship of mutual beneficial  cooperation," he added.    Li also said he expected his visit will help promote  friendship, expand cooperation in all fields and boost bilateral  ties to a new high.</p>

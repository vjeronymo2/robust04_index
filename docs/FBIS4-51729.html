			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["War Hysterics" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 3 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam  Monday [2 May] summoned officials of the "Unification and  Security Policy Coordinating Council," groundlessly vilified the  North over fictitious "increase of military exercises" and  "ordered" the entire puppet Armed Forces to take a "round-  the-clock maximum alert posture," according to a radio report  from Seoul.    This is a step to mobilize the puppet Armed Forces in a war  against the North any moment. This shows the puppets' plan to  unleash a war against the North has reached a very dangerous  stage.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's order to the puppet Defence  Ministry came in the wake of U.S. Defense Secretary Perry's  recent visit to South Korea during which he had military confabs  to carry out new Operation Plan 5027, a war scenario against the  North. It is clear what the order is aimed at.    The fact eloquently proves that the U.S. imperialists and  the South Korean puppets are the very ones driving the situation  on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war and their reckless  new war provocation moves are a main factor of an unpredictable  event.    The outcry of the Kim Yong-sam clique over the "increase of  military exercises in the North" is no more than a trick to  mislead public opinion and justify its new war provocation moves.    Lurking behind it is a sinister intention to lull the strong  fighting spirit of the South Korean people for ousting the Kim  Yong- sam puppet clique and divert their attention elsewhere.    Facts show the Kim Yong-sam clique is a group of traitors  who  are indifferent to peace in the country and harmony of the  nation and seek confrontation and war to place the nation on the  altar of big powers at the instigation of outside forces.</p>

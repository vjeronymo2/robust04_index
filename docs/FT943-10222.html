			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Anger over Muslim meeting Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, was yesterday attacked for not banning a conference organised by the Hizb ut-Tahrir group of fundamentalist Muslims to be held in London tomorrow. The Union of Jewish Students condemned Mr Howard's lack of action, accusing Hizb ut-Tahrir of creating a climate of fear among many students. The Home Office said Mr Howard had no powers to ban the conference.</p>

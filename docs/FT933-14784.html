			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / SFA reports sharp fall in complaints THE Securities and Futures Authority, the self-regulating body for stockbrokers and futures groups, yesterday said that complaints against members and claims paid on behalf of members from the Investors Compensation Scheme had both fallen sharply during the past year. The authority's annual accounts for the year to March 31 showed that it received 421 complaints relating to 143 groups, compared with 542 the previous year. But it said that the complexity of complaints and the tendency of complainants to seek the aid of lawyers had grown. The total cost to authority members following complaints covered by the compensation scheme fell to Pounds 600,000 from Pounds 3.4m in 1991-92. Mr Christopher Sharples, the authority's chairman, said the authority hoped that the current review of the compensation scheme's financing would eliminate the element of cross-subsidy between different authorities in the industry. At present SFA members, who are engaged in wholesale business, underwrite a portion of claims against businesses in retail financial services. The authority is considering raising the maximum compensation which can be paid to claimants if cross-subsidisa-tion is eliminated, he said. The authority recorded an after-tax deficit of Pounds 714,000, partly reflecting lower subscription receipts, although these were offset by lower administration costs. The loss was covered by reserves. Operating expenses for 1993-94 are expected to be lower than the year which has just ended. People, Page 12</p>

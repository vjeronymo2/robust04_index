			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 18 (BTA) -- "Bulgarian President  Zhelyu Zhelev described as dangerous the speculations of the  Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], of its leaders and the  BSP-controlled print media, by which the differences between the  civil and the military leaderships of the Bulgarian Army on one  of the problems of the military reform are twisted and fanned up  artificially. Guided by its narrow partisan interests, for more  than two years the BSP has been intriguing and creating tensions  and uncertainty among the army's personnel thus destabilizing  it," says a press release of the Presidency received at BTA.    "Holding a majority in parliament, this political force  determined the budget of the Bulgarian Army and now is shunning  the problems arising in connection with the support of the armed  forces, the maintenance of the combat readiness of their  equipment and the continuation of the military reform," the  press release says. "The leaders and the print media of the BSP  have been grossly manipulating the public, telling blatant lies  about the army's actual problems and the president's confidence  in the military. Any insinuations about 'purges' in the army  and some 'campaign launched to purge its officer cadre' are an  outright attempt to intimidate the officers and win advantageous  election positions," the document goes on to say.    "It is irresponsible to try to seek solution to the problems  of the military reform outside the Ministry of Defence and the  Council of Ministers, shifting the responsibility for it  entirely upon parliament and the president", the President's  Press Office says in its release.    "As it is in all other spheres of public life, the reform in  the army faces some objective difficulties further aggravated by  the general crisis in the country. The president of Bulgaria  and the supreme commander in chief of its armed forces is  convinced that the command of the Bulgarian Army will not yield  to such political provocations and speculations and will be  guided only by the interests of Bulgaria and its national  security in all their activities," the press release says in  conclusion.</p>

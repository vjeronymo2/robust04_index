			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Potsdam (DDP/ADN) -- As expected, this evening  the Brandenburg Land government decided to halt the deportation  of Kurds for six months. This only applies to Kurds who  originate from the troubled regions in southeastern Turkey and  who make their asylum applications in Brandenburg, government  spokesman Erhard Thomas has announced. Criminals are excluded  from the ruling.    Brandenburg is thus following the Social Democratic  Party-governed states of Schleswig-Holstein,  Rhineland-Palatinate, Hesse, and Lower Saxony.

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / The feeling's mutual: Patrick Harverson examines a change in US investors' habits American investors have been pouring Dollars 1bn a day into mutual funds this year. That would be enough to pay off the government's 1993 budget deficit in nine months, or to meet the non-mortgage debts of every citizen in little more than two years. This unprecedented flow of money has helped lift domestic stock markets to record levels. Yet the repercussions of the dramatic growth in mutual funds  -pools of individuals' and institutions' money invested in stocks, bonds and cash instruments - go beyond contented fund managers and soaring financial markets. The inflow represents a shift in the country's investing habits, making individuals' savings more susceptible to swings in financial markets. This change in investment behaviour, in turn, may result in less stable markets: the switching of large amounts of money into stocks and bonds with a higher risk than short-term bank deposits increases the likelihood that investors will withdraw their funds at short notice. Mr Donald Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, warns: 'Many of these investors are new to the equity markets, and they likely will get very nervous if the market begin to correct, and they may cut and run. I don't think at the moment that the market is all that vulnerable, but who knows what would set such a stampede off.' The growth of mutual funds is helping fuel economic growth by supplying capital to corporate and government borrowers. Yet it also complicates the Federal Reserve's job of managing monetary policy by distorting money supply measures used to track economic activity and set interest rates. About Dollars 1,800bn is currently invested by mutual funds in US equity, bond and money markets, up from Dollars 770bn five years ago. In 1980, only 6 per cent of US households owned mutual funds; today, 27 per cent, or more than 38m individual investors, own funds. The most influential factor driving the industry's growth has been low US interest rates. The Federal Reserve began easing monetary policy in late 1990 to help the ailing US economy. From then on, interest rates fell rapidly as the economy moved into recession, finally emerging into a period of slow, low-inflation growth. The sharp decline in rates made stock and longer-term bond funds attractive to investors who saw yields on their short-term assets, such as bank certificates of deposit and money market accounts, drop to below 3 per cent. 'An entire generation of adults grew up with the assumption that they could get 7 per cent or higher on their money and take almost no risk. Over the last two years that has become an incorrect assumption - they can only get 2 to 4 per cent risk-free, which is not an adequate return to meet their investment goals,' says Mr Roger Servison, head of retail sales at Fidelity, the largest mutual fund group in the US. At the same time as falling interest rates were pushing yield-sensitive investors into bond and equity funds, the 35-45-year-olds of the 'baby boom' generation came of financial age, and embraced mutual funds. One way 'baby-boomers' have gained access to funds has been through their company pension schemes. An increasing number of US companies are turning away from traditional defined-benefit retirement plans, which guarantee employees a specific pension by investing their cash in a company-wide fund, towards defined-contribution pensions, which give employees the chance to choose from a variety of investment options, most of which are mutual funds. The skill of mutual fund companies in marketing their products has been another cause of growth. More than 4,000 funds exist, more than double the number five years ago, and fund groups have been joined by new players in the market - securities houses and commercial banks. Merrill Lynch, the biggest US securities house, is now the country's second-largest mutual fund group with Dollars 115bn of customer assets under its management. The surge in mutual funds has benefited many companies, as a rising stock market has made it easier to raise finance. Mr Richard Hoey, chief economist at the Dreyfus fund group, says the surge in mutual funds has allowed companies to pay off or reduce their debts. 'We ended up with a corporate balance sheet dramatically strengthened, and financial risk in the system dramatically reduced,' he says. But there are disadvantages to the buoyancy of the mutual funds industry. The benefits mutual funds have brought to the US economy would be threatened if new investors stampeded out of funds at the first sign of a stock or bond market correction. Last summer a survey by the Investment Company Institute, which represents the mutual fund industry, showed that one in 10 mutual fund owners had bought their first fund between January 1991 and mid-1992. Moreover, many recent buyers are not particularly wealthy - the ICI says the median income of mutual fund shareholders is a modest Dollars 50,000 a year. What worries the pessimists is that first-time and less well-off buyers, with a significant portion of their savings invested in funds, are just the type of investor likely to be panicked by a market slide. Most practitioners in the industry agree that the current pace of growth cannot be sustained, and that the risk of a correction in financial markets cannot be ruled out. Mr Ronald Lynch, chairman of the ICI, warned recently: 'It is imperative that we educate these first-time investors about both the risks and rewards of investing in long-term funds. In particular, bond fund investors must understand the impact of interest rate changes on the price of bond funds.' The chances of a crash in stock or bond prices, however, are regarded as slim by Wall Street. The economy and corporate earnings are steadily, if slowly, improving and underpinning the buoyancy of financial markets. At the same time, Mr Servison of Fidelity is confident investors will not take fright: 'Eighty per cent of all mutual fund owners have been through the '87 crash, the mini-crash of '89 and the Russian coup of '91, and they have learned not to panic in sharp drops in the market,' he says. Industry observers also believe that demographic trends will remain favourable for several years, attracting new investors. At the same time, employee pension plans, with an emphasis on mutual fund investing, are expected to grow more popular. Such factors encourage companies selling mutual funds to believe that, even if US interest rates start to rise or financial markets dip, the mutual fund industry will not be knocked off its confident stride.</p>

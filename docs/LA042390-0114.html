			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA BOY, 8, SHOT BY DRIVE-BY ASSAILANTS  </P> <P> For the third straight night gunfire from suspected gang members ripped through  a Santa Ana neighborhood Sunday, striking a young boy in the back as he watched  television and a woman who was sleeping in the next room, authorities said.  </P> <P> Carlos Alvarez, 8, of Santa Ana was in serious condition at UCI Medical Center  today with a single gunshot wound. The same bullet, police said, also grazed  30-year-old Oselia Rojas, who was treated at the scene.  </P> <P> The shooting was the latest in a wave of gang-related violence in Santa Ana  that has left two teen-agers dead and three people wounded since Friday night.  </P> <P> Sunday's incident occurred around 10:45 p.m. as Carlos was watching television  in his living room in the 2700 block of West Lingan Lane.  </P> <P> Antonio Torres, a family friend who lives at the house, said a bullet burst  through the wall, penetrated the boy's chair, tore through his upper back and  exited his stomach.  </P> <P> The same bullet, Torres said, then ripped through another wall before striking  Rojas.  </P> <P> "If my head had been moved over another inch, I would have been dead," Rojas  said today during an interview at the Lingan Lane house.  </P> <P> It was the fifth drive-by shooting at the house in three years, Torres said.  </P> <P> Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said investigators have not  determined a motive for the attack, but Torres said it could have been aimed at  another nephew who previously lived at the house and is a reputed gang member.  </P> <P> Thomas said police are trying to determine if the shooting is connected to two  others that claimed the lives of two teen-agers over the weekend.  </P> <P> On Friday night, 17-year-old Roger Ochoa died after being shot four times in  the back during a fight at a birthday party with suspected gang members. And  15-year-old Cesar Salgado was gunned down early Sunday as he and a friend were  walking away from another party, about nine blocks away from Friday's shooting.  He died at UCI Medical Center.  </P></p>

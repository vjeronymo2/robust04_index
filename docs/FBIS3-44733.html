			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Xian, January 5 (XINHUA) -- This capital of  northwest China's Shaanxi Province is attracting more overseas  investment these days.    Up to the end of 1993, this major tourist attraction had  approved more than 1,000 overseas investment projects, involving  a total capital of 3.026 billion U.S. dollars.    In 1993 alone contracted overseas investment amounted to  1.17  billion U.S. dollars, equal to the total in the previous ten  years, according to official sources.    Rich in cultural attractions and located in an advantageous  position on the middle of the second Euro-Asia Continental  Railway, the city has witnessed a marked improvement in its  infrastructure since the mid-1980s, in an effort to boost its  tourism industry.    The city's first expressway, linking it with Lintong, a  major  tourism attraction to the east, opened to traffic this year.  The upgrading of two other highways is also underway.    Also completed in 1993 was the Xian International Airport,  which links it with more than 40 domestic and international  cities and ranks among the top four airports in China. More  flights and routes will be opened soon.    The city's telecommunications system also saw a big boost,  with the installation of more than 200,000 digital-controlled  telephone lines. Direct calls can be made to 800 domestic  cities and towns and over 180 countries and regions worldwide.    The developed infrastructure facilities and powerful  technology development potential (the city's 503 scientific  institutions employ 332,000 researchers and technicians) have  made the city particularly attractive to overseas investment, as  it has been chosen as the site for a national high- and  new-technology development zone.    The past year has seen three major tendencies emerge in the  development of overseas investment in the city, according to the  officials.    Manufacturing and urban infrastructure construction have  become the major targets of foreign investment, in place of  housing and small-scale trade. Of the new projects approved in  1993, some 65 percent are in the manufacturing sector, the  officials said.    With the advent of world business giants on the Xian  investment scene, the volume of investment is becoming larger  and larger. A Sino-Japanese venture involves an investment of  30 million U.S. dollars and produces 236,000 industrial sewing  machines a year.    On a visit to Washington D.C. in the U.S. last November, a  delegation from Xian signed an economic and technological co-  operation agreement with the city which provided that Washington  would invest 40 million U.S. dollars to build the "Washington  Industrial Park" in the Xian High- and New-Technology Zone.</p>

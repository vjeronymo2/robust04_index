			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Norway has lifted its last economic sanctions  against South Africa. It repealed a 1986 ban on oil exports and  oil shipments and other economic sanctions imposed in 1987 to  help remove apartheid. Norway said developments in South Africa  and plans for elections in April this year had made sanctions  obsolete. Another contributing factor was the United Nations  General Assembly resolution last October in which member nations  were urged to follow African national Congress leader Nelson  Mandela's request to end sanctions. Norway was one of the first  countries to impose sanctions against South Africa and to give  aid to the African National Congress.</p>

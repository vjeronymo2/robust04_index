			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORT HARBOR STOPS GLENN IN OVERTIME, 21-20  </P> <P> Newport Harbor High School's defensive line held fast on Glenn's two-point  conversion rushing attempt to preserve a 21-20 overtime victory in the first  round of the Southern Section Division VI playoffs at La Mirada High School  Friday night.  </P> <P> After Glenn's two-point conversion pass from Hector Valdez to Travis Carter was  nullified by offsetting penalties, Valdez handed off to Jerry Jonnadal who was  tackled by a swarm of defenders a yard short of the goal line.  </P> <P> Newport (9-2) won the coin toss after the regulation ended in a 14 -- 14 tie.  Under California tiebreaker rules, the Sailors had four chances to score from  the Eagle 10. On their last play, quarterback Stephen Scheck hit tight end  George Greenwalt from the 2. Josh Klein's kick gave Newport Harbor a 21-14  lead.  </P> <P> Glenn had four chances from the 10 and Valdez hit Robert Ernster in the end  zone from the seven on its second play. Valdez's swing pass to Carter appeared  to give the game to the Eagles until the offsetting penalties.  </P></p>

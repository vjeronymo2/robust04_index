			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Many foreign holiday hotels condemned as dangerous SOME HOTELS used by British tour operators in popular resorts in Spain, Portugal and Greece are dangerous to holidaymakers, Holiday Which?, a Consumers' Association magazine, says today. The January edition of the association's magazine says its inspectors 'found major safety flaws in every grade of hotel' in Benidorm, the Algarve and Corfu. The hotels were assessed for fire and glass hazards, as well as safety in swimming pools, play areas, lifts and balconies. All but four of 42 it investigated in mid-1991 were found to be deficient in at least one way. The hotels scrutinised are used by some of the biggest names in the UK travel industry, including the Thomson group. Among the more serious findings of the report are: An 'appalling' state of fire safety equipment in the Algarve, with nine out of 16 hotels having inadequate fire safety precautions. Half the inspected hotels in Corfu and Benidorm are also dubbed 'inadequate' on fire safety. The majority of swimming pools failed to come up to scratch, with murky water and sudden, unmarked depth changes a potential hazard for weak swimmers or children. The Tour Operators' Study Group (TOSG), representing 22 of the larger UK operators, recommends that travel representatives conduct safety checks every six weeks in hotels they use. But Holiday Which? says that such changes 'have patently not resulted in safe hotels for British holidaymakers abroad'. It adds that 'operators cannot just pay lip-service to improving safety standards while still selling holidays to hotels which are clearly unsafe'. Ms Gloria Ward of Thomson said: 'We don't use any accommodation anywhere which does not conform to local safety requirements. However, we do not control local laws, so whether or not the local regulations are the same as those in Britain is irrelevant. But it is in no one's interest to send people to places which are not considered safe.' The study group said the Holiday Which? findings 'will be checked by TOSG members to ensure corrective action has been taken where appropriate. It is up to each individual operator concerned to consider the continued use of a particular hotel.' Mr Keith Betton, head of corporate affairs at the Association of British Travel Agents, said there was a need for European Community legislation on hotel safety standards. Mr Betton added that UK operators, which may this year account for 8 per cent of the 100m tourists in the Mediterranean region, 'do not have the commercial clout' to force overseas hoteliers to bring their safety standards in line with the 'very high' levels found in Britain. Holiday Which? criticises the EC for failing to introduce legally-binding fire safety standards for hotels. One senior member of the UK travel industry said Holiday Which? is 'recommending safety levels far above those normally found in Mediterranean countries. Generally speaking, hoteliers there simply do not feel that such high standards are necessary'. Observer, Page 16</p>

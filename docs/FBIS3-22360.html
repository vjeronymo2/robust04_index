			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The parliamentary SPD [Social Democratic Party of  Germany] party has called on the Federal Government in a  parliamentary motion to present a comprehensive dioxin reduction  program to bring together and standardize the laender's dioxin  measurement programs for establishing permissible emission and  concentration levels. The data obtained from the measurements  should be stored in a dioxin database and made public.  Mandatory limits based on the principle of prevention should be  laid down as rapidly as possible for the main sources of  emission, says the SPD. The dioxin sources where dioxins and  furans occur as undesirable by-products should be "stopped up."  The deputies thus recommend a schedule for phasing out the use  of hexachloroethane in the aluminum industry, close compounds  involving chloric paints, lacquers, oils, and lubricants in the  metal industry, chloric cooling lubricants and cleaning agents  in metal working, and halogenated organic coatings such as PVC  [polyvinyl chloride] or chloric materials for chipboard and wood  products. Products containing halogenated organic compounds  should be labeled accordingly, states the motion, which also  calls for dioxin to be banned from recycling.    The call above all is for a ban on close compounds  containing  chloric materials in the automobile industry, for instance PVC  underseals, and in cable sheaths. Dioxin concentration limits  should be laid down for agricultural and horticultural areas so  as to avoid it being transferred to human beings via animal and  vegetable foods. At the European level, the Federal Government  should press for this dioxin modification program to be made  binding throughout the European Union.</p>

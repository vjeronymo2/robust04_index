			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Under the Multi-Class Plan, all expenses incurred by each Series will be allocated among the various classes of shares based upon the net assets of the Series attributable to each class, except that shares of a particular class will bear the Differential Expenses incurred by such class. In addition, shares of a particular class will bear expenses assessed to that class as a result of a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan providing for a distribution fee or a service fee. Consequently, the net income of, and the dividends payable with respect to, each particular class would generally differ from the net income of, and the dividends payable with respect to, the other classes of shares of each Series. Therefore, the net asset value per share of the classes will differ at times. Expenses of each Series allocated to a class of shares will be borne on a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  basis by each outstanding share of that class. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Class 9 Shares of a Series will be exchangeable only for Class A Shares of the other Series, Class B Shares will be exchangeable only for Class B Shares of the other Series and Class M Shares of New Cash Fund will have no exchange feature since no other Series currently offers Class M Shares. The applicable exchange privileges will be in compliance with rule 11a&hyph;3 under the 1940 Act and will be set forth in each Series' prospectus. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Conclusions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants seek an exemption from sections 18(g), 18(f)(1), and 18(i) of the 1940 Act to the extent the Multi-Class Plan may result in a senior security, as defined by section 18(g) of the 1940 Act, the issuance and sale of which would be prohibited by section 18(f)(1) of the 1940 Act, and to the extent the allocation of voting rights under the Multi-Class Plan may violate the provisions of section 18(i) of the 1940 Act. Applicants believe that the Multi-Class Plan does not raise any of the legislative concerns that section 18 of the 1940 Act was designed to ameliorate. The proposal does not involve borrowing and does not affect the Trust's existing assets or reserves. In addition, the proposed arrangement will not increase the speculative character of the Shares of the Trust since all such Shares will participate  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in all of the Trust's income and expenses with the exception of the differing Rule 12b&hyph;1 fees and Differential Expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants also believe that the Multi-Class Plan will both facilitate the distribution of Shares by the Trust and provide investors with a broader choice as to the method of purchasing Shares. Additionally, if the Trust is able to maintain and expand its number of shareholders through the Multi-Class Plan, it shareholders would benefit to the extent the Trust's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  operating expenses per share would be decreased. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conditions of Relief <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the requested relief is granted, Applicants agree to the following conditions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investment of a Series and be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the various classes of shares of the same Series will relate solely to: (a) The designation of each class of shares of a Series; (b) expenses assessed to a class as a result of a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan providing for a distribution fee or a service fee; (c) different Differential Expenses for each class of shares, which are limited to: (i) Transfer agency fees as identified by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholders reports, prospectuses and proxies to current shareholders; (iii) Blue Sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) Commission registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (v) the expenses of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (vi) litigation or other legal expenses relating solely to one class of shares; and (vii) Trustees' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares; (d) the related voting rights as to matters exclusively affecting one class of shares ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the adoption, amendment or termination of a Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan) in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1; and (e) different exchange privileges. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically identified above that are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares shall not be so allocated until approved by the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Trustees of the Trust, including a majority of the independent Trustees, will approve the Multi-Class Plan prior to its implementation by a particular Series. The minutes of the meetings of the Trustees of the Trust regarding the deliberations of the Trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multi-Class Plan will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the proposed Multi-Class Plan is in the best interests of the Series and its respective shareholders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

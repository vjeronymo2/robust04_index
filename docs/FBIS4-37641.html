			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, New York, June 23, (IRNA) -- Iran's  Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati criticized the application  of double standards and failure of a number of apparent  advocates of the politically charged international campaign  against terrorism to curb the activities of the terrorist  Mojahedeen Khalq Organization (MKO).    In a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali  submitted to him Wednesday [22 June] by Iran's permanent envoy  to the U.N. Kamal Kharrazi, Velayati referred to the June 20  terrorist bomb blast at the holy shrine of Imam Reza (as) in  Mashhad.    He underlined that the failure of the advocates of  international campaign against terrorism to curb the activities  of the MKO terrorist group has not only encouraged the  continuation of such acts of blind terrorism, but also put their  own commitment to combat this international menace into serious  question.    "The massive explosion caused the martyrdom of at least 26  and severe injury of over 170 innocent pilgrims, including many  children, elderly and women", the letter said.    It further called on the U.N. secretary-general to consider  the General Assembly's Resolution 48/122 of 20 December 1993  urging the international community to enhance cooperation in the  fight against the threat of terrorism at national, regional and  international levels.    Moreover, the eleventh ministerial meeting of Non-aligned  Movement (NAM) held in Cairo urged that this international  campaign should be directed without discrimination or  double-standards against "terrorism wherever, by whoever and  against whomever it occurs."    It is the responsibility of all states to live up to their  international commitments in our common endeavor to eradicate  terrorism, Velayati said.    He added that it was possible to eradicate terrorism through  joint endeavor of all states by not only condemning this  cowardly act of inhumanity, but also investigating whether their  official institutions, their nationals or their territories were  used by this terrorist organization for the commission,  planning, financing, instigating or supporting this crime and  take appropriate and effective measures accordingly.</p>

			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : CHULA VISTA  </P> <P> A 44-year-old woman was hospitalized after suffering smoke inhalation Monday  during an early-morning fire in a condominium complex in Chula Vista, officials  said.  </P> <P> The woman's 16-year-old daughter escaped injury by jumping out a window of the  second-floor apartment at 630 Telegraph Canyon Road, said Carol Gove, a deputy  Chula Vista fire marshal.  </P> <P> The two-alarm fire broke out about 3:20 a.m. and was extinguished two hours  later, Gove said. About 20 residents of the eight-unit complex were evacuated,  none of them were injured. But a dog that was in the second-story living room  died, Gove said.  </P> <P> The living room, dining room and kitchen of the apartment were damaged  extensively, Gove said, adding that the fire traveled through an attic and into  a next door apartment. Two first-floor apartments where damaged by water. She  said damage to the four apartments was estimated at more than $500,000.  </P> <P> Officials believe that the fire started in a chair in the living room and was  caused by "smoking materials," Gove said.  </P> <P> The hospitalized woman, Carmen Rodriguez, ran out the front door; she also  suffered slight burns on her face and chest, and singed her hair, Gove said.  Rodriguez was taken to Chula Vista Community Hospital, where she was listed in  stable condition.  </P></p>

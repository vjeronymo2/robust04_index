			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Still sparkling on Sunset: Billy Wilder, undimmed at 86, tells Nigel Andrews of a life in film, about Monroe and Lemmon, Hitler and McCarthy, Chandler and Lubitsch 'I AM against censorship. But I tell you, at de same time dair can be good tings come out of it. Ven you have a new freedom, immediately it's exploited by de pornographers]'. Billy Wilder's Viennese accent is on overdrive. 'A director like Lubitsch, you see, was so much more subtle. In de old days you could not say 'Son of a bitch', you had to say, 'If your mother was a dog . . . ]' 'Now you ask me about de McCarthy era . . .' I had, ten minutes ago. But meeting Billy Wilder is like wandering into a fireworks factory with a smouldering cigarette. The greatest living veteran among Hollywood film-makers is 86. But when I met him for a tete-a-tete in Los Angeles recently, he still behaved like the felt-hatted pyrotechnician who made Double Indemnity, Sunset Boulevard and Some Like It Hot. If censorship had not existed, Wilder would have had to invent it. For 40 years after coming to Hollywood from Hitler's Germany, the Austrian-born director was the cinema's court jester. He exposed forbidden topics to gleeful satire or melodrama and never mind Senator McCarthy (that 'American Dr Goebbels throwing his weight around') or any other of the moral or political nay-sayers. Wilder gave us adultery and murder in Double Indemnity; alcoholism in The Lost Weekend; more adultery plus Marilyn Monroe having her skirt blown around her thighs in The Seven Year Itch; transvestism in Some Like It Hot. Today Wilder's kind of cinema, racy and literate, high-farcical and sophisticated, is almost defunct. What he thinks of its modern replacement we discussed when we met in his office off Wilshire Boulevard: a small cream-coloured cube with a window that the filtered the sound of honking summer traffic. First, though, where did Wilder come from? 'I was what they called a ghost writer, working without credit on scenarios in Germany. That was before 1929-1930, before sound. Then in 1933 I left Germany, the reason being Mr Hitler.' Wilder was on a skiing slope in Davos when he heard that Hitler had become Chancellor. 'Already everyone knew what this man was doing. Your office was taken over by someone you never knew; you were thrown out of your job; and this was not just Jews but gentiles. If you were an artist, you had to look out. Erich Remarque, Thomas Mann, Brecht . . . 'So I came here where I could speak the language a little, which I had learned from Hollywood pictures]' Billy Wilder's US career began at sprint pace, scripting for 1930s comedies like Midnight and Ninotchka: frothy escapism for an America wrestling with the Depression. But the war changed Hollywood's mood and Wilder's style. As director he had his first dark-toned triumph with Double Indemnity. Sex, homicide and whipcrack dialogue: wrought by an unlikely, squally partnership between Wilder and thriller master Raymond Chandler. 'I was young, always chasing girls. He was older, alcoholic and married to this woman who was about a hundred years old. He had no idea how to write a script. But he had this great ear for dialogue. There's a line in one of his books where he says this man 'had hair growing out of his ears long enough to catch a moth'] There's something perfect there. It's as good in its way as Hemingway or Scott Fitzgerald.' Chandler and Wilder cudgelled James M. Cain's novel into shape, although the script's initial ending was one of two legendary scenes Wilder shot but never used. 'I had the hero Fred McMurray dying in the gas chamber. But it was too strong, it was out of key with the rest of the film.' The other intriguing lost sequence is the beginning of Sunset Boulevard. Wilder's giddy melodrama about a fading star (Gloria Swanson) and the young writer she adopts as secretary-toyboy (William Holden) now opens with Holden's voice-over, issuing as if from his dead body afloat in a pool. But the film once began in a mortuary. 'We had the idea of the writer's corpse being delivered to the morgue. And then we had a scene where he and the other corpses talk to each other about the events that led to their deaths. 'It was very surrealist. But at the previews, once the scene began, people started laughing. It tickled them. So I said, the hell with it. We just begin with the pool.' Wilder insists that screenwriting is as much a craft as an art. 'You can come down from the mountain with a poem or novel, but not with a screenplay. There must be technique, there must be architecture.' Yet his best movies are also triumphs of the unplannable. Gloria Swanson stepped into Sunset Boulevard as fourth choice. (The first was Mae West). The Lost Weekend owed its haunting title to a printing error: the film was originally called The Last Weekend. And directing two movies with Marilyn Monroe, The Seven Year Itch and Some Like It Hot, required a mixture of saintly patience and blind faith. 'It's tough, you sweat it out and you want to kill her. But you tell yourself while this is going on - ten takes, 30 takes, 80 takes - well, one day this is gonna be finished. You're not married to her. 'On Some Like It Hot we had Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon standing around all day in the heat, wearing dresses and high heels. All this while Monroe tried to remember a three-word line] 'It's me, Sugar.' She couldn't do it. 'If you caught her on a bad day it was hell, like squeezing a tube of toothpaste. There was a kind of inhibition there, a kind of blank wall, and of course she had a history of mental maladjustment in her family. But if you caught her on a good day, it could be absolute joy. She had that Element X, you know: something magical that draws you to the character so you don't tire of it after five seconds.' Some Like It Hot, Wilder's best-loved comedy, was followed by his own favourite, the triple-Oscar-winning The Apartment. But then the prizes and plaudits ran out. Wilder himself doesn't know why audiences shunned bitter-sweet late comedies like Avanti], The Private Life Of Sherlock Holmes and Fedora. 'Maybe I was trying to please them too much, tell them I'm a good fella. They weren't successes.' By his light or theirs? 'When you have 1,000 people together in a theatre, you have to trust them. They are a kind of genius, you know. Whether they laugh or are silent, you can hear it if a film is working.' But there are different kinds of silence. One can be discriminating attention, another punch drunk stupefaction. Wilder in his eighties cannot get used to a modern movie age in which people 'want action, car crashes, 957 kinds of explosion. The dialogue in a film today is the time to go out and buy the popcorn.' No wonder he feels a kind of despair whenever the urge comes to pitch a new project. It is 12 years since his last film Buddy Buddy. 'I still think I can make a picture. But what is difficult for me is to go in and 'sell' it. You know, I go to an office at Paramount or Universal and across the desk from me is the guy who used to be the mail-boy at the William Morris Agency. And he is telling me how pictures should be made?' Philistinism, claims Wilder, is innate in the structure of a modern Hollywood studio. 'In the old days they operated like fiefdoms. Everyone was under contract. Paramount had 104 writers under contract. Everyone had to deliver ten or 12 pages every Thursday. 'Today studios are like the Ramada Inn. You hire the soundstage, the editing rooms and dubbing theatres, then you get out. In the old days everything was done under one roof. You had your actors right there. Warners had Bogart, Rains, Cagney - all as contract players. Today, it's agents and packages and deals. It's an industry run by big stars and strong agents.' Hence the anomaly of this one-time movie prodigy working (or making plans about working) from a tiny office, where in a desk drawer he still keeps his notebook full of ideas for projects. Sunset Boulevard - 'Silent star wants to make a comeback, gets herself a writer half her age.' The Apartment - 'I had the idea after seeing Brief Encounter, and I wrote, 'How about the guy who owns the apartment where the lovers meet, and has to crawl back into the still warm bed?' Perfect for Jack Lemmon.' Perfect for its time too. But Wilder believes the Golden Age of mordant humanism has gone, replaced by the gimmickry of ra-ra plot ideas and show-off special effects. Certainly few modern film-makers would look twice at the sign he still keeps on his wall saying 'How would Lubitsch do it?' 'He was the all-time master. He never showed off. Directing a film should be invisible. If someone grabs your arm during a picture and says, 'Look at that camera angle' or 'Look at that special effect' - no good] Pictures should be shot with style, but not to prove how inventive the director is: like those scenes in a living-room that are shot through the fire in the fireplace; because then I have to think there's either a burglar or that Santa Claus has come down the chimney] You shouldn't be aware of cuts or angles. Everything should be shot from a character's point of view.' Wilder's own point of view may soon be much in evidence since he's writing an autobiography. 'I suggested a title, but they thought I was kidding. Who I Was, How I Became What I Am And Who The Hell Am I?' 'Because there's nothing pompous about me' he needlessly adds: in what may be the first pompous remark he has made in an hour of conversation. But in the age of PR and the hard pitch, perhaps even Billy Wilder realises he must sometimes blow his own trumpet.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> DAMAGE: What about local freeways in a big quake? . . . A 7.3 temblor on the  Newport-Inglewood fault would hit the San Diego Freeway hardest, geologists  say, closing parts of it indefinitely. . . . Other heavy damage would be on  MacArthur Boulevard, Pacific Coast Highway and the Costa Mesa and Garden Grove  freeways (A11). But Anaheim Stadium should get by, officials believe. . . . Ten  years ago, special bearings manufactured by Fluorocarbon Co. of Laguna Niguel  were inserted at expansion joints between the Big A's sections, allowing  movement without breakage. . . . Still, said a city official, "it's almost  impossible to build an earthquake-proof building. You build them to be  earthquake resistant."  </P></p>

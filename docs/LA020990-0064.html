			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Idol Update: Rock star Billy Idol is scheduled for additional surgery Saturday  to repair his right leg, severely broken in a Tuesday motorcycle accident in  Hollywood, his publicist said. However, Chrysalis Records has said it will go  ahead with the scheduled April 17 release of Idol's just completed "Charmed  Life" album, with the single "Cradle of Love" to be issued April 10, though a  planned 1990 concert tour is in doubt. Meanwhile, director Oliver Stone  released a statement Thursday that he still wants Idol to co-star in his film  biography of the late Jim Morrison, scheduled to begin shooting in early March,  but may have to recast if Idol's recovery takes too long.

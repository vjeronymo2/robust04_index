			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Pass the sake The worst fears of Tokyo's salarymen are coming true. Japan's recession is not turning out to be the short-lived blip that the bureaucrats said it would be. To its credit, Japan's fractious coalition government is still trying to revive the economy. But a sagging stock market, troubled banks and increasingly uncompetitive exporters all suggest that a long and painful period of retrenchment lies ahead. The latest, if rather belated, evidence that the squeeze has a long way to run comes from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Over the last two years, it has publicly supported the Japanese government line that recovery was just around the corner - last June it forecast growth of 1 per cent this year rising to 3.3 per cent next year. But the truth has slowly sunk in. In its latest report on Japan, published yesterday, the OECD has revised these forecasts to zero growth this year and 1.4 per cent next. But even these numbers are out of date. The OECD secretariat now says it expects output to contract this year and grow by less than 1 per cent next. Have Japan's growth prospects been deteriorating that fast? No. The OECD has been catching up with reality. It is true that Japanese industrial output fell by 6.2 per cent in October compared with the same month last year. But output also fell by more than 4 per cent in each of the first three quarters of this year. The reasons for this accelerating fall in output are well documented in the report. Medium- and small-sized companies are hampered by a credit squeeze imposed by indebted banks, while the sharp appreciation of the yen has cut competitiveness. In 1990, US hourly wages were 109 per cent of Japan's. Now they are 76 per cent. The report also provides the government with the economic case it needs to justify next week's further fiscal package. Up to now, the OECD has been backing the Japanese bureaucracy in a sterile dispute with the US government over the appropriate measure of Japan's fiscal stance. But, as this report shows, even on the widest definition of the public sector, Japan has a much lower ratio of net debt to gross domestic product than the OECD average. In short, the government can safely cut income tax to stimulate consumer demand, especially if the cut is balanced by a consumption tax rise far enough into the future to avoid damaging recovery. Moreover, the scope for tax reform and deregulation to free barriers to higher consumption and to speed up the growth of the service sector is substantial. Yet it looks increasingly doubtful that fiscal policy can do the trick alone. A further discount rate cut, to hold down the yen, a degree of monetisation of government debt and a temporary injection of Bank of Japan capital into the banking sector look more likely to accelerate what is set, in any case, to be a sluggish recovery.</p>

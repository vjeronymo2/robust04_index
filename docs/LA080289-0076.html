			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A federal judge in Fresno, who ruled in favor of wine makers Ernest and Julio  Gallo in a trademark dispute with their brother, Joseph, has been accused by  Joseph Gallo's lawyer of a conflict of interest in the case. U.S. District  Judge Robert Coyle ruled June 20 that Joseph Gallo's use of his name on cheese  he was selling misled the public, because many assumed the brand was connected  with his brothers' E &amp; J Gallo Winery. Attorney Josph A. Yanny has demanded  a new trial, saying Coyle was with the law firm that represented the winery  during settlement of a trademark dispute with Gallo Salami of San Francisco in  1983, before Coyle became a judge. Coyle denied any conflict, saying he was not  involved in the Gallo Salami case.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING/FINANCE  </P> <P> Trading Switch: Shares in Landmark Bancorp, the parent company of Landmark Bank  in La Habra, began trading this week on a national computerized  over-the-counter exchange, a move that will cut the costs of trading the stock  and make it more accessible to a wider investor group.  </P> <P> Landmark stock is now listed on the National Market System of the National  Assn. of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations. NASDAQ provides price  quotations for many New York Stock Exchange companies as well as  over-the-counter firms.  </P> <P> Craig D. Collette, Landmark's president, said the listing gives investors "the  best of both worlds" by providing continuous trading and by creating more  vigorous competition among many market makers. Until now, Landmark stock had  been traded through eight market makers, brokers who dictated the price at  which they would buy and sell the company's stock. Compiled by James S.  Granelli / Times staff writer  </P></p>

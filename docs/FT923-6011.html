			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / War worsens the spread of Aids in Africa: British Association for the Advancement of Science SOLDIERS and warfare are playing a significant role in the spread of Aids through Africa, two experts on the syndrome told the association's meeting. Sir Donald Acheson, formerly the government's chief medical officer and now at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said war, 'particularly the slow-burning anarchic disturbances currently so prevalent', was an important factor in Aids, 'as in all sexually transmitted diseases'. Sir Donald has just returned from the former Yugoslavia, where he is the World Health Organisation's special representative. Dr Andrew Cliff of Cambridge University gave the meeting his detailed computer analysis of Aids in Uganda, showing that 'military-associated factors have been instrumental in the development of the geographical pattern of clinical Aids'. Sir Donald said homosexual men - the group hit first and hardest by the disease - were beginning to 'relapse' back to unsafe sexual behaviour in the UK after avoiding risks during the late 1980s. Sir Donald also said the latest evidence showed 'beyond a shadow of doubt' that the UK now had a pool of 'second-generation cases' of heterosexual HIV infection, acquired within the country. Sir Donald forecast 'famine and a serious upsurge of respiratory and intestinal disease' in the former Yugoslavia during the coming winter. Chemists at Southampton University have developed a candidate Aids drug, So221, which is undergoing pre-clinical tests.</p>

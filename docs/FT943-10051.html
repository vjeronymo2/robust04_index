			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Israel close to trade conflict with Europe: Officials have attacked the EU Israel may be making peace with Arab states but it seems on the brink of trade conflict with the European Union. In recent days Israeli officials have bitterly attacked the EU, its main trading partner, for a 'complete lack of political vision' in negotiations over a new free trade agreement and threatened to take trade sanctions and switch public procurement from European to US companies. Officials negotiating the new accord aimed at reducing Israel's Dollars 5.7bn (Pounds 3.67bn) trade deficit with member states say the EU has refused to make concessions which recognise the political and economic sacrifices Israel has made to achieve Middle East peace. Israel's campaign to be granted a special status with vastly improved access to research and development programmes and agricultural markets has been blocked in two rounds of negotiations earlier this year originally aimed at completing a new agreement by December. Israel says it deserves a special agreement tailored to its developed economy in recognition of the economic concessions it is making to Arabs - such as opening its agricultural market to Palestinian produce - as part of the Middle East peace accords. 'We are not asking the EU to contribute to the political and economic stability of the new Middle East by granting us jets and tanks but by giving us access to their markets,' said Mr Oded Eran, the co-head of the Israeli negotiating team. 'We are asking them to have the vision of the US to recognise the political and economic risks we are taking for peace and to allow us to be more bold in future talks and economic arrangements with Arab neighbours.' Israeli frustration at EU obstruction led Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, to warn recently that unless the EU showed more flexibility in trade negotiations, Israel would consider switching some of its public procurement away from the EU and flexing its 'tremendous purchasing power'. Israel's public procurement programme is worth Dollars 6bn a year, a significant part of which goes to buy goods and services from EU states. Officials also said the government could consider giving incentives to the private sector to import from non-EU states. Total imports from the 12 EU members and the four associate members last year was more than Dollars 11bn. Mr Rabin is known to be particularly angry and impatient about the EU's opposition to Israel's demands. Other Foreign Ministry officials play down the row and the threats and say a favourable agreement will be concluded. 'We are merely looking for a free opportunity for our exports into the backyard of our economy and with our natural ally,' Mr Uri Savir, foreign ministry director general, said yesterday. 'Jacques Delors spoke about Israel's special place in Europe and I believe, despite the problems, Israel is more pro-Europe and Europe is more pro-Israel than ever before.' Israel says new EU agreements with Eastern Europe and Magreb states, and changes in Israeli production have eroded the concessions of the existing 1975 agreement or made them obsolete. Jerusalem is seeking concessions in five major areas - research and development; flour exports; citrus fruits; competition for EU public procurement tenders in communications; and a revision of the rules of origin to expand Israeli high-tech and textile exports into the EU market. Mr Eran says the greatest disappointment is in research and development where Israel is seeking to participate in the EU's 'Fourth Programme'. The Commission originally recommended Israel be granted 'Full Association' of the programme but the move has been blocked by France, Britain, Belgium and Ireland. Israel says it deserves entry to the programme because it invests 3 per cent of GDP a year in research and development. It is also prepared to pay the full entry fees of Dollars 25m-Dollars 30m a year and sign all necessary treaties to protect intellectual property. In the flour sector Israel is seeking an increase in its preferential quota of exports from 19,000 tonnes to 30,000 tonnes a year. In agriculture it wants an improvement in the trade of fresh and processed products, a shift in existing quotas to new products not covered by the 1975 agreement. Israel would also like a relaxation in the EU rules of origin and an agreement on a mutual recognition of standards, tests and certificates to allow greater access of Israeli textiles and high-tech products. Israel wants its companies to be able to compete for public procurement contracts in the communications sector and says the EU's demand for opening all sectors of public procure ment to mutual competition would worsen its trade deficit.

On May 12, 1994, an executive session between the Division and OSM was held at the Western Support Center in Denver, Colorado to discuss Utah's revised program amendment regarding highwall retention. Notice of the executive session was posted in the Western Support Center (administrative record No. UT&hyph;925). A summary of the executive session was recorded by OSM and entered into the administrative record (administrative record UT&hyph;942). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utah responded to the concerns identified in OSM's March 31, 1994, letter and the issues discussed at the May 12, 1994, meeting by submitting a revised amendment dated June 28, 1994 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;941). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

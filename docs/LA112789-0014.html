			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEMP MAY ASK FOR VETO TEST CASE  </P> <P> Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp said Sunday he may ask  President Bush to test a line-item veto on housing projects opposed by the  Administration but earmarked for funding by Congress.  </P> <P> "I am going to do everything I can to make sure that Congress does not earmark  monies, including asking the President to perhaps test on a line-item veto  those programs which heretofore have just been shoved down our throat by  Congress," Kemp said on NBC's "Meet the Press."  </P> <P> The HUD secretary did not say which programs would be involved.  </P> <P> On Oct. 24, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater confirmed reports that  the White House was seeking legislation on which Bush could exercise a partial  veto -- and then allow the courts to decide whether the President acted  legally.  </P> <P> Fitzwater told reporters at that time: "We are looking for a vehicle that might  be a suitable test case, but at this point we don't have one."  </P></p>

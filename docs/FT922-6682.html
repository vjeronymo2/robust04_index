			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Warrants issued on Brazilian bank debt PARIBAS Capital Markets yesterday launched the first warrants on Brazilian bank debt, underlining increased interest among investors in Latin American 'distressed' loans. The warrants offer investors the right to buy Brazilian 'multi-year deposit facility agreement' (MYDFA) debt at 40 per cent of face value over the next year. The loans are already traded actively between banks and were yesterday quoted at around this level in the secondary market. However, the secondary market price of the loans has risen this year as Brazil has worked towards a debt restructuring agreement with its commercial creditors. If the country can agree a Brady-style debt restructuring similar to Mexico and Venezuela - under which loans are converted into collateralised bonds - the warrants will give the holders the right to buy Brady bonds. Paribas said that the warrants, which cover loans with a face value of Dollars 100m, were bought by retail and institutional investors looking for geared exposure to Brazil's improving credit standing in the investment community. Earlier this month, JP Morgan launched a Dollars 100m warrant issue on Argentina's bank debt, offering the right to buy either loans or Brady bonds at 41.5 per cent of face value.</p>

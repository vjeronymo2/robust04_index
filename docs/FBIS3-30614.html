			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mariya Tsankova] </F>   [Text] Today's plenary session of the National Assembly  was extended to allow the deputies to debate the motion for a no  confidence vote in Lyuben Berov's cabinet proposed by the  parliamentary group of the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces].  The proposers of the motion argued that the government was to  blame for failing to bring the crime rate under control and to  act against the growth of organized crime. The Socialist  deputies did not [word indistinct] their criticisms of the Berov  cabinet, but called for the drafting of a national program to  combat crime. The National Assembly deputies of the New  Alliance for Democracy gave the government and the Interior  Ministry leadership a one-month deadline to conduct a purge at  all levels within the Interior Ministry to remove corrupt  officials.    The actual vote on the no-confidence motion will be held by  secret ballot next Wednesday [9 February]. On Tuesday [8  February] the National Assembly will hold an extraordinary  plenary session, at which the deputies are likely to debate the  state budget bill, the excise bill, the draft law on aliens'  residence in Bulgaria, and the draft law on the National  Security Service.</p>

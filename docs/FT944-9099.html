			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Unita urges UN truce observers The Angolan rebel movement Unita yesterday urged the United Nations to place observers in the African country's battle zones to guarantee a truce due to be effect last night, Reuter reports from Lisbon and Luanda. Unita's Lisbon office said in a statement that government forces could not be trusted to observe the truce, which is due to hold until a formal ceasefire is declared after a new peace accord is signed on Sunday. 'Unless the truce is followed by the rapid placing of Unavem (United Nations Verification Mission) observers in the areas where military activity is most intense, there is no guarantee that the government will order its generals and mercenaries to stop their attacks,' it said. The truce came after talks in Lusaka by opposing commanders in a conflict which has killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced millions and ruined the economy of the diamond- and oil-rich country. The rebel statement said Unita did not trust the government's declared commitment to national reconciliation in view of the offensive it had launched since the two sides initialled the new peace agreement in Lusaka on October 31. The offensive has led to the government's capture of Huambo, a Unita stronghold in the central highlands, the oil town of Soyo and Mbanza Congo, the capital of Zaire province in northern Angola. Representatives of both sides met in Lusaka secretly yesterday. Officials close to the talks said details of the session were not expected to be made public before the weekend. There has been no reaction so far from either President Eduardo dos Santos or Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader, to the truce declaration. Military analysts said the truce merely halted immediate hostilities and details of the ceasefire, including the thorny issues of the security of Mr Savimbi and other leaders of Unita and the planned disarming of guerrillas, had to be sorted out before Sunday. South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki yesterday ruled out deployment of a southern African intervention force to rescue the peace process in Angola. Responding to questions in parliament, Mr Mbeki dismissed reports that South Africa had considered joining a force to enter Angola when it appeared that a peace accord would not be signed.</p>

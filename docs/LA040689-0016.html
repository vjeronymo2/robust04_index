			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISTRICT 2 RACE  </P> <P> Alan Gershman is a liberal Democrat who has totally devoted himself to the  education of young people in Los Angeles. Gershman's one sin (other than being  a liberal Democrat) is that he has refused to give his body and soul to UTLA  President Wayne Johnson and his union. With Gershman defeated in the April 11  election for the Los Angeles school board, the unions will own the school board  lock, stock and barrel.  </P> <P> Irrespective of the merits of the current wage dispute, this conflict of  interest would very obviously be an unhealthy situation -- unhealthy for the  taxpayers, the voters and, in particular, the children.  </P> <P> RICHARD J.

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (18): Mexico making up for lost time - An attractive market for investors / Telecom prices in Mexico are falling sharply as a result of competition and the emergence of cellular services While governments in other countries remain cautious about deregulation, Mexico is forging ahead with a swingeing reform programme that will bring the national operator Telmex into direct competition with some of the most powerful telephone companies north of the border. Competition will largely be in long-distance services. The Ministry of Communications and Transport agreed in July to grant an unlimited number of licences to companies to offer long- distance services from January 1997. A detailed regulatory framework for the new operators will be drawn up in the autumn. Several Mexican industrial and financial groups have already thrown their hats into the ring. The leading contenders are those companies which have forged links with US telephone operators. Three such groups have emerged: Mexico's largest financial group, Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival (Banacci), which has taken a 55 per cent stake in a consortium with US long-distance operator MCI. Mexican cellular telephone operator Iusacell, which is 49 per cent owned by Bell Atlantic. Iusacell also has a liceence to build a fixed wireless local telephone network. US telecoms equipment manufacturer Motorola and the Mexican industrial conglomerate Grupo Protexa; also, the US long-distance operator Sprint is in discussions with Grupo Protexa about joining the consortium. Joshua Levenburg, a Latin American analyst at Pyramid Research in Massachussets, says there is 'enormous interest' in the Mexican market - 'the opening of the long-distance market is a tremendous investment opportunity,' he adds. Pyramid Research estimates that telecoms service revenues in Mexico will almost double from Dollars 7.6bn in 1993 to Dollars 14.4bn in 1998; the market grew by 16 per cent in 1993. Mexican long-distance calling patterns are favourable for new operators. Seventy-five per cent of all long-distance traffic is between the cities of Monterrey, Guadalajara and Mexico City. Telmex's long-distance and international call revenues last year totalled Dollars 4.2bn - more than 50 per cent of Telmex's total revenues. Mexico's low telephone line-penetration levels also make it an attractive market for investors. There are only eight telephone lines for every hundred people. Telmex is having problems meeting the demand for new lines, and this gives operators of wireless systems - who can instal lines in a matter of days - a distinct advantage. Telmex is vulnerable to competition - 'you've got some major players with deep pockets coming in,' observes Eduardo Cabrera. It is difficult to forecast the effect of competition on Telmex, he adds - 'the key question in Mexico at the moment is how profitable Telmex will be in the long term.' A proposed licence fee for new competitors in the range Dollars 100m to Dollars 500m will dampen the prospects for competition. But a more important issue is the interconnection fees that competitors will have to pay Telmex for passing calls over its network. Telmex will be seeking to pass on to competitors - through their interconnection charges - part of the cost of operating its loss-making local telephone network. Long-distance competitors will operate along similar lines to companies such as MCI and Sprint in the US. Telmex customers will able to dial a code to choose a long-distance carrier, but they will also have the option of subscribing to a particular carrier for all their long-distance calls. This is the same system as in the US where AT&amp;T has lost 35 per cent of the long-distance and international calls market. But competition will develop along different lines than in the US where local networks remain closed to competition. Two of the three leading Mexican consortia operate cellular telephone networks. Iusacell owns cellular telephone networks in Mexico City, and controls other concession in Guadalajara and in the centre and south-east of Mexico. Its concessions cover almost three-quarters of the Mexican population. Motorola, meanwhile, has stakes in cellular telephone networks across the whole of the 2,000-mile border with the US. This gives the two consortia a big advantage over other prospective long-distance operators. Even when a customer choses a competing long-distance operator, the call begins and ends on local phone lines connecting the orginator and the person who receives the call. The competing carrier has to pay Telmex for these two local ends, and these payments could eat into profits derived from the long-distance section of the call. Motorola and Iusacell can get round this problem by connecting customers to their long-distance networks using their cellular networks. Cellular phone services are currently too expensive for customers to consider using them as an alternative to Telmex's standard telephone service. But prices are falling sharply as a result of competition and the emergence of cellular as a residential as well as a business service. In the meantime, Iusacell is building one of the world's first local fixed telephone networks using cellular telephone technology. The network, which will open in a rural area close to Mexico City in the late autumn, uses frequencies at around 450MHz - the same part of the radio spectrum used by Scandinavian phone companies for first generation cellular telephone networks, launched in the early 1980s. Iusacells's network is supplied by Northern Telecom which has a Dollars 330m three-year contract. Telmex has been bracing itself for competition since its privatisation in 1990 - 'they've done a commendable job of trying to improve the technology: 70 per cent of the network is now digital,' notes Cabrera. Telmex has also hiked up local call rates and reduced long-distance and international charges where it will face stiffest competition.</p>

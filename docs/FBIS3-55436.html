			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kazakh </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A session of the Cabinet of Ministers took place  yesterday, chaired by Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko. Under  examination was the republic's draft budget for the current  year, which had been sent earlier for finalizing. It was noted  that a complex situation had developed in the credit and  financial sphere. A lot of difficulties have been experienced  with ensuring revenue for the budget.    However, a 1994 draft budget gives us hope that its  implementation will change the republic's socio-economic life  for the better. First of all, it is based on the national  currency. Secondly, it has taken into account recommendations of  international financial organizations, such as the IMF and the  World Bank. Thirdly, it pursues a tough policy which is dictated  by the needs of market economy. At the same time, we should  support the less well off sections of society. Social support  should be targeted and preserved. It was decided to submit the  draft budget for consideration by the president of the republic.    The government's report on the main issues of a program for  systematic and economic transformations for 1994 was also  approved by the session. This report will be submitted for  consideration by the Paris meeting of the IMF consultative group  on 14 January.</p>

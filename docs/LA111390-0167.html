			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANAGING YOUR MONEY;  </P> <P> PREPARE YOURSELF;  </P> <P> COUPLES CRAFTING NEW RULES FOR SHARING;  </P> <P> FORGET 'WHAT'S MINE IS OURS.' THAT AXIOM HAS GIVEN WAY TO DIVORCE, THE WOMEN'S  MOVEMENT AND OTHER FACTORS THAT COMPLICATE DOMESTIC MERGERS.  </P> <P> Jeannette DeWyze and Steve Wolfe have been married 16 years. They have two  children, a house in San Diego and two thriving careers. But every month, they  sit down, add up their expenses and split them in half. They have never had a  joint bank account.  </P> <P> Sarah Williams and Ron Thompson were married last year. They live in the  condominium in Los Angeles that she bought before they married. She pays for  their food and clothes. She put his name on her savings account. But his money  goes into his business.  </P> <P> "Household expenses? Not my problem, baby," mused Ron, an artist and general  contractor who, like his wife, asked not to be identified by his real name.  "This is a little early 1990s male chauvinism."  </P> <P> There are few rules left governing how couples handle their assets. The women's  movement and the divorce rate have put an end to that. Some merge everything, a  few merge nothing. And more and more, couples alight on some murky middle  ground.  </P> <P> Usually, it happens haphazardly. They marry in their thirties with a modern-day  dowry of bank accounts, investments and careers. Out of habit, they may start  off keeping things separate. But they soon mingle them, all too often with  little or no thought.  </P> <P> The consequences of their non-decisions can be dire. If the marriage ends, a  spouse can lose more than his shirt. Yet financial planners and marriage  counselors say they are struck by a common theme: how much money matters and  how little it is discussed or understood.  </P> <P> "Money is critical in our marriages," said Jean Flannigan, a psychotherapist in  West Los Angeles. "I think it is the single most important symbol of the  underlying issues. We project our psyche, or our soul, onto money."  </P> <P> "People will share intimate information about their sex life with their best  friend, but they won't share their finances," said Rose Greene, a financial  planner in Santa Monica. "It is the most private subject, and it has the most  amount of shame associated with it."  </P> <P> There was a time when our hang-ups perhaps mattered less. Men made money and  most women didn't. Couples married young, without houses, investments, children  from previous marriages. They pooled everything. After all, hadn't they married  for life?  </P> <P> But these days, most women work. Some earn more than their husbands or derive  self-esteem from being self-supporting. Many couples marry later, in their  thirties and forties, bringing wealth from an earlier life. And half of all  marriages end in divorce.  </P> <P> Contemplating breakup, therefore, has become a necessary evil. Otherwise,  ex-partners can find themselves fleeced -- their hard-earned assets split 50-50  under community property laws or passed on, inadvertently, to a surviving  spouse's children from a previous marriage.  </P> <P> Under California's community property system, money earned through either  spouse's work during the marriage becomes community property. If the marriage  ends, those earnings must be served up for division under the terms of a  divorce settlement.  </P> <P> But assets acquired by either spouse before the marriage can be held as  separate property -- not subject to division in a divorce -- as long as an  absolute separation is maintained and there is no intentional or inadvertent  "commingling" of assets.  </P> <P> According to financial planners, more and more couples are keeping at least  some property separate, especially in second marriages. Some do it because they  have stopped believing that marriage is permanent; others do it to protect  their children's inheritance.  </P> <P> Many hold their house jointly, splitting the mortgage payments. Investments  from before the marriage remain separate. They set up separate and joint bank  accounts and credit cards. Only over time do they begin making joint  investments and "merging."  </P> <P> What is the best way?  </P> <P> Most financial planners insist it is impossible to generalize; any financial  arrangement must be tailored to the couple in question. If there is one rule,  they say, it's that couples should talk about money in advance.  </P> <P> "A lot of it has to do not necessarily with just protecting the assets but  protecting the egos," said Alan Ungar, a certified financial planner in  Calabasas. "It's much less a financial planning decision than it is an  emotional one."  </P> <P> Rose Greene and Carol Rabaut have been lovers for 12 years. Rose has kept her  inherited assets in her own name. But the two women share a lot -- a house in  West Los Angeles, a car, two dogs, a cat and an explicit agreement on how they  would divide things if they split up.  </P> <P> "I think some people mistake the way they hold assets with the degree of  commitment," said Greene, a financial analyst, who sees in her job the damage  wrought by what she calls indiscriminate merging. "I don't think I love Carol  one iota less because I choose to hold assets in my own name."  </P> <P> Others, however, are wary of such separateness. They fear it symbolizes bad  faith. Some say they would never marry a man who asked that they sign a  prenuptial agreement; indeed, weddings have been called off at the last minute  over that issue.  </P> <P> "I'm certainly suspicious of people who really keep things separate," said  Sarah Williams, the 41-year-old television executive who pays all of her  husband's living expenses. "I mean, joining funds is like the least of the  commitment to joining your lives together."  </P> <P> And a few, like Jeannette DeWyze, prefer to keep everything totally separate.  </P> <P> "I think in the early years of my marriage I was very concerned about  preserving my own autonomy within the union," said DeWyze, a 37-year-old  writer. "I guess it was always important for me to feel I could make it on my  own outside of marriage."  </P> <P> "It just fit us, and our psychological makeup," she said. "It's only from other  people's reactions that I get some idea of how weird people think it is."  </P> <P> </P> <P> TIPS  </P> <P> * Couples should talk about money in advance because the consequences of  non-decisions can be dire. Ex-partners can find their hard-earned assets split  50-50 under community property laws or passed on, inadvertently, to a surviving  spouse's children from a previous marriage.  </P> <P> * Under California's community property system, money earned through either  spouse's work during the marriage becomes community property. If the marriage  ends, those earnings must be served up for division under the terms of a  divorce settlement.  </P> <P> * Assets acquired by either spouse before the marriage can be held as seperate  property-not subject to division in a divorce-as long as an absolute separation  is maintained and there is no intentional or inadvertent "commingling" of  assets.  </P></p>

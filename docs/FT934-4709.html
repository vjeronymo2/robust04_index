			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Development Securities to spend Pounds 44m on properties Development Securities, formerly Clayform Properties, yesterday announced two acquisitions for Pounds 44m to be partly funded by a placing and open offer to raise about Pounds 29.3m. Mr Robert Ware, joint managing director, said that yesterday's moves were the same as those which had been planned for November, when the property investor and developer postponed the share issue and acquisitions amid press comment about an investigation by the Department of Trade and Industry into dealings in the shares of Clayform. Mr Ware said that the company welcomed the probe which was - as he understood it - looking into dealings on the two days before Mr Martin Landau, the property entrepreneur, joined DS as deputy chairman. He emphasised that the dealings had 'nothing to do with the company or the directors'. DS is buying a portfolio of 85 properties from Ethel Austin Properties for Pounds 26m, Pounds 25m of which will be in cash. Valued at Pounds 25.8m on December 1, they consist mainly of retail units in town and city centres. Currently the properties produce net rental income of about Pounds 2.2m a year. DS is also acquiring Grafton Estates for Pounds 18m, of which Pounds 15.4m will be in loan notes, Pounds 2.2m in cash and the balance in shares. Grafton has a portfolio of 10 properties across the UK; which were valued at December 1 at Pounds 28.3m and produce rental income of about Pounds 2.5m a year. Mr Ware said that the acquisitions would increase retail property's share of DS's portfolio to 69 per cent of the total leaving offices with 25 per cent and the industrial property with the remainder. DS is issuing some 93.7m shares at 32 1/2 p - the shares were unchanged yesterday at 33 1/2 p - on a 4-for-5 basis. It is also borrowing Pounds 15m to lift the Pounds 29m from the placing to the Pounds 44m acquisition price. Year-end debt will be between Pounds 31m and Pounds 33m, giving pro forma gearing of 45-50 per cent.</p>

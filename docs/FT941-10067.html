			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Councils unite to save steel industry A coalition of 24 Tory and Labour-controlled councils will be launched in the Northamptonshire steel town of Corby today to fight for the survival of the country's steel industry. The campaign, to be called SteelAction, will also demand more action from the government to end subsidies paid to rival foreign industries by their governments. The councils, which all have steelworks in their areas, claim that more than 50,000 jobs are at risk - this is more than the number of jobs lost recently in the coal industry. Mr Roger Stone, a Rotherham councillor is to be the chair of SteelAction. He said: 'We have seen one industry after another disappear from Britain, and we're uniting now to stop the steel industry collapsing in the same way.' SteelAction Organisers say that the country's steel industry faces pressure on two fronts. Subsidies paid to competitors in Italy, Spain and Germany put them at a grave disadvantage, while the continuing over-capacity on the continental mainland badly affects what is left of the UK industry. Mr Stone said that the government either had to force the countries still paying subsidies to stop the payments and to make capacity cuts or it should give UK producers temporary financial help so that they can survive. The launch of the coalition comes on the eve of a meeting of Eurofer, which groups the big European steelmakers, to discuss the industry's restructuring plans. Non-aided private companies are holding back from offering capacity until the European Union takes a tougher line on subsidies.</p>

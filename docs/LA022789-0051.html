			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'ME-TOO' CANDIDATES ANNOY SOVIET PAPER  </P> <P> The Moscow Communist Party daily suggested Sunday that there was little to  choose among the candidates running for the capital's 26 districts in next  month's parliamentary elections.  </P> <P> "What was the most striking thing about the first stage of the election?"  Moscow Pravda asked, referring to the selection and registration of candidates  for the Congress of People's Deputies, which in turn will elect a new  parliament.  </P> <P> "First of all it was the complete or virtually complete identity of positions  in the platforms of the absolute majority of candidates," the paper said.  </P> <P> Almost all the candidates stand for economic development, helping the  underprivileged, environmental protection and strengthening democracy, it said.  "Evidently, to enter into the contest without putting all these points into  one's program would have been pointless," it added.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Procedure Criticized  </P> <P> The paper, which published the full list of candidates, criticized the  nomination procedure and in particular the voting by show of hands. It  expressed regret that there were few working class candidates, saying they had  failed to get the organized backing given to intellectuals.  </P> <P> All the districts have more than one candidate on the ballot, as the new  electoral law specifies, and in one district, voters will have to choose from  13 candidates on election day March 26.  </P> <P> A commentary on the elections by Soviet poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, who himself  narrowly failed to be adopted as a candidate for Moscow's Lenin district, urged  voters to elect only those candidates advocating genuine change.  </P> <P> "We do not need a Supreme Soviet of subordinates fearing their bosses, or of  their bosses fearing even higher bosses, or even those bosses who have no  regard for public opinion or their own consciences," he wrote in the weekly  Ogonyok.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Utopian Ideas  </P> <P> He called on voters to avoid candidates advocating patching up current problems  as well as those with Utopian ideas "who hold elevated discussions about a  state of law, while forgetting people's rights to a roof over their heads."  </P> <P> He said the main tasks of the new parliament, which will hold far greater  powers than the existing rubber-stamp Supreme Soviet, should include granting  citizens the right to free foreign travel and the abolition of residence  permits.  </P> <P> Under the residence permit or propiska system, all Soviet citizens are  restricted in where they can live. The propiska for the main cities such as  Moscow and Leningrad are hard to come by for ordinary people who were not born  there.  </P> <P> Yevtushenko also called for an end to the system of special shops, hospitals  and services for senior officials as a first stage to solving the country's  economic problems.  </P> <P> Similar calls for an end to special privileges have been made by former Moscow  party chief Boris N. Yeltsin, who will fight for a seat representing the whole  of Moscow at the polls.  </P> <P> Yeltsin was dropped as a non-voting member of the party's ruling Politburo in  1988 after criticizing the slow pace of reform.  </P> <P> At an election meeting last week, where Yeltsin was chosen along with a Moscow  car plant director from a list of 10 candidates, he pledged to open the  question of a multi-party system to wider discussion.  </P></p>

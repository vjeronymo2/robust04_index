			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Council ban on deer hunting quashed A ban on deer hunting on Somerset County Council land was yesterday declared unlawful and quashed by a High Court judge. Mr Justice Laws ruled that councillors exceeded their powers when they voted by 26 to 22 last August to ban hunting at Over Stowey Customs Common because they found the sport 'morally repugnant'. The judge said the law 'confers no entitlement on a local authority to impose its opinions about the morals of hunting on the neighbourhood'. He gave the council leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal after being told that 35 councils had imposed similar bans. The Liberal Democrat-controlled county council was ordered to pay the legal costs of the case - unofficially estimated at Pounds 50,000. The judge said the primary question was whether the councillors' moral objections were capable of justifying the hunting prohibition as a measure conducive to 'the benefit, improvement or development' of the area, in line with the council's obligations under the 1972 Local Government Act. The judge said the language of the act was not wide enough 'to permit the council to take a decision about activities carried out on its land which is based upon free-standing moral perceptions as opposed to an objective judgment about what will conduce to the better management of the estate'. He added: 'A prohibition on hunting . . . could only be justified if the council reasonably concluded that the prohibition was objectively necessary as the best means of managing the deer herd, or for the preservation or enhancement of the amenity of their area. 'The view that hunting is morally repulsive, however pressing its merits, has nothing whatever to do with such questions.'</p>

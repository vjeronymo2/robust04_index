			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: DO WE HAVE A NATURAL HUNGER FOR NUTRIENTS?  </P> <P> In Woody Allen's movie "Sleeper," set far in the future, he explains to a  surprised traveler from the past that hot-fudge sundaes and steaks have been  found to be good for you. We'd all like to live that fantasy: having foods that  look, smell and taste good turn out to be the most nutritious. Even better  would be if the reverse were true: if finding a food distasteful signaled that  it was not nutritious, or even plain bad for us.  </P> <P> Alas, that implies an inborn ability to select a good diet and avoid a poor one  -- equipment we lack. It's true that we do have some general genetic  information handed down from remote ancestors, as well as more recent  scientific and cultural guidelines. Otherwise, we're on our own in dealing with  a huge, varied food supply perhaps as challenging as that faced by the  hunter-gatherers of long ago. The human race has been so successful as a  species partly because we are omnivores, able to adapt to new sources of  nourishment -- provided we experiment with caution.  </P> <P> By this time in our evolution, the ways we choose foods are complex. Dr. Paul  Rozin, professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, recently  published an update in Nutrition Reviews on how long-lasting food preferences  develop.  </P> <P> There are a few genetically programmed biases for or against certain food  substances. Thousands of years ago, two bits of enduring information were  acquired by our nomadic progenitors: Sweetness provides energy and bitterness  can signal harm.  </P> <P> Today, when drops of salty, sour, bitter or sweet solutions are placed on the  tongues of newborn babies, their expressions range from emphatic rejection of  the bitter solution to beaming acceptance of the sweet one. The age-old lesson  is still fresh.  </P> <P> Humans also instinctively display ambivalence about new foods -- suspicion  coupled with curiosity. Historically, man has had an inborn ability to make the  link between a given food and unpleasant consequences. This information was  handed down through the generations, promoting survival of the species.  </P> <P> There are innate hungers for a few essential nutrients. Earlier in this  century, Dr. Curt Richter conducted classic studies with rats (another  successful omnivorous species). Sodium-deficient for the first time, the rats  selected high-sodium foods. Made thirsty, they chose foods high in water. It's  also possible, but unproven, that there are innate hungers for protein,  carbohydrate and calcium.  </P> <P> Be that as it may, over time humans (and rats) learn to identify foods that are  deficient in specific nutrients and foods that supply the lack. Long before a  deficiency of Vitamin C was pinpointed as a cause of scurvy, British ships were  carrying preventive medicine in the form of limes (citrus fruits are high in  Vitamin C) on long voyages. Centuries before, the diet of Chinese sailors  included the fresh, Vitamin C-rich leaves of ginger plants.  </P> <P> Predominantly, however, our food choices are influenced by culture and  ethnicity, and by individual experiences, pleasant and unpleasant. Sometimes  cultural knowledge is a plus. The ancient Mexican practice of soaking corn  kernels in lime water to soften them for tortillas also releases niacin in the  corn for absorption by the body and helps prevent pellagra in corn-eating  populations. Fermenting milk to produce yogurt makes it possible for  lactose-intolerant people to enjoy its nutritional benefits, among them  protein, riboflavin and calcium.  </P> <P> On the other hand, if you belong to the people of northern Japan, who  habitually eat a high-salt diet, you have a better chance of developing  hypertension than inhabitants of the southern Japanese islands, where salt  consumption is low. An innate recognition of the need for enough sodium is not  paralleled by an inner gauge signaling when you've had too much. Similarly, the  universal inborn preference for sweet flavors doesn't extend to an instinctive  knowledge that sugary foods, particularly sticky ones, are harmful to teeth.  </P> <P> Within cultures, there are many variations in individual food preferences.  Strangely enough, though, family relationships have little impact on individual  choices. Heredity plays a role in obesity, but bows out when it comes to food  selection. Even a mother's or father's likes and dislikes have no great  influence on those of their children.  </P> <P> Why the family has so little imprint on individual choices is a mystery.  Another public-health puzzle is why people like or dislike foods because of  their intrinsic sensory properties. Obviously, it's easier to persuade people  to eat healthy foods if they also taste good. Worldwide, the food industry is  devoting some $2.5 billion annually to finding ways to give flavor to low-salt  products, add sweetness to foods low in sugar, or introduce a rich and creamy  "fat" sensation without using fat.  </P> <P> Both as nutritionists and as food lovers, our taste is for fresh and lightly  processed foods. But with all this research going on, maybe Allen's  hot-fudge-sundae future isn't so far away after all.  </P> <P> Question: While listening to a TV talk show that took viewers' calls, I heard a  mother call in and ask if it was safe to let her two daughters, age 10 and 12,  become vegetarians. The answer given was that it was fine, especially if the  diet contained dairy products and eggs. However, the person on the show was a  health reporter, not a nutritionist. Was the advice sound?  </P> <P> Answer: Indeed it was, as far as it went. A lacto-ovo vegetarian diet can  provide enough of the essential nutrients young people need for growth and  development. Contrary to popular belief, however, the nutrient that deserves  special attention is not protein. Almost certainly, it will be present in  sufficient amounts -- not only from dairy products and eggs but from the  vegetables and grains the youngsters eat to get the calories they need.  </P> <P> Iron is a different story. In vegetarian diets, the amount of iron is more  limited. Iron from vegetable sources also is absorbed less efficiently than  iron from animal flesh. For these reasons, it's important to pay particular  attention both to getting enough iron into the diet and to making sure that  it's well absorbed.  </P> <P> Iron-rich foods include enriched and fortified breads and cereals, dark-green  leafy vegetables and dried beans. The key to enhancing absorption from these  foods is Vitamin C. That's found in generous amounts in many fruits and  vegetables, among them citrus fruits, tomatoes, cantaloupe, honeydew, broccoli,  green pepper and cabbage. Serving a C-source along with an iron source makes  good nutritional sense.  </P> <P> Q: I bought a tube of concentrated tomato paste in an Italian grocery. The  packaging had no instructions about how much to use in place of regular tomato  paste in a can, and nobody in the store could tell me. Do you know?  </P> <P> A: Whether it comes in a tube or a can, we're talking about the same product.  Either way, that means about 15 calories per tablespoon, virtually all from  carbohydrate. Use the same amount as you would if the paste came in a can. The  advantage of the tube is when a recipe only calls for a tablespoon or two. Of  course, it can be more expensive to buy it in this form. You could open a can  of paste when you need a small amount and divide the rest into small portions  to store in the freezer until needed.  </P> <P> In this country, tubes of tomato paste and other seasoning are only beginning  to become popular. In Europe, this form of packaging has been in use for a long  time.  </P> <P> Q: Are there any differences in the Vitamin-C content of frozen orange juice  prepared from concentrate versus the juice available in the dairy case?  </P> <P> A: The differences are insignificant. In six ounces of juice, the average  amount of Vitamin C ranges from 74 to 76 milligrams, considerably more than the  Recommended Daily Allowance of 60 mg. It's true that Vitamin-C losses occur as  the juice sits in the refrigerator. To minimize losses, keep the juice tightly  covered. Refrigerate it promptly after use, and buy amounts that you can use up  within a few days.  </P></p>

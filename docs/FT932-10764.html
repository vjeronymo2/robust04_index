			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / TUC faces row over conference for blacks: Minorities want the ability to set their own union agenda THE TRADES Union Congress faces an embarrassing public row tomorrow over whether its annual black workers' conference should be restricted to delegates from racial minorities. Mr Marc Wadsworth, from the National Union of Journalists, said: 'The black rank and file in the unions is on a collision course with the TUC establishment, which has been manoeuvring all year to stop black-worker self-organisation.' The congress's race relations advisory committee - which has a black majority - has recommended that the black workers' conference this weekend should back a resolution from the National and Local Government Officers Association (Nalgo) calling for the conference to admit whites only as observers in future. Mr Wadsworth said: 'We want to debate and formulate a black union agenda among ourselves before going on to campaign for it in the broader movement.' The congress carried out a consultation exercise recently to find out what the unions think of such a restriction. Support for a conference restricted to members of racial minorities has come from a handful of unions including the public employees, the communication workers, the National Union of Teachers and the RMT transport union. Large unions, however, such as the TGWU and GMB general unions, the Ucatt construction union, the shopworkers and the MSF technicians union, are opposed to such an idea. The transport workers, led by Mr Bill Morris, their general secretary, have told the congress that the move would be 'divisive' and would create 'an apparent segregation'. The union said this would antagonise many unions that had not yet set up structures to encourage more black participation. This year's TUC black workers' conference, which opens today, will for the first time debate policy resolutions. It is expected to endorse a range of proposals designed to improve the position of black workers in the labour market, including: A call for a statutory ethnic monitoring requirement for all employers, as exists in Northern Ireland. A statutory duty on all employers to pursue equality-of-opportunity policies with goals and timetables for implementation. Legislation to protect civil servants from ethnic discrimination in market-testing programmes. A call on the congress to oppose the recruitment and continued employment of known racists in all industries where black people are clients of the services provided. A demand that the congress accepts three black representatives on its general council. Union membership figures in a government labour-force survey show a sharp fall in unionisation among black workers. The proportion has fallen to only 39.2 per cent among those with a Caribbean origin, compared with 49 per cent at the end of 1991. The number of whites in unions is less at only 34.2 per cent of all workers (excluding the jobless and self-employed). Just 30.2 per cent of workers of Indian origin and 23.5 per cent of Pakistani origin are unionised. Forthcoming research based partly on the efforts of Mr Morris's union to recruit cleaners at London's Heathrow airport reveals that the predominantly Asian women workers saw the union 'as an unsympathetic white organisation'. The research also shows that the local TGWU office had an all-white staff and was located in an area mostly populated by racial minorities. The union has since made efforts to improve the situation. Dr John Wrench, at the Centre for Research in Ethnic Relations at Warwick University, said: 'Barriers of isolation, language, low pay and anti-social working hours make the task of recruiting black workers difficult for unions. 'Although unions nationally are producing improved policies and literature, translating such policies into action through local union offices is still problematic.'</p>

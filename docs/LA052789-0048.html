			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CITY TO REOPEN BIDS ON NEW PHONE SYSTEMS  </P> <P> Under pressure from the San Diego City Council, the city's data processing  corporation has agreed to reopen bidding for a lucrative contract to supply a  new city-government telecommunications system.  </P> <P> The San Diego Data Processing Corp., a nonprofit corporation given authority by  the council in 1986 to select a vendor for the $12-million to $18-million  contract, will accept "best and final" offers from the seven firms competing  for the pact and will hold oral briefings with all of them. No other companies  may enter the bidding, however.  </P> <P> The recommendation to reopen bids has convinced the San Diego Convention Center  staff to recommend that the phone contract for the convention center be bid  separately, to ensure that phone service is available when the new facility  opens in October, according to a memo to the council Friday from Robert  Metzger, executive vice president of the data processing corporation.  </P> <P> Plans call for the convention center telecommunications contract to be part of  the citywide contract. The convention center's board will review the situation  June 8.  </P> <P> The decision Thursday by the data processing corporation's board of directors  is a blow to Tel Plus Communications, chosen by data processing officials over  the six other firms based on highly detailed written bids. The data processing  corporation was prepared to begin negotiations with Tel Plus on details of  providing 6,300 phones for offices citywide and 800 more for the San Diego  Convention Center.  </P> <P> But on May 16, five council members intervened at the 11th hour, led by  Councilman Ron Roberts and Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer. They persuaded data  processing corporation officials to delay the negotiations and further explain  the process by which the bids were compared.  </P> <P> After a private review of the bid process Tuesday, a discussion that included  access to the confidential bids and supporting information submitted by all  seven companies, Roberts said he is even more convinced that oral briefings  must be held with the firms.  </P> <P> "It is very clear to me, and I think to (data processing officials) at this  point that there is a flaw in the procedures that they used," he said.  </P> <P> Roberts said that data processing committees comparing the seven bids put so  little emphasis on cost that, "if a company came in and said, 'we will do this  for you for free,' (the data processing corporation) would not have recommended  that we select them based on their criteria."  </P> <P> Metzger has said that the written bid process was designed to avoid accusations  of favoritism to any firm, a posture partly motived by the 1982 Telink scandal,  in which there were allegations that contractors provided San Diego County  administrators with cocaine, prostitutes and bribes in an attempt to influence  the award of a $24.5-million telephone contract.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fair Competition  </P> <P> Several of those accused were ultimately convicted, but 10 others had their  convictions overturned on appeal.  </P> <P> Karen Mattis, district sales manager for Tel Plus, which is owned by Siemens  Information Systems, said that Roberts' claim "certainly doesn't sound  realistic" and contended that her company won a fair competition because its  product and plans were superior.  </P> <P> "Of course I'm disappointed," Mattis said. "It's really aggravating to me that  the process was over, and now we're opening it up again, for what? Because a  couple of vendors were unhappy, because they were sore losers. What happens if  they're unhappy again after this? Will they open it up again?"  </P> <P> Mattis said that Tel Plus so far has not discussed filing a lawsuit over the  change of procedures. She said that she believes Tel Plus will be chosen again  after further review.  </P> <P> Mayor Maureen O'Connor has so far been the most biggest champion of the  existing data processing selection system. During a European vacation that  ended Sunday, O'Connor, through her chief of staff, demanded that the council  stay out of the selection process.  </P> <P> But Terry Churchill, area vice president for Pacific Bell, which placed second  in the competition and complained about how it was run, said Friday, "We  pursued it because we just didn't think the other way was fair.  </P> <P> "I think this is a good step forward. Let's see what comes out of council."  </P> <P> If approved by the council, the new procedure will cost the city an  undetermined amount of money by delaying acquisition of the phone system about  eight weeks. "Temporary arrangements" for telecommunications services to  Building Inspection department staffers preparing to move into two renovated  floors of the City Operations Building in August will be required at city  expense, said Bruce Gorton director of network support for the data processing  corporation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Blue Ribbon Committee'  </P> <P> The plan approved by the data processing corporation's board of directors  Thursday calls for creation of a "blue ribbon committee of experts in the field  of telecommunications" to listen to daylong oral presentations from each  company, and to recommend a final choice.  </P> <P> The five-member panel, to be selected by data processing staffers, would  include Gorton and four outside experts from private firms, Gorton said.  </P> <P> The committee also will examine other concerns raised by council members,  including whether the new system will be adaptable to the planned relocation of  City Hall and whether Siemens USA's European parent company violates a city  council policy by conducting business in South Africa.  </P> <P> Mattis said that Tel Plus, Siemens Information Systems and Siemens USA do not  do business in South Africa.  </P></p>

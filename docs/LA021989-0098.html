			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> OUSTED LAWNDALE OFFICIALS VOW TO CONTINUE INQUIRY ON CITY USE OF $8-MILLION  GRANT  </P> <P> Ousted from their appointed positions for questioning the handling of a federal  grant, two Lawndale civic activists vowed to redouble their investigations into  possible wrongdoing at City Hall.  </P> <P> Councilmen Larry Rudolph, Dan McKenzie and Harold E. Hofmann voted last week to  remove Recreation Commissioner Nancy Marthens and Beautification Committee  Chairman Virginia Rhodes from their advisory posts after the two wrote to the  U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, alleging that the city  mishandled an $8-million federal grant.  </P> <P> The inquiry by Marthens and Rhodes "was not in the city's best interest,"  Rudolph said in an emotional call for the removal of Marthens, whom he  appointed to the commission last year.  </P> <P> McKenzie, who appointed Rhodes, said: "I don't think they (Rhodes and Marthens)  are working for the city's interests anymore."  </P> <P> Marthens and Rhodes said they believe their vigilance is needed. Rhodes accused  city officials of "inefficiency, waste, neglect and incompetency."  </P> <P> They added to the controversy Thursday night by publicly distributing copies of  a billing statement from City Atty. David J. Aleshire's law firm, Rutan &amp;  Tucker. One of the charges listed was for "laundering of funds" in conjunction  with the federal grant.  </P> <P> Visibly upset, Aleshire said laundering was an erroneous and "unfortunate" word  used by an assistant attorney in the firm. He said the charge was for an  analysis of how city officials can determine when grant funds restricted to a  specific use become available for general purposes. He said Marthens' failure  to ask him for an explanation first was "another example of political  grandstanding as opposed to openness and honesty."  </P> <P> Marthens said she does not believe Aleshire's explanation and she plans to  submit to HUD the bill with the "laundering" entry.  </P> <P> Marthens and Rhodes said they were outraged by their removal from the city  posts and view it as an abrogation of their constitutional right to free  speech. "You are making it a crime in Lawndale to seek the truth," Marthens  told the council.  </P> <P> After the vote, Marthens and Rhodes said they will keep pressing for answers to  their questions on Lawndale's administration of the $8-million federal grant  that the city obtained in 1984.  </P> <P> Under a complex agreement, the city lent the $8 million to South Bay  Associates, a subsidiary of Forest City Enterprises, the developer of the  $70-million Galleria at South Bay. In addition to repayment of the loan with 6%  interest -- which provides the city with an income of nearly $48,000 a month --  the city eventually is to receive a share of mall proceeds once the developer  reaches a certain level of profits.  </P> <P> Marthens and Rhodes say that the city failed to meet hiring objectives for the  employment of Lawndale residents at the mall; that the city failed to seek HUD  approval for a mall refinancing approved by the council last year, and that the  city has failed to comply with a provision of the original deal that for 10  years prevents the developer from buying out the city's interest in the mall.  </P> <P> Aleshire and members of the City Council have defended the city's handling of  the grant funds and said the loan is one of the best investments the city has  ever made.  </P> <P> Mayor Sarann Kruse said the voluminous document Marthens and Rhodes submitted  to HUD is "full of lies and unfounded allegations."  </P> <P> Hundreds of Lawndale residents got jobs at the mall, Kruse and McKenzie said,  adding that they personally helped run a special job recruitment program when  the mall opened in 1985.  </P> <P> Aleshire said the city did not need HUD approval for the refinancing because it  did not increase the outstanding debt. He said that because HUD has signed off  on the project, the federal agency is no longer a party to the contract and the  10-year restriction can be waived by the remaining parties -- the city and the  developer.  </P> <P> HUD has asked the city to respond to the inquiry, but has made no comment on  the substance of the allegations. A HUD official in Washington said that the  federal agency has reviewed the city's procedures and issued a certificate of  completion on the project, which normally ends the agency's involvement.  </P> <P> Marthens' and Rhodes' inquiry comes at a sensitive juncture as the city winds  up months-long negotiations on a proposal by the developer to cash out the  city's interest in the mall.  </P> <P> Proponents say the cash could be a windfall for the city, but Rhodes and  Marthens oppose the plan because they believe the city might squander a lump  sum. In their letter to HUD, they pointed out numerous management problems that  have plagued City Hall, including the loss of $1.68 million in a speculative  securities investment in 1987.  </P> <P> In a surprise move, Kruse and Norman abstained from voting on the removal of  Marthens and Rhodes. In interviews last week they were highly critical of  Marthens and Rhodes and said they would support their removal.  </P> <P> But after Thursday's vote, they said they abstained to protest a method of  commission appointments adopted last year by the council majority, a method  they say is illegal. Formerly the mayor made all appointments with the approval  of the council. Now each council member makes an appointment to each city  panel.  </P> <P> Marthens and Rhodes did not mention that issue in interviews last week.  Political observers said that by abstaining, Kruse and Norman may have hoped to  pin responsibility for the removal of the two outspoken activists on the  council majority, with whom they are often at odds. "They're the ones  accountable," Kruse said.  </P> <P> Kruse and Norman said in an interview that their abstentions do not mean they  are backing away from earlier comments that they, like the council majority,  are displeased with Marthens and Rhodes over the HUD inquiry. They said they  view the inquiry as conflicting with the responsibilities of city  representatives.  </P> <P> "They can't play two roles at the same time," Kruse said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on  4 May on page 1 publishes a 300-word statement issued by the  Standing Conference of the Civic Institute (SKOI) in response to  the offer advanced by the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) to  "right-wing groupings and personalities with similar political  views" to participate in the forthcoming parliamentary elections  on the KDH slate of candidates. The KDH offer, and unification  of Slovak right-wing parties in general, are also the subject of  an 800-word interview with Ludovit Cernak, chairman of the  National Democratic Party (NDS)-New Alternative, by Alena  Gottweisova in Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 4 May on  page 2. The interview, the place and date of which are not  given, is published under the headline "Options of a Joint  Course of Action."    The SKOI statement welcomes the KDH offer as an opportunity  to unite "civic and Christian democratic forces in Slovakia." It  states: "We receive with satisfaction the KDH's opening toward  civic democratic forces, which we understand as a historic step  toward overcoming mutual differences and toward the actual  amalgamation of Christian democratic forces in Slovakia."  Referring to the fragmentation of the right-wing vote in the  1992 elections, the SKOI statement proclaims that "the mistakes  of the year 1992 must not be repeated" and calls on "all civic  democratic forces that want to share in the KDH's and SKOI's  common work to follow our path of unification of civic and  Christian democratic forces in Slovakia."    Cernak's reaction to the KDH offer is more reserved. The  relevant passage in the SLOVENSKY DENNIK interview reads:    [Gottweisova] ``The unification of right-wing forces is the  topic of the day. Representatives of the KDH, Democratic Party  (DS), the Democratic Union of Slovakia (DEUS), the Party of  Entrepreneurs and Tradesmen, and the NDS have agreed to  cooperate. One option foresees the formation of a single entity,  the other option is represented by KDH's offer to reserve places  for representatives of other parties on its own slate of  candidates. Which option is more promising, in your opinion?''    [Cernak] "It is premature to say which option would be  better. During the meeting of parties of the right center we  noted that all of them are interested in cooperation.  Unfortunately, some subsequent statements did not quite confirm  this readiness. The KDH has put forward its idea, I and my  party colleagues will prepare other possible alternatives. We  have to realize that we would suffer terrible defeat in the eyes  of the Slovak public if we kept meeting for two months, kept  proclaiming that we want to cooperate, and, ultimately, failed  to agree on the form of this cooperation. That would be the  worst possible alternative. Creating a single entity is  unrealistic, however, in my opinion because, in view of  differences in programs, the liberally oriented DEUS cannot  merge with the KDH. We can proceed jointly in a coalition bloc  or establish a grouping within the framework of the center and  right center. I am an advocate of joint course of action by the  widest possible current, which is why I would prefer the  formation of a coalition bloc, within the framework of which  those five entities, plus, possibly, a sixth one, would nominate  their candidates. We would be able to expect a relatively good  result in that case. The voter can, moreover, influence the  result by means of preferential votes. I would therefore  accept, for example, a procedure with a single slate of  candidates whereby, in the event of electoral success, he who  gets the largest number of preferential votes would form the  government. This option does not seem to be feasible, however,  in view of certain antagonisms existing among individual  parties." Asked about the "sixth potential partner," Cernak  says that he was thinking of the Christian Social Union (KSU),  which has reportedly abandoned the idea of cooperating with the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and "has left the door open  for talks with other political entities." Cernak concedes,  however, that the presence of the KSU in such a right-wing bloc  might deter some potential right-wing voters.</p>

			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> ZSA ZSA AVOIDS JAIL CELL FOR NOW WHILE SHE APPEALS CONVICTION  </P> <P> A Municipal Court judge today put a hold on actress Zsa Zsa Gabor's 72-hour  jail sentence and fines totaling $2,937 while she appeals her misdemeanor  cop-slapping conviction.  </P> <P> But Judge Charles G. Rubin refused to delay the 120 hours of community service,  a psychiatric evaluation and $10,000 restitution to the Police Department that  he ordered during Gabor's sentencing.  </P> <P> "I want to make it clear Miss Gabor still has to do her community service, pay  her restitution . . . ," Rubin told defense attorney Harrison Bull during a  short hearing that the flamboyant actress did not attend.  </P> <P> Gabor, 72, was originally ordered to go to jail before Dec. 29.  </P> <P> Bull said outside court that he had advised Gabor not to show up at any future  court dates unless she is needed. He said Gabor had already begun one part of  her sentence by doing community service work at a Venice women's shelter.  </P> <P> Gabor was arrested when she slapped Officer Paul Kramer on June 14 in an  altercation after he pulled her Rolls-Royce over because its registration tags  were expired.  </P> <P> A jury convicted her on Sept. 29 of misdemeanor battery on a police officer,  driving without a valid driver's license and having an open container of  alcohol in her car.  </P></p>

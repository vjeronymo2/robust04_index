			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Dutch praise for caution on rates MR Wim Duisenberg, the president of the Netherlands National Bank, last night stressed that yesterday's cuts in Bundesbank and other European interest rates did not represent any change in the cautious monetary policies of continental central banks. Addressing a group of international monetary policy makers and academics, Mr Duisenberg castigated 'Anglo-Saxon commentators' for failing to understand that sharp cuts in short-term interest rates would not boost the recession-hit member countries of the European exchange rate mechanism. Mr Duisenberg, who is also chairman of the European Community's central bank governors' committee, said attempts to force down short-term interest rates aggressively 'might very well stir up inflationary expectations again' and result in higher rather than lower long-term interest rates. Long-term rates were 'far more important for investment and growth than short-term rates' among ERM member states, he said. 'In the short run, changes in short-term interest rates in continental Europe do not have a large impact on the disposable income of consumers and enterprises.' Such effects as there were only appeared after a long time lag. Mr Duisenberg underlined that monetary stability in a European context meant more than price stability. It also meant exchange rate stability. 'This is a fact I cannot over-emphasise,' he said. 'Sometimes, the crucial notion of exchange rate stability as an essential foundation of the functioning of the single internal European market is strongly underestimated. In the very open and highly interdependent continental European economies, ex-change rate volatility is much more damaging to trade and general economic developments than in, for instance, the United States.' He applauded how ERM central banks had steered clear of competitive devaluations in the aftermath of the July and August currency crisis that resulted in the widening of most ERM fluctuation margins to 15 per cent either side of central rates. The cautious approach to short-term interest rates cuts had paid off.</p>

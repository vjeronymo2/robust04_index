A key  event was the withdrawal by 31 August 1993 of Russian troops  from Lithuanian territory, which finally eliminated the main  irritant in the relations between the Russian Federation and the  Lithuanian Republic. A new stage ensued. However, the  negotiating process did not get any easier.    Shortly after, a number of important agreements were signed  during the visit of the head of the Russian Government to  Vilnius on 18 November 1993. This event became the practical  implementation of the agreement achieved in the course of the  meeting of the presidents of Russia and Lithuania in Moscow on 4  November 1993.    The emphasis in the work of the Russian delegation shifted  to  the preparation of agreements to ensure the normal vital  activity of Kaliningrad Oblast and the problems associated with  this. But the Lithuanian side was in no hurry to activate the  dialogue at the level of official delegations. As a result,  despite our repeated appeals and proposals, the Lithuanian  partners, beginning with November of last year, stubbornly  remained silent. A long break occurred in the work of the  delegations, the end to which did not occur until 21-22 March of  this year, when our delegations met in Moscow. It is already  apparent from this how unconvincing the statements of the  Lithuanian representatives sound about readiness for  negotiations on any subject and the need to intensify the  process of the Russian-Lithuanian negotiations. On our part, we  always were for energetic work on problems on the widest  possible front. It is sufficient to refer to the fact that we  have already submitted two dozen drafts of various kinds of  agreements.    On the whole, the March round of negotiations, in our  assessment, proceeded in a sufficiently businesslike way. The  Lithuanian delegation arrived in Moscow with a new membership.  While in the past, a majority of its members consisted of  representatives of the political opposition that had an interest  in discussions of a general nature, now they have been replaced  by specialists and practical workers. Despite the differences  that remained between us as before in approaches to individual  problems, this made it possible to work on specific questions  for a great part of the time. A draft of an agreement was  initialed on entry points on the Russian-Lithuanian border. In  the end, a list of 12 draft agreements was coordinated that will  be worked on in priority order by our delegations and  corresponding working groups. On this list are drafts of  agreements on cooperation in the sphere of nuclear energy,  pension guarantees, principles of work activity of citizens of  the Russian Federation in Lithuania and Lithuanians in Russia,  and others. An agreement was reached on conducting a meeting in  April in Vilnius of experts of both sides on questions of  civilian motor vehicle and railroad transit, including  additional work on a draft temporary agreement on mutual travel  of citizens, and afterwards on a meeting of experts of the  customs services of Russia and Lithuania this month in Moscow.  We would like to count on a positive outcome of these  negotiations, keeping in mind that at the end of April and the  beginning of May our delegations could conclude work on yet  another group of drafts that regulate questions of civilian  traffic to and from Kaliningrad Oblast. But if this is not done,  then the position will prevail that results in the  dissatisfaction of both sides. There still remain for us  inconveniences and difficulties of visas, customs, and other  areas in the sphere of transit, especially motor vehicle,  through Lithuanian territory. But the Lithuanian side, in its  turn, cites our failure to put into effect an agreement signed  on trade and economic relations. At the same time, it seems to  have practically forgotten the provisions of the  Russian-Lithuanian declaration of 30 August 1993, and also the  package of agreements at a working meeting of the Russian and  Lithuanian presidents in Moscow on 4 November of the same year.  After all, at that time there was talk not only about the need  to come to an agreement in the sphere of transport and about  Russian military pensioners, but also about accelerating work to  conclude agreements about guaranteeing the normal vital activity  of Kaliningrad Oblast. But, after all, it is precisely the  latter that do not exist to this day. Russia still has not been  answered on these questions with reciprocity. Therefore, under  the situation that has developed, it would be pointless to count  on the immediate enactment of an agreement on trade and economic  relations in which Lithuania would receive most favorable  treatment in trade with Russia    It is especially necessary to talk about Russian military  transit to Kaliningrad Oblast and from it through Lithuanian  territory. For the time being, it exists on the basis of our  verbal agreements. The Lithuanian side also proceeds on the  basis of provisions of the agreement on the transit of troops  and military freight of the Russian Federation being pulled out  of the FRG(!) On the one hand, Lithuania seems not to deny the  reasonableness of the endeavors of Russia to maintain  unobstructed communications with part of its own territory,  which Kaliningrad Oblast is. On the other hand, the Lithuanian  side does not conceal its desire to come to an agreement about  the organization of Russian military transportation exactly on  the basis of a bilateral agreement (we have already turned over  our draft of such an agreement). Judging by everything, the  matter is moving now to the adoption by the Lithuanian  authorities of some kind of unilateral decisions that establish  the rules for the shipment of military and dangerous freight of  any foreign states over the territory of the Lithuanian  Republic. But about what kinds of more or less significant  foreign military shipments, other than Russian, can there be a  realistic discussion? An attempt is also being made now to  neutralize the need for a bilateral agreement on this question  in Lithuania with the help of the expression of "concern"  regarding the alleged excessive presence of military troops in  Kaliningrad Oblast--a kind of threat to the security of  Lithuania. In addition, it is true, at least official Vilnius  admits that it does not sense "any kinds of aggressive efforts  of Russia, and any kind of real threat on its part." From our  standpoint, even given the presence of some kinds of general  rules, our countries, nevertheless, should establish in a treaty  procedure the conditions for Russian servicemen and freight to  transit through Lithuanian territory.    We are also conducting negotiations on the delimitation of  borders between the Russian Federation and the Lithuanian  Republic. Although statements have been made repeatedly in  Vilnius about Lithuania's lack of any kind of territorial claims  on Russia, the position of the Lithuanian side on the  demarcation of the territorial sea, which, from our standpoint,  contradicts the UN convention of 1982 on maritime law, is  beginning to create certain difficulties in the negotiations.    Finally, I would like to touch on one more subject that is  continuously present in Russian-Lithuanian negotiations. These  are problems that directly affect the life of ethnic Russians in  the Lithuanian Republic (the Lithuanian delegation, on its part,  comes out with various kinds of claims against us). In  Lithuania, as is known, it was possible to avoid serious  complications on national questions and on questions of  citizenship. However, this does not entirely mean that there are  no difficulties at all in this sphere. They simply have another  character than, for example, in Latvia and Estonia. It must be  noted that the Lithuanian side, despite our proposals, has  already been refusing over the course of a long time to examine  the draft of an agreement on cooperation for the purposes of  ensuring the rights of ethnic, linguistic, cultural, and  religious minorities. At the same time, references are made to  pertinent legislative acts in effect in Lithuania that meet  generally acceptable international norms. From our standpoint,  the presence of any kind of national decrees does not at all  rule out the possibility of a bilateral agreement between the  Russian Federation and the Lithuanian Republic. Moreover, if our  approaches to guaranteeing the rights of minorities are really  close or coincide, this fact would only facilitate the  achievement of an agreement on this score.    In conclusion, I would like to note that on the whole we  look  with optimism to the prospects of Russian-Lithuanian  negotiations. I am convinced that, despite all of the  difficulties and problems, our countries have real opportunities  for the development of mutually beneficial good neighbor  relations. Without forgoing Russia's interests, our delegation  is ready to go halfway to meet the necessary agreements for  expanding and strengthening the treaty and legal bases of  Russian-Lithuanian relations.</p>

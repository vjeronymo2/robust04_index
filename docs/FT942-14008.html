			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / World Trade News: Technology is S Korea's price - The terms of GEC Alsthom's high-speed rail deal The gruelling eight-month negotiations by GEC Alsthom with South Korea to supply the Train a Grande Vitesse for the country's high-speed railway is evidence that foreign companies have to pay a high price for entering one of Asia's most protected markets. South Korea is demanding extensive technology transfers from foreign companies hoping to win orders in industries ranging from telecommunications to defence equipment. This reflects Korean concerns that it is falling behind in technical development because it has concentrated on increasing its production capability at the expense of industrial research. GEC Alsthom's willingness to meet Korea's technology requests and offer price and financing terms favourable to Seoul is considered the key reason it was selected for the prestigious Dollars 2.1bn (Pounds 1.4bn) high-speed rail contract. The TGV defeated the newer and more technologically advanced Inter-city Express offered by Siemens and Mitsubishi's older Shinkansen train. The agreement, concluded on Monday, will enable Korea to make the TGV on its own once it acquires full rights to the transferred technology in 2002 and sell it to other countries. GEC Alsthom had to weigh the advantages of gaining its first beachhead in the potentially lucrative Asian market against allowing its consortium of Korean subcontractors - Hyundai, Daewoo and Hanjin - to become an eventual competitive rival. 'It's how the game is played,' said Mr Philippe Jarrosson, deputy director of GEC Alsthom TGV project in Korea. GEC Alsthom at first resisted the extent of Korea's technology transfer demands, citing patent and intellectual property rights. But the Anglo-French group in the end agreed to provide design and manufacturing technology to enable the Korean subcontractors to produce key components valued at more than half the contract and provide them with the ability to upgrade the TGV system in the future. Koreans' share of production is bigger than the 45 per cent share granted to Spain for its version of the TGV. Thirty-four of the 46 TGV trains will be manufactured in Korea. The eagerness of Korean manufacturers to gain access to the technology provoked a dispute that threatened to wreck GEC Alsthom's contract negotiations with the government. GEC Alsthom's selection of Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry as head of the Korean consortium provoked a protest by Daewoo Heavy Industries, which feared that it would be denied full access to the transferred technology if it remained a junior partner. Both companies will produce the TGV engines, while Hanjin will make the carriages. Daewoo tried to stop negotiations last winter by filing a suit, claiming it had the right to be consortium leader since it was GEC Alsthom's original partner during the two-year bidding process against Siemens and Mitsubishi. Daewoo agreed to join the consortium last month after the suit was dismissed and GEC Alsthom promised it would have equal access to the technology. GEC Alsthom has also been forced to reduce substantially its bid for the TGV order from its initial offer of Dollars 3.6bn in 1991 to the agreed price of Dollars 2.1bn, which is Dollars 270m below its final bid last year. Korea was able to obtain the last-minute price cut by adopting a 'stripped-down' train interior that is less comfortable than those on the European TGV trains, according to negotiators. Mr Jarrosson denied that that was the case, but explained that cost savings were the result of Korea declining to accept 'the optimum range of features' that GEC Alsthom offered in its final bid price. The TGV is due to go into full service in 2002 and link the country's capital of Seoul with Pusan, the country's second-largest city and its biggest port.</p>

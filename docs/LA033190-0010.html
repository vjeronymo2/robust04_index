			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 2 SUPERVISORS BACK BOLAND FOR ASSEMBLY  </P> <P> Los Angeles County supervisors Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana on Friday  endorsed Republican Paula Boland in the 38th Assembly District primary race,  lauding her for her devotion to neighborhood, business and political activities  in the northern San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> Boland is running for the Republican nomination for the Assembly seat vacated  by Marian W. La Follette, who surprised political observers a month ago by  announcing that she would not seek re-election after representing the area for  10 years.  </P> <P> La Follette endorsed her aide, Robert Wilcox, in the June 5 primary.  </P> <P> Dana described Boland as "hard-working and energetic," while Antonovich called  her a "dynamic candidate."  </P></p>

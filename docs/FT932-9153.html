			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Plea to reduce debt burden NON-ALIGNED ministers yesterday ended a three-day meeting abandoning the polemics of the past and declaring war on the developing world's 'crippling crisis of indebtedness', Reuter reports from Nusa Dua. The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), seeking to end its traditional hectoring of western nations, issued a final press communique full of calls for greater self-help and a two-way partnership between rich and poor nations. Mr Ali Alatas, Indonesian foreign minister and chairman of the gathering, acknowledged the movement's past faults and offered a vision focused on improving the lot of its members. 'We have indeed learned the precious lessons of our past experiences in economic and social fields. Accordingly we have reassessed and determined our strategy in a vastly changed international situation. . . in order to solve the global economic problems of our time,' he said. Ministers from Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe, ending their gathering on the island resort of Bali, presented an agenda based on modest but specific measures. Delegates said attempts by Pakistan, North Korea and Palestine to insert their own unilateral issues into a final document were swept aside. Instead the meeting, attended by 74 countries, discussed ways of starting a dialogue with the rich North and of promoting ties among its own members. Ministers backed an initiative by current NAM chairman Indonesia to have President Suharto address a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries in Tokyo in July on behalf of the movement. The G7 has so far been lukewarm about the proposal. The communique called for at least three panels of experts to be set up to collate data on debt, development and food but stopped short of recommending an economic summit as suggested by some delegates. Of particular concern are the massive debts - which last year touched Dollars 1,400bn - hanging over members. Ministers also called for a boosting of growth in the South, which would in turn foster a net transfer of financial resources to debtor countries to prevent poorer nations falling back into a vicious cycle of debt.</p>

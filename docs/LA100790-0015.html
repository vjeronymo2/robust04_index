			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIXED MEDIA: ** 1/2 "ISLE OF NOISE" BY MARK J. PRENDERGAST; ST. MARTIN'S PRESS  ($15.95);  </P> <P> ITEMS IN THIS PERIODIC SURVEY OF POP-RELATED BOOKS, VIDEOCASSETTES AND LASER  DISCS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> More than you need to know about blues-rocker Rory Gallagher and less than  you'd like to know about Sinead O'Connor: Though updated from the 1987 "Irish  Rock" for American publication, this detailed guide seems out of date and  parochial considering the worldwide impact of O'Connor, who only gets a brief  mention, though her picture is on the cover. What's more, a deserved  dissertation on Van Morrison suffers from Prendergast's labored critical  analyses. Still, sections on the early beat groups and Irish folk-rock are  fascinating accounts of pop musical evolution outside the more familiar  Britain/U.S. breeding grounds, while the "Modern Music" chapter does a good job  showing the cultural/musical context that launched U2.

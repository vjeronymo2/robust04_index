			<p>BFN     [Text] Tension suddenly rose at the Libreville University  campus this morning with cases of violence reported. The  rector's office was completely ransacked and computer equipment  destroyed. The rector was molested while an Africa No. 1  correpondent and a lecturer were severely beaten up with the  lecturer presently in hospital. These unimaginable acts took  the place of a referendum scheduled on the campus for students  to decide whether or not they agree to resume lectures, which  they have boycotted since 26 May.    Meanwhile, students of Omar Bongo University, Libreville,  have embarked on a strike to back up a demand for a 19-percent  increase in their stipends to cushion the effects of the  devaluation of the CFA franc, which will bring their monthly  stipend from 63,000 to 75,000 CFA francs. The Government of  Gabon, which is currently engaged in negotiations with the IMF  and the World Bank for the redress of the economy, says it  cannot go beyond the 14 billion CFA francs allocated for  stipends. It says the best it can do is to raise the stipends  from 63,000 to 66,000 francs, and to reduce rents on campus by  2,000 francs. Students find these measures ridiculous.    Apparently, following this morning's violence on the campus,  chances for the continuation of negotiations between the rector  and students have practically evaporated, and it quite likely  that the university will be closed down before the end of the  academic year.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (10): A resource for small companies - Virtual Office in Devon JANE YATES, manager of Deer Park Telecentre, is no newcomer to teleworking. She deals with the membership of the National Association of Teleworkers, a register of resources for teleworkers who want to find work on the open market, which uses the Telecentre as its headquarters. Now she also runs the Deer Park Telecentre, which she describes as 'a virtual office,' officially opened on April 27 this year. It grew from an existing service to business people staying at the Deer Park Hotel at Weston, near Honiton in Devon, and is so far not a member of the Telecottage Association. 'We see ourselves as a temporary office, a resource for small businesses who don't want to tie up capital in equipment,' she explains.

Digital Equipment (DEC) has played a large part in establishing the centre, particularly in providing training, while the Worshipful Company of Information Technologists has also been a valuable source of support and guidance. There is a dedicated host modem linked to Digital's own offices for the use of visiting employees and other visitors, which gives the Centre another role - that of demonstration centre for live teleworking. As well as providing back-up and support for the courses and conferences at the hotel, (mostly for directors and senior executives), Deer Park provides a secretarial service which embraces everything from general typing to a personalised answering service, mail shots and creating transparencies and acetates for presentations. There are also two private rooms for hire, described as 'telephone kiosks of the 21st century.' These provide business users with a private room on a flexible hire basis, with use of fax, phone, PC, modem and printer. 'There are lots of skills the south-east, but they need to be co-ordinated,' concludes Jane Yates. 'Quality control has to be carried out to a high standard.'</p>

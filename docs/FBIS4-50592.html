			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 18 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai now claims 76  enterprises launched by Chinese students returned from overseas,  who have been encouraged by preferential policies endorsed by  the local government.    So far, over 1,000 people back from abroad have lined up for  official approval to set up their own companies.    These firms, featuring high technology, are involved in the  fields of information, advertising, consultancy and tourism.  Three-quarters of these returned students have masters' degrees  or doctorates obtained abroad.    Doctor Ni Xuanzhong, who has initiated a company of  "intelligent machines", is trying to develop an innovatory  scanner for Chinese characters, which can read 400 characters  per second.    Another new product developed by the company is capable of  linking six pairs of telephone users using just one line,  relieving the shortage of lines in the region.    Doctor Jiang Qinguo, licensed lawyer who studied in New  York,  has established a consultancy firm to offer advice and act as  agent to Chinese and foreign businessmen, at home and abroad.    Luo Yan, nationally-renowned actress who has just finished  eight years of studying in the United States, has invested  100,000 U.S. dollars to set up an entertainment firm, prompting  program exchanges with television and broadcasting stations in  foreign countries.    The city has set aside special areas in some development  zones, wishing that more and more overseas students will bring  in investment and their knowledge and skills.</p>

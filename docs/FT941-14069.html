			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Markets Report: German moves confuse A series of unexpected and oddly timed announcements from the Bundesbank left the foreign exchange markets bemused and somewhat wrong-footed on a day described by one analyst as remarkable, writes Emma Tucker. An early announcement from the German central bank that it had decided to leave its official discount and Lombard rates unchanged was widely expected and made little impact on the D-Mark. However, the Bundesbank did not make any comment on the repo rate, prompting speculation that next week it would ease monetary conditions either via a lower fixed repo rate or by reintroducing a variable rate. Euromark futures traded up on the news, but dropped when half-an-hour later the Bundesbank - in what looked like an afterthought - announced it would set the next two securities repo tenders at a fixed 6 per cent. Further confusing matters, the Bundesbank declared in the afternoon that it intended to reduce and restructure its minimum reserve requirements in a move to improve the competitiveness of Germany's banks. The Bundesbank said it was scrapping the progressive rate on minimum reserve requirements on sight deposits and introducing a flat rate of 5 per cent, effective March 1. Previously, minimum reserve requirements of between 6.6 per cent and 12.1 per cent had been imposed according to the volume on deposit. It added that any rise in liquidity that resulted from the change in reserve requirements would be dealt with through its money market operations. Economists said the move was also designed to reduce credit costs in the economy without putting the D-Mark under any undue pressure. Sure enough, the net effect of the Bundesbank's various moves was to boost the D-Mark against the dollar. 'The fact that the reserves changes could be good for German banks, and potentially good for the economy, and the fact that the repo rate was held at 6 per cent, means that the result of the day's moves was beneficial for the D-Mark,' said Mr Jeremy Hawkins of Bank of America. The dollar shot up  1/2 pfennig against the D-Mark, after the announced changes to the reserve requirements, but dropped back once the Bundesbank made it clear that it would mop up extra liquidity resulting from the move, through its regular money market operations. The dollar closed at DM1.7358, down from the previous day's DM1.744, as strong housing starts data failed to deliver a decisive boost to the currency. In New York it ended at DM1.7376. The Bank of England sent a clear signal to the UK money markets yesterday that it was unhappy with recent speculation of a cut in interest rates. It attempted to quash further speculation, by not offering an early round of assistance in spite of a relatively large shortage of Pounds 1.2bn. As a result of this unexpected behaviour - the market virtually takes for granted an early round when the shortage is higher than Pounds 1bn - the overnight rate shot up to 5 1/2 per cent, from 4 3/8 per cent at 9.15am. The overnight rate ended at 6 per cent, reflecting a lack of liquidity in a very thin market. But the three-month interbank rate - a rough indication of where the markets believe base lending rates will be in the spring - remained steady. Having opened at 5 9/32 per cent, it moved up  1/16 percentage point to end at 5 11/32 per cent. 'It is a slap on the wrist,' commented one dealer. 'The Bank is saying do not be stupid boys. Rates are where we set them, not where you want them, and they are staying where they are at the moment.' Another said: 'My guess is the Bank does not like where three-month money is at the moment, they think it is too low.' The March short sterling contract traded in a wide range, reflecting the Bank's operations. From an opening of 94.82 it dropped as low as 94.72 before closing at 94.75. In early trading the pound was buoyant, following a radio interview in the morning during which Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, sought to calm expectations for another interest rate cut. 'What you have to do is set yourself a clear idea of when you change interest rates and stick to it, not be influenced by what the papers say in the morning,' said Mr Clarke. He added that in the medium term the government needed to keep inflation down, because for the businesses now enjoying the recovery, 'most of them know that inflation could be a serious check to that recovery'. The pound did not sustain its lift, however, mainly because of D-Mark gains, and closed just slightly up at DM2.6029 from Wednesday's DM2.6016. Against the dollar it ended at Dollars 1.4996, up from Dollars 1.4918. The Swedish crown was weaker after a  1/4 point cut in Sweden's marginal interest rate to 7.5 per cent. Analysts said the cut confirmed the central bank's cautious approach to monetary policy and its desire to see a sustained strengthening of the crown. Turkey's central bank hoisted interest rates sharply to halt a run on the lira, but banks remained reluctant to lend more to the Treasury. The lira ended at 17,000 to the dollar on the interbank market after slumping 12.1 per cent on Wednesday to 18,500, after the central bank raised weekly interest rates to 135 per cent from 105 per cent.  ------------------------------------------------                POUND IN NEW YORK  ------------------------------------------------ Jan 20          Close        Prev. close  ------------------------------------------------ Pounds spot    1.4968            1.4930 1 mth          1.4936            1.4900 3 mth          1.4885            1.4853 1 yr           1.4749            1.4724  ------------------------------------------------</p>

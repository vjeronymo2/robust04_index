			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / WH Smith profits rise 44% to Pounds 50m A SHARP decline in interest charges helped WH Smith, the book and music retailer, lift pre-tax profits by 44 per cent from Pounds 34.9m to Pounds 50.1m in the half year ended November 30. The improvement came in spite of weakness in the music market and a substantial decline in the contribution from Do It All, the group's do-it-yourself joint venture with Boots the chemists, which suffered from intense price competition. Interest charged fell to Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 15.6m) as borrowings were brought down with the help of a rights issue and the disposal of the TV and travel interests. The charge was likely to be higher in the second half because of acquisitions the group expected to make, mainly in the US. On higher earnings of 13.7p (11.1p) the interim dividend is being raised to 4.3p (4p). Turnover was up to Pounds 1bn (Pounds 936m), with an 11 per cent increase in retailing sales offsetting a 9 per cent fall in the DIY operations. However, retailing did not fare as well in terms of trading profits which fell 4.5 per cent to Pounds 37.5m (Pounds 39.3m) mainly because of the slump in the recorded music business. Sir Malcolm Field, group managing director, blamed the relatively new CD market, the recession affecting young consumers and a perception among consumers that CD prices were too high. The Do It All joint venture with Boots suffered from difficulties in integrating the products and systems of the constituent businesses, as well as strong price cutting by competitors. Sales dropped to Pounds 97.9m (Pounds 107.9m) and WH Smith's share of profits fell to Pounds 100,000 (Pounds 3.1m). 'The sector has been severely depressed and there has been no improvement in the housing market,' Sir Malcolm said. Efforts had been made to improve the product range and Do It All expected to be number two in the market. WH Smith's distribution business, including news and magazine wholesaling and office supplies business, increased sales and trading profits. In the US, which contributed about 5 per cent of turnover at Pounds 59m (Pounds 39.5m), trading profits rose 27 per cent to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 1.5m). The group had acquired long-term leases of 27 shops in Hyatt Hotels for Pounds 17.5m. Lex, Page 20</p>

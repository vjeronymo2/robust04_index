			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Letter: Senior loans Sir, So Barclays has now instituted a new procedure for approving big corporate loans ('Barclays' new loan procedures' March 22). Under this new procedure there will always be one senior executive who takes personal responsibility for the loan. For the benefit of those who, perhaps, like myself are not too sure about the way the old procedure worked, how many executives used to be responsible for such loans; none or more than one? John Renaudon, The Firs, Madeley Heath, Crewe, Cheshire CW3 9LQ</p>

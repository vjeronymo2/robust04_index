			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Bombay brokers in tax probe protest A STOCKBROKERS' strike yesterday halted trading on the Bombay Stock Exchange, India's largest equity market, following repeated failures to settle a dispute arising from last year's Rs42bn (Pounds 875m) securities market scandal. Brokers meet today to decide whether to continue their action which has disrupted stock market dealings throughout India and undermines efforts to build confidence in the capital markets. The dispute started last month when income tax inspectors investigating the affairs of Mr Harshad Mehta, the broker at the centre of the scandal, froze dealings in specified blocks of stock in nine leading companies. The inspectors' action has upset trading because brokers and investors alike have become reluctant to deal in shares of the nine companies for fear of handling tainted stock and unwittingly being drawn into the tax probe. Under the BSE's trading rules, a broker buying stock only receives the share certificates in the final stages of a transaction, after money has changed hands. So he cannot check whether he is receiving tainted stock until it is too late. The affected shares include scrip issued by Reliance Industries, the large chemicals and textiles combine, and ACC, a major cement producer. Stock exchange officials lobbied the tax inspectorate to relax the freezing order but the inspectors have declined, saying it might hamper their investigations. An attempt to have the matter resolved in the courts failed when the special court established to try scandal-related cases this week refused to arbitrate and referred the matter to the government. Finance ministry officials were yesterday seeking ways of resolving the issue. The Securities and Exchange Board of India said a solution would be found in seven days. Officials of the board, the income tax department, the finance ministry and the stock exchange are to meet tomorrow.</p>

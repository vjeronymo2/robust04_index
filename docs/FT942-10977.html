			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / The Traffickers:  After experiencing the wierdness and confusion of Bolivia's drug culture, Nicholas Woodsworth joins a patrol on the trail of  .. US President Bill Clinton came to power on the promise that he would re-stitch America's badly-worn social fabric. Health, education, racial tension, the under-class - just about any subject to do with the declining quality of life in America draws fire. But none so excites the ire of the average citizen as that of law and order and a problem that lies at the heart of American street violence - drugs. Since 1988, the US government has annually spent more than Dollars 10bn on drug enforcement programmes. It sounds a lot, but it has done little to stem America's appetite for snorting, injecting, smoking or ingesting illegal substances imported from the four corners of the world. Today, America's 11m users spend five times as much on drug consumption as the government spends trying to stop them getting hold of drugs in the first place. Bill Clinton has recognised that the real solution to the problem lies in Americans themselves - more effort is now being put into rehabilitation, education and community programmes aimed at reducing drug demand domestically. But at the same time, his administration has adopted new tactics in its war against the global drug trade. Of the record Dollars 13bn requested for the President's 1995 National Drug Control Strategy, 60 per cent is earmarked for 'supply reduction programs' - instead of going after drugs and dealers upon arrival in the US, the emphasis is now on suppressing the drugs trade at source.                          *      *      * I had just left the Bolivian mountain capital of La Paz, where I had seen something of the drug-trafficking life. I had had enough drug weirdness, enough confusion, intrigue, paranoia, enough Bad Guy behavior. Here, in the Chapare district of lowland Bolivia, I hoped things would be more straightforward. I was going to go patrolling with Umopar, a para-military jungle unit trained and equipped by the DEA, the US Drug Enforcement Agency, to eliminate the Bolivian drug trade. But nothing in Bolivia is as simple as it seems. Matters in Chapare seen from the side of law and order turned out to be no less odd than seen in La Paz from the point of view of the drug villains. In fact things have gone so far awry in Bolivia that in popular opinion, roles have become bizarrely reversed: the 35,000 Indian families who cultivate coca in Chapare are innocent and downtrodden victims, while Umopar and their foreign mentors, the DEA, are evil bullies bent on social fragmentation. From a desk in Washington, neat and innocuous-sounding policy initiatives like 'supply reduction' may sound rational and entirely justifiable. When issues have become as confused on the ground as this one, however, policy execution is an entirely different matter. As a result of a forceful new coca eradication campaign, Chapare erupted in bloody violence the day after I arrived. Sitting in the office of Commandante Luis Caballero, head of the Mobile Rural Patrol Unit - or Umopar, as its Spanish acronym has it - I could see why the Commandante was loath at present to let me accompany one of his groups. Things were not going well. Outside in the Umopar compound sat armoured cars with smashed windscreens and burned-out military transport trucks dragged back from the day's action. On one side of a quadrangle of barracks were piles of primary cocaine processing material - sacks of lime, jerry cans of kerosene, bottles of sulphuric acid. On the other, a large squad of soldiers was being issued with riot gear - helmets, batons, shields and tear gas cannisters. Flying low over the palm trees and jungle surrounding the base, helicopters shuttled back and forth with men and material. All over Chapare roads were blocked, goverment buildings were being destroyed, and spear-wielding, dynamite-throwing peasants were clashing with Umopar troops. The Commandante, though, was putting a positive face on it. A well-built, thick-set man with a heavy moustache, he wore a black T-shirt and a pistol at his belt. Emblazoned on his chest was the Umopar logo - a crossed dagger and M-16 rifle, and the legend Leopardos. 'The new campaign is achieving results,' he asserted. 'In one month the Leopards have destroyed 255 pozas - the coca leaf maceration pits in which the cocaine refining process begins. Also 246 kilos of cocaine paste, and 755 litres of agua rica - liquid cocaine concentrate. It is the biggest operation we have ever mounted.' But, the Commandante assured me, now was no time to go out looking for pozas  -the cocaleros, or coca leaf growers and processors, were on the war path. To convince me, he led me across the heat-baked quadrangle to a room full of objects seized from Chapare's 'ant army' - the hundreds of men, women and children who surrepticiously carry cocaine out along trails and forest tracks. There were narco-shoes with hollowed out-heels, narco-bibles with no text between Genesis and Exodus, even stuffed and sewn-up narco-chickens. But the Commandante wanted to show me a bomb, a five-gallon cooking-oil tin filled with glass, stones and explosives, attached to 100 yards of wire with a car battery at the other end. 'It is primitive but effective,' he said. The traffickers like to surprise us on jungle paths. They are well organised, have better arms and better communications than we. Worst of all, we do not know who they are - often the little children sitting by the roadside are not as innocent as they look  -they are narco-lookouts.' Narco-politicians in La Paz, narco-children in Chapare . . . was there nothing in this part of the world to which that prefix could not be attached? The Commandante persuaded me to wait until things calmed down and I went off to find out about Chapare's narco-economy with Jenny Ortiz of the United Nations Drug Control Programme.                          *      *      * The UNDCP is the United Nations' biggest undertaking in Bolivia; it is devoted not to drug enforcement and eradication, but to alternative development - to creating economic opportunities other than coca cultivation for the Indian families of Chapare. In the last few years all sorts of occupational schemes, as well as road, electricity and water supply networks, have been initiated by the UN. Banana, citrus, tea, cassava, aromatic plant and dairy projects have all been established. None have provided a real solution. The simple fact remains that with four coca harvests a year bringing in between Dollars 1,200 and Dollars 1,500 a hectare, there is no peasant activity in Chapare as profitable as coca cultivation. In spite of all eradication efforts, last year saw a net increase in coca cultivation. I had lunch with Jenny Ortiz at DoMa Gaetana's restaurant, a palm-frond shack on the edge of the village of Chimore, headquarters for both Umopar and the UN. DoMa Gaetana is an enormous Indian woman with long black braids, gold-filigree teeth, and a liking for birds and flowers; two brilliant green parrots sat in the orange trees beside the shack and watched us as we ate. None of this exotic colour, though, did much to hide the surrounding poverty. Chapare is the poorest region in the poorest country in Latin America. Jenny no more believes in the benefits of cocaine than does Bill Clinton, but after years spent working in Chapare she understands the peasant point of view. 'You don't pose moral questions on an empty stomach,' she said. 'There are few genuine markets for most of the products we are trying to persuade the peasants to grow. In Ibirgasama, where Umopar helicopters fired machine guns over the heads of 40,000 demonstrating peasants yesterday, Scandinavian Pentecostals built a 50,000 litre-a-day dairy - all we have to do now is persuade Bolivians to keep cows and develop a taste for milk. We are trying to offer a better life to peasants, but survival now means much more to them than development over five years. The problem remains the high price offered for coca.' Down the road, 200 yards from DoMa Gaetana's, the focus of activity in the centre of Chimore is the tin-covered coca market. Here coca leaves, piled in great mounds or packed in 100 pound bags, are bought and sold daily under the noses of passing Umopar patrols. Everywhere you drive in Chapare you find vast stretches of roadside coca fields and harvested leaves being dried outside village houses. There is not the slightest attempt at concealment. If poverty gives impetus to the cocaine trade, so does the coca leaf's confusing legal status. Coca has been chewed as a stimulant by Andean Indians for thousands of years. Its use in Spanish colonial times was encouraged in order to exact the maximum work possible in fields and mines. Its use more recently has been vigorously defended by powerful domestic interests seeking profit or political support. Most Bolivians regard coca as a valued part of their cultural heritage; some still speak of the 'sacred leaf'. Today coca is both legal and illegal. In 1988 the Bolivian government, under international pressure, passed a law setting aside 12,000 hectares of coca for legal use - chewing, tea, and pharmaceutical production. All other hectarage was defined as 'excedentary', and subject to phased, voluntary eradication in return for cash payment. Any new, post-1988 cultivation was declared illegal. Such a system, of course, is wide open to spectacular abuse. Today, virtually all of Chapare's 28,000 hectares of coca go towards the making of cocaine. I left with an Umopar patrol at dawn three days later. I liked the 10 soldiers who made up the unit - they were uncomplicated boys from the countryside. But I found pencil-moustached Teniente Avila, the officer in charge of the patrol, an ominous character; anyone who wears black leather gloves in the humidity of tropical jungle is, as far as I am concerned, creepy. Leaving behind a squad of muscle-bulging, crew-cut blond Americans doing calesthenics in front of the esquela anti-narcotico, the DEA training school, we drove off into the bush. Normally I would have been fascinated with the discoveries that come with a tramp through the Amazon basin - thick rain forests, groves of giant bamboo, strange flowers, spiders' webs glinting with dew, blue butterflies as big as your hand. I was more concerned, though, with what lay at the end of the narrow and difficult paths we were following. On some of them I could barely the see indications of human passage - the newly broken branch, the muddy footprint  -that might or might not indicate the presence of a poza hidden deep in the forest. But these men were taking no chances. They studied the ground with great attention, walked with automatic weapons at the ready, and communicated silently with hand signals. Three times that morning we moved in cautiously on clearings where through jungle growth they had spotted the wooden stakes, the plastic sheeting, the discarded jerry cans and acid bottles that give away a maceration pit. Each time, though, we found the pozas abandoned and the cocaine processors moved on. The entire area, in fact, seemed abandoned that day. The patrol moved through hamlet after jungle hamlet, each as dirt-poor as any you might find in Africa, rifling through huts and looking for locals who might be paid or pressured to provide information. Whole villages were empty. Teniente Avila's eyes glinted with anticipation when once we came across a Baptist with a suitcase full of heavy books. But they were only books. Waste-deep swamps, clouds of mosquitoes, brain-deadening heat - by noon the thrill of the jungle had began to wane. By late afternoon we were discouraged and worn out. Had Umopar's anti-narcotics campaign scared the cocaleros away from the region? Not at all. We ran into them on the drive back. Organised by Chapare's powerful and militant coca-grower's federations, they were gathered by the thousands at demonstrations along the highway. I was pushed down to the floor of the truck so my white gringo face - easily mistaken for a hated DEA face - could not be seen. With machetes banging angrily against the side of the truck, we passed through a sea of jeering peasants.                          *      *      * Has Umopar's anti-narcotics campaign succeeded at all? Like many observers Peter Shaw, my former drug-dealing acquaintance in La Paz, says that until poverty disappears, the trade is likely to continue - there is just too much pressure and too much corruption to wipe it out otherwise. Shaw laughed when I mentioned finding individual pozas; the big refining labs where the final refining process takes place, he said, are heavily protected by pay-offs to government officials; so are the transportation routes out of the country. Worse, the trade is spreading eastwards into Brazil where a new cocaine theatre, as yet wholly uncontrolled, is rapidly opening up. A Dollars 13bn annual budget notwithstanding, America's drug war is likely to continue for some time.</p>

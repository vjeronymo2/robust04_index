			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Accountancy Column: Man with a mission prepares to take on the world - Challenges facing the new chairman of the International Accounting Standards Committee MR EIICHI SHIRATORI, the new chairman of the International Accounting Standards Committee, is a man with an ambitious mission. By the end of his term in June 1995, he wants to see his organisation's standards accepted in most of the world's leading equity markets. 'That is my hope,' he says in a tone which is simultaneously respectful and assertive. 'It is also my expectation. I am more than 90 per cent certain that it can be achieved.' Shiratori, who became chairman at the start of the year, flew back to his native Japan on Monday after a week in London at headquarters discussing agendas and addressing some 15 issues to be tackled in the coming months. He will need all of his skills of persuasion for the task ahead, and may well be glad that he has retired from his partnership with Arthur Andersen and can concentrate on his new responsibilities. After years of toil unnoticed except by a small group of dedicated, jet-setting accountancy luminaries since its creation in 1973, the International Accounting Standards Committee (Iasc) has recently begun to come into its own. In the late 1980s, the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco) gave Iasc a new lease of life by suggesting in principle that it might accept international accounting standards as an alternative to national standards. Theoretically, that could lead to companies that use its standards being able to seek a listing on foreign equity markets without the additional expense and legal difficulties of presentation in that country's format. Late last year, the process came one step nearer at its annual conference in London. Iosco agreed to accept the now near-complete canon of international auditing standards produced by the International Auditing Practices Committee of the International Federation of Accountants. Shiratori hopes that Iosco will follow suit by accepting Iasc standards on the same basis at its next annual meeting this autumn. If not, he is determined to win acceptance by the time of its 1994 meeting which - appropriately enough - will be in Tokyo. Much of the Iasc's efforts up till then will be in completing its so-called comparability and improvements project. This was designed to reduce the number of alternative accounting treatments that it permitted in order to gain approval from its members. The most immediate question is what compromises Iasc may be forced to make in order to gain Iosco's approval. More fundamental is whether the magic endorsement will hold sufficient reward in comparison to the energy being invested in the process. To its critics, the International Accounting Standards Committee still seems irrelevant. While a small group of technical accountants works away busily in the background, few others - least of all the national equity markets - pay much heed. There may be a case that the drafters are moving far too much ahead of the demand for international standards. Certainly it has so far proved impossible for the committee to fill its three vacant, part-time board seats with any representatives from business. Equally, the number of companies using Iasc standards appears to be small. The organisation's latest survey last summer showed just 94 companies had cited the standards in their published financial statements - although these included some notable names such as Nestle and Fujitsu. But Mr Ray Hinton, technical partner with Arthur Andersen, dismisses the figures: 'There is by no means a flood, but the most important thing is not whether companies say they are complying but whether they are. 'Even more important is whether international accounting standards are permeating into the standards of individual countries,' he says. 'National standards-setters won't necessarily confess to it, but the Iasc has an influence by osmosis. They are loath to go in the other direction.' He cites the example of related-party transactions, issued by the Iasc in 1984 and now finding a place in many countries' standards. In the UK, he argues that the Accounting Standard Board's statement of principles has drawn heavily on the Iasc's conceptual framework. Some countries have adopted the Iasc standards virtually unchanged, such as Singapore, Malaysia and a number in Africa. Several Stock Exchanges, including London and Hong Kong, already accept international standards as alternatives to their own national ones for listing. Now one of the key missing players has also begun to thaw. The US, previously hostile to the Iasc, has started to take notice, driven in part by concern over companies seeking listings in other countries rather than meeting its own tough requirements. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has begun to conduct more open dialogue. Even the Securities and Exchange Commission has become more active. Late last year, Mr Walter Scheutze, its chief accountant, began talking about the need for an 'accounting Esperanto' to broach the differences in accounts in countries across the world. But these gestures have come at a high price. The International Accounting Standards Committee, already very much driven by Anglo-Saxon accounting principles, has been forced to bend even more towards the US approach apparently in order to gain acceptance. One clear instance which caused the stomachs of many observers to sink was Iasc's decision to permit last-in-first-out (Lifo) for the valuation of inventories in its revised standard IAS 2. Among the key proponents was the US. Mr Allister Wilson, a technical partner with Ernst &amp; Young, argues that there is an irreconcilable tension between Iasc's role in setting minimum standards for national adoption and standards allowing multi-nationals to seek foreign listings. He also questions how meaningful harmonisation of accounting standards can ever be whilst national practices are a function of very different cultural and political regimes, with widely divergent tax systems and other factors which make cross-border comparisons fraught with ambiguity. Meanwhile, there is no guarantee that even if Iosco does accept international accounting standards, it can persuade its member countries' regulators and exchanges to accept them. It will prove a difficult battle in the US. It will be tougher still in Germany and in Mr Shiratori's own country, Japan.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "According to Mr. Leotard's </F> Entourage, France Requested Military Assistance From Washington"]    [Text] A source close to Mr. Leotard revealed on Wednesday,  5 January, that France has called on the United States to  provide assistance for two military operations in Bosnia aimed  at relieving the Muslim enclaves besieged by Serbs. The same  source stated that Paris expects Washington to provide military  air support and logistics assistance to reopen the Tuzla  airfield in northern Bosnia and to make it possible for a Danish  UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces] armored column to  relieve a Canadian unit in Srebrenica in the east.    Questioned on those statements, diplomats from the Quai  d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] could not explain what France exactly  sought from the United States. They said that Paris would urge  the United States, at next week's NATO summit, to respect the  commitments it made.    According to them, this refers to the military air support  that NATO pledged to provide the blue helmets with last August  if they needed it. But the diplomats stated that the UNPROFOR  has never requested any such assistance, except for  reconnaissance missions.  <H5>  Mr. Mitterrand: "Unacceptable" </H5>   Meanwhile, while receiving the New Year wishes of the  diplomatic corps, President Mitterrand warned against the  possibility of an "even more dramatic situation" in former  Yugoslavia. He outlined the dilemma that faces the countries  involved in the UNPROFOR. "Should we continue to let people kill  each other to the last man? Should we stay and be the target  that takes the blows of those who like death, as was said during  the Spanish [Civil] War?" he asked. "In both cases, the  situation is unacceptable. We thus must ensure that the  development (...) of this deadlocked situation does not give  rise to an even more dramatic situation."</p>

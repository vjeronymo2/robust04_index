			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (10): Latin America starts to turn on the lights again - End of debt crisis offers hope By any measure, Latin America's need for new power generating capacity is huge. The World Bank expectsdemand of Dollars 24bn a year for power projects in the region in coming years. There is no doubting the need: the debt crisis brought new spending on power projects almost to a halt across the region. The big electricity deficit that developed has led to widespread power cuts in many countries. In some, such as Colombia and Honduras, it has had a palpable effect in slowing economic growth in recent years. The debt crisis brought about another development: budget stringency led many governments to shed responsibilities, to privatise and to encourage privately-financed projects in areas previously in the government domain. Yet handing over more responsibility to the private sector has raised questions about how growth in generating capacity will be financed, particularly since the big project financiers for governments - the World Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank - are unable, or have limited ability, to lend direct to the private sector. The reaccommodation of Latin America in the world's financial markets has helped to ease the way, although many international banks remain inhibited from lending for a variety of reasons. Only Chile - the pioneer in developing private electricity generating capacity in Latin America - has developed its local capital markets sufficiently not to depend on foreign finance. Bankers agree that the necessary, if not sufficient, condition for private finance is the establishment of a regulatory regime that lenders feel they will be able to trust over a long period of time. The pricing of electricity is of huge political significance and governments are often tempted to keep prices down to preserve their popularity. A study by the Latin American Energy Organisation (OLADE) showed that in 1990 only five Latin American governments were charging prices at or above long-term marginal cost. 'This is changing quite rapidly,' said Mr Vijay Chaudhry, head of the power division of the International Finance Corporation's infrastructure department. Now more and more governments are introducing realistic pricing policies that send the right signals to investors. Not everywhere, however. In Brazil, where government ministers have spoken about bringing in private generating capacity, the local price of electricity is under 5 US cents per kilowatt/hour. 'You can't build world scale generating capacity at that price and and make money,' said Mr J. Scott Swensen, senior portfolio manager at Scudder Latin American Trust for Independent Power. This trust, which has investment of Dollars 100m, was launched with the idea of generating some Dollars 500m from institutional investors. In Mexico, where the government has ostensibly allowed independently-financed power generation, the state electricity company has made life difficult for would-be private-sector investors. Mr Swensen says many investors are comfortable with Mexico and there is a big scope for large-scale investment in power generation there. There have been some recent signs of progress on the long-delayed 700MW Samalayuca II plant near the US border in the state of Chihuahua, south of El Paso, Texas. This envisaged a 20-year build, lease and transfer agreement, with plant to be owned by a consortium led by GE. Mr George Aguilera, general manager of GE Power Systems,Mexico, told a conference in January that he expected Mexico to add 18 gigawatts to its generating capacity over the next decade, with steam turbines accounting for nearly 55 per cent of orders. New generation orders in Brazil were expected to reach 22GW Argentina 11GW, Colombia 4.5GW and Venezuela nearly 10GW. He predicted that gas turbines would account for 45 per cent of the generation mix, with steam turbines steady at a little over 25 per cent and hydro installations a little under 30 per cent. Some, of these figures might seem too high. When generating capacity already under construction comes on stream in Argentina, for example, some observers think the country may even have an electricity surplus. Private refurbishing of existing plant has already generated important gains in capacity. With heavy rains helping hydro-electricity generation this year, prices fell to 4 US cents per kilowatt-hour. But it is not only in the large economies that private generating capacity is coming on stream. Two companies, Amoco and Southern Electric International, have just won a bid in Trinidad &amp; Tobago to expand generation to the installed 1,100MW capacity. And even in countries where the overall pricing regime is not particularly investor-friendly, a growing number of stand-alone private projects aimed at generating electricity for a group of users is emerging. This seems particularly workable where the potential users have a foreign exchange generating capacity - it has been used in the Dominican Republic to provide power for a group of hotels. Overall, manufacturers of power generation equipment are enthusiastic about the prospects. Mr Aguilera of GE commented: 'Latin America and the Caribbean, when combined with the US and Canadian markets, make a potential trading bloc that could surpass the European common market, and more than hold its own against the emerging mega-market of Asia.'</p>

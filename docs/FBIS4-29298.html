			<p>BFN     [Text] Melbourne, June 16 (OANA/ANTARA/REUTERS) -  Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas is in good condition  after heart bypass surgery in Australia and could leave hospital  next week, an Indonesian Consulate official said on Thursday.    "He's fine. Good condition. Stable. Next Monday or  Tuesday, he could leave the hospital," Indonesia's Melbourne  Vice Consul Bambang Tarsanto told REUTERS.    Alatas, 61, was admitted to the private Epworth Hospital in  Melbourne on Sunday and underwent a three-hour quadruple bypass  operation on Monday after suffering a heart attack last month.    Bambang said the foreign minister's departure from hospital  and return to Indonesia would depend on advice from his surgeon,  Professor Brian Buxton, the hospital's head of cardiac surgery.    But he said he had no idea when Alatas would return to work.    Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating visited Alatas on  Wednesday.    Alatas is a key figure in the Nonaligned Movement and in  preparations for this year's summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation.</p>

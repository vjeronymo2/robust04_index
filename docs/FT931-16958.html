			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / 100 Years In The Pink: Lies, damn lies and financial reporting - The business press's steps beyond the City JANUARY 2 1893, when the Financial Times first blushed pink, marked the newspaper's arrival at the second great milestone in the evolution of Britain's financial press. The first had been the transition from papers which consisted purely of price lists towards those that also supplied the news behind the markets. The earliest financial papers were those such as Lloyd's News, created in 1696 by Edward Lloyd, a coffee house owner, to serve the growing anthill of London's financial district. In the US these early business papers were known as price currents and formed the basis of today's trade press - providing specialist services to tightly defined business groups from tobacco growers to railroad men. In 1869 George Houghton, successful editor of the The Hub, a carriage business paper, published a list of do's and don'ts, of which the cornerstone was: 'Stick to your speciality] You will want soon to publish a story that has no connection with carriage-making, or will be tempted to use some reading matter of a general character. Don't do it. If you do you will kill your paper.' The FT was able to outgrow this stern advice because the growth of financial markets in the 19th century and the emergence of a substantial investor class created an appetite for information about all sectors of business. This information boom underpinned the maturing of a modern economy based on international trade. It also created opportunities for unscrupulous stock promoters and fraudsters. Even as early as 1720 The South Sea Bubble could not have happened on the scale it did without a rudimentary and nationwide financial news system to pump it up. By 1893 it could not be claimed that the press had developed robust ethical standards to chart them through these turbulent waters. Horatio Bottomley, who became chairman of the FT in 1888 at the age of 28, had a taste for champagne, chorus girls and horseracing. He went on to run the viciously rightwing John Bull newspaper, which printed details from Ramsay MacDonald's birth certificate and so revealed something of which the Labour party leader was himself ignorant, namely his illegit-imacy. In the 1890s Bottomley floated a string of suspect companies but it was not until 1922 that he was convicted of fraud for his leading role in the sale of wartime Victory Bonds. In the ensuing years several more sober and enduring figures in the FT's history were to be exposed as recipients of substantial payments from dubious City figures whose stocks the paper had pushed. This may have been normal for financial journalists of the time, who attacked enemies and defended friends with fulminating vigour. The FT had yet to discover that honesty and impartiality could provide a sound base for its business. If the honesty of some of the early leading figures in financial journalism was questionable there was, however, hard work in evidence. An early history of the Financial News, with which the FT was to merge in 1945, records the following day in the life of one FA Hanson who 'was reputed to return home for sleep only at the weekends'. He 'would call at the office at eleven each morning to be assigned to a company meeting. This engagement fulfilled, and his copy transcribed, he would write up the produce markets - no light task in those days of easy space - before going down to his real night's duty at five in the afternoon. Having seen the paper to bed in the small hours of the morning, he would snatch a few hours' sleep in a chair, take breakfast at a restaurant in which he was wickedly reputed to have some financial interest, and begin the routine again.'</p>

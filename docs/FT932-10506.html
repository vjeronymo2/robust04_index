			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Carbon emissions may rise after 2000 MR MICHAEL Howard, environment secretary, said yesterday the UK's emissions of carbon dioxide were likely to rise after 2000 even if the country met international targets on combating global warming. The UK committed itself at last year's Rio Earth Summit to bringing emissions in 2000 back to 1990 levels, a target normally referred to as 'stabilisation'. But that commitment did not mean that emissions would not rise again after 2000, Mr Howard said. He told the Department of the Environment's conference on the UK's plan for meeting the Rio targets: 'We will look in 1996 at emissions beyond 2000 in the light of the scientific knowledge at that point - that review process is part of the Rio convention.' Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment spokesman, called Mr Howard a 'flat-earther' for 'disputing the scientific evidence on global warming' and for refusing 'to give any commitment, even in principle, to reduce emissions beyond the year 2000'. Mr Howard told the conference that the public sector would not escape pressures for energy efficiency. He said the government had set itself the target of saving 15 per cent in energy consumption - about 3 per cent a year - between 1990-91 and 1995-96. 'Our targets should take energy use by central government down to well below 80 per cent of 1990 levels by 2000,' he said.</p>

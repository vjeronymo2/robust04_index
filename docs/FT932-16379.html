			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Fund manager's global ambitions persist: Invesco MIM's new team at the top inherit an old strategy The architect has gone, but the blueprint has survived his departure. Though Lord Stevens, who built up Invesco MIM, the London-based fund management company, left last year, Mr Charles Brady, the American who succeeded him, harbours the same global ambitions. When MIM Britannia, chaired by Lord Stevens, acquired the US fund management businesses of Invesco in 1986, the plan was to create a worldwide investment group. Even before Invesco MIM became bogged down in a series of controversies that led to Lord Stevens's departure, the dream was already fraying at the edges. The figures tell their own story. In 1986, just after the takeover of Invesco, the combined company had Pounds 6.4bn under management in the UK and roughly Pounds 10bn under management elsewhere. At the end of 1992, the US business held funds under management of Pounds 32.6bn, the UK funds had shrunk to Pounds 4.3bn and Europe and Japan accounted for just over Pounds 1.3bn each. Gross profits from the US operations were Pounds 32.9m while the European and Pacific operations had profits of only Pounds 2.6m before exceptional write-offs of Pounds 10.1m for the year. 'Invesco MIM is really a US fund management company with a bit of European business around the edges,' says Mr Philip Gibbs, securities analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Mr Brady, who last week assumed the title of executive chairman, says the group hopes to put its past troubles behind it and go on to build the international organisation it had always hoped to be. Among the company's first priorities, he says, is restoring the confidence of the UK pension fund consultants who guide the bulk of institutional business into the hands of fund managers. That will take time. A clutch of problems remain fresh in UK memories: Investment performance. Invesco MIM's three-year investment returns - the figure which fund managers most rely on to sell their services - are hampered by poor performance in 1990 when it used a 'black box' technique to select stocks using a US-style active quantitative approach. The approach, imported wholesale from the US, had been insufficiently tested in the UK, consultants says. Regulatory problems. In autumn 1991 Imro, the UK self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, fined Invesco MIM Pounds 75,000 for administrative problems with its PEP products. Imro has the firm under investigation for its role in the handling of transactions from the Mirror Group Pension Scheme, whose trustees have also filed a writ seeking return of over Pounds 11m handled by Invesco MIM. Bad publicity. Recently, Invesco MIM lost the management of one of its largest investment trusts, Drayton Asia, in a well-publicised fight over several months. Last year it had to pay Pounds 9.5m to investors in Drayton Consolidated, another of the investment trusts it managed, after it emerged that it had breached the trust's own ceiling on the concentration of funds in a single investment. The firm's reputation has also been hurt by revelations of its investments in companies of which Lord Stevens was a director. Mr Brady says he has moved swiftly, selling off those investments linked to Lord Stevens and withdrawing from businesses with a high risk profile. That is why, he says, Invesco is closing down its venture capital division which has roughly Pounds 600m under management. Talks about a possible management buy-out are under way. Mr Norman Riddell, newly appointed chief executive of Invesco's European operations, says the firm's image is already improving. Several pension funds have selected it to participate in 'beauty parades' at which fund managers are selected, he says. But pension consultants are less upbeat about Invesco's prospects. 'We haven't been directing clients to them. There's no point,' says a partner at one of the large actuarial consulting firms. 'We'd have too much explaining to do.' While Invesco MIM's performance in 1991 and 1992 has been above average, it has not been sufficiently spectacular to overcome clients' concerns, he says. Mr Gibbs says that even if Invesco MIM is nothing more than a US-based company its shares, at 104p, still represent good value. It would be well advised to seek a US listing, he argues, to reflect its true status. Mr Brady has grander ambitions. The company's UK-based retail operations are not up for sale, he says, in spite of industry speculation. And he is not interested in parting from any of the geographical regions in which Invesco now operates, no matter how marginal the current profitability of those activities. In short, Lord Stevens's vision of a global fund management company still stands.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Forced sales hit BAe A decision by British Aerospace to force international shareholders to lighten holdings because of rules governing overseas ownership of the defence group saw the shares marked down sharply yesterday. The company warned of its action late on Tuesday following a breach of the permitted 29.5 per cent ownership. Yesterday the shares opened sharply lower on fears that the move would cause a stock overhang and that buying pressure would subside without the continued overseas interest. But analysts said the problems caused by the ceiling, imposed by the government to prevent the company being dominated by foreign interests, were likely to force the government to relax the rule. After the market closed, BAe said its foreign-owned stakes had fallen to 29.49 per cent. Meanwhile, a press story that BAe's aircraft leasing obligations were substantially greater than the income it expects to receive on sub-leases to airlines was said to have caused few ruffles. The stock closed 13 off at 488p.</p>

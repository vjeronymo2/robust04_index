			<p>BFN     [Text] The Congress-I has said that India will not sign  the Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] unless all countries are  included in it and it becomes nondiscriminatory in character.  Talking to newspersons in New Delhi today, the party spokesman,  Mr. V.N. Gadgil, said revision of the treaty is due next year  and, therefore, member countries need to have some negotiations  in this regard.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Takushi Kawada from Seoul; part two of </F> three-part series entitled "North Korea's Suspected Development  of Nuclear Arms: The Crisis Structure: Involvement of the  United States, China, Russia, and Japan Deepens"]    [TEXT] On 6 June, the United States, the Republic of  Korea, and Japan conferred in Washington on the DPRK's nuclear  question, and an old general abruptly left Pyongyang for  Beijing. He is 75-year-old Choe Kwang, chief of the general  staff of the People's Army and a member of the party Politburo.  During World War II, he was said to have engaged in partisan  resistance activities with President Kim Il-song and at present  he ranks ninth in the hierarchy. Choe immediately went into  talks with his Chinese counterpart and extolled "friendship  between China and the DPRK."    In the evening of 7 June, the following day, ROK President  Kim Yong-sam deplaned at a military air base in Seoul after an  official visit of Russia and read a statement: "Russia pledged  resolute measures to prevent North Korea from developing nuclear  arms."    Only in the Korean peninsula does serious confrontation  continue after the end of the Cold War. As suspicion over the  nuclear arms development program is getting more serious, brisk  activities are going on in the four neighboring [word as  published] countries -- the United States, China, Russia, and  Japan. Both South and North Korea are all out to work on China  and Russia and heated behind-the-scenes negotiations are going  on at such organizations as the UN Security Council. On 8 June,  ROK Foreign Minister Han Song-ju will arrive in Beijing and  Japanese Foreign Minister Kakizawa will visit Seoul and Beijing  over the weekend.    "The Korea peninsula has once more become an arena of  rivalry  among the peripheral four powers. South and North Korea joined  the United Nations simultaneously three years ago, pledging  coexistence in their basic agreement, but the nuclear problem  has completely changed the picture." So said with a sigh North  Korean affairs specialist Kim Nam-shik, fellow at the Peace  Study Institute in Seoul, comparing the present situation with  that of the Yi Dynasty.    In the later 19th century, the Korea peninsula, China,  Czarist Russia, and Japan were rivals for rights and interests  and Japan colonized Korea after the Sino-Japanese and the  Russo-Japanese wars. It is needless to say the present situation  is different from that of those days when imperialism was  rampant. But fellow Kim pointed out: "Although what matters  today is nuclear, not the territory, the resembling situation is  that the peripheral powers are stepping up their influence over  the Korean peninsula for their own security and interests."    As the forefront of East-West confrontation during the Cold  War days, the Korean peninsula maintained a confrontational but  stabilized situation in two distinct camps -- North Korea  supported by China and the Soviet Union and South Korea with the  backing of the United States and Japan.    Following the Cold War's end, the ROK normalized relations  with the former Soviet Union and China, tipping the power  balance over the Korean peninsula in one breath.    At one time, the South and North sought to construct a  unique  order of coexistence but the DPRK finally chose a way to use the  suspected nuclear arms development program as the means to get a  U.S. guarantee indispensable "for the maintenance of the present  order on equal terms." As a result, the United States was  compelled to further its involvement in the Korean peninsula and  China, Russia, and Japan became strongly concerned due to  further complication of the nuclear matters.    From this viewpoint, the situation in the Korean peninsula  can be described as a grandiose diplomatic war between the South  and North and the Big Four to build a new order of stability in  the peninsula with the nuclear problem as their keyword.    The United States is steadily making preparations for when  sanctions may be imposed with the cooperation of Japan and the  ROK with a proposition of "nuclear nonproliferation." But the  positive fact that must not be overlooked is that none of the  parties, South and North Korea, the United States, China,  Russia, or Japan, want sanctions imposed. It is their true  intention to evade the situation that goes against building a  new order.    According to diplomatic sources, the present position of the  United States, the ROK, and Japan that they would "impose  sanctions if necessary" is a policy to apply pressure on the  DPRK to become more flexible and it is thought to be a  considerably long time before actual sanctions would take place.  How are South and North Korea and the four other nations going  to deal with the dangerous factor of nuclear problems and of  building a new stability? The DPRK will not easily abandon the  nuclear card unless it is confident of its survival.    Well-informed sources in North Korean affairs predicted the  future development this way: "DPRK President Kim Il-song is not  embarrassed at all. Rather, he is indignant with the United  States for the `nonfulfillment of promises.' There is a good  reason to believe that the Pyongyang leadership will look for a  new logic to make compromises on the nuclear inspection and  shift its position for dialogue, while consolidating readiness  to undergo preliminary sanctions. On the other hand, it is  conceivable that it may seek a new solution through the octonary  negotiation [as proposed by Russia]." They added, "The current  situation is different from ideological confrontation during the  Cold War. It poses another problem that crisis may be amplified  by complex interests of the countries involved."</p>

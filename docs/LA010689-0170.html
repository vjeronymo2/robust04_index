			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> DIGITAL;  </P> <P> DIGITAL TO UNVEIL DESKTOP MODELS;  </P> <P> EFFORT MARKS MAJOR SHIFT TO PERSONAL COMPUTERS  </P> <P> Digital Equipment Corp., the company that invented the minicomputer, is now  trying to convince its customers that it is just as serious about desktop  computers.  </P> <P> The company hopes to make a big splash Tuesday with the announcement of a host  of new desktop models, marking a move from expensive minicomputers to more  down-market personal computers.  </P> <P> The effort represents a major change in attitude for one of the world's three  largest computer companies, industry analysts said. However, it may not solve  Digital's biggest problem of the past year, a slowdown in sales of its most  profitable product, the most advanced VAX minicomputer.  </P> <P> "Back in November (chairman) Ken Olsen said the problem with sales was at the  high end of the line," said Jay Stevens, computer analyst with Dean Witter  Reynolds Inc. "They are adding additional machines at the low end but that  offers no resolution to the main problem."  </P> <P> With sales of the more expensive high-end machines expected to remain sluggish  through the first half of this year, analysts expect Digital to report lower  earnings for its fiscal year no matter how spectacular its desktop strategy.  </P> <P> The company's stock has been rising over the past two months in anticipation of  the much-publicized announcement of new models, which will include a family of  personal computers manufactured by Tandy Corp. and a high-powered workstation  based on a computer chip from MIPS Computer Inc.  </P> <P> But analysts caution that the announcement will not turn Digital's outlook  around immediately.  </P> <P> "I believe the products will be very, very aggressively priced," said Marc  Schulman, who follows Digital for UBS Securities. A combination of slim profit  margins on the new models and initial limited production volumes will prevent  the products from boosting Digital's results for the next six to nine months,  Schulman said.  </P></p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (15): Trampled by the bull - The US / Analysis of the fall in activity After the 1980s debt binge, the US management buy-out business is suffering a prolonged hangover. Buy-out activity since 1990 has been extremely light, and the business has slowed down even further this year. According to Securities Data, the financial information services group, so far this year 131 management buy-out deals have been announced, worth a total value of Dollars 2.95bn. (The figure includes deals that have been unveiled but not yet completed, and the total runs up to November 16.) This compares unfavourably with the totals for 1992, when 151 deals, worth Dollars 5.6bn, were announced, and 1991 (170 deals, worth Dollars 4.8bn). This year's total, however, could yet be improved if, as many investment bankers expect, the Kmart subsidiary Payless is taken private before the end of the year in a buy-out that could be worth as much as Dollars 1bn. Even with the Payless deal, the 1993 total is still meagre by comparison with the late 1980s, the heyday of the MBO business. In 1989, 296 MBO deals, worth Dollars 34.4bn, were announced, and in 1988 - the peak of the boom - 294 management buy-outs worth an astonishing Dollars 84.5bn were announced. Various factors have been behind the downturn in the MBO market. They include: The collapse of many of the big leveraged buy-outs of the 1980s scared many potential investors away, possibly for good. Financing has dried up, although banks are now back in the market, albeit with considerable caution. Some of the tax loopholes of a decade ago, which made breaking up a company after a buy-out so attractive, have been closed. The roaring bull market in equities has made it much more profitable for companies seeking value to sell their stock to the public, rather than take it private in a buy-out. And the rise in stock prices has valued companies so highly, that they are simply too expensive for management or buy-out boutiques to consider acquiring. As one corporate finance executive at a top Wall Street firm explains: 'You can't really do buy-outs at these prices. (The high valuations) mean that sponsors have to put in a lot more common stock, and the returns, and the deals the management group gets, are less juicy. There is a lot less incentive for everyone to pursue buy-outs now.' The result has been a sharp drop-off in activity, not just measured by volume, but also in terms of the size of deals announced. Last year, the biggest MBO, the Kohlberg Kravis Roberts-led purchase of American Reinsurance from Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, was worth Dollars 1.4bn. In contrast, the largest deal so far this year has been the Dollars 425m acquisition of Purina Mills, British Petroleum's animal-feed subsidiary. Purina was bought for cash by its management with the help of the Sterling Group, a private investment group from Houston, Texas. After the Purina deal, the next largest transactions were two buy-outs valued at Dollars 300m: one of General Motors' Allison Gas Turbine Division; the other of Du Pont's weapons manufacturer, Remington Arms. Both deals were put together by the firm of Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice. While many of the bigger name boutiques, like Wasserstein Perella (now minus the Perella), Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Forstmann Little, have kept a relatively low profile, Clayton Dubilier has probably been the busiest buy-out boutique this year. The firm has kept itself active by focusing on buying smaller companies that have been struggling to make a contribution to a much larger parent. In the case of GM's Allison and Du Pont's Remington, Clayton Dubilier found two companies which the firm believed would be better off separated from their parent group. This search for the smaller deals highlights a recent trend. As Mr Jack Levy, managing director and co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Merrill Lynch, puts it: 'More often than not, the kind of buy-outs which are available today are subsidiaries of private companies, private companies, and the very occasional smaller public company. I can't think of a large public company which has said in 1993: 'I want to go private.'' Yet it would be wrong to suggest that the majority of buy-out specialists are sitting around twiddling their thumbs. Many are taking the opportunity to raise new funds to prepare for an upturn in activity, possibly when the boom in public markets is over. Mr Levy says: 'Things are rather quiet for buy-out groups, but they are by no means standing still. A number of groups are raising money, and are preoccupied with getting refuelled for another round of transactions.' Whether the next round of deals will justify the preparation remains to be seen. One investment banker at a major firm is doubtful: 'The market is pretty realistic about buy-outs. The business went from one where people were pretty rational about how much they paid, and the transaction structure, to a feeding frenzy. It led to disaster and losses. All of the defaults created a lot of fear in the market. Anyone who went through the defaults does not really want to do it again. We're never going to get back to where it was.'</p>

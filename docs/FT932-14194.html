			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: Quarto slips to Pounds 3.81m but confident of brighter prospects QUARTO GROUP reported a dip in pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.05m to Pounds 3.81m in what the publishing, marketing and production services company described as the 'harshest year we have known'. Sales in the year to December 31 rose from Pounds 35.1m to Pounds 39.4m. The US-registered group said: 'Our determination not to trade sales for margins has restricted our turnover growth this year, but it is important to recognise that margins, once lost, are hard to regain.' Quarto is involved in publishing in the UK, US, Europe, the Far East and Australia, and said the diversity and geographic spread of its activities had afforded the group a degree of protection from poor market conditions. Profits were depressed by a Pounds 160,000 exceptional charge relating to an aborted acquisition. There was also an extraordinary loss of Pounds 296,000 from the disposal of Lefax, which was sold to Filofax for Pounds 1.2m in October. The board said that because of these charges, the performance of the group was better reflected by earnings per share of 16.2p (17.9p). Quarto said prospects for this year were much brighter, with better sentiment in the US after the election feeding through into better sales. A similar effect had been seen in Australia, following last month's election, and even in the UK sales had risen. In view of the better prospects, the group increased its final dividend to 3.75875p (3.6375p), making a total for the year of 5.37125p (5.25p).</p>

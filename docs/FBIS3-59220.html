			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Claude Angeli: "Listening in on the New War in </F> Algeria"]    [Excerpt] Every evening, unit commandants and regional  military leaders transmit the day's balance sheet to Algiers:  the dead and the wounded in each camp, then the number of  prisoners. These conversations, encoded or not, are recorded  and, if need be, decoded by the French intelligence services.    It is a simple question of technique. Above the  Mediterranean, an Atlantic-2 plane permanently monitors these  military communications. Lower down, in international waters, is  the patrol boat Le Berry, belonging to the General Directorate  for External Security (DGSE). Equipped to intercept all  telephone and satellite communications, Le Berry records  messages from the Algerian military but mainly monitors civilian  governmental communications.    This is probably not enough to know everything that moves  among our neighbors. In Algeria proper, the "big ears" of the  military intelligence branch of the DGSE are also working.  Thanks to perfected scanners, our intelligence operatives  monitor the local communications of the special units and the  gendarmery, which are the most deeply engaged in the fight.    In June 1993, for instance, our newspaper had mentioned the  interception of a radio conversation between a unit pursuing  clandestine operatives in an Algiers neighborhood and an  official from the former Military Security who explicitly gave  the order to execute the wounded fundamentalists arrested in a  sweep.    This says much about the reason why Mitterrand, Balladur,  Juppe, and Leotard should worry about Algeria. In their recent  notes, the French services estimated the weekly balance sheet of  this new war at 200 dead. Desertions and arms thefts occur.  Clandestine operatives who do not hesitate to circulate in rural  areas, show themselves to the people, attack barracks and set  ambushes. This is no longer terrorism and repression.    Finally, always according to the French services, young  Algerian officers, from lieutenants to commandants, are not all  faithful partisans of the present leaders. This pre-civil war  situation troubles many of them.  [passage omitted]</p>

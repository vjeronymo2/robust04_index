			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ilana Baum] </F>   [Text] The Construction and Housing Ministry yesterday  issued a tender via the Public Works Division for the  construction of the "Jericho bypass" road.    It will be the first of a series of "security roads" to be  built by Israel to avoid friction between Israelis and  Palestinians and to increase security for the Jewish settlers in  Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip.    Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, approved  the building of the new road. The length of the "Jericho  bypass" road will be 13 km and it will cost 5 million shekels.  It is a ring road which will be built some 2 km south of  Jericho.    The work will begin within a month and will end within weeks  after that.    About three months ago, the Construction and Housing  Ministry  prepared a master plan for the "autonomy roads," which will cost  a total of 2 billion shekels.    They will involve the building of some 600 km of roads in  Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. The plan, which is defined  as top secret, categorizes the importance and urgency of each  road.    The "Jericho bypass" road was defined as having immediate  urgency.    The plan was presented for Defense Ministry inspection and  Yitzhaq Rabin's approval. No permission has yet been given for  the building of additional roads.    The autonomy road plan has two tracks:    One: restoring, expanding, and adding new lanes to existing  strategic roads, such as the Jordan Rift Valley road, the Alon  Road, and the Trans-Samaria Highway.    Two: building new roads, called "security roads" with the  aim of assuring the safety of the Jewish residents. These are  bypass roads, such as the "Jericho bypass" road.    The aim of the security roads is to bypass Arab population  centers and prevent friction between Jews and Arabs. Under this  clause, additional roads are planned: the Ramallah bypass, the  Nabulus bypass, the Tulkarm bypass, and the Shomron bypass.</p>

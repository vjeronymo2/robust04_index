			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / International Company News: BZW moves to regroup capital market operations BARCLAYS DE Zoete Wedd, the investment banking arm of Barclays, the UK clearing bank, has regrouped its capital market operations in an attempt to boost its activities in the debt and structured finance areas. Like rival NatWest Markets, which has been through an extensive reorganisation of its own, BZW's move appears to demonstrate a recognition that its debt and derivatives operations lag behind more ambitious US and continental European rivals in London. The bank's bond activities have been largely restricted to sterling in the past, though last week it won its first big European currency unit mandate as joint lead manager on an Ecu500m bond issue for the European Investment Bank. The new debt capital markets group comprises bond origination and private placements, structured finance - previously part of the corporate finance unit - and swaps and options. Debt trading and sales activities will remain in the bank's markets devision, though swap and options trading will be part of the new group. Mr John Spencer, managing director of Barclays' financial markets group, said the changes did not signal any wider shake-up of BZW's corporate finance operations.</p>

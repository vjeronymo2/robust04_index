			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> STAKE IN GILLETTE BOOSTS STOCK  </P> <P> Gillette Co. stock climbed 62.5 cents a share in early trading today on news  that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. had bought a $600-million stake in the company --  a purchase analysts saw as an anti-takeover effort.  </P> <P> Berkshire Hathaway bought $600 million in bonds yielding 8.75% that in two  years are convertible to common stock equal to 11% of the company's outstanding  shares.  </P> <P> The investment makes Gillette, which has been the target of several takeover  attempts in the past few years, less vulnerable to an unfriendly buyer,  analysts said.  </P></p>

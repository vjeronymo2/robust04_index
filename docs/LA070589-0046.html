			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SOCCER TEAM KNOWS NOT WHERE IT'S HEADED  </P> <P> The United States' World Cup soccer qualifying game against El Salvador that  was scheduled for Sunday has been postponed indefinitely, a spokesman for the  Federation of International Football Assn. said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Guido Tognoni said from FIFA headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland, that the game  might be played on July 23 in either Tegucigalpa, Honduras, or Canada but that  neither the date nor the site will be determined until negotiations are  completed among the United States, El Salvador, FIFA and the potential host  city.  </P> <P> The game was originally scheduled for San Salvador, El Salvador's capital, but  FIFA ruled last week that no games could be held in El Salvador for at least  one month because of a fan disturbance in a June 25 game.  </P> <P> El Salvador requested that the game be moved to Los Angeles, where there is a  large Salvadoran population. But two other countries in the five-team  qualifying tournament, Costa Rica and Guatemala, objected because they felt it  would give the United States the advantage of having an additional home game.  </P> <P> Tognoni said FIFA failed in efforts to persuade Costa Rica and Guatemala to  give their approval so that the game could be played Sunday. He said the only  stadium prepared on such short notice was the Coliseum, where tickets have been  on sale since Monday. Keith Walker, a U.S. Soccer Federation official, said  Saturday that he was 99.99% sure the game would be in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "The only thing we know for sure now is that the game will not be played in the  United States," Tognoni said.  </P> <P> There is, however, a possibilty that the game will be played in San Salvador,  he said. FIFA officials will meet July 25 to decide how much longer the  suspension in El Salvador should last. If the suspension is lifted before the  United States faces El Salvador, the game probably would be rescheduled for San  Salvador.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE  </P> <P> DONIZETTI and BELLINI ARIAS. Raul Gimenez, tenor; Scottish Chamber Orchestra  conducted by Michelangelo Veltri.  </P> <P> Nimbus 5224 (compact disc). Although already 39 years old, the Argentinian  Gimenez is something of a newcomer to the international scene. He shows a  somewhat smallish, tight voice, which nonetheless is used with color variety  and sensitivity. The cruel demands at the top of the range in this repertory (a  D flat in the "Puritani" and the respected C's in the treacherous "Fille" aria)  hold no terrors for him. He is also capable of the seamless legato line  necessary for "Una furtiva lagrima" and the "Pasquale" excerpts. Sympathetic  accompaniment by Veltri. WALTER PRICE  </P></p>

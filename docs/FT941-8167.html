			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Clarke denies prejudicing trial: Disclosure would have put at risk intelligence agents, chancellor says Mr Kenneth Clarke said yesterday he had served the national interest by seeking to restrict information on Britain's intelligence services from a court case involving arms exports to Iraq. The chancellor told the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry that while home secretary he had signed public interest immunity (PII) certificates that barred intelligence officers from providing certain types of information to the court in the Matrix Churchill case. He said he did so after satisfying himself that full disclosure would have 'damaged' Britain's intelligence services and put at risk some of its operatives. He told the Scott inquiry: 'Once I decided that this type of information, if disclosed, would be damaging to the intelligence services and it was not in the public interest for this to be in the public domain, then . . . I had a duty, and still think I have, to claim public interest immunity . . . ' Mr Clarke has threatened to resign if criticised in the judge's final inquiry report. Yesterday, in a characteristically robust performance, he refused to accept any personal culpability and insisted that the PII certificates had not prejudiced the defence in the Matrix Churchill trial. But Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade spokesman, said that Mr Clarke's evidence raised new questions about the conduct of other ministers and the government's legal advisers. Mr Clarke said he considered that as minister he had discretion as to what evidence should be covered by the PII certificates. Other ministers and government lawyers have argued that ministers are obliged to sign such certificates, and that it is for the attorney-general to decide whether to sanction them. Mr Clarke said that he had in previous cases argued successfully against government lawyers. But he told the inquiry that Mr Michael Heseltine, as trade and industry secretary, had signed a PII certificate in the Matrix Churchill trial on the advice of Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, that all ministers were duty-bound to do so. Mr Heseltine's PII certificates covered advice to ministers from officials, and communications between ministers. The defence in the Matrix Churchill trial alleged that the documents proved that three businessmen charged with breaching rules over exports to Iraq had done so with the approval of government. One of the businessman had been recruited by the intelligence services. The trial collapsed after the defence convinced the trial judge that the bulk of the documents covered by public interest immunity should be disclosed. Mr Clarke said he had 'never known' of such an immunity being sought by a minister to 'seek a conviction of an innocent man'.</p>

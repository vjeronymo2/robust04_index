			<p>BFN     [Text] The release of two Soviet prisoners of war, Aleksey  Olenin and Yuriy Stepanov, who had been handed over to First  Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin in Islamabad  recently, resulted from close cooperation between the Russian  Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) and the Pakistani Defense  Ministry's Defense Agency. Tatyana Samolis, a spokeswoman for  the FIS, who said so in an Interfax interview added that her  statement had been cleared with the Pakistani intelligence.    She said that Stepanov and Olenin would arrive in Moscow at  the end of the week. She explained that they were not forced to  stay in Russia. They alone will choose the country where they  will live. Her agency sought only their release.    Samolis said that former Soviet POWs were still held in  Pakistan. She hoped that cooperation between the Russian and  Pakistani intelligence services would continue.</p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INCUMBENTS TAKE BEATING AT THE POLLS;  </P> <P> ELECTIONS: VOTERS MAKE CLEAN SWEEPS IN THREE CITIES. ASSEMBLYMEN FRANK HILL AND  CHARLES CALDERON ARE WINNERS IN RACE FOR SENATE SEATS.  </P> <P> San Gabriel Valley voters ousted 18 incumbent council members, including all  those running in La Puente, Monterey Park and Temple City, and rejected two tax  measures Tuesday.  </P> <P> In La Puente, where no incumbent has been defeated since 1968, voters made up  for lost time. For the first time in city history, three veteran councilmen  were swept from office in a dramatic upset fueled by the highest voter turnout  in 14 years.  </P> <P> In Temple City, three candidates who said it was time for new ideas and  leadership swept three incumbents aside.  </P> <P> And in Monterey Park, newcomers scored decisive victories over two council  incumbents, including Barry L. Hatch, the outspoken former mayor who alienated  some residents with his complaints about illegal immigration.  </P> <P> Incumbents also were turned out of office in Arcadia, Azusa, Covina, El Monte,  Glendora, Irwindale, San Gabriel, South El Monte and West Covina.  </P> <P> In addition to the city votes, special elections were held Tuesday to fill two  vacant state Senate seats. Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier) won a runoff to  succeed William Campbell of Hacienda Heights, who resigned to become president  of the California Manufacturers Assn., in the 31st Senate District.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Charles Calderon (D-Whittier) was an easy winner in the 26th  District, which was represented by Whittier Democrat Joseph B. Montoya until he  resigned in February after being convicted of political corruption charges.  </P> <P> Voters in La Puente elected Manuel J. Garcia, 52, chairman of the city's  Planning Commission, Edward L. Chavez, 26, a substitute teacher and school  board member, and Louis R. Perez, 52, a sales engineer for a diesel company.  </P> <P> They ousted incumbents Francis M. Palacio, 62, and Max E. Ragland, 70 -- both  of whom were vying for their seventh four-year terms on the council -- and  Louis F. Guzman, 70, a council member since 1979.  </P> <P> "It's time for the changing of the guard," said Garcia, who led the field of  eight candidates with 632 votes. "I think the people sensed that."  </P> <P> Palacio, who served 24 years on the council, said he was pleased that the three  victors were all Latino. "I helped pave the road for these people," he said,  noting that few Latinos held municipal office in Los Angeles County two decades  ago.  </P> <P> No one characterized the spirit of the election better than Chavez, who was  only 2 years old when Palacio was first elected to the council. Chavez, who has  a political science degree from UCLA, said he even has photos of himself as an  infant posing with the councilmen he helped defeat.  </P> <P> "It was kind of hard to run against them, you know, just out of respect," said  Chavez, who still lives at home with his parents. "But obviously I think the  community wanted to move forward. I'll never say I was better than these  councilmen, though. I'll never gloat."  </P> <P> In a hotly contested race in Monterey Park, incumbents Pat Reichenberger and  Hatch lost to challengers Sam Kiang, an attorney and engineer; Marie T. Purvis,  a businesswoman, and Fred Balderrama, automotive shop owner.  </P> <P> Hatch said he had no regrets. "I did it my way," he said.  </P> <P> In Temple City, Mary Lou Swain, running for her third term, and Ken Gillanders  and Tom Atkins, both running for their fourth terms, were defeated.  </P> <P> Challenger Bobbie McGowan was the top vote-getter with 1,764 votes, followed by  Cathe Wilson and Mary Louise Manning. "I'm absolutely elated," said McGowan,  who said she ran because she felt the council was not listening to residents.  Voters "have spoken again," she said. "but this time at the ballot box."  </P> <P> In Azusa, council members Bruce Latta and Jennie Avila took unexpected tumbles,  losing to John Dangleis and Stephen Alexander. Councilman Tony Naranjo, who had  aligned himself with Latta and Avila in a bid to oust Mayor Eugene Moses, saw  his hopes for higher office dashed.  </P> <P> "I thought we were taking this city in a direction they wanted," Naranjo said.  "It's really puzzling to figure out this community, I tell you."  </P> <P> In South El Monte, Raul Pardo, 30, a newcomer to the city's politics, outdrew  three other candidates in six of seven precincts. He and incumbent Jim Kelly,  who tied Pardo in his home district, won the two seats, beating incumbent  Ignacio (Slim) Gracia.  </P> <P> "The community overwhelmingly spoke," said Pardo, celebrating with exuberant  campaign volunteers in a storefront after the results were in. "The voters said  it was time for a change, and they wanted somebody to bring a new vision."  </P> <P> Gracia, 71, who trailed the field, said that Pardo had "played to my age." But  he acknowledged that he had done little campaigning.  </P> <P> "This is a funny city," said Vice Mayor Stan Quintana, who made an appearance  at City Hall early in the evening. "People like to see you. Gracia didn't get  out and walk."  </P> <P> In Irwindale, where disillusionment after a failed multimillion-dollar Raiders  bid still looms over the tiny city, voters replaced longtime incumbent Joseph  Breceda with Frederick Barbosa, the man most known for trying to stop the  football stadium project. Two other incumbents, Robert Diaz and Patricio  Miranda, were reelected.  </P> <P> Barbosa, 41, joined other residents and Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani  Bernardi in suing the city in 1987 to force it to prepare an environmental  impact report on the proposed stadium's impact. A Superior Court judge ordered  Irwindale to conduct such a study, and barred Irwindale from negotiating with  the Raiders until it was completed more than a year later.  </P> <P> Arcadia Councilman Roger Chandler lost his bid for relection, finishing fourth  among six candidates. The winners were incumbent Robert Harbicht, George W.  Fasching, a businessman who owns a travel agency and car wash, and Joseph  Ciraulo, owner of a medical transcription service.  </P> <P> In El Monte, Mayor Don McMillen, a fixture on the council for 10 years, edged  challenger Art Platten for reelection, with Maurice Lopez a distant third.  </P> <P> In the council election, El Monte, whose population is about 75% Latino, lost  its only Latino councilman when incumbent Ernest Gutierrez was edged out by  Patricia Wallach and Jack Thurston in a six-candidate field. The two winners  waged aggressive campaigns, attacking the current council for allowing what  they described as runaway development.  </P> <P> In San Gabriel, newcomer Dominic S. Polimeni outpolled both incumbents in a  three-way race for two seats. Polimeni, 49, has been a member of the Parks and  Recreation Commission for seven years. He is the administrator of the Alhambra  Municipal Court. Veteran Councilman Sabino Cici won a fourth term.  </P> <P> In Covina, Chris Richardson, who has been city clerk for 27 years, was elected  to replace Mayor Bob Low, who had served for 12 years. Low finished last in the  three-candidate race, trailing winners Richardson and incumbent Henry Morgan.  </P> <P> West Covina voters ousted Councilman Richard Lewis and swept in challengers  Richard Jennings and Steve Herfert. Jennings attributed his victory to voter  discontent with the city Redevelopment Agency's arrangements with developers.  </P> <P> In Glendora, Councilwoman Lois Shade was at a loss to explain why she failed in  her bid for a third term. She gained 2,874 votes but trailed Marshall Mouw, a  47-year-old letter carrier, by 169 votes, in a comparatively large vote  turnout. Shade said a tax measure to buy hillside property, which was  resoundingly defeated, helped draw voters to the polls.  </P> <P> Also elected in Glendora were incumbent Bob Kuhn, a 46-year-old insurance  agent, who gained a second term, and Molly MacLeod, 38, an attorney and city  planning commissioner.  </P> <P> Claremont voters reelected Mayor Nicholas L. Presecan and Diann Ring to their  second four-year terms, but also elected a critic of city policies, Algird G.  Leiga, 56, a business executive. Leiga said his election reflected not only  hard work by an army of volunteer supporters but also voter desire for stronger  controls over city spending.  </P> <P> Rosemead City Councilmen Gary Taylor and Dennis McDonald won easily against  challenger Frank Villar, each earning more than a 2-to-1 margin of votes over  Villar despite the newcomer's intense campaigning.  </P> <P> Only one newcomer was chosen among seven candidates to fill three City Council  seats in Sierra Madre. MaryAnn MacGillivray, marketing vice president of a  health products company and the only woman candidate, will join incumbent Clem  Bartolai and former councilman Gary Adams on the council.  </P> <P> Voters supported an advisory measure limiting the terms of council office, but  rejected overwhelmingly a measure that would have increased property taxes 8  1/2 cents per every $100 of assessed value to raise money for paramedic  services.  </P> <P> San Dimas Mayor Terry L. Dipple won reelection without opposition and  Councilman Sandy McHenry was reelected. John Ebiner, a hospital computer  analyst, finished ahead of five other candidates to win the second council  seat.  </P> <P> In Baldwin Park, Mayor Pro Tem Bette Lowes was easily elected from a field of  three candidates to her first full term as mayor. No provision has yet been  made for filling the remaining two years of her council term.  </P> <P> Incumbent council members Julia McNeill and Bobbie Izell were also reelected  from a field of six candidates. Two ballot measures that would have changed the  mayor's position from a two-year elected term to a rotating seat among council  members were defeated.  </P> <P> In South Pasadena, where six candidates were vying for three seats, incumbents  James Hodge Jr. and James Woollacott Jr. were returned to the council. Harry A.  Knapp also was elected. Former Councilman Robert Wagner finished fifth in the  voting.  </P> <P> In Diamond Bar, which had to hold its second election only a year after  incorporation because of a technicality in state law, both incumbents running  for reelection, John Forbing and Gary Werner, won four-year terms. Jay Kim,  owner of a Diamond Bar-based engineering firm who outspent all eight of his  opponents, won the third seat and captured the highest number of votes.  </P> <P> In La Verne, Mayor Jon Blickenstaff scored a decisive victory despite an  aggressive campaign by challenger David L. Sardeson, who criticized the city's  approval of a 12-screen movie theater with 2,950 seats. Incumbent Councilmen  Patrick J. Gatti and Robert Rodriguez also won new terms.  </P> <P> Monrovia voters reelected Lara Blakely and John Nobrega to the council and gave  Mayor Bob Bartlett another term.  </P> <P> In Alhambra, voters overwhelmingly passed Proposition A, which repealed a 1982  ordinance prohibiting the sale of Alhambra Community Hospital without approval  from two thirds of the voters.  </P> <P> The financially troubled hospital had fallen behind in rent payments to the  city, forcing the city to tighten its belt by slashing the municipal budget  twice last year.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Irene Chang, Jesse Katz, Elizabeth Lu, Edmund Newton,  Siok-Hian Tay Kelley and Vicki Torres contributed to this report.  </P> <P> * ELECTION RESULTS: J9-10  </P></p>

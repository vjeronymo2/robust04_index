			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Michael Enger, Philip Siegel, and Hans-Peter </F> Weymar]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In March 1994, Defense  Minister Volker Ruehe said: Germany cannot check to see whether  weapons delivered by Germany are being used against Kurds in  Turkey.    This year, the shops remain closed in Diyabakir, Kurdistan's  secret capital. The Kurds' New Year celebration does not take  place -- out of fear of the Turkish military.    There is a German BTR-60 armored personnel carrier near  Diyabakir. The photograph shown here was taken three weeks ago.    A former colonel of the National People's Army [NVA] and  expert on tank technology has now confirmed the research done by  Monitor.    [Begin ex-NVA Colonel Lotahr Mann recording] These tanks,  which are BTR-60 PB armored personnel carriers, clearly come  from the stocks of the former NVA. Proof of that are the  changes that have been made on the vehicles, in particular  regarding external lighting, but also those changes that were  made on the vehicles in connection with the transition to the  licensing regulation under the FRG traffic code, such as  rearview mirrors. Thus, it is quite clear that these vehicles  are not deliveries from the former Soviet Union or from Russia,  but that these are clearly German tanks. [end recording]    Only two weeks ago did we visit several towns and villages  in  Turkish Kurdistan again. After just two days on this trip, we  identified German military materiel in six different places  [video shows a map of Turkey on which Elazig, Maden, Ergani,  Tatvan, Silvan, and Hasankeyf are marked]. Nevertheless,  despite all the photographs, television pictures, and  eyewitnesses, the foreign minister is still denying everything.    [Begin Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel recording] I have  really tried to clarify the matter. We have never managed to  get direct proof. [end recording]    [Monitor moderator Klaus Bednarz] Two weeks ago, I sent  Foreign Minister Kinkel a video tape with the Monitor cast of  last November, which documented the use of German tanks against  the Kurds. One week ago, I received the response that the tape  had been forwarded to the FRG Defense Ministry for examination.  We have not heard anything since then. How long do the  gentlemen in the Defense Ministry actually need to recognize  their own tanks?</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Nicaraguan Foreign Relations Ministry  Information and Communications Directorate has clarified the  Nicaraguan Government's position on the possible return of Cuba  to the OAS and on the U.S. embargo of that island. An AFP news  dispatch, which was published by BARRICADA on 15 June 1994,  addressed those issues and took statements made by Deputy  Foreign Minister Dr. Jose Pallais out of context, presenting an  incomplete picture.    Acting Foreign Minister Dr. Jose Pallais, asked if Nicaragua  supports Cuba's reinstatement to the OAS, told foreign  correspondents in Nicaragua: "Nicaragua supports it, but Cuba  must obviously show some willingness to adopt and share the  changes that the inter-American system has experienced within  the OAS and the principles and values that the OAS developed in  the 1990's."    As for the embargo against Cuba, he stated: "Nicaragua, as  all Latin American countries, and based on its own experience,  does not believe that confrontation and isolation help solve  national problems. In Nicaragua we realized that confrontation,  war, and embargoes do not work, but consensus, dialogue, and  understanding do. Nicaragua and this government are the  products of this dialogue. It is therefore logical that we  cannot support practices that contradict what we have found to  be successful in our country."    Jose Pallais added: "The embargo is a unilateral position of  the United States. We do not believe in such measures, but it  is a unilateral decision of the United States, and the rest will  have to be debated at the OAS. Of course, the OAS has changed a  lot since Cuba was a member because it has reaffirmed the most  important element of its identity; that is, democracy."</p>

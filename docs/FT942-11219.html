			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Aerostructures expects Pounds 26m from flotation Aerostructures Hamble Holdings, the former British Aerospace aircraft components subsidiary, expects to raise about Pounds 26m net of expenses when it comes to the market this month. The pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, said the money would be used, alongside a new Pounds 10m unsecured revolving credit facility, to repay Pounds 35m of debt incurred during the Pounds 47.6m management buy-out in 1990. It will be raised through a placing and intermediaries offer. Aerostructures Hamble, which occupies the site near Southampton where Sunderland flying boats were built, made operating profits of Pounds 7.89m on turnover of Pounds 70.4m in 1993, compared with profits of Pounds 7m on turnover of Pounds 71.3m in 1992. The pathfinder puts pro forma pre-tax profits for 1993 at Pounds 5.6m, after allowing Pounds 2m for restructuring. The charge will cover the cost of shedding a further 200 jobs this year. At the end of December the workforce had been reduced from 2,000 at the time of the buy-out to 1,635. The company, which is expected to be valued at more than Pounds 70m, depended on BAe for 93 per cent of its business in 1990, but reduced that to 78 per cent last year. Mr Andy Barr, chief executive, said new orders already won, including a substantial contract from Boeing for wing parts for the 737-700, would reduce the level further this year. He described the broadening customer base as 'blue chip'. The senior management, all with experience at Rover Group, is implementing Japanese techniques learnt in the car business but not previously used in the aircraft industry. Mr Barr said that margins had improved from 8.9 per cent to 11.3 per cent in three years, and he was seeking continuing improvements. The management, including Mr Barr who has a 14.8 per cent stake, will be selling some shares. Legal &amp; General Ventures Partners, the largest institutional holder, with 36.7 per cent, is also likely to sell some of its investment. The flotation is sponsored by NM Rothschild and the broker is Smith New Court.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Newscast"] </F>   [Text] One of the five factions that comprise the Farabundo  Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN] has rejected the  possibility of striking an alliance with the other factions,  thereby demonstrating that internal differences still persist  within the party. Guillermo Valencia filed this report:    [Begin recording] [Valencia] The FMLN's political future  remains uncertain. On 4 and 5 June, the Revolutionary Party of  Central American Workers [PRTC] advocated a new unity pact, but  it rejected an alliance.    [Unidentified speaker] We must reach an agreement with those  we identify with in terms of politics, programs, and what a  leftist party should be.    [Valencia] Have you talked about striking an alliance?    [Unidentified speaker] Actually, we do not know what our  conclusions will be; however, according to the negotiations we  have held so far with the rank and file, we are not likely to  strike an alliance among the five FMLN factions.    [Valencia] The Communist Party of El Salvador, the People's  Revolutionary Army, and the National Resistance last week agreed  to seek a new alliance. However, the PRTC pointed out that it  is unwilling to enter into a pact of this kind. Instead, it  will come to an agreement with only those movements that are  advocating a new kind of pact.    [Unidentified female speaker] This is a practical problem.  The FMLN has limitations and lacks force as long as it cannot  reach unified opinions and beliefs. Our struggle consists of  forging a strong left and constructive opposition, but it must  be coherent in its proposals and actions. Should we strike an  alliance based upon the understanding of common issues, anyone  could at any moment strike an alliance with other sectors that  oppose the new agreement.    [Valencia] The FMLN National Council on 26 June will meet to  decide on ways to approach a new political pact. [end recording]</p>

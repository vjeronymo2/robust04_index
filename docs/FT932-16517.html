			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Community agrees copyright rules on crossborder TV COMMON EC rules on copyright for television programmes transmitted across borders via satellite and cable received broad approval from European Community ministers yesterday. The measure is aimed at filling a gap in the 1989 directive liberalising crossborder broadcasts within the EC - the so-called 'television without frontiers' directive, which came into force in October 1991 and contained no reference to copyright protection. Ministers responsible for the internal market agreed that the satellite and cable companies responsible for transmitting the programmes would handle the payment of royalties for cross-frontier broadcasts. The legal void has led to confusion about who is responsible for paying copyright fees due on satellite or cable broadcasts, with right-holders trying to collect royalties from different companies in the member states where programmes are received. The directive will come into force on January 1, 1995, assuming it gets the final legislative go-ahead from ministers and the European Parliament. Separate draft legislation aims to harmonise differing national rules on the duration of copyright protection. Ministers postponed until June a decision on controversial measures aimed at outlawing the sale of high-power motorcycles in the EC. Motorcyclists demonstrated against the measure nearby, as ministers discussed whether to limit the total power of the machines to 100 bhp. The measure is part of a series of measures harmonising technical standards for motorbikes. Advocates believe it will help improve road safety, but Portugal, supported by the UK, yesterday proposed a five-year delay to allow safety studies.</p>

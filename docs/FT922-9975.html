			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: General Motors Judging by the appetite of US investors for equity issues, it would seem nothing could go wrong with the planned Dollars 2.3bn offering from General Motors. The company has carefully prepared the ground, first by announcing a far-ranging restructuring plan and then first-quarter net income of Dollars 179m instead of a widely expected loss. The restructuring seems in earnest, involving a move towards buying in components and rationalisation of the North American model range and plants. So GM's share price may be able to make up some ground on Ford. Still there are grounds for scepticism. GM will probably face fierce opposition to restructuring from the United Auto Workers union. And though its own shares are not necessarily that expensive in terms of longer term earnings potential, the offering looks set to come in a market where even cyclical stocks are discounting robust recovery this year. Given the lack of international appeal, most of the issue may have to be placed in the US. But US investors, for different reasons, are also expected to take the lion's share of the Wellcome offering. At some stage they may rebel against such a heavy burden. International investors might reflect in their turn that Japanese industrial equities look cheap on fundamental grounds and the yen is weak. Toyota could put up a fight with GM in the equity market as well as the forecourt.</p>

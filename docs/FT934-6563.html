			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: St Paul injects Pounds 20m into the Lloyd's market St Paul Companies, the leading US insurance and financial services group, is to become the second international insurance company to join the Lloyd's of London insurance market, taking advantage of the rec-ent opening to corporate capital. Last month Yasuda Fire and Marine, Japan's second biggest insurance company, injected Pounds 1.5m of capital into its Lloyd's subsidiary. St Paul injected Pounds 20m into a new subsidiary, Camperdown Corporation, which will supply between Pounds 30m and Pounds 40m of capacity to 10 to 15 Lloyd's syndicates in 1994. Mr Jeff Post, of St Paul, said the group was particularly interested in obtaining access to specialist markets such as ocean marine and war risk through its participation at Lloyd's. It was also seeking to underwrite some catastrophe business. Mr Post said that following the failure or scaling back of some of the new Lloyd's investment trusts there was a 'new rush for capacity from some syndicate managers'. Merchant banks and securities have raised more than Pounds 800m from institutional and retail investors in the past few weeks. And two large US investment companies - London Market Investors and Lutine Capital Corporation - still have to finalise plans to raise some Dollars 600m (Pounds 403m) from international investors.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The chairman of the State Duma committee for CIS  matters, Konstantin Zatulin, has warned against rushing  presidential elections in Ukraine which would endanger calm and  stability in the republic. In an interview with  INTERFAX-Ukraine Tuesday, he pointed out he was referring to  Russia's experience of aggravated relations between different  branches of state power which should be taken into account in  Ukraine.    "With great difficulty, we have surmounted the worst.  Actually, the first stage of civil war in Russia has taken  place," Zatulin was quoted as saying.    The interviewee said Russia would conclude "the most  extensive agreements, the most extensive trade and economic  ties" with Crimea.    A number of unsolved issues remain, the main one being the  future of the Black Sea Fleet and Sevastopol, he said. "Without  support from both Russia and Ukraine, Sevastopol will find  itself in the most difficult situation," he said.    Zatulin did not preclude "Russia proposing to Crimea  participation in a package of programs, in the first place  economic ones." The Russian deputy has been participating in the  Crimean parliament's session since its opening.</p>

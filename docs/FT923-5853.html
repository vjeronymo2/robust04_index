			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Weir Group Given that Weir nearly went bust 10 years ago the change in its fortunes is truly dramatic. Fairey, Howden and 600 Group are just some of the proud British engineering names whose market capitalisations you could add together and emerge with change from Weir's near Pounds 400m. Yesterday's interim results provided another demonstration of the company's ability to withstand most shocks in the current recession. Turnover was down a touch as a result of lower demand for spares and short run orders, but the built-in strength of long-term contracts enabled pre-tax profits to advance by 23 per cent. Orders received were in line with last year's second half - even if they were down on the exceptionally buoyant equivalent six month period - while the cash performance was good, taking account of money spent on acquisitions. Weir's equanimity about the current sterling exchange rate is enviable, though there may be more pressure from American competitors in coming months. At last night's close of 507p the shares are on a prospective multiple of 14 assuming full-year profits of around Pounds 40m. If, as seems likely, investors in the engineering sector are increasingly going to focus on a handful of well managed companies with decent businesses - rather than forlornly searching for bombed out cyclicals - the rating seems well justified.</p>

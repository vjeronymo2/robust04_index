			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NO PAY, NO STAY, SAY PLAYERS;  </P> <P> PADRES: JACK CLARK, BRUCE HURST AND TONY GWYNN SAY THEY WILL SEEK FREE AGENCY  IF THE TEAM CARRIES OUT ITS PROMISE TO DOCK THEIR PAY.  </P> <P> Jack Clark, Bruce Hurst and Tony Gwynn said Friday that they will file a  grievance in an attempt to gain free agency should the Padres carry out their  promise to dock their pay because of a shortened season.  </P> <P> The Padres, on the advice of the Player Relations Committee, have informed four  players -- Clark, Hurst, Gwynn and Eric Show -- that they will not receive full  pay if the baseball lockout results in cancelled games.  </P> <P> The Padres, according to the Major League Players Assn., are required to pay  the four players their full salaries during the lockout. Yet, the players  received notices with their March 15 paycheck that they should expect  deductions for a shortened season.  </P> <P> "I guarantee you if any of my checks are missing so much as a dime," Clark  said, "they won't see me again. The next time they'll see me again will be in  court.  </P> <P> "If (the major league owners) think there will be a whole new ballgame now,  just wait. I'll show you a whole new game when we're in court. I'm tired of  their damn games. This is another one of their ploys. It's one of their scare  tactics."  </P> <P> Clark realizes that the PRC is behind the Padres' action, and vents his anger  not only at the team's management, but all of baseball's owners. Yet, if the  Padres continue their threat of withholding wages, he promises they'll be the  ones paying the price.  </P> <P> "Am I taking this seriously?," Clark said. "You're damn right I am. If they  pull this crap on us, they're going to lose me, they're going to lose Hurst and  they're going to lose Tony. They're screwing with the wrong guys. We'll all  file for free agency and split.  </P> <P> "It's sad. It's ugly. No matter what happens, these scars aren't going to go  away.  </P> <P> "The owners keep telling us to trust them, yeah, right, as gutless and  untrustworthy as they are."  </P> <P> Hurst, who became a free agent after the 1988 season with the Boston Red Sox,  signed a three-year, $5.25 million guaranteed contract with the Padres that  specifically provided that he be paid during a baseball lockout. In fact, if  the Padres had not provided the clause in the contract, Hurst said that he's  not sure he would have come to San Diego.  </P> <P> "They know what they signed, and I know what I signed," Hurst said. "No one got  hood-winked in this deal. The deal is if there was a lockout, I would get paid.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out.  </P> <P> "Now, all of a sudden, they say they're not going to pay me. I'm not a whiz  kid, but I perceive that as breach of contract.  </P> <P> "If we don't get paid, we'll file a grievance, and I'll sure take my chance at  free agency."  </P> <P> Show and his agent, Arn Tellem, could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> The four Padre players learned of their predicament when written notices were  included with their March 15 paychecks that advised them of possible future  deductions. Hurst, Gwynn and Show are paid on a 12-month schedule. Clark gets  paid from March 15 to November 15.  </P> <P> The notices that were mailed to the players, according to sources, read:  "Please be advised should the current disruption cause a delay in the start of  the championship season, future salary deductions will be made based on the  days of the championship season missed and not the actual payment schedule in  your contract. Therefore, it may be necessary to withhold payment of salary  after the resumption of play so that the club has fully received any  overpayment which resulted due to your payment schedule."  </P> <P> The fact that most of the major league players with guaranteed contracts won't  be paid is no secret, considering that 199 players with guaranteed contracts  have lockout language in their contracts which relieves the club's obligation  for payment.  </P> <P> But yet, according to sources in the Major League Players Assn. and the Player  Relations Committee, 31 players have clauses in their contract that provide for  payment in the event of a lockout and 16 players have no lockout language at  all. Hurst and Show each have defensive language that provides for payment and  Clark and Gwynn have no language in their contracts that would preclude  payment.  </P> <P> So why the notices to the four players?  </P> <P> "There's all kinds of different language in contracts," said Louis Melendez,  associate counsel of the Player Relations Committee, "but it's the  understanding that everyone under a standard uniform players' contract will not  be paid (during a lockout).  </P> <P> "I'm sure many of these cases will be litigated and challenged, but if there  are games missed, the appropriate deductions will be made."  </P> <P> Bill Beck, the Padre assistant to vice president/baseball operations who sent  out the notifications, said: "This is a mandate from the PRC. Hopefully, this  will become a moot point, anyway."  </P> <P> Still, even if a labor agreement preserving the 162-game season is reached  today between the players and owners, Clark said that the memories of this  lockout will not fade.  </P> <P> Clark, who joined the Padres in October, 1988, became the first big-name free  agent to break the collusion barrier in 1988 when he left the St. Louis  Cardinals and signed with the New York Yankees. He signed a three-year,  $6-million contract with the Yankees that contained no lockout language. When  he was traded, the Padres picked up his contract.  </P> <P> "I had to scratch and claw for what I got," Clark said, "and now they're trying  to tell me it's no good. I had to go to nuclear war to get a contract like  that, and they're trying to take it away. This is a lot of crap and I'm getting  tired of it.  </P> <P> "I'm directly involved in all three collusion cases. I haven't had my day in  court yet, but I will. I'm ready to open up all the smut in court. I'm still  gathering evidence.  </P> <P> "I don't know what the hell these owners are thinking of. The owners don't give  a damn about anything except for their greed. It's getting real old, I'm  telling you."  </P> <P> The Players Assn. has been informed of the notices mailed to the Padres and  other teams, and said that it will wait until any pay deductions materialize  before a grievance is filed. Once a grievance has been filed, the major league  club has 10 days to cover the lost wages, according to an official with the  Players Assn. If the player is not compensated, the spokesman said, the player  may file for free agency.  </P> <P> "It's going to open a whole new can of worms," said the official, who spoke  only on the condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> The four Padre players who received the notices are among the eight  highest-paid players on the team and have guaranteed contracts that are  scheduled to pay them $5.3 million -- about one-third of the club's 1990 player  payroll.  </P> <P> The Padres, according to sources in the Players Assn. and the PRC, are  scheduled to pay nearly $17.5 million in salaries and signing bonuses to major  league players on their 24-man roster this season. The average salary will be  $728,000.  </P> <P> There are a franchise-record seven players who will make at least $1 million  this season, led by outfielder Joe Carter who already received a $2 million  signing bonus and has a $1.2 million contract. Other signing bonuses in the  1990 fiscal year are $500,000 to free-agent reliever Craig Lefferts and  $150,000 to free-agent outfielder Fred Lynn.  </P> <P> While Clark, Hurst, Gwynn and Show are the only players on the Padres with  favorable or no lockout language in their contracts, a shortened season is  expected to have even a more severe effect on players with incentive-laden  contracts.  </P> <P> Lynn has the most playing incentives of anyone on the Padres and would nearly  double his base salary of $500,000 if he achieves the incentives and bonuses.  His contract requires that he be paid $3,000 for every game he plays past his  80th, and $5,000 a game for every game beginning with his 100th.  </P> <P> "It's definitely not going to be fair if games are canceled," Lynn said. "I'm  going to look into pro-rating the incentives with the schedule. I think that's  only fair, but I'm certain they'll have a different point of view."  </P> <P> Third baseman Mike Pagliarulo also has provisions that would pay him an extra  $95,000 to his base $575,000 contract if he should play a full season and make  625 plate-appearances. And shortstop Garry Templeton would add $40,000 to his  base $500,000 contract if he plays in 140 games.  </P> <P> Show, who structured his contract so that he would receive $400,000 less this  season than in 1989 because of a possible strike, could be adversely affected  even a year from now by a shortened season.  </P> <P> Show's contract stipulates that his 1991 season would become vested if he  pitches 175 innings in either 1989 or 1990. Since he underwent back surgery and  missed half of the 1989 season, he would have to meet the requirement this year  or wait for the Padres' decision. If the option is picked up, Show is eligible  to file for an arbitration award of $1.1 million to $1.7 million.  </P> <P> "Honesty has certainly shown it doesn't always work, does it?" said Nick  Lampros, Hurst's agent. "You've got to wonder how serious the owners are about  settling this."  </P> <P> </P> <P> INSIDE: NEGOTIATIONS: Baseball's owners and players were locked in a collective  bargaining session in New York at 1:30 EST this morning.

			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> WOODWORKER PUT HIS STAMP ON CITY  </P> <P> Artist Mogens Abel literally carved a name for himself in Laguna Beach, his  home for 46 years.  </P> <P> A native of Denmark who moved to Laguna Beach in 1937, Abel established a  reputation as a woodcarver and was commissioned by the City Council to sculpt  wooden welcome signs for all three entrances to the city.  </P> <P> He also carved the sign on Laguna Canyon Road that welcomes thousands of  visitors at the entrance to the city's Festival of Arts and Pageant of the  Masters.  </P> <P> "His wooden signs and carvings are all over this city," said Sally Reeve,  public relations director of the pageant, who has an Abel woodcarving inset on  the door of her office.  </P> <P> Abel was remembered Friday at a private memorial service at Heisler Park in  Laguna Beach. He died July 1 after suffering an aneurysm at his home in Leisure  World. He was 75.  </P> <P> Abel was a fixture at the festival and pageant in several capacities. He  exhibited his artwork for more than 30 years, served on its board of directors  and then acted as grounds manager for more than 20 years.  </P> <P> Abel also portrayed Judas in the pageant's traditional final act, "The Last  Supper."  </P> <P> "Mogens was the type of man we always thought would be here," Reeve said. "His  brother told me he didn't have an enemy in the world, and I believe it."  </P> <P> Abel's brother, Christian Abel, is an internationally known architect who lives  and works in Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> Mogens Abel also is survived by his wife, Shirley, of Leisure World; two  sisters, Bierte Abel of San Juan Capistrano and Jane Duree of Escondido; one  daughter, Sharon Daly of Austin, Tex.; two stepdaughters, Susan Kish and Nadine  Jones, both of Dana Point; one granddaughter and one step-granddaughter.LEN  HALL  </P></p>

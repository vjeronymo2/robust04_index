			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Lebanon completes poll for deputies LEBANON yesterday completed its first parliamentary elections in 20 years with a by-election that was boycotted by a majority of voters. The turnout at elections in Kesrouan, the coastal strip north of Beirut, was estimated at less than 15 per cent. Mr Nasrallah Sfeir, the Maronite patriarch, and a coalition of right-wing Maronite Catholics, had called on the 80,000 registered voters to boycott the poll. While most Christian Maronite voters backed the call, the extent of the boycott is unclear. The five winning candidates will join the 128-member parliament when it convenes for the first time on Friday. Ten thousand Lebanese army troops and police were despatched to Kesrouan to ensure security during the vote. They manned checkpoints at all main intersections and searched cars for weapons. Advocates of the boycott claim the newly-elected parliament has no legitimacy while 35,000 Syrian troops remain in Lebanon. The Lebanese Opposition Front, established last week, is demanding the dissolution of the legislature. Those who took part in the election pointed out there are no Syrian troops in Kesrouan. Three of the Opposition Front's four Maronite leaders, including the rebel general Michel Aoun, live in France. Much of Kesrouan was bombarded by Gen Aoun's forces in the inter-Christian war he started in 1990, but the exiled officer is popular here. The region is the seat of the Maronite patriarchate and is regarded by many Maronites as the heart of Lebanon. The Kesrouan parliamentary elections, which were originally scheduled for August 30, were postponed when all candidates withdrew. The participation of 24 candidates in yesterday's poll was a blow to the prestige of the patriarch. The mountain village of Raifoun is home both to Patriarch Sfeir and one of the more prominent candidates, his cousin, Mr Henri Sfeir. Mr Sfeir resisted pressure from his clan and the church to renounce his candidacy. 'People here are torn between allegiance to the church and political pragmatism,' said a brother of the candidate. 'How can we make our voice heard if we have no seats in parliament?' In an election based on feudal family loyalties, the list led by Mr Fares Bweiz, the former foreign minister, appeared likely to win most of the five seats.</p>

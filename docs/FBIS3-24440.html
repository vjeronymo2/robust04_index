			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by O. Osipenko, general director of Rinkon </F> consulting company and president of Audeks auditing firm, and M.  Margolin, director of the EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN Economic and Legal  Consultation and Business Information Agency's legal center:  "State Privatization Program: Internal Contradictions"]    [Text] The State Program of Privatization of State and  Municipal Enterprises went into effect beginning 1 January. One  has to admit with regret, however, that the long-awaited and  finally adopted state program has inherited two main  shortcomings from its 1992 predecessor. Namely, failure to  describe the main mechanisms for implementation of a score of  requirements defined in a most general form, and obvious and  hidden contradictions.    Without claiming an exhaustive analysis of the document, we  would like to offer some comments on individual provisions of  the state privatization program.  <H5>  I. Buyout of Land Lots </H5>   The most impressive example of imperfections of the former  kind is the remaining uncertainty in the matter of buyout of  land lots by privatized enterprises. Can one use privatization  vouchers for buyouts? If so, to what extent (along with rubles)?  In what form should one apply and what is the time frame for  review? Which precise property fund (oblast, rayon) is the  seller? (The state program mentions "corresponding property  funds.") What are the procedures for interaction between rayon  and city land use committees and property funds in the buyout  process? Does an enterprise acquired in the process of  privatization as a single property complex won in a bid or at  auction have the right to buy out the land lot? (It is easy to  see that the existing norm in the current law, duplicated by  Article 5.3.7. of the state program--regarding the requirement  that more than 80 percent of shares of privatized enterprise  must be first sold for vouchers--covers only facilities  converted to joint-stock holding.) The answers to these and many  similar questions remain up in the air. As do the proclamations  of the official ideologists of privatization of enhancing its  attractiveness through state emission of "land privatization  vouchers."  <H5>  II. Reorganization of Enterprises Undergoing Privatization </H5>   Neither are many practical problems of privatization removed  by another provision literally borrowed from current economic  legislation--that structural subunits are not permitted to be  separated from privatized enterprises (with the potential  autonomous privatization of these subunits) if they constitute  "a single technological complex." Skipping the interpretation of  the latter notion, the program provides poor aid to the work of  commissions on arbitration of disputes between state enterprises  and their subunits, which currently act under the guidance of  the joint directive of the Russian Federation GKI [State  Committee for the Administration of State Property] and Russian  Federation GKAP [State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and  Support of New Economic Structures] No. LB 4953 and No. 1898-r,  dated 3 November 1993.  <H5>  III. Sale of Equity (Interest, Shares) Owned by the State </H5>   Despite outward operational simplicity, the problem of  privatizing state equity in partnerships and joint-stock  companies of mixed form of ownership is still shrouded in  mystery. Article 5.2 of the program says that the corresponding  state equity (blocks of stock) must be sold through auctions and  bids. Meanwhile, the procedures for holding them remain unclear,  as also the forms and time frame within which the winners in  these actions and bids must pay for this interest, information  support for this procedure, who may initiate privatization of  state-owned equity in joint ventures, limited liability  partnerships, joint-stock companies, and so on. It is indicative  that this is the only privatization method of those included in  the general list that has not received any comments in the text  of Part 5 of the state program.  <H3>  IV. Status of Property Contributions By State Enterprises In  the Charter Capital of Other Enterprises </H3>   Comparison of the previous (1992) and current texts of the  privatization program show that its authors no longer insist  that state enterprises' contributions to the charter capital  (funds) of enterprises of any organizational-legal form be  considered state property and property funds--their legal  successors (Paragraphs 4 and 6 of Article 5.1 of the 1992 state  program). It is clear that this provision obviously contradicted  Article 14 of the RSFSR Law "On Property in the RSFSR," the  methodology of appraising state enterprises' property in  determining the size of charter capital (Decree No. 66 of the  Russian Federation President dated 29 January 1992) and standard  privatization plan. However, the problems that have emerged as a  result of applying this provision of the old state program last  year, for instance, are thereby not resolved at all. The  corresponding interest in "business type" enterprises, which at  the insistence of some committees and property funds was not  included in appraisals, quite often is still carried on  joint-stock companies' books. The conundrum of this situation is  that now the legal base for transferring the rights to these  contributions (blocks of shares) to property funds is absent.  The property has in a way ended up in neverland: On one hand, it  is not recognized as the property of the AOOT's [publicly held  joint-stock company], which are the legal successors of state  enterprises; on the other, it has not been really transferred to  the funds, which in addition have lost the prospects for a  legally documented transfer of the corresponding rights.    From the examples above one may draw the following  conclusions. Either the state program's authors assumed in  advance that this document cannot, and should not, be a  direct-action normative act; or they deliberately gave carte  blanche to regional committees and property funds to engage in  various sorts of improvisations.    It should be noted that the former hypothesis is only  partially supported. Thereby giving legitimacy to the latter.  Really, the state program assumes, for instance, that giving  officials of bodies of state administration the role of  representing the interests of the state in joint-stock  companies' boards of directors, the procedures for maintaining  the stockholder register, and the procedure for preparation and  conduct of a general shareholder meeting of a publicly held  joint-stock company are to be spelled out in special statutes  drafted and approved by the Russian State Committee for the  Administration of State Property or with its direct  participation. One would think that if we just have patience and  wait for the issuance of these administrative acts, complete  harmony will come to reign in matters of the mechanism of  implementing the corresponding requirements of the state  program. Alas, this is only a first glance and incorrect  impression. No matter how perfect from the standpoint of  corresponding procedures these documents may end up being, their  authors clearly will attempt to keep them from contradicting the  main text of the state program. Thus frequently driving future  executors up a normative dead end of sorts.  <H3>  V. Joint-Stock Company Administrative Bodies. Stockholders  General Meeting </H3>   Let us pay attention, for instance, to the fact that the  first of the aforementioned statutes, whose development is  envisaged by Point 3 of Article 2.3 of the state program, will  include the institution of representing the holder of the  controlling share of stock in a joint-stock company--the  state--for some reason only on the board of directors. At the  same time, the procedures for their participation in general  meetings of stockholders apparently remained undefined. The same  is confirmed, by the way, by another provision of the same point  of the state program, which says that officials of bodies of  state administration will represent the interests of the state  in the boards of directors on a contract basis. Does it follow  from this that the right to vote for the corresponding share of  stock may be given to other functionaries of corresponding  departments? Can the state be represented at general  stockholders meetings, in the event the controlling share of  stock is "frozen" in state ownership up to three years, by, for  instance, representatives of holding companies or FPGs  [financial-industrial group] operating in the same sectors as  the joint-stock company? Answers to these and similar questions  apparently take us into the sphere of rather creative  interpretations of the program. In any case, the second  provision of Article 11.4 ("Representatives of the  administration and employees of joint-stock companies cannot act  as representatives of the state at shareholders meetings and on  the board of directors") appears to mean, after all,  representatives of this particular joint-stock company.    The latter assumption, however, is based only on a common  sense judgment. Unfortunately, the program authors, while  including in it some mandatory provisions, clearly forgot about  this. This involves, in particular, such requirements enumerated  in Point 9 as mandatory mailing to participants in the general  shareholder meeting materials on the meeting agenda, including  ballots for voting in elections of the audit commission.    The point is that by its legal and commercial nature, most  plans for shareholder meetings are of a confidential nature  (first and foremost with respect to setting up new enterprises  on a shared basis with other partners; board of directors and  audit commission's reports, which enumerate joint-stock company  clients; some especially sensitive intra-company provisions;  etc.). Thus, in attempting to "protect shareholders' rights" in  the form of the utmost openness, according to the logic of the  state program the joint-stock company's executive bodies must  deliberately put themselves in conflict with investors and  partners in cooperation.    As to the requirement of mailing electoral ballots for the  audit commission's election (assuming, of course, that they will  not be blank forms, which would be absurd), this is technically  impossible altogether. As is known, current legislation does not  contain any restrictions regarding stockholders' rights to be  nominated for membership in this control body of the joint-stock  company. For instance, current legislation does not have the  requirement that the written consent of the nominee must be  obtained and the nomination procedure completed one week before  the meeting (unlike, for instance, nominations to the board of  directors). Which means that stockholders may nominate their  representatives to the audit commission right at the meeting.  What is the point then in mailing the ballots home?    Another item that clearly contradicts common sense and  current legislation is the restriction contained in Point 9.10.6  of the state program with respect to converting publicly held  joint-stock companies into privately held joint-stock companies  and limited liability partnerships (and all publicly held  companies at that, not only successors to state-owned  enterprises); and the quotas on membership of outside investors  in their boards of directors. The point is not that these bans  are easy to circumvent (which is precisely what happens in  practice). The issue is whether we should expect much of the  provisions in the state program given that they have absorbed  the norms launched into legislative orbit in total disregard of  the entire sum of other current legislative acts, as well as  stockholders' true--not perceived--interests.    The answer to the latter question suggests that as in  1992-1993, committees for the administration of property,  property funds, working privatization commissions, as well as  executive bodies of joint-stock companies will have to resort to  quite major improvisations in using the norms of the document  under review.    Essentially, one is led to this conclusion also by direct  contradictions within the state program, of an internal nature,  and the different interpretations that are inevitable in  comparing it with other normative acts.    An example. According to Article 17.5 of the state program,  activities of unregistered financial-industrial groups are not  permitted. Meanwhile, this does not follow from the main  document regulating the process of creation of FPGs--Edict No.  2096 of the Russian Federation President of 5 December 1993. The  functioning of full-fledged FPGs, a long as they do not claim  the right to use in their company name the words  "financial-industrial group," and the corresponding state  preferences for those that have been approved by the State  Committee on Industry, is not forbidden at all.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 12 (XINHUA) -- The United States  today refused to recognize the new Haitian president installed  by that country's military on Wednesday, dismissing the action  as "purely illegitimate."    State Department Spokesman Mike McCurry told a news briefing  that it was clearly "an illegitimate act by this rump group in  Haiti."    The Haitian military arranged for their allies in parliament  to install on Wednesday 80-year-old Supreme Court Justice Emil  Jonassaint as that country's head of state to replace exiled  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.    The Organization of American States (OAS) issued on  Wednesday  night a strong declaration condemning the Haitian military's  action as "contrary to the majority will of the Haitian people."    "Any action taken by the illegitimate government, including  any call to elections, will be deemed entirely invalid," the  declaration said.    McCurry said the OAS declaration is "a united statement on  behalf of the hemisphere which categorically rejects the actions  that have been taken by this rump group in attempting to install  an illegitimate provisional president in Haiti."    "I think the standing of the UN Security Council resolutions  in effect," he said. "The purpose of the world community is to  restore President Aristide and restore democracy to Haiti."    "That is the purpose of the sanctions that have been in  place  and that are now going to be put in place in an even stronger  fashion," McCurry added.</p>

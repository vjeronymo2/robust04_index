			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POPLINE: MIDGE URE WRITES A 'DEAR GOD' LETTER; A SONG ON THE LINE FROM THEY  MIGHT BE GIANTS; TRACIE SPENCER, 13, A REAL TEEN.  </P> <P> Pop radio has suddenly become a prime medium for addressing deity. First there  was XTC's less-than-reverent "Dear God," a hostile open letter to a nonexistent  Supreme Being and a bitter tract of faithlessness in a hostile universe.  </P> <P> Now, somewhat less abrasively and more commercially, comes the first American  solo hit from Midge Ure: a more upbeat anthem also titled "Dear God" --  strictly coincidence, according to Ure.  </P> <P> "The XTC thing?" said the unfailingly polite Scotsman, on a recent visit to  town. "I wasn't aware of it at all until last week. The record company played  me a cassette of it. It's a very good song. It's a bit more cynical than mine,  but a similar sort of sentiment, except mine was more questioning and theirs  was a bit more sort of a statement."  </P> <P> Indeed, whereas XTC's attitude was defiantly atheistic, Ure comes off as  hopefully agnostic, petitioning the God Who May Be There for "a worldwide  religion . . . hope for the children . . . peace in a restless world."  </P> <P> It's not a surprising posture, given that Ure was the co-writer with Bob Geldof  of the original charity sing-along, Band Aid's "Do They Know It's Christmas?,"  and a prime mover behind the Live Aid and FreedomFest benefit concerts.  </P> <P> Not that he thinks this request for a "worldwide religion" is in any danger of  being delivered soon.  </P> <P> "It's a tall order," he admitted. "I've a real problem with religion. I find it  very, very bizarre that someone's god is better than anybody else's god so they  end up killing each other over it.  </P> <P> "Where I come from, there's a real inbred bigotry. Glasgow's very similar to  Belfast. You don't choose your religion, you're born into it. And I thought  that everyone in Britain felt the same way -- like a Catholic girl couldn't  marry into a Protestant boy's family, and a Catholic football team couldn't  have a Protestant player. It wasn't until I moved away that I realized that not  everybody felt that way."  </P> <P> More such weighty world topics are to be found on Ure's second solo album,  "Answers to Nothing." The reasons for his heightened consciousness? "I don't  think that the whole Band Aid/Live Aid saga started me off on all the things  that I've written about on the album. But having a baby certainly did. I never  particularly worried about (world problems) for myself or for other people, but  there's a whole new responsibility that I never dreamed of before, and you do  start to worry."

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast: Video report from Semipalatinsk </F> test site by S. Polyayev, identified by caption]    [Text] [161043] [Polyayev over video of posters and bust  of Academician Kurchatov followed by a wall chart of  Semipalatinsk test site] Russia is prepared to extend the  moratorium on nuclear tests. In connection with this it is  envisaged that all Russian scientists will have left the nuclear  test site in Semipalatinsk by the beginning of July.  Incidentally, right now only 20 percent of the original number  of servicing personnel remain at the site. This is insufficient  to maintain the site properly and to ensure its security.  [video shows dilapidated buildings, followed by extensive  aerial views of test site captioned "Video material supplied by  Moscow Office of TBS"] At the insistence of the Kazakhstani Air  Force, helicopter flights over the nuclear facilities without a  special permit are banned. The last authorized flight took  place 13 February this year.    Despite the high level of radioactivity at the test site,  the  facilities are not being guarded. Furthermore, the local  authorities are seriously considering setting up a livestock  farm on the territory of the site. The military also fear that  abandoned equipment and cables, which could constitute a  radioactive hazard, may be removed by pilferers. An unexploded  nuclear charge which remains in one of the galleries also  presents a threat. It cannot be defused because there are no  specialists, and it cannot be exploded.

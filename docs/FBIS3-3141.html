			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by station reporter Ren Yongming; from the "News" </F> program]    [Text] Deputies from Tibet to the Second Session of the  Eighth National People's Congress continued deliberation of  Premier Li Peng's government work report on 14 and 15 March.  They held in- depth discussions focusing on Tibet's reform,  opening up, foreign trade, and education for this year; and  maintain that Tibet must pay keen attention to the two major  issues of development and stability, and must subordinate the  work in all fields to the overall interests of seizing the  opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting  development, and maintaining stability [the 20-character  principle], thereby actively and prudently pressing reform and  opening up ahead in an all-round manner and creatively  implementing the central authorities' guidelines.    Minister Song Defu and Vice Minister Zhang Zhijian of  personnel; Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic  cooperation; and Liu Bin, vice minister in charge of the State  Education Commission; attended the discussions to hear deputies'  opinions and answer their questions.    NPC deputies Chen Kuiyuan, secretary of the regional party  committee; Raidi, Standing Committee member and deputy secretary  of the regional party committee and chairman of the regional  people's congress Standing Committee; and Yang Chuangtang and  Luosang Toinzhub, vice chairmen of the regional government,  spoke at the discussions. They emphasized: Development and  stability are two major issues for Tibet. To accomplish the  various tasks of this year, we must correctly handle the  relations among reform, development, and stability. Reform is  the motive force for economic development; development is the  foundation for stability; and stability is the prerequisite for  reform and development. To correctly grasp and handle the  relations among these three issues in the light of the overall  situation is crucial for the success of this year's work. In  spite of mounting difficulties on the road of establishing a  socialist market economic system in Tibet, we must resolutely  implement the 20-character principle to serve the interests of  the overall situation. We must take the overall interests into  account and, in line with the principle of "three conducive's,"  go all out to proceed everything from reality and to work hard  and conscientiously to achieve concrete results. Currently we  should further solve deep-rooted problems of ideology and  understanding, especially such problems among leading cadres;  and should correctly handle the relations among the maintenance  of social stability, the acceleration of reform and opening up,  and the pace of economic development. We should also correctly  handle the relations between self-reliance and hard work on the  one hand and support and assistance from the state and fraternal  provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions on the other;  as well as the relations between economic and social benefits.  We should get mobilized immediately and, based on the  capability of each locality, department, or unit, work hard and  conscientiously to continually scale new heights in Tibet's  reform and opening up.    The deputies concluded: In invigorating Tibet's economy, we  should continue to promote agriculture and animal husbandry, and  more importantly, break the region's self-confinement and open  it to the outside world.    Song Defu, Wu Yi, Liu Bin, and other officials answered  questions raised by deputies on Tibet's institutional reform,  foreign trade, and education. They said: The party Central  Committee and the State Council have shown great concern for  Tibet, and have stressed the need to support and assist the work  in Tibet. Under the new circumstances of a socialist market  economic structure and while continuing to implement the central  authorities' preferential policies for Tibet, new preferential  policies in keeping with the new situation have been studied and  formulated. The central authorities have begun investigations  of problems raised by deputies from Tibet. Efforts are being  made to resolve most of the problems.    The officials unanimously pledged to do everything possible  to solve Tibet's problems. Meanwhile, they urged Tibet to seize  the opportunity; further promote reform and opening up; and make  ample flexible, and effective use of the central authorities'  preferential policies for Tibet to push its economy to a new  stage of development.</p>

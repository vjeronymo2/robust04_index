			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Italy's Christian Democrats suffer poll humiliation The political map of Italy was further shaken yesterday by the collapse of support for the long-ruling Christian Democrat party and its allies in partial municipal elections. According to usually reliable exit polls, the Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi strengthened its hold in northern Italy, and the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) managed to forge a successful series of alliances throughout the country. At the same time, Christian Democrat votes and those of its three other allies that form the basis of the Ciampi government's parliamentary majority  -the Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals - switched in central and southern Italy to the neo-fascist MSI. In Sicily this vote switched to the progressive Catholic movement, La Rete (The Network) of Mr Leoluca Orlando. Mr Orlando, on the basis of exit polls, looked set to be the sole mayoral candidate to achieve an absolute majority on the first round. Campaigning on a clean government and anti-Mafia ticket, this represented a huge vote against corruption and organised crime. Yesterday's municipal elections involved 1.1m voters, almost a quarter of the electorate, in 428 towns and cities. The Christian Democrat vote dropped in many places to below 10 per cent, compared to almost 30 per cent in previous polls. The result is likely to increase pressure for early general elections in the first quarter of next year. It is also likely to put pressure on Mr Mino Martinazzoli to resign from the Christian Democrat leadership. Under new laws approved in March, mayoral candidates have to get an absolute majority in the first round or face a run-off on December 5. The run-off in Naples will be between the PDS alliance and the MSI, whose candidate is Alessandra Mussolini, grand-daughter of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini.

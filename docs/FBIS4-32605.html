			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic from Bihac] </F>   [Text] The defense lines on the Bihac and Bosanska Krupa  fronts as well as on the Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau have been  exposed to incessant Chetnik shelling and sniper fire.    As for the members of Abdic's traitor phalange, there has  been no change from the usual, despite the successive defeats  suffered by that rebel scum. Last night they launched barbaric  attacks straight after Fikret Abdic -- in the steps of his hero  Radovan Karadzic -- announced some sort of a counteroffensive.  From Liskovac, Rosic, and (Crkva), they have been shelling the  newly liberated areas in the Cazin and Kladusa municipalities  and, from the Kladusa area, they have been pounding with mortars  and cannons (Golubovici), [words indistinct]. An entire  sabotage group was captured during these attacks.    Abdic's warmongering headquarters has continued to arrest  citizens in Velika Kladusa, and to terrorize them. Another  request has been sent to international organizations for help in  their protection, since these are people who do not want war and  who reject the insane ideas of the self-proclaimed Kladusa  leader.</p>

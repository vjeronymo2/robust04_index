			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Japan surplus shows modest rise JAPAN's current account surplus rose a modest 8 per cent to Dollars 11.8bn (Pounds 7.7bn) in February, as exports declined for the first time in almost three years, suggesting that the rapid expansion of the surplus may be nearing an end. The Japanese government was relieved by the relatively slim increase, and also encouraged by a 1.7 per cent rise in car sales during March, the first year-on-year expansion in nine months. Government officials are debating whether an economic recovery has begun or whether favourable statistics this week, including a rise in housing starts, are merely blips on the graph. The positive figures were balanced by a plunge in construction orders and a forecast of lower capital spending this year. The debate has complicated preparations for an emergency economic package, which the ruling Liberal Democratic Party boasts will be 'the biggest ever', while the Finance Ministry, conscious of a fall in tax receipts, appears to have something more modest in mind. Japan has promised the US it will stimulate growth, and the package will be watched closely in Washington, as the economic downturn was blamed for an increase in exports and decline in imports which produced the surge in the current account surplus. The Finance Ministry said the overall balance of payments for February showed a surplus of Dollars 1.3bn, down from Dollars 15.6bn a year earlier, while the deficit in invisible trade fell 85 per cent to Dollars 186m. In the long-term capital account, Japanese net sales of foreign bonds were Dollars 3.7bn, a sharp turnaround from net purchases of Dollars 1.6bn in January, and net sales of foreign stocks were Dollars 345m, up from Dollars 18m. The figures reflected the repatriation of funds before the close of fiscal year last month. Foreigners' net purchases of Japanese stocks were Dollars 249m, compared to Dollars 131m, and net sales of bonds were Dollars 510m, against Dollars 2.6bn in the previous month. The ministry expects stocks purchases to jump in March, as the return of foreign investors has spurred Tokyo prices over the past two weeks. Meanwhile, the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said the increase in new cars was due to renewed demand for cheaper models. Sales of passenger cars, excluding mini-cars, rose 3.4 per cent, but sales of trucks were still weak, down 2.4 per cent, reflecting curbs on capital investment by most manufacturers.</p>

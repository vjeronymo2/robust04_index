			<p>BFN     [Text] On 14 May, the Baku police blockaded the building  belonging to the AZADLYG independent newspaper and demanded that  the newspaper's employees leave it. The police threatened to  throw in the street all property of the edition, including  computers, if its employees did not leave the building  voluntarily.    The police stated that the measure had been carried out  under  the order of Baku Mayor Rafael Allakhverdiyev.    The Baku Mayor's Office refused to comment on the decision  of  the mayor saying he was not present at the office.    The AZADLYG was the newspaper of the Azerbaijani People's  Front (now in the opposition) before summer, 1993. Now the  newspaper reflects the point of view of the opposition and the  Azerbaijani People's Front remains one of its sponsors.    On the same day the Turan independent news agency and  several  other editions which occupy the same building with the AZADLYG  were demanded to leave it.    Editor of the AZADLYG newspaper Gyundyuz Tairli told  journalists that he considered the actions by the police a a new  wave of oppressions against independent media.</p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RULING PAVES WAY FOR DUTIES ON PHONE EQUIPMENT  </P> <P> The International Trade Commission has ruled that certain South Korean  telephone equipment being sold on the U.S. market at less than cost was  injuring American firms, paving the way for the imposition of duties on  shipments.  </P> <P> The vote cast on Monday was tied at 3-3, but the commission voted in favor of  the plaintiffs, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and Comdial Corp., based  in Charlottesville, Va.  </P> <P> Commerce Department investigators had found earlier that the equipment was  being dumped and imposed temporary duties pending a finding by the ITC, an  non-governmental body that monitors adherence to U.S. trade law.  </P> <P> Similar anti-dumping duties were imposed in November on small business  telephone systems and subassemblies shipped from Japan and Taiwan after the ITC  found firms in those nations were also selling equipment at less than fair  price.  </P> <P> South Korean firms, led by Samsung and Goldstar, sold about $58 million worth  of the equipment in the United States in the first six months of last year.  </P></p>

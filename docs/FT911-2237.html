			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: Bondholders in TWA win court order A US District court judge has ruled that bondholders at Trans World Airlines are entitled to repossess at least 10 aircraft, together with some additional jet engines, as a result of the carrier's failure to meet payments on certain notes. Connecticut National Bank, trustee for the relevant notes, would not comment on the ruling. But TWA said it had proposed a settlement which would involve the outstanding interest and a moratorium on the outstanding principal until February 1992, which it hoped would be accepted. The investors brought an action against the carrier last month, after negotiations to reschedule payments on the notes failed to reach a conclusion. TWA, which made heavy losses in 1990 and has amassed debts of Dollars 2.5bn, failed to meet payment on some of its bondholder debt in February. Judge Gerard Goettel's ruling, which followed a hearing last week, acknowledged that 'by forcing TWA to turn over the property, its ability to serve consumers may well be diminished and there may also be a threat to the jobs of TWA employees.' There has been much debate about TWA's future recently, with its owner, Mr Carl Icahn, anxious to sell its London routes to American Airlines for Dollars 445m, while West Coast investor, Mr Kirk Kerkorian, offered to buy the entire airline if it retained those routes. The US Department of Transportation approved the sale of the three main London routes last week, but TWA's unions and the city of St Louis have now filed an appeal against this decision. TWA said it would not accept less than Dollars 445m for the sale of the three routes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] More Jordanians have arrived from Yemen at Queen  Alia Airport, where the prime minister was on hand to welcome  them back. Details in the following report by Kassab Samawi:    [Begin recording] [Samawi] Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam  al-Majali led the welcoming party at the airport for 117  Jordanian and other Arab nationals who arrived from Sanaa this  evening aboard a Royal Jordanian Airlines plane. The prime  minister shook hands with each of the Jordanians and Arabs.    [Al-Majali] As you know, his majesty the king is  particularly  sensitive to humanitarian issues, as much with regard to  non-Jordanians as Jordanians. Of course, in this case, given  that there is a large number of Jordanians in Yemen, his majesty  ordered that military and civilian planes be sent to evacuate  whoever wished to be evacuated, particularly women and children.  Four planes have thus far made the trip there and back. We are  in constant contact with our ambassador in Sanaa to keep us  posted. His majesty ordered that medicines be dispatched to  Yemen. A well-trained and well-equipped medical team has  travelled to Yemen to help out. [end recording]</p>

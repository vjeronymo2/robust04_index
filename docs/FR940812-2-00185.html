			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In taking the interim action described in this letter, the NRC staff wishes to emphasize that, while use of the specific voltage-based repair methods described herein is approved as an acceptable short-term measure for dealing with ODSCC tube degradation, this action should not be construed to discourage the use by licensees of better or further refined data acquisition techniques, eddy current technology, and eddy current data analysis as they become available; and the staff strongly encourages the industry to continue its efforts to improve the nondestructive examination of steam generator tubes. The staff continues to believe that inspection methods and repair criteria based on physical dimensions (e.g., length and depth) of defects are the most desirable when they can be achieved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 1. Overview of the Voltage Repair Limit Approach <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In order to use the voltage repair criteria, licensees should complete the following actions: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=2 --> _Perform an enhanced inspection of tubes, particularly at the tube support plate (TSP) intersections, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Utilize nondestructive examination (NDE) data acquisition and analysis procedures that are consistent with the methodology used to develop the voltage-based repair limits, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Repair or plug tubes that exceed the voltage limits, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Determine the beginning of cycle voltage distribution, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Project the end-of-cycle (EOC) distribution,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _For the projected EOC voltage distribution, calculate leakage and conditional burst probability (and repair additional tubes if necessary). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 2. Generic Letter Applicability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The criteria in this generic letter are only applicable to ODSCC located at the tube-to-tube support plate intersections in Westinghouse designed steam generators. These criteria are not applicable to other forms of steam generator tube degradation, nor are they applicable to ODSCC that occurs at other locations within a steam generator. The voltage-based repair criteria can be applied only under the following constraints: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The repair criteria of this generic letter apply only to Westinghouse designed steam generators with 1.9 cm [3/4 inch] and 2.2 cm [7/8 inch] diameter tubes and drilled hole tube support plates, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The repair criteria of this generic letter apply only to predominantly axially oriented ODSCC confined within the tube-to-tube support plate intersection (refer to Section 1.a of Enclosure 1 for further guidance) and, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Certain intersections are excluded from the application of the voltage-based repair criteria as discussed in Section 1.b of Enclosure 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 3.

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: IMI bullish on foreign demand for share issue Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the Italian treasury-controlled financial services group which is due to be privatised this month, believes foreign institutions would like to buy about three times the amount of shares allocated to them. Soundings by SG Warburg, the UK merchant bank, and IMI, which are together co-ordinating the privatisation, have so far indicated foreign institutions want to buy almost 300m shares. The offer, to raise up to L2,200bn (Dollars 1.29bn), involves selling 200m shares - a third of IMI's capital. About half will go abroad, some 75m to Italian private investors and the balance to Italian institutions. Pricing will be revealed on January 29 and the sale will start two days later. The bullish oversubscription forecast, made by a senior official, came on the first day of roadshows to illustrate the deal to international investors. Mr Mario Draghi, the director general of the treasury, which directly or indirectly holds about 90 per cent of the shares being sold, said the state would dispose of its entire stake within a number of years. Following the privatisation, it will hold about 30 per cent of IMI against just over 60 per cent at present. Mr Draghi warned that a bigger first tranche would risk swamping the market ahead of other privatisations, beginning with Banca Commerciale Italiana on February 28. However, some analysts believe the caution stems partly from concern to stop Cariplo, the Milan-based savings bank, gaining control of IMI too cheaply. Cariplo already has 8 per cent of IMI and has said it will raise its stake to the 10 per cent limit. However, that limit is only valid until October 1996, after which it could be abolished provided enough big shareholders agree. In that case, Cariplo, which tried unsuccessfully to buy IMI directly from the treasury last year, might attempt to raise its stake further.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Oleksandr Moroz, newly elected chairman of the </F> Supreme Council, in Kiev -- live]    [Text] Esteemed people's deputies. Dear compatriots.  Guests present in this hall.    Frankly speaking, I was not preparing any throne speech for  today. What I want is just to share my thoughts and  contemplations following this thing that has just occurred,  after you have entrusted me to lead the top power body in  Ukraine, the top legislative body.    The feelings that I now am filled with, if formulated in one  word, can be expressed by the word responsibility -- a burden of  huge responsibility for what I am supposed to do in order to  make the work of the Supreme Council productive and to the  benefit the working people, the overwhelming majority of the  population of Ukraine. At the same time I understand that this  is your responsibility as well, because having cast your votes  in my favor you put your trust not only in me, but you also put  your trust in the fact that your hopes would come true, as far  as the organization of work is concerned, as far as defending  those principles which let you receive the people's deputy  mandates are concerned.    Nevertheless, I hope that we shall manage to demonstrate in  the Supreme Council building a possibility of society's  consolidation and accord for the sake of overcoming that  extremely difficult situation our state finds itself in today.  Being aware of the fact that different methods and different  arguments are used during the debate and having taken part in  these debates for four years now, I understand that not all the  arguments could be agreed to. And I saw where they were  substantiated and where they were not quite substantiated.    For example, I have long shown sincere respect for my  colleague Mykhaylo Kosiv. I know that he referred to Taras  Hryhorovych [Shevchenko -- 19th century Ukrainian poet] because,  as a matter of fact, he had nothing else to refer to, because I  know that he loves Shevchenko, but there is no monopoly for this  love. I believe that everyone has the right to this love. I  also love Shevchenko, the same way as he does, and I know that  nonetheless, I quoted literally what Taras Hryhorovych was  saying. If anyone has doubts, open Holodnyy Yar [Cold Ravine]  in the Kobzar. If necessary, I can further quote what is  written there but it is not this that matters.    Nevertheless, I want us to step over something which can  disunite us. Because we are different, this is true. We are  different people of different convictions. The only thing which  unites us is Ukraine.    Before the voting and earlier, and afterwards as well,  people  were coming up to me and asking: What kind of state will it be?  What shall we build? I referred those who never read, for  example, some political declarations by different political  forces, including the one which supported me during the election  The first thesis of principle written there is Ukraine's  independence and the building of the Ukrainian state. I  understand that the building of the Ukrainian state should not  apply pressure on the needs and interests of either a separate  individual or a working collective. People should feel free in  a free state. This should be backed up by both a strong legal  basis and an economic basis; both social and cultural issues  should be solved. All this can be done if we show in real terms  that we can work together, that there is unity in our lofty  collective. And I hope that we shall come to agreement despite  the contradictions which do exist, which is only natural.  Because such is society and this is natural for any society.    I believe that without wasting much time on the formation  of the Supreme Council structures, we must immediately get down  to the formation of the government. And I would like to share  my thoughts with you in this connection.    We should not wait for the re-election of the president or  even the entire procedure. People are waiting for specific  actions today. And I am convinced that if we fail to find a  candidate for premier who would be supported by the Supreme  Council, I am convinced that the Supreme Council will support  one in several months time, when the election takes place, if it  does. Because, true, the executive structure should be formed  today to be at the top of the entire executive branch, because  there is no other way out today.    Besides, we should coordinate certain norms of the already  existing law and work out new ones so that we could link all the  executive power in the state, so that both at the village  council and at the Supreme Council we could feel that a single  mechanism is working and that it is working for the lofty goal  of building a (?united) state capable of defending itself and  its interests in the world community.    And undoubtedly when I am speaking about consolidation of  the  Supreme Council deputies I understand that there should be  consolidation of the top power structures in the state as well.  There can be different approaches, but different approaches have  value when they are truly reasonable and when they lead to  consolidating society and achieving those interests which will  today satisfy the needs of a specific individual -- a citizen of  Ukraine -- in real terms. And in connection with this, it seems  to me that there is a possibility today to bring together the  people in the authority structures -- in the president's team,  in the government which we shall form, and in the Supreme  Council -- and, despite everything, to work in one direction, so  that there would be no contradictions which do not benefit  society and the state whatsoever.    I believe that even yesterday's speeches by the contenders  and their discussion testify to the fact that our Supreme  Council has sufficient potential. We shall increase it later  on, when those deputies which the Supreme Council is evidently  lacking -- and we feel this -- are elected at by-elections. We  do need a stable Supreme Council which would conduct its course  regardless of the upheavals which may occur in society. And I  believe that we can work out programs toward that end which  would ensure Ukraine's breakthrough in the implementation of  those priorities which we feel we have today. Yesterday and  today they were correct to mention these priorities as far as  the economy is concerned -- the development of the  agroindustrial complex and the solution to the power engineering  problems.    But above all -- I again refer to this issue -- probably the  very sense of the work by the Supreme Council chairman is, as I  see it, first and foremost, accord, consolidation, patience,  tolerance, and the belief that we shall build a better life.  But we shall build it only if all of us together, everywhere  and everyone, no matter where our country's citizen works --  either as an industrial or agricultural worker, a farmer, or a  deputy to the Supreme Council -- it is necessary for us to work  for one goal. And then, I think, all that we have been dreaming  about during the election campaign and, probably, in the last  days, will come true. I wish this to happen and believe me,  every constructive opinion, every reasonable opinion which  sounds in this hall will go through my conscience, through my  heart, and I am convinced that this will promote consolidation  and the constructive nature of our work, of our responsible  activity.    I am very much grateful to all of you. And, no matter what  is the course of events, later on I will always remember that  these people in this hall entrusted me with huge responsibility  and pinned their hopes on me, the hopes of the Ukrainian people.  Thank you.</p>

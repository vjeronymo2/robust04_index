			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BARSTOW;  </P> <P> WOMAN SLAIN IN ROBBERY ATTEMPT  </P> <P> Authorities sought four youths described by police as "big-city gang types"  after two employees at a check-cashing business in Barstow were shot, one  fatally, in a robbery attempt. The gunmen approached two women and two children  shortly after the women had closed the Any Kind Check Cashing office downtown,  police said. The gunmen demanded money, then shot both women, said Sgt. Wayne  Ecker. The children were not hurt, and it was not clear whether the four  assailants escaped with any cash. "We have homicides," Ecker said. "But I can't  think of anything that was this cold-blooded." Loretta Abeyta-Chabira, 22, was  declared dead at Barstow Community Hospital after the shooting. The other  employee, Phyllis Padilla, was listed in critical but stable condition at the  same hospital.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Higher State Security prosecutor has decided to  hold Ibrahim Sharaf, member of the Guidance Bureau of the Muslim  Brotherhood, in custody for 15 days pending investigation. He  also decided to hold in custody for 15 days the following Muslim  Brotherhood members: Hajj As'ad Zahran from Damietta; Sayyid  al-Naqqas from al-Gharbiyah; Muhammad 'Amarah from al-Minufiyah;  Muhammad Suwaydan from Damanhur; Dr. Muhammad Sufani from  al-Jizah, Ahmad 'Awad, assistant professor at Hulwan Engineering  School; and Mustafa Isma'il, chairman of the Shari'ah Society in  Bulaq.    The prosecutor also ordered the arrest of Dr. Hilmi  al-Jazzar, a Muslim Brotherhood leader who has stayed in Saudi  Arabia after performing the pilgrimage rites.    The State Security Intelligence Department arrested these  Muslim Brotherhood leaders on the basis of reports that they  have planned and financed terrorist operations.    Muslim Brotherhood sources said that the arrested leaders  are  innocent and added that this security move is meant to be an  excuse to exclude the Muslim Brotherhood from the national  dialogue.</p>

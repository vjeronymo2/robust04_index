			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A carrier's BTWACC shall be calculated in precise accordance with the rules set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forth in this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Subsidiary carrier's capital structure.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Where a carrier is a subsidiary that obtains its common-stock equity capital through a parent company, the capital structure of the subsidiary shall be used in computing the BTWACC. The subsidiary carrier's cost of common-stock equity capital, the subsidiary carrier's cost of long-term debt capital, the subsidiary carrier's cost of preferred stock capital, and the subsidiary carrier's composite statutory corporate income tax rate shall also be used in computing the BTWACC. The subsidiary carrier's cost of common-stock equity capital shall be inferred as the cost of common-stock equity capital estimated for a sample of firms having business and financial risk comparable to the subsidiary carrier when the subsidiary carrier's capital structure is used in calculating the BTWACC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comparable risk companies.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) Concurrently with the filing of the annual financial statements required under &sect;552.2, a carrier must submit for Commission approval a proxy group of companies to impute the carrier's cost of common-stock equity capital where:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The carrier is an independent company (i.e., it has no corporate parent) which issues no publicly-traded common-stock equity, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The carrier is a subsidiary that obtains its common-stock equity capital through a parent company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) After notice and opportunity for comment, the Commission will approve a proxy group of companies based on the following criteria:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The proxy companies shall be based in the United States and shall be listed in The Value Line Investment Survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The proxy companies shall operate and derive a major portion of their gross revenues primarily as common carriers in the business of freight transportation, and shall own or operate transportation vehicles or vessels. Companies with gross annual revenues equal to or less than the $25,000,000 shall be excluded from the proxy group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) In addition, comparable risk companies shall be selected by examining some, but not necessarily all, of the following risk indicators:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A company's total capitalization ratio and/or debt-to-equity ratio;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The investment quality ratings of a company's long-term debt instruments;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The investment safety ranking of a company's common-stock equity;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By GUANGMING RIBAO reporter Lin Ying (2651 5391) and XINHUA </F> reporter Zhu Youdi (2612 1635 2769)]    [Text] Beijing, 4 Feb (XINHUA) -- At a national conference  on environmental protection that closed today, State Councillor  Song Jian pointed out: It is necessary to promote the  development of China's environmental law system more quickly and  vigorously, and emphasize investigations in environmental law  enforcement this year. This is the most fundamental measure for  implementing various environmental policies and plans.    Song Jian said: To promote the development of the  environmental law system, it is first necessary to quicken and  perfect legislation, such as the enactment of regulations on  natural preserves, laws preventing solid waste pollution, and  other environmental protection laws. Meanwhile, localities  should also quickly enact local environmental protection laws.  Second, it is necessary to strengthen supervision in law  enforcement. For governments at all levels to realistically  shoulder law enforcement responsibilities, government  organizations and leaders must take the lead. Environmental  control is the government's fundamental function, while  environmental departments are representatives of the government  in enforcing environmental protection laws. This is the mission  empowered by the law, and the departments must be bold and  strict in enforcing it. If we do not undertake effective  environmental protection measures, heavy pollution will affect  people's production and lives, and it will be impossible to  maintain social stability and progress.    Song Jian said: The enforcement of environmental protection  laws will be investigated in over a dozen provinces,  municipalities, and autonomous regions this year. Localities  must also conduct their own law enforcement investigations.  These investigations should focus on checking and penalizing  serious violators of the environmental protection law.  Seriously harmful souces of pollution will be closed down,  while others will be given deadlines to undertake remedial  measures. We must also include biodiversity in our work this  year as there are many problems in this respect. We must  strengthen our control over environmental problems caused by  village and town enterprises. For example, we must not allow  the heavy pollution caused by small paper mills in the upper  reaches of the Huai He to continue.    It is learned that the "Ninth Five-Year Program" on  environmental protection as well as the 2010 long-term  environmental protection and development plan will be formulated  this year. The environmental program for adjoining regions of  Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Inner Mongolia as well as the pollution  prevention program for the Three Gorges Dam region on the Chang  Jiang will also be drawn up. In addition, comprehensive plans on  acid rain prevention will be developed. An investigation and  sewage disposal registration system will be implemented for  tertiary industries such as the catering and service sectors.  Meanwhile, environmental control in rural areas will be  strengthened; pollution caused by village and town enterprises  and its control will be investigated; and namelists of village  and town enterprises nationwide as well as regions causing  serious pollution will be announced. To further promote our  country's environmental protection work, international  cooperation will be actively sought and international  conventions, of which China is a member, will be earnestly  implemented.</p>

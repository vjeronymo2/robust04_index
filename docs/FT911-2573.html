			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Share schemes found not to alter attitudes of workforce THE INTRODUCTION of an employee share ownership scheme in a Midlands factory had virtually no effect on the attitudes of workers to their employer in its first year of operation, according to a report, writes Michael Smith. The study - by Stephen Dunn and Ray Richardson of the London School of Economics, and Philip Dewe of Massey University - is the latest in a series of papers debating the worth of companies' providing shares for their workers at less than the market rate. Some have concluded that companies with share schemes reap a reward through improved performance; others found it has no discernible effect. The report on the unnamed Midlands factory found that there had been no change in attitudes that could be attributed to the scheme. In some respects, attitudes towards the employer had deteriorated, although a dispute over a wage rise may have been largely to blame. Far fewer employees actually joined the scheme than a survey of initial interest had indicated. Of 210 employees, 26 had joined the scheme, 57 initially tempted had stayed out and 127 never considered joining. Among the first and last groups, attitudes toward the employer were broadly the same in the two surveys. However, among the group that rejected the scheme after first being tempted, there was more hostility towards the employer. 'In the event, we concluded that there had been no change in attitudes which we felt should be attributed to the scheme. If this is correct, it is hard to see how it could have had any effect on the behaviour of the employees and any significant advantages to the company,' the report says. The paper, published in Human Resource Management Journal, says the low take-up of the scheme indicates its limitations and highlights the dangers. The authors say membership often becomes the preserve of the relatively higher-paid, because workers on low incomes are unwilling to make the five or seven-year commitment necessary to take part fully. The AEU engineering union has awarded its 159 national officials a pay rise of 10 per cent.

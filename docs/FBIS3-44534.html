At the meeting, the principle of doing unified  planning with due consideration for all concerned and ensuring  major areas was reaffirmed and concrete arrangements were made  for grain allocations and transfers between provinces in the  first quarter of the year.    According to the plan worked out at the meeting, in current  grain allocations and transfers, it is necessary to implement  the principle of making unified planning with due consideration  for all concerned and ensuring major areas. The major areas to  which grain will be transferred include eight provinces which  are short of grain and three municipalities. The provinces are  Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hainan, Zhejiang,  and the eastern part of Sichuan, and the municipalities are  Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. When making arrangements for  the grain transfer, priority will be given to special grain  reserves, grain for market regulation, and grain for the  fulfillment of trade contracts.    It has been learned that for January this year, various  provinces have worked out special transportation plans, adding  140 special trains for this purpose. This has added burdens to  communications and transportation. The departments concerned  are now discussing the issue with the railroad department to  solve this problem. It is expected that in January, a plan to  transport some 700,000 metric tons of grain will be fulfilled,  including those which have already been transported, which will  be 100,000 metric tons more than the original plan. In February  and March, it is planned that a total of 4.1 million metric tons  of grain will be transported.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Intrum Justitia rises to Pounds 6m INTRUM JUSTITIA, the Dutch-based group aiming to bring respectability to debt collection, yesterday reported a 33 per cent rise in interim profits despite the slowing pace at which overdue debts are being paid. Pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 rose from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 6.11m on sales ahead 12 per cent at Pounds 40.8m. Earnings per share rose 14 per cent to 4.2p. The interim dividend is increased by 25 per cent to 1p. 'This year we will not achieve 20 per cent eps growth,' said Mr Gert van Laar, chief executive. 'In some of the company markets the deepening recession is impacting upon the success rate for collections, which is declining. This will reduce the rate of growth in profits in the short term.' In the last six months, the company has seen a 19 per cent increase to Pounds 1.2bn in the value of gross collections it is making in Europe. Mr van Laar said there was a growing awareness of the balance sheet problem many companies faced which would be good for Intrum Justitia once the European economy began to recover. The company was confident that once that recovery arrived handling times would shorten and companies would have become accustomed to using its debt collection services for slow paying accounts. It recently stepped up its campaign for creditors to be paid in full and on time by debtors; it is to spend Pounds 3m sponsoring a European entry in the 1993 Whitbread round the world yacht race under the slogan Fair Pay.</p>

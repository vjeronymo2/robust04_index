			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Bosnian Serbs set for clash with UN on relief convoy THE UN yesterday was set on a collision course with Bosnian Serb leaders after they turned back a relief convoy headed for a besieged Moslem enclave cut off from the outside world since April. In what was seen as a crucial test of a UN pledge to break through a Serb siege of Moslem enclaves, the ten-lorry convoy set off from Belgrade at dawn carrying 90 tonnes of food and medical supplies to Cerska, eastern Bosnia. But Bosnian Serb commanders said the convoy could not pass because of fighting in the area. According to The Belgrade office of the UN High Commissioner of Refugees (UNHCR), the Bosnian Serbs also claimed they had not received prior notice. The UNHCR said the convoy will try again today. The convoy was stopped even though Mr Jose Maria Mendiluce, the special UNHCR envoy, at the weekend told Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic the convoy would go ahead despite Serb opposition. Mr Karadzic demanded that a truce must be agreed before the convoy was allowed to pass. Serb commanders have shocked UN relief workers with their refusal to allow the passage of food and medical supplies for reasons ranging from personal security to accusations that the convoys are carrying smuggled weapons. Belgrade Radio yesterday reported fighting between troops in Serb-held Bratunac, on the River Drina which marks the Bosnian frontier with Serbia, and Srebrenica, a nearby Moslem stronghold. The mainly Moslem Bosnian forces in Srebrenica have tried to break the Serb stranglehold of eastern Bosnia. Mr Ljubisa Vladusic, the minister for refugee affairs in the self-styled Serb Republic of Bosnia, who attended the meeting, said: 'We said we had nothing against aid supplies for the Moslems along the Drina river but an end to the fighting was a precondition -  not just on the day and place of a convoy but a truce which would ensure the safety of the corridor.' UNHCR officials have vowed to get tough with Serbs, Croats and Moslems for undermining the deliver of emergency relief -  but have singled out Serb leaders for blocking relief to about 100,000 Moslems in eastern Bosnia. Mr Mendiluce yesterday in Sarajevo condemned the Bosnian government for its decision to boycott aid for the 380,000 people trapped in the capital out of solidarity with the besieged Moslem enclaves.

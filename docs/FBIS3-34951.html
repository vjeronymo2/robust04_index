['Arafat] I had wished that an initial agreement would be  made, as I had agreed with Mr. Peres, in the presence of my  brother, Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa. I had also wished  that this initial agreement would be followed by a final  agreement in the presence of Mr. Rabin in Cairo. We covered a  considerable distance in Davos during the world economic  conference, and before that in Oslo during the funeral of our  friend Holst, the former Norwegian foreign minister. However,  we were surprised recently by Israel's request for a further  delay of one week, after the Israeli delegation received several  telephone calls from Tel Aviv, under the pretext that they need  more time to study the draft that is under discussion.    Apparently, as has been reported by several Israeli  newspapers, primarily YEDI'OT AHARONOT, the military command has  an intransigent stand against the agreement. As a matter of  fact, the question will become one of international  responsibility rather than Palestinian responsibility. The  agreement was under President Clinton's auspices at the White  House and bears the signatures of the two cosponsors of the  conference. There was also an international blessing of the  agreement. What is happening reflects new, hard-line Israeli  positions that try to demolish the very foundations of the  agreement. These stands are being fabricated and are related to  issues that are foreign to the agreement, in letter and spirit.  International law says that the withdrawal of any occupying  power from any territory means that this territory is liberated.  This applies to Gaza and Jericho.    The current attempts to add as many texts as possible is  meant to undermine this concept in the September agreement in  Washington. It is now clear, after all that has happened in  Oslo, Paris, Davos, and Cairo, that there is an ongoing Israeli  attempt not to honor the deadlines they have agreed to, or not  to honestly implement the agreement. This is now the  responsibility of the entire international community.    [Shirbil] Do you feel that after the U.S.-Syrian Geneva  summit, Israel is no longer interested in quick progress on the  Palestinian track?    ['Arafat] No. The evidence is that there was no concrete  progress in the recent negotiations in Washington. Anyway, any  progress on any Arab track is progress on all other tracks.    [Shirbil] There has been recently more talk about  differences between Rabin and Peres.    ['Arafat] I do not take things at face value. The bottom  line is that I am facing the Israeli government, whether it is  represented by Rabin, Peres, or Baraq.    [Shirbil] It is said that arms are being distributed in Gaza  and elsewhere. What do you think?    ['Arafat] The most serious thing about this issue is that  Israeli intelligence officers, with the full knowledge of the  government, are carrying out a huge arms sales in the occupied  territories, as part of a malicious plan to ignite  inter-Palestinian fighting after their departure. Israeli Army  officers are behind the arms sales. However, I have great  confidence in our people and their awareness, struggle, faith,  and power.    [Shirbil] This means that your taking over power in Gaza and  Jericho will bring up the possibility of a confrontation with  some of the population?    ['Arafat] No. The issues is not that of some people. The  public selling of arms, in this huge quantity, is meant to  create a security problem in all of our occupied territory. I  hold the cosponsors of the conference responsible for this  serious action, and I have raised this question with U.S.,  Russian, European, and Chinese officials, since they are among  the permanent members of the Security Council.    [Shirbil] What will happen if Israel pursues its current  approach?    ['Arafat] The result is that the agreement will not be  implemented. Israel, and all its supporters on the  international scene -- Israel does not act without the support  of some international forces -- should understand that peace is  not only a Palestinian and Arab demand; it is a Palestinian,  Arab, international, Israeli, U.S., and European demand.  Everybody should understand that the alternative is  comprehensive anarchy in the region, whose scope only God knows,  and that will definitely Balkanize the region. Any Israeli or  international official who supports Israel in this stand is  mistaken if he believes that Israel can quietly swallow up any  Arab territory.    [Shirbil] Can we say the agreement is in danger?    ['Arafat] There is no doubt about this. It is obvious that  Israel procrastinates and tries to evade implementing it. It  suffices for Rabin to announce that dates are not sacrosanct to  show how false their approach to peace is.    [Shirbil] Are you preparing yourself for its possible  collapse?    ['Arafat] I am a practical man and I do not live in dreams.  Things will be tackled as they come. For every action, there is  a reaction equal to it, according to engineering theories.    [Shirbil] For example, resuming armed operations?    ['Arafat] Not only armed operations, but there will be total  confusion in the region.    [Shirbil] Are there contacts with the Hamas Movement to  contain any eventual deterioration?    ['Arafat] Contacts are under way with all the brother  officials in the factions in the Palestinian arena.    [Shirbil] What about dialogue with Hamas? Are there new  attempts in this respect?    ['Arafat] We never suspend contacts with any Palestinian  faction.    [Shirbil] How do you assess the results of your visit to  Saudi Arabia and your talks with King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz,  custodian of the two holy mosques?    ['Arafat] The truth is that it was a blessed visit. Tne  meeting was cordial, brotherly, and positive, as is the case  when his majesty the king meets us and with all of Palestine. As  you know, I used to put his majesty in the picture, whether  directly through letters or indirectly, about all the details of  developments in the Palestinian arena, and he supported us. This  support was expressed in the statement the Saudi council of  ministers issued at the end of the visit. We thank his majesty  for this, particularly his stand on the question of Jerusalem  and the interest he shows in this issue, toward the Palestinian  cause, and the Palestinian people. I thank him from the bottom  of my heart. Let us hope we will meet soon, God willing, to pray  in Jerusalem.    [Shirbil] From King Husayn's statement, one understands that  the Jordanian authorities wish to stop speaking about the  confederation issue?    ['Arafat] I read this statement. Of course, for us, the  issue  of confederation is a political decision made by the Palestine  Nationl Council [PNC] in 1983 and which it reconfirmed in every  session that followed. This decision calls for a confederal  union with Jordan in accordance with the voluntary and free  choice of the two fraternal Jordanian and Palestinian people.  This decision is binding on all the Palestinian command and all  the Palestinian factions. However, at the same time, we respect  and appreciate any free Jordanian option as mentioned in our PNC  decision.    [Shirbil] It seems that since last August Jordan and the PLO  have been speaking different languages, or at least there has  not been an agreement on interpretation?    ['Arafat] I do agree on this specific topic. As I have said,  the talk about a confederation has come within the framework of  the voluntary and free choice of the two fraternal people. We  do not want to impose our political decision on anyone. You  surely remember that one of the decisions was made at the PNC  session in Amman in 1984 and in two agreements, one of which I  and his majesty the king signed in 1985, dealing with a  confederation. After this came the disengagement decision that  his majesty the king announced and the 1985 agreement was  suspended. Then we went to Madrid as a joint delegation in  accordance with a Palestinian-Jordanian agreement the two  parties signed.    [Shirbil] Some say you are intentionally postponing settling  some matters until after you leave for Gaza and Jericho    ['Arafat] Like what?    [ Shirbil] The relationship with Jordan and issues  concerning  the Palestinian arena?    ['Arafat] This is untrue. We signed two agreements with  Jordan, an economic agreement and a security agreement. We  signed with Egypt an economic agreement, and we are in the  process of signing a security agreement. At my recent meeting  with His Majesty King Husayn we agreed that the joint  committees' work will continue.    [Shirbil] Do you plan to visit Syria again after your  recent meeting with President Hafiz al-Asad to offer condolences  on the death of his son Basil?    ['Arafat] I was dutybound to go to Syria to offer sympathies  after his profound loss, considering the longstanding, strong  relationship I have with President al-Asad. I had known the  departed since he was a little boy. It is a brotherly relation  between us that developed 30 years ago. May God help my brother  President al-Asad to overcome this profound calamity, which is a  loss for Syria, myself, and all of us. I welcome any  opportunity to visit the brothers in Syria. I want to proudly  note the meeting of the heads of negotiating teams in Washington  as a beginning of the restoration of this cohesion to the talks.    [Shirbil] Do you expect imminent progress on the  Syrian-Israeli track, for example, reaching a declaration of  principles?    ['Arafat] It was supposed and expected that something will  happen in Washington. However, according to what the brothers  in Syria said, no progress was made on the Syrian track, nor on  the Jordanian, Lebanese, and Palestinian tracks. This reveals  the size of the maneuver by which Israel is trying to buy time.    [Shirbil] The question of democracy has once again surfaced  in the Palestinian arena. What is the scope of the problem?    ['Arafat] The very fact that this question has surfaced in  the arena gives an indication of the scope of democracy in this  arena. I want to ask: Can this problem surface in other arenas  with the same candor and clarity that we see in the Palestinian  arena? We are democratic. We are proud that we have achieved a  democracy of the jungle of rifles since the launching of the  Palestinian revolution and up until now. The revolution and the  people take pride in this achievement.    [Shirbil] I meant charges that you have a monopoly over  decisionmaking?    ['Arafat] Do you know the saying: They could not find  anything wrong with the rose, so they told it: You have red  cheeks? I am a businessman for 18 hours a day, and I follow  everything, small and important. I have been this way since the  launching of the revolution. Is there anything wrong with that?  I am proud, at the same time, that I do not make any decision  without seeking the advice of my comrades. I also take pride in  different views and criticism. I always remember the famous  saying: May God have mercy on anyone who corrects [Caliph]  'Umar. I also remember Voltaire's saying: I might disagree  with you, but I am willing to fight for your freedom of  expression. No doubt, I am there in the serious, important, and  major junctures that face our cause, people, and destiny. I am  a man who does not hide. I do not bury my head in the sand.  But the truth is that there has been a campaign, since we  signed the agreement, by some brothers and friends and some  international quarters, to try to strangle this new baby,  Palestine, which is experiencing a rebirth.    There are many forces against this baby and against this  rebirth. This event will change the map of the Middle East.  They say that we are incapable of running a state. This is one  of the stupid questions that are being raised. Right from the  outset, we have been a state within a revolution. Has any  revolution paid as much attention as we did to education and  medical services? Lebanon bears witness to this, through our  hospitals and dispensaries.    Has any revolution paid as much attention as we did to  universities, social care, sports, and exporting agricultural  products? I want to know why those questions were not asked to  Mandela, Mugabe, Samora Machel, Ben Bella, and why they did not  ask all the revolutionaries who liberated their countries?    [Shirbil] When did you first think of peace with the  Israelis? Were the first contacts with them like the ones 'Isam  al-Sartawi held after obtaining your agreement?    ['Arafat] Since 1974, I have been thinking of negotiations  with Israel. The PNC decided to establish a national authority  on any inch of land we liberated or from which Israel pulled  out. In the same year, the Palestinian revolution accepted a  joint Arab delegation to the Geneva talks. In 1977, we accepted  the Egyptian-U.S. statement in which they proposed a joint Arab  delegation, including a low-level PLO representation. We then  decided to deliver our approval of Resolution No. 242 to  Gromyko. I also want to recall our approval of King Fahd's  initiative in Fes in 1981. 'Isam al-Sartawi won my agreement to  meet with the Israelis. I was the first to meet with members  of the Israeli Communist Party, Rakah, in Berlin in 1983. What  is strange is that some Rakah members, like Mahmud Darwish,  later became members of the PLO Executive Committee. Such  meetings were regarded at that time as a crime. We were also  the first to support the "Peace Now Movement" in Israel and the  first to call for a democratic state in which people can coexist.    You have asked me about fears regarding our current  decisions  and steps. I do not feel I have made a mistake. I have carried  out the PNC resolutions, as well as the Palestinian peace  initiative. Did we go to Madrid to dance or to make peace?    [Shirbil] Did you wish you would enter Palestinian territory  with a machine gun?    ['Arafat] I entered it with a machine gun. The last time was  in 1968.    [Shirbil] How many people betrayed you and abandoned you in  delicate situations?    ['Arafat] Many fell in every stage of the revolution, but  they were few compared to those who joined the revolution, more  determined and resolute.    [Shirbil] With whom had you wished that you would enter  Palestinian territory?    ['Arafat] I wish all martyrs had been with me, led by my  brother Abu-Jihad [Khalil al-Wazir] and Abu-Iyad [Salah Khalaf]    [Shirbil] When are you supposed to go to Gaza and Jericho?    ['Arafat] I am supposed to go there this month, February.    [Shirbil] When did you first know that the Soviet Union had  ended and that you could no longer depend on it?    ['Arafat] During a meeting of the socialist countries in  Berlin attended by Gorbachev. I and 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Yemeni  vice president and secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist  Party, were also sitting at the main table. I said to al-Bid:  This is not the Soviet Union we knew. What is happening is  completely different.    [Shirbil] What were the most difficult moments in your life,  negotiating with enemies or with others?    ['Arafat] Was there any moment in my life that was not  difficult? I live with difficulties.</p>

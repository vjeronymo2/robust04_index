			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Letter: More a question of economics than fashion Sir, I note the comment in your piece on schools ('Schools for free or fee: what's the difference?', October 24) that 'boarding becomes ever less fashionable', but presumably demand for boarding places is down (if it is) because fewer parents at the moment can pay for them. Your feature writers' comment is about as sensible as saying, with regard to an area with a falling school population, that education is going out of fashion.

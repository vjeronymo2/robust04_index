			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chen Hongwei (7115 4767 0251), Lin Xihui (2651 </F> 3305 6540), Yang Bin (2799 2430), and Zhou Kexing (0719 0668  5281): "On Macroeconomic Control of Export Tax Rebates"]    [Text] The key items involved in macroeconomic control of  export tax rebates include: The distribution form of export  tax rebate responsibility (the division of treasury rebates  among central and local revenues), the operating grounds for  export tax rebates (mostly planning or law), and the initiative  for regulating export trade through export tax rebates  (particular treatment aimed at specific conditions).  <H3>  I. The Features of China's Macroeconomic Control of Export  Tax Rebates </H3>   Since 1991, China has rigorously strengthened its planned  control over export tax rebates in the following detailed ways:  We have linked tax rebate plans to export plans, with those  without export plans not to be approved in principle for tax  rebate plans; we have linked tax rebate plans to  exchange-earning plans, with those not fulfilling  exchange-earning duties having their tax rebate quotas reduced;  we have broken down tax rebate plans to all regions and export  enterprises; and we have made local revenues responsible for the  excesses when tax rebate plans are exceeded.    These provisions show that China's macroeconomic control  over  export tax rebates is characterized as follows:    1. Treasury rebates are mostly the responsibility of central  revenues. The criteria for treasury-rebate division are tax  rebate quotas, with central revenues being completely  responsible for those within quotas, and local revenues  completely responsible for those beyond quotas.    2. Export tax rebate operations are dependent mostly on tax  rebate plans, not on fixed laws and regulations.    3. We exercise overall control over export trade, with all  exports, both those that exceed and those that do not fulfill  export plans, subject to restrictions and constraints without  respect to particular conditions. We lack individual  regulation and correct guidance of export trade.  <H3>  II. Existing Problems in China's Macroeconomic Control  Method for Export Tax Rebates </H3>   1. Our Control Method Has Mutual Conflicts with Export Tax  Rebate Legalization. Article 3 of the "PRC Tax Collection  Management Law" states clearly that: "Tax impositions and  cancellations, as well as reductions, exemptions, rebates, and  make-up payments, are enforced according to legal provisions;  State Council provisions authorized by law are enforced  according to the provisions of the administrative laws and  regulations drawn up by the State Council." So export tax  rebates, just as tax collections, should have legal mandates and  permanence. While China's export tax rebate legislation is  still very inadequate, lacking the legal norms of our supreme  organs of power, the pertinent Ministry of Finance provisions  approved by the State Council similarly do have a certain legal  standing, so should be regarded as a component part of China's  tax law system. As matters, such as export tax rebate scope,  tax rebate rates, and tax rebate calculation methods, are  clearly set forth in our pertinent legal documents, certainly  not varying because of the amount of export turnover or exchange  earnings, all export products that conform to China's external  economic laws and regulations should enjoy tax rebate  qualifications and rights.    But in our current control method, whether export products  win tax rebate qualifications depends on whether there are  export plans and export tax rebate quotas, with above-plan  exporters subject to local government constraints as to whether  they will get tax rebates, and the future tax rebate treatment  of export enterprises that do not fulfill plans subject to  restrictions, etc. Such a control mechanism operating on  planning grounds adds many artificial factors to China's export  tax rebates, largely diluting the proper permanence, solemnity,  and force of laws and regulations.    2. It Puts a Heavier Burden on Central Revenues. In China's  current graded revenue-control system, most flow-tax revenue is  shared by the center and localities at a 50-50 rate (in  minority-nationality regions, the local share is greater;  commissioned customs collections revert to the center). For  1991 and 1992, China's export tax rebates respectively totalled  25.4 billion RMB and 27.6 billion RMB. If export tax rebates  and real export product tax inclusion were in overall balance,  then the central revenue from export products before tax rebates  would have been only 12.7 billion yuan and 13.8 billion yuan.  But as tax rebates are mainly the responsibility of central  revenues, the figures for these two years reduced central  revenues about 13 billion yuan a year for this one item alone,  thus putting a heavier burden on central revenues.    That tax rebates are mainly the responsibility of central  revenues was set years ago. In 1991, in order to reduce the  impact of tax rebates on central revenues, while the state was  forced to institute quantitative control of export tax rebates,  using the quota method to break them down to all regions and  export enterprises, this merely alleviated the symptoms without  getting at the root of the problem. As we expand our reform and  opening, China's exports and export tax rebates are bound to  increase year after year. So if we do not thoroughly reform  our treasury-rebate methods, central-revenue difficulties are  also bound to grow increasingly more serious.    3. It Affects the Initiative of Local Governments To Support  Export Growth, Acting as an Inducement to New Regional Economic  Barriers. The provision that above-plan tax rebates are the  responsibility of local government treasury rebates is a  restriction on export growth per se. As to regions with rapid  export growth but revenue difficulties, it is undoubtedly a  blow. So proceeding from revenue-balance considerations, some  local governments take a negative approach to export growth,  even to the point of using administrative means to restrict it.    Although many export enterprises could buy in products from  other areas to expand their exports, the taxes would be  collected in other areas while the tax rebates would be the  responsibility of local revenues, causing strong opposition by  local governments. In many areas, governments demand that  export products be produced locally, forbidding exports of  products bought from outside, which not only restricts export  growth, but also forms new regional economic barriers.    4. It is Detrimental to the Intensified Reform of Our  Foreign  Trade System. Our foreign trade system reform is aimed at 1)  achieving a corporate status for foreign trade enterprises and  2) reducing the scope of planning. An essential prerequisite  for enterprise incorporation is enterprise operating  independence, so that as long as they conform to state export  policy, enterprises should have the right to decide their own  export orientations and scales based on domestic and foreign  market information. But export tax rebate quotas directly  restrict enterprise export scales, thus indirectly controlling  their export orientations. While a market economy intrinsically  requires the reduction of government administrative interference  and directive planning, combining export guidance-plans with  quota-type tax rebate plans turns them into mandated plans in  reality as well as in name. Our foreign trade sector has  clearly pointed out recently the need to reduce planning-list  commodities, as well as the export commodity varieties subject  to quota and licensing controls, in order to expand the scope of  market regulation. In this case, our export earnings plans  grounded on tax rebate quotas should mostly no longer exist,  with tax rebate quotas becoming like water without a source or a  tree without roots. This means that the establishment of a new  and scientific export tax rebate control form is imperative,  without which it will be hard to move forward with  intensification of our foreign trade system reform.    5. It Is Adverse to the Optimization of Export Product Mix  and the Diversification of Export Markets. In recent years,  China's export products have been concentrated mainly in a few  varieties, such as toys, textiles, clothing, and machinery and  electronic products, with our export markets being mostly in  Hong Kong and Macao, Japan, the United States, the West European  EC, and the five ASEAN countries. When formulating export  operating tactics, enterprises are subject to tax rebate-quota  constraints, being forced to consider matters such as the tax  rebate rates of various products and the prices on various  international markets; thus not daring to add new export  varieties or open up new export markets. How many domestic  products actually miss out on good opportunities of being  exported to new markets due to tax rebate quotas? While we do  not know this, we can say with certainty that as tax rebate  quotas are set according to export plans, which in turn are  basically set according to the real achievements of past years,  keeping export tax rebates under overall quota control  ultimately can only ensure that past export products and markets  continue to maintain their dominant positions, while the export  growth of new varieties and the development of new international  markets are restricted.    6. It Apparently Strengthens but Actually Weakens. While the  quota-type method apparently strengthens control, it is actually  a mere formality that exists in name but not reality. 1) As tax  rebate quotas have become a scarce item similar to our past  coupons when we practiced supply by coupon, having become a  special "commodity" transferred at a price privately among  controllers and enterprises, among enterprises, and among  regions, they have become the source of a certain amount of  corruption and law violation. 2) tax rebate-quota control  forces enterprises to pay attention only to fulfillment of  export earnings plans instead of RMB-accounted profits and  losses, while providing an opening for tax fraud. 3) When  enterprises and regions exceed tax rebate quotas, the relevant  departments are forced to grant further ones on pretexts, such  as supplementary quotas. In both 1991 and 1992, real tax  rebates exceeded the planned figures at the beginning of the  year.  <H3>  III. Suggestions on Improving China's Macroeconomic Control  Method for Export Tax Rebates </H3>   Our guiding reform ideology is to standardize export tax  rebates in order to bring them more into line with market  economy demands, in order to push forward with normal export  trade development and intensified foreign trade system reform.  Reform should observe the following principles: treasury  rebates should be tied to revenue jurisdiction; we should treat  individual products or enterprises appropriately differently, in  order to guide export trade to a sound growth; and macroeconomic  control should be mostly through legal institutions. Our  specific suggestions are as follows:    1. We Should Reform Our Treasury-Rebate System, by Dividing  Up the Responsibility of Revenues at All Levels According to  Revenue Jurisdiction. China' macroeconomic control method for  export tax rebates was at first treasury rebates being the joint  responsibility of the center and localities, then was changed  after a relatively short time to central treasury rebates, which  was a blow to central revenues, and then was changed again to  the method of quantitative control and overall quota control,  which took export tax rebate control off of a legal track, and  finally created the many above-analyzed adverse results. This  shows that in order to reform our current macroeconomic control  method, we will first have to begin by reforming our  treasury-rebate system.    We favor bringing order to revenue relations, by dividing up  central and local revenue treasury-rebate responsibility  according to revenue jurisdiction. As the customs-commissioned  part of flow taxes come under central jurisdiction, the central  revenue treasury-rebate responsibility should be appropriately  higher on the basis of revenue-sharing percentages.    The greatest obstacle to local responsibility for tax  rebates  is local revenue sustainability. According to 1992 tax rebate  calculations, the tax rebate responsibility per province,  municipality, and autonomous region averaged 400 million yuan,  reaching about 800 million yuan for certain provinces and  municipalities with large export volumes, which was adverse to  the local balance between revenue and spending. In addition, as  product export tax rebates and pre-export taxation could be  separate regionally, local governments also formed new regional  economic barriers to increase local revenues and decrease tax  rebate responsibility. This shows that while reforming our  treasury-rebate system, we must also appropriately resolve the  following matters. 1) As central revenues have over 10 billion  yuan more in revenues on the current basis, giving them the  capability to regulate the relations between local revenues,  they should provide local revenues with appropriate fiscal  subsidies based on their varying conditions. 2) In our tax  separation reform process, we could appropriately increase local  shares and tax categories. 3) When our market economy is being  established, in order to keep the powers devolved by the center  to enterprises from being intercepted by local governments, we  must also perfect our administrative and economic laws and  regulations, in order to reduce local government interference in  the economy, and effectively promote export growth and  interregional economic ties.    Changing central treasury rebates to joint treasury-rebate  responsibility by the center and localities will certainly not  be merely a simple change of the form of transfer of revenue  funds, but will rationalize relations by linking  responsibilities to rights, not only increasing central  macroeconomic regulation and control capability, but also paving  the essential way for overall reform of our macroeconomic  control method for export tax rebates.    2. We Should Abolish Our Quantitative Control and Overall  Quota-Control Method, and Adopt a Selective Quota-Control  Method. In order to abolish our current method, we will need to  clarify a theoretical question, i.e., does export and export tax  rebate growth affect the growth of overall state revenue?    Our answer to this question is no. 1) Export tax rebates  involve only domestic flow taxes, not other tax categories or  revenues. 2) Domestic flow taxes are divided into two parts: a)  taxes involving export products, being revenue that the state  "renounces;" b) domestic consumption (final consumption) taxes,  being genuine revenues. As to certain supply-constrained  products or resources (such as oil) that are scarce, for which  domestic supply does not meet demand (effective demand), and for  which increased exporting would lower domestic consumption, the  state restricts or bans exports, also not granting export tax  rebates. So for most products, export growth and  domestic-consumption (meaning substitute-product consumption)  growth should occr together, with the latter necessarily being  more stable growth. As long as domestic consumption grows,  regardless of whether consumers buy domestic or imported  products, this will provide the government with steadily growing  domestic flow-tax revenues. If the phenomenon of simultaneous  export growth and government flow-tax revenue decline occurs,  the inherent causes will be either economic recession or lower  domestic effective demand, or not having brought taxes into line  with tax rebates. In other words, as long as the tax rebate  system is designed to implement the principle of taxes being in  line with rebates, with particular operations avoiding or  reducing incorrect tax rebates and tax fraud, then export and  export tax rebate growth will absolutely not bring a decline in  domestic flow-tax revenues. 3) As to long-range development,  export tax rebates will be converted to funding sources for  individual income and enterprise expanded production and  operation scale, finally promoting production and  domestic-consumption growth, thus providing the state with more  revenues. The practice of all countries in export tax rebate  method shows that export growth has never yet caused a decline  in national revenues.    Of course, this analysis refers to overall state revenues.  If  the form of treasury-rebate sharing is inappropriate, export tax  rebates will have varing impacts on revenues at various levels.  But even in this case, export tax rebates will not affect  overall revenue growth. This shows that there is a full  rationale for abolishing our current method.    We favor the adoption of a selective quota-control form:    1. We need to continue to draw up export tax rebate plans  each year, as well as bringing them into line with the national  budget (or budgets at all levels), the goal being to enable the  government through such projection planning to fully grasp  future national economic development trends, thus enabling it to  adjust and perfect its macroeconomic and macrosocial policies.  But we must not substitute planning for tax rebate laws and  regulations, and even less so mandate plans for markets and  enterprises, which would constitute forceful interference in  export trade.    2. As to enterprises, such as those still within foreign  trade export plans, those with low added-value products, and  export enterprises with high exchange-conversion costs and poor  economic efficiency, we should practice rigorous tax rebate  quota control, with quota overages being the responsibility of  treasury rebates from local revenues. While particular  operations can be directed at export products and export  enterprises, such products or enterprises should be the  minority, as well as being clearly distinguished.    Enterprises that export new or high added-value products and  actively develop new international markets should be provided  incentives. Despite the amount of their tax rebates, they must  all be given priority tax rebates to speed up their fund  turnover, with an appropriate increase in the central revenue  share for their treasury rebates.    As to the majority of export enterprises and export products  that do not fit into these two categories, we must not exercise  quota control, and we must grant special preferences for a  regular system of tax rebates.    3. We Should Reinforce Our Legislation. Our current export  tax rebate legislative inadequacies are quite glaring: 1) Our  legislative norms are quite low. Except for the provisions on  tax fraud and penalties in the NPC "Tax Management Law," the  only higher standard is the provisions in the pertinent Ministry  of Finance "Circular" approved by the State Council in 1985. 2)  Our various provisions are quite disorganized, with many  conflicts and duplications, and lacking a systematic and  complete legal article. 3) The liabilities of all parties to  violations of our tax rebate system are not detailed and clearly  distinguished, equating tax fraud with tax evasion. 4)  Penalties for violators are too lax. In 1992 for instance, we  investigated 178 export enterprises throughout China for tax  fraud involving 580 million RMB, averaging a high of 3.25  million a case. But according to the provisions in our "Tax  Management Law," tax fraud of over 10,000 yuan is penalized by  only up to three years of imprisonment or service in detention.  In comparison to the "three to seven year sentences for tax  arrears that are not paid and cannot be collected of over  100,000 yuan," and the penalties for tax evasion or other  economic crimes, such criminal penalties for tax fraud are  obviously too lax.    We hold that macroeconomic control of export tax rebates  should be mostly through the legal system, the prerequisite for  which is legislative perfection. In a market economy, the lack  of legislative guarantees for the export tax rebate system will  have many harmful consequences. From a long-range perspective,  the export tax rebate method is absolutely not a matter of  expediency, but rather a permanent way to promote trade  development and fair international competition either for China  or other countries. So we are recommending that the NPC draft  and promulgate as quickly as possible a systematic and complete  "Export Tax Rebate Law," to restrain the fiscal and  administrative behavior of the government sector and the  economic activities of export enterprises, clearly distinguish  the liabilities and rights of the control sector and tax rebate  applicants, and thus lay the foundation for achieving the  legalization of our export tax rebates.</p>

			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ANGRY OVER 'VISITORS'  </P> <P> In response to "Baby Boom Pushes a Hospital to Limit":  </P> <P> I feel that our public maternity wards are being abused by "visitors" from  other countries. Last year, a relative of a friend came to Los Angeles under  the presumption of visiting a family member.  </P> <P> This man and his wife arrived in L.A. approximately two weeks before her due  date.  </P> <P> The woman had not received proper prenatal care in her native country. She was  also in need of Medi-Cal assistance to defray the cost of her maternity stay.  Somehow, the proper paperwork was completed and this young lady delivered her  baby boy by C-section at Olive View Medical Center.  </P> <P> What really angered me was the fact that these so-called "visitors" returned to  their country about three weeks after the birth of their son.  </P> <P> Why are we, the taxpayers, left with these outrageous bills? We can't even take  care of our own Medi-Cal patients, but we are willing to pay for outsiders to  deliver their babies in American hospitals.  </P> <P> We should seriously investigate why we taxpayers are paying for these births  and supporting these visitors.  </P> <P> CAROLE RODIN  </P> <P> Chatsworth  </P></p>

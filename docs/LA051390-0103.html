			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDEFINING AUTHORITY: THE NEED FOR DIVERSITY;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: SEEKING TENURE FOR A BLACK WOMAN, HARVARD LAW STUDENTS DEMAND  CHANGE: THEY ASSERT THAT AUTHORITY DOESN'T MEAN WHITE AND MALE.  </P> <P> Inside the gray corridors of Harvard Law School, where 18th-Century oil  paintings of robed barristers cast cold stares from beneath big wigs, there is  divergence on the issue of diversity. Outside the classrooms, hundreds of  students have marched and rallied in recent weeks to demand the tenure  appointment of a woman of color to the faculty. It is a struggle waiting to  happen on many campuses -- a struggle to change the face of legal authority.  </P> <P> The singular demand for "diversity" hardly reflects the numbers behind it: 173  years without a Latino, woman of color, American Indian, Asian, disabled or  openly homosexual tenured professor. Of the 60 current tenured faculty, 53 are  white men, three are African-American men and five are white women.  </P> <P> For Dean Robert C. Clark, untold faculty and many conservative students, it is  a struggle to preserve the power of the Harvard name, as though it were the  H-bomb of elitism to be dropped upon frightened listeners in professional  conversation. The idea of, say, a black woman in charge of a class full of the  "best and brightest" is anathema to people, mainly men, more accustomed to  watching them cook and clean than assign and grade. Discrete and insular  minorities were less threatening when they were quiet and unknown.  </P> <P> An outsider might wonder why so much is made of a single appointment in such a  large institution. Is the fear that an inch may become a mile so realistic?  </P> <P> Perhaps it is. After all, diversity would call into question many of the  assumptions about interpretation of the law. It might challenge professors not  fond of confrontation to defend their expertise in classrooms, law reviews and  faculty meetings. It might challenge the dishonesty of "it is" -- for which law  faculty are known -- with the "I think" -- by which many minority and feminist  scholars assert their views. Perhaps "Truth" itself would disappear. As more  integrated approaches rivaled tradition for intellectual primacy and discourse,  the old school might lose hegemony. The H-bomb might explode, leaving equality  to reign amid the ruins.  </P> <P> Yet for minorities and others outside the norm whose presence and competence  was only recently recognized here, diversity might defuse the H-bomb that burns  within us.  </P> <P> Any student can tackle questions or deliver doctrine on demand. But law is  ultimately about living people, and to sit inside a law-school class and hear  the stories of our parents reduced to irreducible principles of abstraction,  the facts removed from the flesh in our casebooks, the race and class edited  out of opinions is to taunt implosion. As mild-mannered missionaries of  difference, we await "race week" in contracts, "women's day" in constitutional  law and "Indian moment" in property to offer the victim's expertise. We are  good, but we are tired of being visiting lecturers for the education of white  students. Like all students, we come for the rigorous study of ourselves.  </P> <P> Yet the promise of true diversity is that groups who don't know each other will  come to terms through exposure and debate. This is rare in the bastion of  privilege and rarer still among U.S. suburbs and boardrooms. But it is critical  to an education for leadership. You cannot exalt diversity only in exotic  vacations, the globalization of markets, new opportunities in Eastern Europe  and popular intolerance of apartheid. You must live it at home.  </P> <P> The law is but one element in life -- though it tries to be its regulator --  and life is becoming more diverse all the time. The major cities for legal  practice -- New York, Chicago and Los Angeles -- are home to more Latino school  districts, lesbian-owned businesses, Asian service workers, homeless families  and black developers than ever before. That presence parallels the numerical  inclusion of minorities in training grounds such as Harvard.  </P> <P> As a result, this struggle for diversity involves the demand for substantial  inclusion and a radical restructuring of legal perception, argument and  analysis. It is a struggle for the power to legitimate. That perhaps is why  conservative faculty here, as everywhere, raise questions about the competence  of African-Americans to teach or, for that matter, to own businesses and lead  school districts. It is not enough that the black female professor under  scrutiny in the current debate is a well-published authority on insurance law,  tenured at Penn Law School and sought by Michigan Law School. At Harvard,  because she is also an unapologetic role model, she is the first step on a  "slippery slope."  </P> <P> A majority of students here at Harvard do not care to drop themselves upon the  world like bomb threats. While black women have been most vocal, the 700  students who have consistently attended rallies and sit-ins this spring  constitute a multiracial group of men and women intent on adequate preparation.  The passage of a student referendum supporting a pro-bono requirement and the  frequent winter protests over cutbacks in public-service programs signal a  curiosity and a desire to expand the range of legal advocacy. The recent  announcement by a beloved black professor, Derrick Bell, that he will not  return until demands are met, threatens the existence of a role model for  students hungry for open doors, feedback and human insight. Despite its  acrimony, the diversity struggle has produced a rare experience at Harvard Law  School: community.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BAN ON POLITICAL FORGERY PASSES DESPITE DETOURS  </P> <P> When Sen. William A. Craven (R-Oceanside) first introduced a bill outlawing the  use of phony endorsements in political campaigns, it was with a righteous zeal.  </P> <P> But, as the measure limped into the homestretch last week -- after being  repeatedly tripped, stalled, amended and sideswiped -- Craven confessed to  feeling more like one of the condemned.  </P> <P> "We're suffered the rigors of the damned on this thing," he said.  </P> <P> It wasn't until Friday, the last business day of the 1990 legislative session,  that the bill was snatched from an ignominious death. The final version  approved by the Legislature makes it a felony to use unauthorized "handwritten  or mechanically reproduced" signatures in campaign material, or to take bona  fide signatures "out of context." Violations could be punished by a year in  jail or fines up to $50,000.  </P> <P> Yet the treatment by well-meaning legislators and unseen forces has had all the  markings of a whodunit: The knife has gone in several times, but there have  been no witnesses or fingerprints.  </P> <P> Craven points to professional political consultants and campaign managers --  people who have been known to deceive voters with phantom endorsements and  signatures -- as the culprits. His prime suspect has been Los Angeles-based  B.A.D. Campaigns Inc., a powerful consulting firm operated by Michael Berman  and Carl D'Agostino.  </P> <P> Phone messages left at B.A.D. Friday were not returned.  </P> <P> Senate President Pro Tempore David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) confirmed Friday  that Berman had called to complain about an earlier version of the measure. He  emphasized, however, that the inquiry had less to do with the bill's  difficulties than legislative concerns about a tricky subject.  </P> <P> "It's not clear-cut. . . . We're all against forgery," Roberti said. "The issue  is who's the responsible party?"  </P> <P> For the record, no one has ever signed up to oppose the measure. It has been  approved by lopsided margins at every turn, including a 72-1 slam-dunk in the  Assembly earlier last Monday.  </P> <P> Yet some very uncanny things have happened. The bill has been forced through  more hoops than Shamu on a busy day.  </P> <P> "It's been through three policy committees, two fiscal committees, two floor  votes, 10 rounds of amendments," said Allen Sumner, assistant attorney general  who has helped Craven with the legislation.  </P> <P> "It's been in the Elections Code, the Government Code, the Penal Code and now  the Civil Code," he said. "And, with 24 hours left in the legislative session,  they still want to rewrite it virtually from scratch."  </P> <P> Pretty rude stuff for a measure that Craven, a 17-year veteran, thought was a  cinch to sail through the Legislature. He introduced it with a flourish shortly  after the 3rd District Court of Appeal threw out felony forgery charges against  Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange) on a technicality.  </P> <P> Lewis was charged with forging then-President Ronald Reagan's signature to  thousands of 1986 campaign smear pieces against Democrats in six state Assembly  races, despite White House orders not to use the President's name. One of those  mailers targeted Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson) and accused him of  "caving in to the powerful underworld drug industry."  </P> <P> Although the court condemned the behavior as "misconduct which impinges on the  public's interest," it ruled in January that no one was defrauded of money or  property -- necessary ingredients under the law for felony forgery charges.  Since the state's election code is silent on forgery, the charges were thrown  out.  </P> <P> On Jan. 31, Craven introduced his bill to close the loophole. At first, it  applied to signatures and phony endorsements in all campaign material or  advertisements. If anyone doubted the rightness of the cause, Reagan himself  endorsed the measure.  </P> <P> Craven said the idea was to get the bill approved and to the governor in time  for the June primary season. And that seemed to be within reach when the Senate  passed it 31 to 3 in March.  </P> <P> But, over in the Assembly, things began to go bump in the night.  </P> <P> Records show that the relatively straightforward idea was, in the words of  Craven's staff, "loved to death." It was sent on a circuitous track through  three committees, amended six times and eventually put into the state's Fair  Political Practices Act -- a process that conveniently kept the bill in limbo  until after the primaries, when most legislative contests are actually decided.  </P> <P> In San Diego, for instance, Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas) dodged  a bullet after a scandal about double-dipping in her campaign funds. And  Assemblyman Pete Chacon (D-San Diego) beat out a serious challenge from Celia  Ballesteros with behind-the-scenes help from Assembly Democrats.  </P> <P> At first, Craven and the attorney general's staff were willing to give  lawmakers looking over his bill the benefit of the doubt.  </P> <P> "This is one of the few bills where they immediately identify with the topic  and everyone has his or her own interpretation of his or her own campaigns,"  said Sumner. "You see the same treatment with the ethics bills about  honorariums. There is a lot more tinkering, a lot more amendments, a lot more  attention."  </P> <P> Then came the incident over amendments. The Assembly Ways and Means Committee  decided Aug. 8 to make some perfunctory wording changes in the bill. Despite  ample time, records show that the amended form of the bill wasn't in print  until Aug. 20, a 12-day gap that no one has been able to explain.  </P> <P> As it happens, the delayed printing of the amended bill violated a little-known  deadline that requires measures involving the political reform act to be  delivered to the Fair Political Practices Commission for public review. This  year, the deadline for delivery to the agency's office, just a few blocks from  the Capitol, was no later than 5 p.m. on Friday, Aug. 17.  </P> <P> Craven's bill showed up in the mail Aug. 21. The Oceanside Republican believed  that was a sign that someone was trying to kill the measure through procedure,  and not through a public vote in the Legislature.  </P> <P> The suspicion became even more pronounced when Craven's staff discovered that  two other FPPC-related bills were given the royal treatment by Assembly clerks.  Although the two other Senate bills bear the same Monday, Aug. 20 amendment  date, special preprint versions were hand-delivered to the FPPC offices at 4:26  p.m. on deadline Friday, records show.  </P> <P> Without that special treatment, Craven's bill was left for dead, but his staff  maneuvered around the obstacle by having it taken out of the political reform  act and put into the penal code -- a move that removed the deadline provisions  and revived the bill. It was passed by the Assembly on Monday and approved 29  to 3 by the Senate on Wednesday.  </P> <P> With that, Craven's bill was bound for the governor's desk. Yet, in another  bizarre twist, the measure was procedurally plucked in mid-flight on its way  out of the Legislature so that lawmakers could take one more look at it.  </P> <P> The request prompted two days of quibbling among legislators over what  constitutes a signature. Did it only apply to a genuine handwritten signature?  What about signatures that are actually written by machines, such as the Reagan  name later forged by Lewis?  </P> <P> Roberti wanted Craven to insert the words "cursive" and "handwritten" into the  bill -- a step that would make double sure to leave untouched printed names.  </P> <P> Such printed names and endorsements are used on so-called "slate mailers," a  piece of campaign literature that lumps together the names of political  candidates from the same party but running for different offices. Berman and  D'Agostino's firm is the leading slate mail consultant for Democratic hopefuls  in Los Angeles and other areas of the state.  </P> <P> It also found itself in court several years ago for allegedly using phony  quotes in a last-minute 1984 slate mailer against Assemblyman Phillip Wyman  (R-Tehachapi). The campaign material attributed quotes critical of Wyman to a  state senator and the state commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Wyman  said the quotes were false and sued under false advertising statutes, but lost  on the ground that business law does not apply to political speech.  </P> <P> On Friday, Roberti acknowledged that Berman called his office about the bill.  But the Senate leader said it was his personal concerns that prompted him to  take a closer look at Craven's bill, even after it was passed by the Senate.  </P> <P> He said it is always difficult to sort through who is at fault when there are  charges of misquotes and phony endorsements. People who allow the use of their  printed names in the mailers sometimes cave into criticism and disavow their  actions to save face.  </P> <P> "The issue is, who should get the blame?" said Roberti. "Is it the campaign  manager? Is it the candidate? Or is it the person who probably allowed the  endorsement to be used but changed his mind?"  </P> <P> With the additional changes Friday, Roberti said the Craven bill was narrowed  to deal with flat-out forgeries, as represented by the Lewis case. And, with  all questions apparently settled, the measure was finally approved by the  entire Legislature.  </P> <P> "We don't want to be morbid about it," Craven reflected afterwards about what  his bill went through. "In reflection, the effort was well worth it, and it  produced a product that would serve the people well."  </P></p>

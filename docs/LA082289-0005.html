			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'A NEW AGE' OF ENERGY SAVING  </P> <P> Your editorial "Energy: A New Age," does well to point out the need for  California to practice energy conservation. However, you state that "at the  moment, there is no such thing as an environmentally benign electric power  plant." Such power plants do exist today and Luz utility-scale solar power  plants have received national attention in The Times, the Washington Post and  other prestigious publications. It is important for your readers to know that  viable solutions to the problems posed in your editorial do exist.  </P> <P> Luz International Ltd. has brought solar power to utility scale and currently  produces more than 90% of the world's solar electricity. With seven solar  energy plants operating in the Mojave Desert outside of Los Angeles, Luz is  supplying the Southern California Edison utility grid with nearly 200 megawatts  of electricity, enough for the residential needs of 270,000 people.  </P> <P> We are now constructing the first of five planned 80-megawatt solar plants  which will be competitive with oil and coal peaking plants at less than 8 cents  per kilowatt hour. With completion of the five 80-megawatt plants in 1994,  Luz's production of solar electricity will total almost 600 megawatts, enough  electricity to serve the residential needs of over 800,000 Californians.  </P> <P> PAUL B. SAVOLDELLI  </P> <P> Assistant General Counsel  </P> <P> Luz International Ltd.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 29 -- The newly appointed Deputy Prime  Minister and Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko on Friday [29  April] pledged that while coordinating the government economic  policy he will take care that an authentic concern for the  satisfaction of social needs of working people and businessmen  be not ignored. Addressing the plenary meeting of the Sejm held  amid a strike wave that has swept the country Kolodko said that  under the present circumstances it is possible to reach  consensus.    "I will not appeal for 90 peaceful days, I have no doubt  that  we need much more of peace than 90 days," Kolodko said. In his  opinion, the foundations of an economic policy of the state must  be constructed in the conditions of a will to reach agreement  rather than solutions attained by force. "I do not see such  conflicts of economic interests that, with a good will of all,  could prevent us from solving problems," he said. Kolodko did  not agree with the opinion that the coalition government has no  economic programme. Instead, he confirmed the opinion that this  programme must be critically assessed in a constructive and  creative way. the government's strategy for poland, co-authored  by Kolodko half a year ago, is designed to simulate development  and growth. He expressed the hope that the government, in  agreement with trade unions, will settle the wage control  problem shortly.    In a statement for journalists Kolodko announced he will  present to public opinion a medium-range programme of economic  development for Poland, and submit it for discussion with trade  unions and for approval of the government. A medium-range  financial strategy that will combine instruments of monetary and  fiscal policies will be an integral part of the programme.  Kolodko named such priorities in the economic policy as  stabilisation, economic growth and a just, or at least socially  acceptable distribution of national income that would not give  rise to conflicts.    Kolodko said he will meet with National Bank of Poland (NBP)  President Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz on Saturday. "I believe that  our cooperation will go on perfectly well," he predicted. At  the same time he said he will undertake steps to protect the  zloty. Denomination of the zloty will have to be carried out  along with the further fighting of inflation. The banks actions  to this aim must be coordinated with those of the government.    "We have good economic prospects," Kolodko declared saying  that everything indicates that real wages will increase sooner  than planned. "I would treat it as my defeat and a failure of  my mission if we fail to maintain Poland's good position as a  leading country in central and Eastern Europe," he said. The  most important thing is to change the situation in Poland for  the better, the new deputy minister and finance minister  declared.</p>

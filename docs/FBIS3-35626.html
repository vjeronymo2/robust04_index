Sunday Sees Second Round of Presidential  Elections on the Peninsula"]    [Excerpts] Simferopol -- Everyone has long been aware that  trouble was brewing in the Crimea. Trouble with a host of  aspects and shades. But the governments and parliaments of  Ukraine and Russia watched the alarming process stony-faced,  allowing events to run their course as it were. Thus the Crimea  came to see presidential elections with Nikolay Bagrov and Yuriy  Meshkov in the final lap.    Nikolay Bagrov is an experienced politician, a product of  the  system, a former party obkom [oblast committee] first secretary,  now chairman of the Crimean Supreme Soviet. It was he who was  behind the revival of a republic in the Crimea and secured its  political and economic autonomy.    In Ukraine Bagrov is considered a treacherous separatist, a  "Red-cum-Brown." Crimean radicals are thought to be irresolute  and trying to ingratiate themselves with Kiev. "Do you want to  live as you are? Do you want Kravchuk's rapscallions and  humiliation? Then vote for Bagrov!" -- that is his political  opponents' main idea.    Yuriy Meshkov is a man of the squares. Rallies are his  element, slogans and war cries his weapons. He has been a  fitter, a soldier, a student at Moscow State University's  Faculty of Law, and a Prosecutor's Office investigator. He  promises the people of the Crimea a sovereign republic, he  promises to bring the Crimea back to the ruble zone and to the  bosom of Russia, he also promises the good life soon, and that  young men will do their military service on the peninsula. He  also says that he wants to heed the harassed, impoverished,  desperate people. Most of the points in his program are  unfeasible. But they are all Joe Public's dream.... [passage  omitted]  <H5>  To What Kind of Russia Does the Crimea Want To Return? </H5>   In the public garden opposite the Crimean Supreme Soviet  from  morning until evening two dozen citizens, primarily of a  venerable age, have been freely cursing Kravchuk and all  Ukrainians with their independence and making emotional appeals  for the Crimea to be returned to Russia. Yuriy Meshkov is their  idol. Zhirinovskiy has spoken here. The gathering warmly  applauded the announcement of his intention to become president  of Russia and annex [prisoyedinit] the Crimea.    It is easy to see in conversation that these citizens cannot  stand President Yeltsin, they do not fete Gaydar and his team  for their "shock therapy," and their sympathies lean more toward  those who "favor the Soviet Union and Great Russia," a disaster  for the whole world.    The 1.5 million Russians in the Crimea form a heterogeneous  mass and cannot be identified with the hysterical women in the  public garden. In sober, calm conversation they agree that you  cannot regrettably bring back the past and that forcibly carving  borders spells a bloodbath. But they cannot resign themselves  to the fact that they are cut off from Russia and must accept  the supremacy of Ukrainian law and acknowledge Ukraine's right  to the peninsula.    The Crimean people believe religiously that Mother Russia is  waiting with open arms for their "escape from captivity."  Presidential candidate Yuriy Meshkov sounds off on every street  corner saying that "all matters have been resolved with Russia,"  from dual citizenship to the Russian ruble's circulation in the  Crimea.    The Crimean people's separatism has a firm foundation --  the economic collapse in Ukraine. The coupon-karbovanets is bad  not because it carries a picture of the Cathedral of Saint Sofia  but because it is a Mickey Mouse currency.  <H5>  Enterprises Choke in Tax Noose </H5>   An entrepreneur from Krasnogvardeysk was puzzled as to how  "masochistic" a government has to be to render commodity  production unprofitable. And he described how they organized  production of electric stoves in conjunction with foreign  partners.    The goods are in great demand. But taxes have been crushing.  He himself bought equipment to manufacture plastic pipes for  water supply lines and sewage. Given the current levels of  individual housing construction in the Crimea this is a correct,  profitable, and necessary business. But the taxes that have  been levied from all quarters are so extortionate that the  workshop is standing idle.    Needless to say, Dnepr water is a boon, life itself for the  steppes. But I. Karamelev, director of the "Tavricheskiy"  Sovkhoz in Perekop, spoke of how equipment was standing idle at  the height of the field work -- there are no spare parts, no  fuel, and, most importantly, there is no state interest in  ensuring that the land feeds the people. The economy is  withering every day.    "We voted for Bagrov. All the country people in the rayon,"  he said. "Because we see him as stability."    That was how food producers in the Crimea saw N. Bagrov's  campaign to shape an open economy on the peninsula, finally  extricating the Crimea from Ukraine's ruinous economic policy.  As of this January the republic has had its own bank,  established its own tax system, and tried to manage autonomously.  <H5>  Foreboding of Disaster </H5>   Rashness mixed with a craving for simple solutions has  always  cost us plenty. Let us ask ourselves the following question:  What will happen to the Crimea in the future? What if Yuriy  Meshkov becomes president (and he is very likely to be  victorious) and starts putting his slogans into practice? How  will the already strained Ukrainian-Russian relations develop  then? It is naive to think that even the most moderate  politicians in Ukraine will agree to disrupt the state's  territorial integrity. After all there are also radical forces,  like the national self-defense detachments that have fought in  the Dniester Region and Abkhazia and do not come under the  jurisdiction of official Kiev. Dynamite and the assault rifle  are by no means secondary in their arsenal of arguments, and  their experience of wrecking lines of communication in the  Caucasus and blockading railroads can easily be transferred to  the Crimea. And what then? Without water, without electricity,  and without reliable railroad communications the Crimea would  indeed be a peninsula.... Would things be better for it then?    A conflagration is starting before our eyes, threatening to  burn hot. Why are we keeping silent? Why do we think that  embroiling millions of people in an adventure constitutes  democracy?    Over many centuries the Perekop Channel [perekopskiy rov]  has  begun to slowly close up, becoming overgrown with idyllic reeds  and losing its defense significance. How I would like to hope  that it will not be used for its real purpose at the close of  the 20th century.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 16 Jun (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, the  president of the People's Assembly of the Bosnian Serb Republic,  told TANJUG today that the maps, under review by the Contact  Group for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, were far from  acceptable for the Serbs. We have had a preliminary look at the  maps, but we are expecting some improvements, that is,  corrections. If that happens, it will be create favorable  conditions for the restoration of peace in Bosnia, Krajisnik  said. He particularly stressed that the maps, which have been  circulated, were causing concern and fears among the Serb people  that they could be imposed on the Serbs in their current form.    The maps considerably affect the vital interests of the Serb  people and, in fact, they are destroying the achievements of our  struggle for the homeland, which is impermissible. I do not  want to pass any judgments on the maps. However, I am expecting  reasonable proposals because we presented our objections and  explained why we could not accept their proposals. We also  invited the Muslims side to present their stances.    We are awaiting a response with great interest. Our reaction  to the response will in any event be in line with the proposals  adopted by the Serb Republic People's Assembly at the last two  sessions, Krajisnik said in conclusion.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Boesky on Prison Furlough: Former Wall Street stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky  was granted a temporary release from his three-year term at a California prison  camp last Thursday, authorities reported. Boesky is due back at the  minimum-security prison in Lompoc near the end of the month, said Ed Wolahan,  the prison's supervisor of education. Boesky's attorney, Leon Silverman,  declined to comment on the furlough. Wolahan said Boesky applied for the  temporary release, which was approved by the prison warden. Wolahan said  inmates who request furloughs must demonstrate a need for the release, but he  wouldn't disclose Boesky's reasons. Boesky paid $100 million and agreed to  plead guilty to one felony to settle charges three years ago in Wall Street's  biggest insider trading scandal. He will be eligible for release in April.  </P></p>

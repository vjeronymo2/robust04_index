			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / MPs told details of fraud at British Council Two frauds and a theft in the past financial year have cost the British Council more than Pounds 500,000, the Commons public accounts committee was told yesterday. Mr John Hanson, director-general of the council, a quango which operates educational services outside the UK, told the committee he 'bitterly regretted' the losses, which had led the council to abandon planned projects in several eastern European countries as well as South Africa and Malaysia. Sir John Bourn, the comptroller and auditor-general, told the committee the biggest fraud took place last September, when Pounds 520,072 was paid in foreign currency through the electronic transfer system into overseas bank accounts of bogus suppliers following the receipt of seven fraudulent payment vouchers by the council's banking section. Mr Hanson told the committee the vouchers had been put into the council's computer system by an 'external criminal gang'. The council's banking system had not been 'protected with the same barrier of controls which had been erected around the main payment system'. Mr Robert Sheldon, chairman of the committee, suggested that the vouchers 'could only have been obtained from within the system', and said 'there appears to be some criminal element within the body itself'. Mr Hanson admitted that the criminal gang had access to 'insider information', but denied that this necessarily came from a past or present British Council employee. He said the gang could have been helped by a temporary employee or contractor. The police had arrested and charged three people in connection with the fraud, and arrested a fourth, he said. None had ever been employed by the council. To date, only Pounds 19,751 had been recovered. Separately, Sir John told the committee that in February the council had discovered that a finance officer in an overseas division had defrauded the council of funds and travel tickets worth Pounds 51,861. The fraud had been difficult to discover because 'the key control checks had been delegated to the perpetrator,' Sir John said. Mr Hanson said the employee had been dismissed, tried, found guilty and was awaiting sentence. Sir John added that a member of staff had been dismissed following a burglary of Pounds 8,145 from the council's office at Victoria station in London, while transactions of about Pounds 9,000 in one of the London departments 'appeared to have been fraudulent'. Mr Hanson told the committee that the payments had involved overstated claims for overseas travel and subsistence. The employee had retired in February and could not be traced, so the money was to be retrieved by deducting from payments made to him to cover his early retirement.</p>

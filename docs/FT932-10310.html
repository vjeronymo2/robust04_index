			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Djibouti president re-elected President Hassan Gouled Aptidon of Djibouti has been re-elected to a fourth six-year term, officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Djibouti. Less than half the electorate voted in polls over the weekend which were boycotted by supporters of the opposition Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy. FRUD guerrillas control large areas in the north of the tiny Red Sea republic. Officials said Hassan, in power since independence in 1977, won 60.71 per cent of the vote, making a second round unnecessary.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Nafta trade zone is good news for Perot THE US Commerce Department has approved the establishment of a free trade zone centred on a cargo-only airport near Fort Worth, Texas, which would boost a 20,000-acre development project owned by the family of Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire. The new Alliance Airport and the surrounding area is envisioned as a crossroads for a export boom for products going on to Mexico and the rest of Latin America. Mr Perot, a leading critic of the North American Free Trade Agreement, is a minority stockholder in Hillwood Development, which plans to lease land and buildings surrounding the airport to importers seeking more favourable tariff treatment. Mr Perot's son, Mr Ross Perot Jr, is the majority stockholder and a supporter of Nafta. If the Nafta is approved by the US Congress, the airport project will benefit from its location as a trade hub. If it fails, the free trade zone designation is even more valuable. The Dallas Morning News said the 'contradiction' between the positions of the father and son has 'prompted some critics to question whether the former independent presidential candidate is playing both sides of the free trade issue'. The US has 193 federal free trade zone projects, which allow domestic business activity to take place as if it were outside US customs territory. No duties or quotas are charged on re-exports; customs duties and federal excise taxes are deferred and sometimes lowered on finished products which emerge from the zone into the US market.</p>

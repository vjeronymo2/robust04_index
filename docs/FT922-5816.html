			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Taking a stake in the colony: Chinese-backed group in HKDollars 3.8bn Hong Kong property move - Agreement underlines the transformation of commercial relations When Mr Deng Xiaoping, the 87-year-old Chinese patriarch, travelled to Guangdong in January, he was impressed with the pace of economic development. He left the local Communist party officials-turned-entrepreneurs with one message: be bolder still. Three of China's fastest growing communities are taking him at his word. The governments of Nanhai and Foshan, together with the city of Zhongshan - all in the Pearl River delta region of Guangdong province - are backing a consortium which yesterday participated in China's biggest plunge into Hong Kong's property market. They agreed to pay HKDollars 3.8bn (Pounds 270m) to Hongkong Land, the Jardine Matheson property subsidiary, for a slice of prime Hong Kong real estate. The property, which will be paid for in instalments over the next 18 months, is the recently-developed 9 Queens Road, a 301,000 sq ft office and retail office block. The price values the office space at HKDollars 10,000 per sq ft and the retail space at HKDollars 12,000 per sq ft - prices which analysts say will lead to a re-rating of landlords, especially Hongkong Land, the colony's biggest landlord. The deal puts Hongkong Land in a prime position to assume the lead role in a Jardine bid to build the colony's ninth container terminal. It also allows the company to participate in further property development in Hong Kong, or to take advantage of the distressed market conditions in the UK. 'We are in strong shape and can move quickly if we find an attractive investment', said Mr Alasdair Morrison, Hongkong Land's managing director, 'but we are in the fortunate position of being able to wait.' Two local Hong Kong companies, with impeccable mainland connections, are part of the Chinese-led consortium: Hongkong Macao Holdings, which will take 10 per cent of the property, and its associate, China Investments, which will have 5 per cent. Hongkong Macao is headed by Mr Hu Jinguang, a mainland Chinese businessman. Little is known about him, except that he left China five years ago for central America and arrived in the colony last year with a lot of money and a Panamanian passport. Mr Hu acquired a controlling interest in Hongkong Macao and, since September, has invested in Shenzhen's biggest office block, taken a controlling stake in a Beijing residential and shopping development, and bought a hotel in Guangzhou (Canton). Hongkong Macao and China Investments also said yesterday they would be buying 68m sq ft of land in Huizhou, Guangdong, for a consideration of HKDollars 620m to be paid for by the issue of shares to a company owned by the city. The involvement of the two Hong Kong companies leaves the mainland investors to fund the lion's share of the purchase from Hongkong Land. The mainland participants undoubtedly have the resources, but how they will fund their HKDollars 3.23bn obligation has been left unsaid. However, this commitment to the Hong Kong property market underlines the transformation which has taken place, in commercial matters at least, between the colony and the mainland. Since the beginning of this year, 'China' has been the dominant factor behind the performance of the Hong Kong stock market. Mainland Chinese investors have committed large sums to the market, but that is just evidence of the change in mood. It was primarily British and US investors who took the Heng Seng index through the 6,000 level this week, to leave it 42 per cent higher than its 1991 closing level. China's re-embrace of economic reform, which started with Mr Deng's visit to the south, has gathered pace and the country is now courting international investors with renewed vigour. This has heartened local investors who, sitting in Hong Kong, observe daily the economic miracle taking place across the border. Mainland companies have expanded their interest in Hong Kong through all walks of commercial life, from banking and insurance to transportation, manufacturing and retailing. Cumulative mainland investment in the colony is estimated to be in excess of USDollars 10bn (Pounds 5.5bn) - underlining that trade and investment is two-way - and controlled by literally thousands of companies. In April, China Merchants, one of the 'Four Heavenly Kings', as the big Beijing conglomerates are known in the colony, paid Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation Company Pounds 100m for a 15 per cent interest in container port operator, Modern Terminals. China Merchants' fleet already ships 10 per cent of the colony's seaborne trade. Beijing-based China International Trust and Investment Company through its listed Hong Kong subsidiary, CITIC Pacific, owns large slices of Cathay Pacific and Hongkong Telecom and is developing into a 'hong' to rival Jardine Matheson, Swire and Hutchison. 'Some people view China's purchases of assets in Hong Kong as a threat,' said Mr Richard Witts of United Mok Ying Kie, a local broker. 'But why put up good money now if they intend to march in and take it come 1997? I think it is a very positive develop-ment.' Hutchison bids for Cavendish minorities, Page 31; Lex, Page 22</p>

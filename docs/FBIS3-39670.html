			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed LVE (MTH): "Hans Van Den Broek Soon To </F> Visit FYROM [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] and  Athens"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database]    [Text] Brussels, 21 Feb (BELGA) -- Theodhoros Pangalos, the  Greek minister for European affairs, announced on Monday [21  February] that Hans Van den Broek, the European Commissioner for  external political relations, will in the next few days pay  successive visits to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  (FYROM) and Greece in an effort to identify more precisely the  reasons for the dispute between the two countries. The dispute  escalated suddenly last week, after the Greek decision to close  the port of Salonika to all trade destined for FYROM.    Mr. Pangalos, whose country currently occupies the  presidency  of the European Union Council of Ministers, continued: "The  European Commission has taken the initiative to send Hans Van  den Broek to Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Yugoslavia  -- FYROM] and then to Athens to assess the new situation in the  region. (...) The Commission decided to ask for legal  clarification enabling it to determine whether or not it should  refer the case to the European Court of Justice."    At Breydel (European Commission headquarters) it is  considered that Greek sanctions against FYROM are incompatible  with Community treaties.    A Commission spokesman said on Monday: "The Greek decisions  clearly break trading regulations."    In this type of situation, the jurisprudence of the European  Court of Justice requires that the sanctioning country must  present evidence that it is subject to "law and public safety  difficulties that it is unable to deal with," the spokesman said.    The Greek minister, who chaired a meeting of the Twelve  devoted mostly to FYROM and preparing for Tuesday's negotiations  with the four candidate countries on Community enlargement, did  not hide the fact that Greece had been the target of a running  fire of criticism from its partners in the European Twelve,  annoyed by the decision taken unilaterally by Athens and  skeptical as to its legal basis.    "Several countries have criticized the content of the Greek  Government's decision and the way in which the Greeks announced  it to their partners," he said at a news conference.    Mr. Pangalos added, however, that "the Greek Government has  decided to lay on the table all the legal arguments that  justified its decision," although he did not say what these  arguments were.    The Greek minister merely gave an enigmatic allusion to  excessive oil imports that seemed to suggest that Skopje would  be reselling part of its purchases to Belgrade, thus bypassing  the international embargo imposed on Serbia by the United  Nations.    He told journalists: "Twelve million tonnes of oil were sent  (last year) from Salonika to FYROM, while FYROM itself can only  use 5 million tonnes. It is up to you to decide where the  remaining oil ends up."</p>

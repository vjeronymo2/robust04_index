			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Birt has reluctant support from BBC staff MR JOHN BIRT may have won the support of the BBC's board of governors in the controversy over his tax affairs and employment terms. But how the affair will affect the director-general's relations with the corporation's staff, many of whom have expressed deep distaste for his management style and proposed reforms, remains to be seen. Some of his critics have, inevitably, hoped that the incident would bring about his downfall and replacement by 'somebody whom programme makers could relate to and follow, so that perhaps we would actually understand what was going on', as one documentary producer put it. Yet to judge by conversations with staff across the organisation yesterday, this may be a minority view. Although their personal sympathy for Mr Birt and his methods is limited, many concede that the BBC's interests will be best served by his remaining in office. To a large extent, this view reflects the belief that any alternative would be even worse. 'He pretty well has to stay. He's the fountain head of the only plan we've got,' said one radio producer. 'If he went and (chairman Marmaduke) Hussey went too, the BBC would face its gravest crisis ever.' He also dismissed as unworkable the idea favoured by some staff that Mr John Tusa, popular head of the World Service, should be appointed director-general, backed up by Mr Bob Phillis, recently recruited from ITN as Mr Birt's deputy. 'The trouble is that Phillis has never worked for the BBC before, and however popular Tusa would be with staff, you couldn't really expect him to take over the Birt plans with much conviction,' he said. None of Mr Birt's innovations has been more controversial than the introduction of Producer Choice, a system of market discipline and budgeting. Intended to improve efficiency, it is seen by critics as an attack on the BBC's creative resources. Yet some BBC rank and file were arguing yesterday that the system, which has been widely viewed as a way of cutting the organisation down to size, might actually be one of the most solid guarantees of independence. a member of the drama department at Television Centre said: 'Whether or not even Birt believes in Producer Choice, it seems to be effective in keeping the government off the BBC's back.' Although Mr Birt may be winning staff support by default, the BBC governors have won no plaudits for their handling of the controversy. There is a widespread belief in the organisation that someone should be made to pay the price for the affair by resigning - and that that person should be Mr Hussey.</p>

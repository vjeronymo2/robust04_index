			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Alcoa output cuts may be permanent Alcoa of Australia, the alumina producer owned jointly by Alcoa in the US and Western Mining Corporation, warned yesterday that cutbacks in production at its Portland aluminium smelter could become permanent unless it secured new power arrangements with the Victoria state authorities. The smelter - a joint venture between Alcoa, the state government, China International Trust Investment Corp (Citic), First National Resource Trust and Marubeni Aluminium Australia - said it had been advised that the state electricity commission would withdraw power supplied under a supplemental agreement with effect from January 1. This, it said, would cause the smelter to operate at an aluminium production capacity of around 300,000 tonnes a year. The smelter had already cut production by around 26,000 tonnes a year as a part of the global initiative to reduce output in response to serious international oversupply, but it was envisaged that this reduction would be temporary. The state authorities have been seeking to renegotiate the power arrangements since May 1993. The smelter owners said they would 'welcome the opportunity to agree on a satisfactory basis for acquiring additional power', but offered to waive the three-month notice period so that the withdrawal of the supplemental power would be effective immediately.</p>

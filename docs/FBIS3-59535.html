			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hafid Mahmoudi: "Transpac Tailors Offerings To </F> Compete on European Market"]    [Text] Confined to a small band in the spectrum of France  Telecom comunications offerings, being pressured to accommodate  higher data flow-rates, and taking hits from the competition,  Transpac is abandoning its X.25 label and plunging into the  market: a strategy that means changes in pricing, products, and  contracts.    "The upcoming reduction in tariffs that goes into effect on  1  January 1994 is the biggest since 1987," says Charles de  Cognets, head of central marketing and communication for  Transpac. Overall, the telecommunications operator is announcing  a reduction that is equivalent to seven percent in constant  [French] francs [Fr]. But that's not the only news from  Transpac. The menu of services offered is also in for major  changes. And client-tailored contracts are gaining ground over  services to the general public -- a change that reflects  Transpac's eagerness to shed the X.25 label still clinging to  its offerings with a view to becoming the leading supplier of  European data-sharing networks.  <H5>  Tariffs Reduced </H5>   Good news for Transpac customers: Bills will go down next  year. According to the firm, tariffs will decline 4.84 percent.  The figure is an average that takes into account discounts on  service charges, rate per kilobyte, and cost per minute for use  of virtual circuits. Monthly service charges at speeds from  4,800 bits per second [bps] to 256 kilobits per second [kbps]  are all revised downward from 1993. High transfer rates of 384  to 1,920 kilobits per second [Kbps] will make their debut in the  tariff charts. This palette of options and high-speed data  transfer rates is modeled on the one employed by the Transfix  service. By the way, the overall rate reduction cannot fail to  have a direct effect on the rates Transfix charges. But Transpac  is going a step further than its elder sibling, lowering rates  for 9,600-bps leased lines at a time when Transfix's tariff for  the same grade of service is unchanged. The discount is all the  more impressive when one considers that 9,600-bps service, along  with 19.2 Kbps, accounts for most of the direct accesses to  Transpac.    On the other hand, users who must access Transpac indirectly  will get less benefit from the declining service charges. The  cost per minute on-line via RTC [public switched telephone  network] is unchanged. Telex access costs are going up slightly,  though the rate for Numeris (channel B) is falling.    Another descending indicator is unit price per kilobyte,  which is dropping from 5.7 to 5.4 centimes. Per-minute on-line  rates are also going down. This reduction is being implemented  by simplifying the rate structure from six categories to three.  Setting the 2,400-bps CVC (Switched Virtual Circuit) service  rate equal to that charged for low-capacity links (300 and 1,200  bps) is not going to increase the profitability of the former.  At the next higher level, the cost of CVC service at 19.2 kbps  is being aligned with the reduced rate for 4,800 and 9,600-bps  service.    Finally, the cost of the highest-speed service (48 Kbps) is  unchanged. The realignment is most advantageous for CVFs  (Dedicated Virtual Circuits), with an 11 percent rate reduction.  Users of interactive applications will benefit from this change,  though it is offset by an augmentation in the price of CVPs  (permanent virtual circuits) between two direct access points.    Transpac is also introducing new services, including  synchronous direct access at 14.4 kbps. In a bid for greater  market share, it is adding LVUs (single virtual lines) to its  catalogue of offerings. These are 9,600 bps to 1,920 Kbps  virtual circuits linking two sites, with billing based on volume  calculated in either of two methods.  <H5>  Channel D </H5>   Under the first method, unit rate declines as total volume  rises. As monthly consumption increases from Fr1,000 to  Fr24,000, the rate per kilobyte decreases in six steps from 20  to 65 percent. Moreover, if the two linked sites are in the same  interchange zone, price per kilobyte is cut another 50 percent.  Better still, the off-peak hours discount is also applied to the  volume of data transferred over LVUs.    Under the second, increasingly large monthly consumption  ceilings are attached to each LVU based on the data transfer  rate. There is no added charge for traffic above these ceilings.  According to Charles de Cognets, "LVUs give our clients the  security of stable, predictable outlays." All this has to be  seen as a response to the aggressive rate structure of Transfix,  which today is Transpac's only real competitor. In practical  terms, LVU is designed for high-volume applications such as  provision of [wide area network or WAN] connectivity between  separate data processing sites or local area networks [LANs].  Another advantage: LVU starts with a 9,600-bps transfer rate  that amply meets the needs for this type of application but also  offers a range of speeds as high as two megabits per second  [Mbps]. In addition, the former LVR (rapid virtual link)  service, which catered only to the demand for medium and high  flow rates -- without much success, it must be conceded -- is  being removed from the services catalogue. Regarding WAN  link-ups, we will conclude by noting that henceforth an IP  [Internet Protocol] hook-up on Ethernet will be incorporated  into the rate. The SNA [Systems Network Architecture] option  will follow later.    In a similar vein, Transpac plans to discontinue its 300-bps  asynchronous service as of 31 December 1994. The firm also plans  gradually to increase cost of service at the next higher rung.  Thus connections at 1,200 and 2,400 bps will cost more starting  next year. In this way the operator hopes to encourage  low-volume users to migrate toward Numeris's "Channel D" service.    One might legitimately ask whether this decision does not  signal an unaknowledged intent to move away from all analog  media and focus exclusively on digital. Reinforcing this  perception, Transpac is lowering the monthly connection charge  for Channel D from Fr400 to Fr380. At the same time, the price  per kilobyte is inching down from 6 to 5.4 centimes, and cost of  the adapter unit is being reduced from Fr250 to Fr200. "The  2,400-bps ports will be the last to turn toward Numeris, because  their volume of usage is so low," explains Charles de Cognets.  "Actually it is 4,800-bps ports, the most commonly used, that  probably account for most migration to Channel D. But turnover  for the latter will still be less than that for direct  connections."    The product has yet to seduce more than a relatively small  number of clients. According to Transpac, 600 "Channel D" links  are in operation today, and all the switching units are  VN3-level. Looking ahead to 1994, the enormous contract signed  with La Francaise de Jeux for 13,800 connections probably will  account for 60 percent of installed capacity. However, the  operator claims another big account is to join the ranks of  Channel D users between now and late 1994. When first launched,  it will be recalled, the service was oriented toward PMEs [small  and medium sized enterprises] with between 10 and 500 employees,  70 percent of them Numeris users. But it seems that this type of  consumer has not yet acquired the Channel D habit.  <H5>  Split-Speed </H5>   Failure to understand the existing market partly explains  this inertia. Let us recall that as of 1993 the profitable usage  threshold is between 10 and 15 megabytes of traffic per month.  But what most inhibits Channel D's growth is the profusion of  alternative solutions -- private networks based on leased lines  or VSAT [variable aperture satellite terminals]. More and more  medium-sized enterprises, armed with their data traffic charts  and overhead analyses, are calling on Transpac to provide  service tailored to their own specifications, leaving public  rates and comparison charts to the ordinary consumer. This  "enterprise network" service, as Transpac calls it, is based on  a specially tailored contract, in which billing depends partly  on actual connection costs and utilization charges are invoiced  as a pre-agreed lump sum. This practice encourages existing  customers to remain loyal to the company, at least pending the  advent of serious competition.    Assured of a stable domestic market for at least the next  few  years, Transpac is happily prospecting for new clients in the  European market. "We find it easy to make contacts abroad,  because we enjoy the technological cachet associated with France  Telecom group," notes Charles de Cognets. This export-oriented  strategy shows Transpac's ambition to become the biggest  European data transmission operator. There are however, a few  obstacles to be overcome, namely Infonet (international  consortium of X.25 operators) and Info AG (a subsidiary of  Germany's telecommunications operator).    As for the first obstacle, Transpac and Infonet will need to  divide up the market in order not to step on each other's toes  in Europe. With regard to the second, everything depends on  Deutsche Telekom's acquiring an ownership share in France  Telecom (president Marcel Roulet is hoping for 10 percent).    Whatever happens on the international scene, a page has been  turned. And Transpac has already traded in its French X.25  mantle for a multiservice, European livery.</p>

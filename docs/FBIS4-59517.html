			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sanaa, May 14 (AFP)--A battle raged Saturday  between rival army units in the strategic region of al-Dali' as  hopes faded for Arab League mediators to secure a ceasefire in  Yemen's civil war.    The north, rejecting a southern ceasefire plan, said troops  loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih also captured the town  of Musaymir, northwest of the south's stronghold of Aden.    The south had suffered "heavy losses."    In al-Dali', 90 kilometres (55 miles) down the road from the  port city, northern forces were mopping up the last pockets of  resistance and making further advances, Sanaa said.    Southern military officials said their warplanes were  mounting raid after raid on the al-Dali' region, where  correspondents saw seven northern soldiers dead on the side of  the road, just five kilometres (three miles) from the village.    On Friday, the mountain village itself was almost deserted  apart from southern soldiers, they said. Hundreds of residents  have fled to Aden.    The two sides have not issued a casualty toll since the war  erupted on May 5, although the north said Monday that 74 of its  troops had been killed and more than 200 wounded. A Scud  missile Wednesday on Sanaa claimed 25 more lives.    Clashes were also taking place in the Abyan region, east of  Aden, but fighting had eased in Kharaz, on the coast 120  kilometres (75 miles) to the west of the city.    The south has said the war between Salih's troops and the  forces of Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, was being waged on  five fronts.    On the diplomatic front, an Arab League delegation has been  here since Thursday waiting to see the president and deliver a  call from the League's secretary general, Esmat Abdel Meguid,  for an immediate ceasefire.    A northern spokesman in Sanaa said the meeting was finally  likely to take place on Saturday.    But a source at the organisation's Cairo headquarters said  the League was not expected to make any headway because both the  south and north had toughened their positions.    The ruler of Bahrain, Amir 'Isa Bin-Sulayman Al Khalifah,  Saturday joined the ceasefire calls and urged Yemen's rival  leaders "to allow reason to prevail." [passage omitted on  previously reported cease-fire proposal]    In the latest evacuation of foreigners, more than 200  nationals of the former Soviet Union arrived Saturday in Moscow  on a flight out of Moscow, the Russian news agency ITAR-TASS  said.    The Philippines foreign ministry said at least 619  Filipinos,  including 40 children and six pregnant women, were still waiting  evacuation from Yemen.</p>

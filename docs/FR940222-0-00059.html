The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, has determined that the 1994 calendar year aggregate maximum allowable quota mandated by the International Dolphin Conservation Act (IDCA) would have been reached if additional taking of dolphins under the permit was allowed to continue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, NMFS issues a notice of a January 27, 1994, court-ordered prohibition on the taking of any of the northeastern stock of offshore spotted dolphins under the ATA permit, implemented by NMFS on February 1, 1994, and expanded by NMFS on February 4, 1994, to include all stocks of offshore spotted dolphins. This prohibition is being incorporated as a new element in the marine mammal program of the United States. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The prohibition on the taking of any dolphins under the ATA permit was effective at 0001 hours local time, February 8, 1994, until 0001 hours local time, January 1, 1995.

One of the primary purposes of the IDCA was to secure multilateral agreements between the United States and other purse seine fishing nations, establishing a 5-year moratorium on the use of purse seines to encircle marine mammals. Such a moratorium was to have taken effect beginning March 1, 1994, on which date the ATA permit would have expired. The IDCA set a maximum allowable mortality at 800 during the 14-month period beginning January 1, 1993, and ending March 1, 1994. The IDCA also required that, if there was no international agreement and the permit did not expire on March 1, 1994, the maximum allowable mortality each year could not exceed the number of dolphin mortalities that occurred under the permit during the previous year. Furthermore, total dolphin mortalities occurring under the permit each year must continue to be reduced by statistically significant amounts each year to levels approaching zero by December 31, 1999.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The U.S. fleet killed 115 dolphins in calendar year 1993. In the process of determining what would constitute a ``statistically significant'' reduction in the maximum allowable mortality under the ATA permit for the calendar year 1994, NMFS determined that the U.S. fleet had killed 107 dolphins in the period from January 1, 1994, through February 6, 1994. Given that the maximum allowable mortality under the ATA permit could not exceed 114 dolphins for the period January 1 to December 31, 1994, and given that NMFS predicts that the number of dolphins killed incidentally in the U.S. tuna purse seine fishery in the ETP would have reached 114 within a matter of days, NMFS prohibited the taking of any dolphins under the ATA permit by notice to the vessels on February 7, 1994. This prohibition will remain in effect until 0001 hours local time January 1, 1995, when the next year's dolphin quota becomes available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 27, 1994, the United States Court for the Northern District of California ordered NMFS to prohibit, effective immediately, the incidental taking under the ATA permit, of any northeastern offshore spotted dolphins in the ETP. The court order also requires NMFS to issue final regulations within 40 days of the date of the order, prohibiting the encirclement of any schools of dolphins in which northeastern offshore spotted dolphin are observed prior to release of the net skiff, and incorporating such prohibition into the comparability standards developed pursuant to section 1371(a)(2)(B) of the MMPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the January 27 court order, NMFS, on February 1, 1994, advised U.S. vessels fishing under the ATA general permit that all sets on the northeastern stock of offshore spotted dolphin were prohibited due to their recently determined status as depleted under the MMPA (58 FR 58285, Nov. 1, 1993). On February 4, 1994, these U.S. vessels were further advised that the take of all offshore spotted dolphin was prohibited effective immediately, under provisions of the court order requiring NMFS to minimize the take of northeastern offshore spotted dolphin. NMFS is developing regulations pursuant to the court order to implement these new elements of its marine mammal program. NMFS is also notifying affected foreign harvesting nations, as required by the court order, of the effective dates of the changes to the U.S. marine mammal program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action is not subject to review under E.O. 12866. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: February 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Charles Karnella, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Acting Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, National Marine Fisheries Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;3835 Filed 2&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

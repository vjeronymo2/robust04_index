			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff and Sarah Womack] </F>   [Text] John Major's grip on the Tory leadership was visibly  weakened today after a night in which his shattered party  surrendered some of its prized possessions.    Britain's most dramatic local government elections for  decades became the Conservatives' worst and most humiliating  showing of all time, as the Liberal Democrats swept to victory  after victory, with Labour making some surprising gains as well.    Conservatives stood by helpless as their power sensationally  deserted them in some of their most diehard heartlands. Now  they face a nerve-racking five weeks before the Euro-elections,  where all the signs point to further setbacks and catastrophes.  By 6am Labour had made a net gain of four councils, the Liberal  Democrats had made a net gain of nine councils and the Tories  had made a net loss of 17 councils.    In an astonishing catalogue of misery, the Tories lost  control of, or failed to capture, a series of authorities which  for decades have been Tory through and through. These  included: the flagship Basildon, the Essex seat which epitomises  Toryism, Epping Forest, Woking, Worthing, Birmingham,  Stratford-upon-Avon, Southend, Enfield and Croydon -- where they  have held power for more than a century -- and even Tunbridge  Wells.    Now, the clamour will mount -- possibly irresistibly -- for  a  leadership election in the autumn, even though Tory business  managers will warn dissidents that a challenge will plunge the  party into even further and possibly irreparable disarray. But  Michael Portillo, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, and the  choice of the Right to succeed Mr Major, insisted that the  night's "disappointments" would have the reverse effect and  rally the party behind the leader.    If the pattern of yesterday's voting is repeated at the  Euro-  elections, experts have predicted that Labour leader John Smith  would have 55 of the 86 seats, Mr Major would have 18, and Paddy  Ashdown 10. Repeated in a general election, today's figures  would also give Labour a massive 125 overall majority in the  House of Commons.    At the Liberal Democrat headquarters the party celebrated a  night of triumphs -- flawed only by a blemish at the troubled  East End Tower Hamlets council, the scene of allegations of  racist campaigning. And jubilant Labour not only ousted the  Liberal Democrats from control, but celebrated, too, their  defeat of the British National Party in the Millwall ward --  "the most important ward in Britain tonight", said Frank Dobson,  Labour's election coordinator. The Liberal Democrat trophies  included Eastleigh in Hampshire -- where the Tories will soon be  defending a vital parliamentary by-election. All the signs are  now that the Conservatives' 17,000-plus majority at the general  election will be wiped out by Paddy Ashdown's party. Paddy  Ashdown was in ebullient mood. He told PA News: "The Liberal  Democrats are the clear winners in these elections. This has  been a vote of confidence in the Liberal Democrat councils,  councillors and campaigners." The Liberal Democrat roll of  triumph is Worthing (from the Conservatives) plus, Bath,  Colchester, Congleton, Eastleigh, Kingston-upon-Thames, Mole  Valley, Rochford, St Albans and Winchester, all of which had no  overall control.    The Tory loss of Basildon, where John Major personally  campaigned, was a bitter blow. But even worse was the failure  to capture Birmingham from Labour, whose management of the city  has been pilloried ceaselessly and without mercy by ministers.  Birmingham was Target Number One on the Tory hit-list. But  Labour managed to keep control. Labour gained Croydon, Enfield  and Welwyn Hatfield from the Tories. Croydon was a special  prize, in that it has been in Tory hands for more than a  century. And the victory at Enfield is a direct body-blow for  Michael Portillo, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Tories'  London election coordinator. But Labour lost control at  Kirklees, Oldham and Pendle. Even so, John Smith the Opposition  leader, commented: "This has been a splendid night for Labour.  "We have achieved far more than could have been expected, in  particular the stunning victories in Croydon and Enfield, a  swing to Labour in Birmingham and the destruction of the  Liberals in Tower Hamlets."    Conservative chairman Sir Norman Fowler's assertion that  they  would emerge with net gains now has a hollow ring about it. But  he underlined his view -- shared by Michael Portillo -- that the  Prime Minister is safe in his job. Mr Portillo said the night's  "disappointments" meant that the party would rally behind the  Prime Minister. "These are disappointing mid-term results.  But we will recover from them. What has happened is that some  Conservative voters stayed at home. They did not transfer over  to Labour."</p>

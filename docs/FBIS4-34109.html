			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 14 Jun (PL) -- Nicaraguan  President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro announced here today that  the Central American nations have granted her country most  favored nation status, according to the agreements reached this  past weekend.    The decision was reached during a meeting between the  Central  American presidents, just hours before leaving together for this  Colombian City, to attend the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. The  Nicaraguan leader did not disclose the details of the agreement.    In her speech before the 21 other participating leaders,  Violeta Barrios fiercely defended the privatization process,  while downplaying the poverty situation in Latin America,  particularly in Nicaragua.    In an address tainted by many diction errors and mistaken  names and places, the leader used the better part of the seven  minutes granted to each president, to overestimate the  Nicaraguan democratic situation.</p>

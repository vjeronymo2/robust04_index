			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Defence of Lamont version of events THIS statement was released by the British Treasury yesterday afternoon in a prompt response to the document released by the German embassy in London. Late last night Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign minister, added their names to the Treasury statement. On Monday, the German Ambassador called on the Permanent Under Secretary to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and handed over a paper sent to him personally by the Bundesbank President Dr Schlesinger. The paper sought to rebut allegations over the Bundesbank's recent conduct in relation to sterling. The Ambassador asked that the paper be considered confidential. Earlier today and without warning, the German Embassy, on behalf of the Bundesbank, made available an almost complete version of the paper. The first point Dr Schlesinger makes is that in his interview with Handelsblatt, published on Thursday 17 September, he was supportive of sterling's position. However, this misses the point. By 17 September, sterling had been forced out of the ERM. The problem arose not from the reports published on 17 September, but from what was published on the morning of 16 September, early reports of which began to circulate on the evening of 15 September. This earlier version said: 'In an interview with the Handelsblatt and Wall Street Journal, (Dr Schlesinger) conceded that the problems had not been completely solved by the measures so far. The situation in the EMS could have been further eased if there had been a more comprehensive realignment.' Against a history of reports emanating from the Bundesbank, this was inevitably interpreted as a reference to sterling. On learning of these reports, the UK authorities asked Dr Schlesinger if these reports were true, and, if they were not, whether he would issue a clear denial. Eventually, and after sterling had fallen outside its ERM bands in New York trading, the Bundesbank issued a statement saying: 'The text was not authorised. He did not say that, and it was not what he intended to say.' The markets and the media did not find this a convincing denial with very damaging effects for sterling. Had the version eventually published on 17 September been issued instead, events may have turned out differently. Later in the paper, Dr Schlesinger claims that the Bundesbank undertook substantial intervention in support of sterling. The UK Government has never claimed that the Bundesbank did not comply with its technical obligations under the ERM. We have simply noted the very public way in which statements of support for the franc were made, in contrast to the undermining statements made in relation to sterling. Finally the paper implies that the Bundesbank sought a realignment of several currencies on the weekend of 11/12 September. No request was made by the German authorities to the UK on that weekend that it too should realign.</p>

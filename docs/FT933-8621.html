			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Unit tumbles and incurs Pounds 388,013 losses UNIT Group, the USM-quoted maker of timber pallets, tumbled to Pounds 388,013 in the red for the year ended March 31. Last time there were pre-tax profits of Pounds 138,971. Mr John Adams, the chairman, said the results were a great disappointment and reflected the extremely difficult conditions in the pallet industry. The main problems were the fall in volumes as a consequence of recession on its customers and an increase in the cost of timber as a result of the fall in the value of sterling. Turnover declined to Pounds 18.9m (Pounds 21.2m) and operating losses amounted to Pounds 67,347 (Pounds 650,930 profits). The pre-tax result was after interest and similar charges of Pounds 320,666 (Pounds 511,959). Losses per share emerged at 6.3p against earnings of 0.8p. Although trading losses had continued into the current year, Mr Adams said the board had and would continue to take action to restore profitability as soon as possible.</p>

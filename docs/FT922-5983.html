			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / French trade surplus at record level in April FRANCE had a record FFr7.79bn (Pounds 780m) trade surplus last month, thanks to continued growth in industrial exports. It was the fourth consecutive monthly surplus and brings to FFr12.8bn the seasonally corrected surplus since the beginning of the year - a sharp swing from the FFr16.49bn deficit in the same period of 1991. Exports last month rose by 2.6 per cent over the March level to FFr109.66bn, while imports fell by 3.6 per cent to FFr101.87bn. The surplus on the industrial account was FFr5.65bn, against a FFr119m deficit in March. Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister, said the surplus underlined French companies' competitivness. Their performance has been strongest in other European Community countries, with which France recorded a FFr6.03bn surplus last month, after a FFr2.26bn surplus in March.</p>

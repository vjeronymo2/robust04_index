			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Japan on Friday [3 June]  expressed support for a U.N. Security Council resolution which  called for a cease-fire in Yemen's month-old civil war, and  strongly urged all parties concerned to comply with the  resolution.    In a Foreign Ministry statement read by spokesman Terusuke  Terada, the Japanese Government expressed "deep regret" that  large- scale armed conflicts in Yemen, which broke out on May 4,  have caused a number of civilian casualties and damaged Yemen's  nation- building efforts to which Japan has greatly contributed.    Japan has supported the unity and democratization of Yemen  and a peaceful settlement of the problems through dialogue among  all those concerned, it said.    Tokyo supports the U.N. Resolution 924 adopted Wednesday and  welcomes Yemen's declaration confirming its acceptance and its  readiness to implement the resolution, the statement said.    Japan strongly hopes that all those concerned will earnestly  comply with the resolution, it said.    The socialist South Yemen and conservative North Yemen  merged  on May 22, 1990. But civil war erupted in early May after  months of increasing tension, with southerners accusing the  north of trying to dominate the republic.</p>

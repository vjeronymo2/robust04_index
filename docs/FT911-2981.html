			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (38): Clowns or beauties still light up the collector - Alternative Investments / Most cigarette cards are worth little, but a rare set may fetch a fancy price AN AMERICAN collecting fanatic last month paid Dollars 450,000 (Pounds 254,000) for a cigarette card. But don't bother ransacking the attic for that old box containing the cards of your childhood. This was the one-off price needed to acquire the most perfect example of the rarest and most desirable card in the market. It is a portrait of the baseball player Honus Wagner, a big name around 1910. Wagner was an ardent anti-smoker, and when he discovered that his likeness was being used to promote sales of cigarettes he asked the tobacco company to withdraw the card. Fewer than 40 Wagner cards are known to have survived, and less than 10 are in good condition. This one is the finest: hence the price. Most cigarette cards are virtually worthless. They were produced in their billions in the UK and the US from the 1880s up to the second world war. But they have always been collected, first by small boys, and now mainly by middle aged men, nostalgic about their youth. (For some reason they have minimal appeal to women). And the rarer sets, especially those of the pre-1920 period, go for fancy prices: the British record is the Pounds 17,050 paid at Phillips in 1987 for a set of 20 Taddy's Clowns. This was quite exceptional. Two rich collectors had been trying for years to acquire these rare cards, of which only 15 complete sets are known, for their holdings and they chased each other up in the saleroom. If a set of Taddy's Clowns appeared on the market now, it would probably go for around Pounds 7,000 - the underbidder on the record price was soon able to complete his set, reducing the demand. The same fanaticism fuels the search for cards from an even rarer set, 'Tobacco Leaf Girls', Edwardian beauties who have maintained their appeal. One card could make Pounds 800; perhaps much more if two collectors need it to complete the set of 20. The highest prices tend to be paid for the earliest cards, such as 'Pirates', by the American manufacturers Allen &amp; Ginter in 1888 and valued at over Pounds 300 a set. The only post-1930 set to attract exceptional prices is the 'Life of Edward VIII', which disappeared from the streets as quickly as the monarch. A set might cost Pounds 1,500. Around 15,000 sets of cards were issued in the UK. By the 1920s, Wills and Players had bought out most of the smaller cigarette makers, like Taddy, Kinnear, Duke &amp; Sons, Richmond Cavendish and Salmon &amp; Gluckstein; and for almost two decades were pumping out annually new sets by the hundred. Today, they can usually be bought for around Pounds 10 a set, with really popular subjects, like the Kings and Queens of England, produced in massive quantities in the 1930s, worth now around Pounds 5 - less if the cards are stuck in one of the books published by the tobacco companies to encourage loyalty to the brand. Serious collectors place their cards in protective plastic covers. As well as rarity, condition is all-important: creased or dog eared cards have minimal appeal. The low value of most cards means that, these days, the auction houses tend to sell them in vast job-lots - if they sell them at all. Phillips still includes cigarette cards in its sales of books or collectables at its rooms in Leeds, Ipswich, and Sherborne, as well as at London West Two. Christie's South Kensington now has two substantial sales a year and confines appropriate cigarette cards to specialist auctions - on such subjects as cricket, fishing and aviation. Generally, a saleroom lot which contains a few rare cards and carries an estimate of up to Pounds 100 sells at around its target. The lots containing thousands of popular cards from mixed sets, and with estimates up to Pounds 300, sometimes make much more as dealers compete for the hoard. These cards will then be matched into sets and retailed at collector's fairs or street antique stalls with a substantial mark-up. There are specialist dealers who tend to offer a postal service. They can be tracked down through the periodical Card Times. But around 70 per cent of the lots at auction go to private buyers, who might do some weekend trading of their spares to finance their hobby. Christie's South Kensington noticed that prices in its October 18 sale were appreciably higher than in the spring of 1990 when demand was weak: perhaps the cutback in the number of auctions had left the dealers short of stock. This would account for a job-lot of 129 complete sets, including many pre-1920, selling for Pounds 4,620, as against a top estimate of Pounds 500. A Phillips auction in Leeds, in late February, also suggested a healthy market. One lot, consisting of cards from FJ Smith's 'Cricketers' - as well as 'War Incidents (First Series)' and 'British Butterflies', from Godfrey Phillips - made Pounds 297, against a top estimate of Pounds 50. Twenty-four full sets of natural history and sport, conservatively estimated at up to Pounds 100, went for Pounds 407. It does not matter too much if a set is not complete - it is usually possible to acquire from a dealer the missing cards. But it is hard to predict price frenzy among the cigarette cards. The collectors are getting older; the likely frequency of rare cards appearing for sale is known; price levels have moved in line with inflation, but no more. Certain areas are perenially attractive to collectors, like cards of cricketers, which have shown an impressive rise in value in the past decade. This has now levelled off. Boxers seem currently to be attracting attention, joining Edwardian beauties as bankable propositions. Anyone with a little surplus income could form an impressive cigarette card collection quite quickly and painlessly. But this misses the point. The attraction for enthusiasts lies in slowly assembling sets in a particular area - sporting cards, military cards, pre-1910 cards, cards produced by lesser-known cigarette-makers - and pouring over the inevitable card stall at a boot-sale or at a Sunday morning gathering of like-minded collectors, trading and exchanging until the holding is complete. Few areas offer the thrill of the chase with quite so many possibilities of success. And there is undoubted investment potential among the earlier, rarer, cards.</p>

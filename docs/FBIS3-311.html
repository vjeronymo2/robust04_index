They have  accepted international mediation in principle to resolve South  Africa's deadlock. This followed an alliance meeting in Cape  Town today. Conrad Burke reports:    [Burke] [passage omitted] The names of possible mediators  that have been suggested so far include the Italian-based Venus  Commission, the German Constitutional Court, the Swiss-based  International Institute for Federalism, American former Chief  Justice Warren Burger, and the Carter Center, which has been  involved in Ethiopia. But getting this together could take time.    On the other hand, if the ANC [African National Congress]  and  the Government signal a positive response, the Freedom  Alliance's parties could go ahead and register before midnight  tomorrow and tighten up on the nuts and bolts of mediation over  several days. There is a slim possibility that the registration  deadline could be amended, but even this won't afford them much  time. Candidates' lists need to be submitted in six days' time.

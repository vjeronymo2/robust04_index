			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One CFR part (44 CFR part 403), which places restrictions on transportation movements and the transportation of goods to North Korea or the Communist-controlled area of Vietnam, is jointly administered by the Department of Transportation and the Department of Commerce. This part will be the subject of joint agency rulemaking at a later date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14 CFR parts 300, 302, 303, 325 and 385 are procedural and organizational regulations concerning aviation economic proceedings. All references to the Assistant Secretary for Policy and International Affairs are being changed to the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs, and a minor editorial change is being made to &sect;302.22a(b)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 49 CFR part 1 describes the organization of the Department of Transportation and provides for the performance of duties imposed upon, and the exercise of powers vested in, the Secretary of Transportation by law. Delegations to the Assistant Secretary for Policy and International Affairs are being transferred to the Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy and to the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs, as appropriate. Delegations to the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs are being transferred to the Assistant to the Secretary and Director of Public Affairs. Further, &sect;&sect;1.22 and 1.23 are being revised not only to reflect the structure and responsibilities of the Office of the Secretary as a result of these delegations, but also to reflect the structure and responsibilities of the Office as a result of earlier reorganizations. Finally, minor editorial changes are being made to &sect;&sect;1.43(c) and 1.65(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 49 CFR part 7 implements the Freedom of Information Act, and prescribes rules governing the availability to the public of records of the Department of Transportation. Consistent with the delegation of authority to the Assistant General Counsel for Environmental, Civil Rights, and General Law in 49 CFR 1.57b, references to the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs in part 7 are being changed to the Assistant General Counsel for Environmental, Civil Rights, and General Law. A minor editorial change is also being made to &sect;7.53(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 49 CFR part 8 sets forth procedures for the classification and declassification of national security information and material. Authority to classify information is being transferred from the Assistant Secretary for Policy and International Affairs to both the Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy and the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs, and a minor editorial change is being made to &sect;8.11(b)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, 49 CFR part 28 carries out provisions of existing law that prohibit discrimination on the basis of handicap in programs or activities conducted by Executive agencies, including this Department. Certain compliance procedures for which the Assistant Secretary for Policy and International Affairs was responsible will now be the responsibility of the Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since this rule relates to departmental management, organization, procedure, and practice, notice and public comment are unnecessary. For the same reason, good cause exists for not publishing this rule at least 30 days before its effective date, as is ordinarily required by 5 U.S.C. 553(d). Therefore, this rule is effective on the date of its publication. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In consideration of the foregoing, and under the authority of 49 U.S.C. 322, parts 300, 302, 303, 325 and 385 of title 14 and parts 1, 7, 8, and part 28 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, are amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> TITLE 14_AERONAUTICS AND SPACE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;&sect;300.0, 302.1, 302.22a, 303.02, 325.7, 325.8, 385.1, 385.13, 385.14  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> [Amended] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. In chapter II of 14 CFR, the words ``Assistant Secretary for Policy and International Affairs'' are revised to read ``Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs'' wherever they appear in the following places: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "A Few Words to Our ITAR-TASS </F> Colleagues"]    [Text] The commentary "Dangerous Fishing in Black Sea of  Disinformation Threatens To Aggravate Russian-Ukrainian  Relations," published in IZVESTIYA 7 April, elicited a pointed  reaction from our ITAR-TASS colleagues -- a reaction which, in  general, is understandable. The point is that the article,  which speaks of the danger of an information war, contains a  reference to a report by the agency's correspondent on Ukrainian  Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy's flight to Crimea. The  correspondent referred to information received at the Black Sea  Staff. The information had not been confirmed, which fact  ITAR-TASS at once reported, but the agency tape did not reach  our observer's desk. It did not have time to. This is why, in  denying the information on the Ukrainian defense minister's  trip, he cites not ITAR-TASS but reports by our correspondent in  Crimea and other sources.    We know that ITAR-TASS staffers work to a rigid real-time  regime. Information which is received is passed on instantly.  The editorial office really did not wish to cast even a shadow  of suspicion on the agency, whose materials it readily uses.    Even without us there are enough people ready and willing to  shift onto journalists the responsibility for inaccurate  information received from trustworthy sources. For example, a  "technical error" gets through in an official report, and they  call journalists to account, although it was prepared by  politicians. Meanwhile the agency was merely fulfilling one of  its important functions -- that of acting as middle-man between  the public and the organs of power.</p>

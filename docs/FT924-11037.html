			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Warning on N America reinsurance in London NORTH American insurance companies will face potentially steep increases in premium rates when they come to renew annual reinsurance programmes in London over the next few weeks. Underwriters at Lloyd's of London and in the wider company market have been stung into action by losses from Hurricane Andrew, which devastated parts of Florida and Louisiana in August. 'For the primary insurer the message for the future is simple. Reinsurance is going to become scarcer and more expensive to buy,' Mr Dick Hazell, deputy chairman of Lloyd's told a meeting of US insurers yesterday. Insured losses from Andrew were recently estimated at Dollars 10.2bn (Pounds 6.2bn), but brokers and underwriters believe losses could exceed Dollars 14bn. Reinsurers can expect to pick up Dollars 8bn of the bill, with the London market bearing up to 30 per cent of the cost. Mr Hazell said the London market would offer less cover and higher limits. Policy terms and conditions could be tightened.</p>

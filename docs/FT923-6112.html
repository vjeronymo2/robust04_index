			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Moody's cuts ratings of DKB and Mitsubishi MOODY'S Investors Service, the US credit agency, yesterday lowered ratings of two Japanese commercial banks, Dai-Ichi Kangyo and Mitsubishi. The downgrade of two of the most conservatively run commercial banks, from Aa1 to Aa3, shows the extent of deterioration of property related assets at Japanese banks. Moody's referred to DKB's involvement in the restructuring of financial companies which lent heavily to property related developments. DKB is likely to face further asset quality deterioration owing to direct and indirect property related exposure domestically and internationally. DKB is also burdened by higher overhead costs, thus making its low profit margins more vulnerable to a rise in non-performing loans. Mitsubishi faces exposure to the weak US property market through Bank of California, its US subsidiary. The bank also faces exposure to the property market through its non-bank financial affiliates. Moody's said Mitsubishi faces a competitive disadvantage because of its weak core profitability and low penetration in the domestic retail market. It added that although the bank's core earnings are improving due to higher interest rate profit margins, the increasing problems in assets quality could jeopardise the bank's financial performance in the medium term.</p>

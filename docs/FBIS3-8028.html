			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Adam Tanski, chairman of the State Treasury </F> Agricultural Property Agency, by correspondent Halina Zielinska;  place and date not given]    [Text] [Zielinska] Mr. Chairman, it is now two years  since your agency was set up, and we still cannot see even the  beginning of the end--that is, the end of the process of the  privatization of Polish agriculture. Why is your progress so  poor in that area?    [Tanski] I must say I disagree with you completely. Our  progress is by no means "poor," but actually quite good. You  must take into account that it has not been "all of two years"  but "only two years," which, in practice, has meant 18 months of  our activity in a fully developed structure. During that time,  we managed to take over the assets of all of the state farms and  more than 40 percent of the assets at the disposal of the State  Land Fund. And we began in extremely difficult circumstances,  with only a small group of dedicated enthusiasts committed to  the idea of the future transformations and resistant to all  attacks and accusations....    [Zielinska] What attacks? What accusations?    [Tanski] Well, all kinds of interests happen to come into  conflict with one another as a result of the new privatization  schemes. Previous employees of the state farms [PGR] currently  under privatization often dream of getting the land for  themselves. Now and again you still come across the slogan  "Share out the land!," which was invoked, most irresponsibly, in  my opinion, by people who at the time controlled the state's  agricultural policy.    Former PGR directors cherish different expectations than  either local farmers or self-government structures, which in  their turn view the privatization process in the light of their  parishes' interests. However we look at it, these interests are  often in conflict with one another as well as with the interests  of the state treasury, to which the land belongs.    [Zielinska] You can often hear the view that it is quite  hard to find buyers ready to purchase reprivatized land.  Especially in the northeast of Poland, where whole fields are  often to be found lying fallow.    [Tanski] It is true that situations do happen when land is  left fallow during the period when, say, the privatization  process is under way, when the old owner is gone and we have not  yet managed to find his successor. But it also happens--quite  often, too--that instances of land left to waste are the result  of the agricultural policy inherited from the time when the PGR  farm acreage statistics were artificially increased by the  addition of grade V and grade VI land to the records, even if  production on those sites was too expensive and unprofitable  because of low soil quality. The market economy principles  currently obtaining have naturally verified the land grading  system, and I believe that this process is healthy and natural.    [Zielinska] Another irritating development is that land sale  auctions are inevitably won by local setups or interest  groups....    [Tanski] The auction operations are merely the end element  of the whole process because a long process has to take place  before land is put up for sale by auction: It must be assessed,  valued, and restructured according to a program drafted by our  experts. This is in order to prepare healthy farms, free from  excess poor quality land, capable of high production and able to  function in the free market situation. And all of our auctions  are organized in a way that precludes the possibility of  corruption. Each is mandatorily attended by a notary official  who collects the tenders, and by a director from our own agency;  all decisions are made by an auction commission.    You voiced an objection to "local setups." But these are  fine as long as they are groups of local people who have  sufficient financial credibility, with a leading shareholder,  and a good chance of attracting external finance. Why should we  object to them?    On the other hand, it is true that sometimes interested  local  groups attempt to bend the rules to serve their own interests by  proclaiming loudly that they are entitled to the land they want  because they had been attached to it.    [Zielinska] Are you talking about Andrzej Lepper?    [Tanski] Not only him. In my opinion, in Lepper's case the  aim was to take advantage of the fabricated conflict for  political reasons. When we comment widely on such developments,  we play into the hands of people who are only too keen to figure  in front page news.    Such incidents have taken place several times already,  although they were not particularly highlighted by the press.  For example, we came across such a campaign in Lysomice near  Torun, when our office was forcibly occupied and we were forced  to ask the police to intervene. This sort of action amounts to  a breach of the law, and it should be unequivocally condemned,  with all of the attendant consequences. And nothing more need  be said about it.    [Zielinska] What are your relations with the Polish Peasant  Party [PSL] and the Pawlak government?    [Tanski] During the past few months, we encountered no  particular problems associated with the fact that a government  coalition had assumed power. We do not need to convince anyone  that privatization of the agricultural sector will bring  immediate and tangible effects. We have only those problems to  contend with, with which we had already grappled before.    [Zielinska] Does the PSL or the coalition government not  want to post their own men within your Agency?    [Tanski] That would be a secondary concern. For the time  being, as you see, I persist in my office, I function  adequately, and I do not believe I look despondent at all. Of  course, as any other high state official, I must be prepared for  the possibility that I might be recalled one day, but I do not  believe that this must not make any difference to the quality of  my work in the present office: It should never bear the stamp  of a "temporary job."    [Zielinska] You mentioned certain problems.    [Tanski] Yes. Our worst problem at the moment is the  question of PGR debts. Let me remind you that we take over the  PGR's, which are under liquidation, which means inheriting all  of their assets as well as their debt liabilities.  Unfortunately, the latter are quite massive: We estimate that  they reach 20 trillion zlotys [Z]. Furthermore, you must  remember that our creditors are institutions that must not be  allowed to collapse because that would hurt the agricultural  sector too much. Consequently, we seek a compromise that could  be reached by instituting talks with the banks on the terms of a  possible settlement, which would give a chance to both sides.    Our second problem is the need to find credible customers  willing to buy or rent the privatized properties. Here we are  only partly successful because the lack of free capital in  Poland presents a serious obstacle in this area. That is why we  welcome engagement of foreign capital.    The last problem is unemployment. Previously, this was  hidden because PGR structures made it possible to conceal it,  but the present transformations have uncovered and highlighted  it very plainly. The phenomenon is particularly troublesome  because it is concentrated in Poland's northern and western  regions, where almost half of our farms are situated. People  who live there have no alternative employment opportunities,  while we, unfortunately, are unable to create so-called  individual family farms, whose size would be limited to 20-30  hectares. Nevertheless, we are doing our best to activate for  that purpose certain currently "underused" credit lines, which  had been granted to us by the World Bank. We also intend to try  to activate production in those farms that we have "liberated"  from their debt liabilities after taking them over. We believe  that it is possible to acquire finance for that purpose from the  Labor Fund. We also expect that the government will take  appropriate steps to assist us in the funding of our operations.  Otherwise, the employees of our farms will end up as clients of  employment offices, applying for money that ultimately comes  from the same source but that would then be handed to them in  the form of unemployment benefits.</p>

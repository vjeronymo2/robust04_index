			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, May 10, BNS -- The Estonian Minister of  Justice, Kaido Kama, today criticized a bill on crimes against  humanity and war crimes submitted to the parliament by the  legislative body's so-called KGB commission.    The bill, which Kama said needs taking back as immature, is  aimed toward establishing rules for the legal prosecution of  activists of serial executions and mass deportations carried out  in Estonia after the Soviet takeover in 1940, during World War  II and the following almost decade of violent suppression by  Stalin's regime.    The legislation was submitted by the parliamentary  commission  for investigation into the activities of the KGB and other  foreign secret services in Estonia.    Kama said the parliamentary commission had submitted a "raw  version" of the Justice Ministry's bill which the ministry had  just turned over to other departments for coordination.    Although Estonia has joined the respective international  conventions, it so far lacks legislation of its own to allow to  start criminal proceedings against persons suspected of such  crimes, the minister said.    The bill is now expected to be discussed by the legislative  body as early as this week.    MP [member of parliament] Enn Tarto, a former political  prisoner who heads the parliament's KGB commission, has told  reporters his commission has got evidence against a number of  persons who could be convicted for war crimes.    "We have turned over to the State Prosecutor's Office  materials and documents about persons who organized and carried  out the June 13 and July 1-4, 1941, and March 25-28, 1945, mass  deportations and the 1951 deportation of members of non-majority  Christian denominations," Tarto said.    "The prosecutor's office turned these materials over to the  Defense Police, who refused to start a criminal case. Now the  materials have been sent back to the State Prosecutor's Office  and the whole case hangs in the air," he added.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: In-depth study would show a different picture of Jersey Sir, Your survey on Jersey (March 22) was far from being an in-depth study into the current state of the island. Its principal weakness lies in its focus on the same old faces that have dominated the scene for much of the past 30 years. Their version of reality paints a glossy picture of financial probity, political stability and a general state of well-being that contrasts with the rest of the world. In this respect, the text mirrored the photographs, carefully contrived to avoid reference to the unpleasant side-effects of uninhibited growth such as over-population; pollution stemming from rising volumes of domestic waste and an over-intensive agricultural system; ugly architecture which has greatly diminished our heritage; price inflation; the complete absence of consumer or labour protection; and the subversion of the democratic ideal. As newly elected politicians, we are greatly concerned that the Bailiff, an unelected Crown Officer, should use the FT survey to criticise the recent measure to provide politicians with a very modest allowance to cover their living costs. We have no doubt that it suited the Bailiff, and many like him, to have in place a system which precluded the vast majority of islanders from standing for office. For decades the States of Jersey has been dominated by land owning and small business interests. Old-boyism and incompetence have been rife. At the 1993 elections, the voters opted for a new breed of radical politicians committed to an agenda of social reform and environmental protection. These voices have, by and large, been ignored by an intentionally anti-democratic power structure. Confronted by an electorate that is hungry for change, the old guard is fighting back by refusing to share out power through the committee system of government, and by clogging up the law-drafting process with legislation catering to the needs of international finance capital. The message is loud and clear: we can do anything we like as long as we do not interfere with the status quo. So much for democracy.

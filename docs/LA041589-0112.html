			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANTI-DRUG PROGRAM WILL BE EXPANDED  </P> <P> An anti-drug education program taught by Los Angeles police officers at public  schools has been expanded to include 10 private and parochial schools, and by  next year as many as 70,000 students in the city's non-public schools could  participate, officials said.  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley, Police Chief Daryl F. Gates and Archbishop Roger M. Mahony  announced the expansion of the Drug Abuse Resistance Education program at  Normandie Christian School before an auditorium full of fifth- and  sixth-graders who have attended DARE classes for nine weeks.  </P> <P> Officials said they will offer the program next year to every private and  parochial school in the city with more than 200 students. The new focus is not  the result of specific drug problems in the schools, they said, but because  students from all schools face pressures and temptations that can draw them  into drug abuse. "Drug abuse is simply nonsectarian," Mahony said.  </P> <P> The city, along with private and corporate backers of the DARE program, will  pay for the expansion. The cost will be about $250,000 for five additional  full-time officers needed next year to teach the program in as many as 162  private schools.  </P></p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Tokyo sets the pace for further losses ATTEMPTS IN the UK stock market to find a stable footing after last week's setback were undermined overnight by the plunge in the Nikkei average, and yesterday brought further losses across the range of UK equities. There was no great weight of selling but London's weakness deepened after Wall Street opened the new session in poor form. Worries over the Japanese stock market, where some UK analysts fear that the Nikkei could face a further setback, and also over the outlook for Wall Street, strengthened London's fears over the sluggishness in world economies. UK investors continued to back away from cyclical stocks, and increased holdings of defensive sectors only very sparingly. Once again, economic factors were largely ignored, a narrowing of the UK trade deficit in May having no effect in the stock market. It was an entirely negative session. The FT-SE Index opened nearly 12 points off at what proved to be the day's best, and closed almost 35 down at the session's low. The final reading of 2,550.3 showed a fall of 34.5. Some lines of stock in leading companies came on offer but trading volume across the market was not on any great scale. Seaq-reported business totalled 371.8m shares, against Friday's 440.6m. The total was swollen at the close when a fairly large programme, mostly on the sell side, was printed; the trades taking place earlier in the session. Traders believed that many fund managers were content to stay out of a market now looking thoroughly nervous. Some managers were creaming the last of their profits on shares bought just before the general election at the beginning of April, when the Footsie stood more than 100 points lower than last night's close. The shadow of GPA's pulled share issue continued to hang over the stock market, which concentrated on plans for the international offer of stock in Wellcome, the UK drugs group. However, there was a ready response for a Pounds 34m share placing by Hays, the business services group, to purchase a French food distributor. Good preliminary interest was also reported for the planned flotation of the Daily Telegraph, ahead of the prospectus expected today. The overall picture was of a market still overshadowed by the Maastricht debate, in spite of the 'yes' vote in the Irish Republic, and the prolonged agony imposed by the domestic recession. The new, and potentially disturbing, factor is the fresh weakness in the Nikkei Average, which some UK analysts see dropping to between 12,000 and 13,000 and putting pressure on the US market. Against this is a belief, expressed this weekend by SG Warburg Securities, that the UK market represents good value and is in danger of 'overshooting on the bear tack'. The strategy team at Kleinwort Benson predicts a mild downward drift this week, but warns that if the Dow Average breaks downwards then the UK is likely to follow. Mr Peter Thorne, at Nikko, expects the market to stay around Footsie 2,550-2,600 for the present, with volume remaining at its current low levels.</p>

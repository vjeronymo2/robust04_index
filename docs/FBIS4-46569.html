Yu.M. Perunov has been Scientific Production  Association (NPO) Chief Designer since 1987. The NPO develops  and produces electronic warfare (EW) weapons. "Gradiyent" VNII  [All-Union Scientific Research Institute] (Rostov), where Yuriy  Mitrofanovich was the director until 1987, is part of this  association.    [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] Yuriy Mitrofanovich,  does the NPO imeni P.S. Pleshakov exist right now and, if it  does, in what form?    [Perunov] Under new conditions, the NPO is being transformed  into an associative type association with those same missions  and in that same composition that it was, with the exception of  the enterprises that are on the territory of the countries of  the former USSR. There is approval for entry into the  association of enterprises of the former Minelektronprom  [Ministry of the Electronics Industry], specifically, "Almaz"  NPO (Saratov). This will permit us to more effectively and  purposefully accomplish the missions of developing the latest  models of equipment and their modernization.    The Future Planning, Prediction, Development and Foreign  Economic Activities Center has been organized under the Chief  Designer to ensure coordination of the work and to improve  interrelations with our customers, including foreign customers.    [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] How do matters stand  with orders in the NPO?    [Perunov] The policy of wholesale conversion did not bypass  the association, just like the entire defense industry, and  therefore practically all customers do not have the required  resources for their financing when a packet of orders is  available. If the work that we previously accomplished is  somehow still being supported with financing, then new work,  especially scientific-research work, is practically not being  paid for.    There is one more distinctive feature in the financing of  our  work. EW systems are normally installed on certain land-based,  airborne and maritime-based platforms. In the majority of cases,  the cessation of financing of our work has been associated with  the fact that the development of the platform is being  terminated. The enterprise certainly has a broad sphere of work  in relation to the modernization of previously developed and  series-produced systems. However, the shortfall in financing is  also holding back this direction.    In 1992, the NPO's enterprises on average were supplied with  approximately 50% of the financing required and this  figure  totaled from 20-80% for individual enterprises.    [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] Will your enterprises  manage to retain cadres? How will wages be paid at those  enterprises that are being poorly financed?    [Perunov] The situation is taking shape as follows. We are  partially supplementing the shortage of resources for state  orders using budget resources that are being allotted for  conversion, furthermore, we are manufacturing household  appliances. However, the resources received are clearly  inadequate which has naturally resulted in an approximately  30%  reduction in the number of workers. Unfortunately, as a rule,  the best cadres are leaving.    In order to ensure the required wage level, we are  attempting  to find that customer or those orders that would give us the  capability to employ so-called dual use technologies for  civilian production.    [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] What work is being  conducted at your association in the context of conversion?    [Perunov] The NPO has repeatedly proposed conversion  programs. The appropriate plans, tasks, and executors exist.  However, the state is allotting very limited resources for  conversion which is impacting the effectiveness of putting these  plans into effect. Commercial structures and banks practically  do not resort to long-term investment programs or place  unacceptable terms on credit.    If we talk about the content of the conversion plans, then  they are --medical equipment, security systems, satellite  television antenna and reception systems, a device for employing  microwave energy in various productions of the food and  processing industries, a device to monitor the ecology of the  environment and to monitor cargoes on rail and motor vehicle  transportation, and many others.    [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] Are you only developing  conversion products or are you involved in their series  production?    [Perunov] We are primarily conducting development and we are  producing small lots. Of course, there is series production.  This is primarily tape recorders, washing machines, telephones,  and microwave ovens. However, in the process, we are  encountering enormous difficulties in obtaining components. The  prices for them are continuously increasing which leads to the  need to increase prices for the end product and, consequently,  creates difficulties with sales.    [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] What kind of contacts  do  you have with foreign countries and firms?    [Perunov] For the time being, our contacts have been largely  limited to negotiations and to protocols on intentions. However,  foreign firms are displaying a great deal of interest in some of  our developments. We are conducting negotiations with the  countries of the Middle East, China, with representatives of  South America, and also with European states. Our enterprises  have also attracted the attention of certain foreign firms. They  are prepared to invest their resources but the unstable  situation in Russia, the absence of guarantees by state  structures, and also the bureaucracy in the countries of these  firms, COCOM, and certainly the policy directed toward the  collapse of our scientific and military potential is stopping  them. This often makes our negotiations futile. They are not  ending with the conclusion of contracts or joint cooperation.  For now, cooperation with China and the Middle East countries  appears to be realistic.    [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] What has changed with  the formation of the Defense Sectors Committee?    [Perunov] Very little has changed. The Committee is  practically disenfranchised. However, the situation has still  improved in comparison with the time when the Ministry of  Industry existed. Elements of coordination have appeared in the  modified structure and the board of The Committee for the  Realization of Sector Programs and Conversion is rendering  substantial assistance.    [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] How do you assess the  level of weapons developed at the NPO in contrast to the West?    [Perunov] The EW equipment that the NPO has developed and  has  in series production is no worse than foreign models and some of  the developments are better or do not have equivalents in the  world. We are resolving the issues of systems engineering and  integration at a level that is higher than the world average.  However, there is a certain lagging behind in circuitry.    Under today's conditions, the high degree of automation and  information processing of military equipment determines EW's  primary role as a deterrent factor, both during the conduct of  combat operations and also in peacetime. EW equipment is also  being utilized as performance monitoring and recording devices.    Russian First Deputy Minister of Defense A.A. Kokoshin has  assigned the issues of developing EW among the priorities,  however, our NPO still has barely felt the practical steps of  this decision. Only work to equip platforms that are being  produced and developed is being financed and not completely.  Work for the future and research work is practically not being  financed. If the situation doesn't change, we will lose our  cadres, our reserves, and our ideas.    [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] The Persian Gulf War  demonstrated the significance of electronic weapons in combat  operations. Have the results of this war been reflected in the  NPO's activities?    [Perunov] We foresaw many of the results of this war. We  knew  that the Multinational Forces were saturated with electronic  weapons and we also knew that Iraq practically did not have  these weapons. If Iraq had had adequate EW systems, say, like  those that the Russian Armed Forces have, then it is hard to  predict how soon and with what results that war would have ended.    It turned out that the Multinational Forces suppressed  Iraq's  electronic systems and the allies' numerous electronic systems  functioned without jamming. Today aircraft, ships, ground-based  equipment and other military targets that are not protected by  EW systems are being transformed into accessible and easily  destroyed targets. Modern military conflicts -- are first of all  an information war. Weapons of destruction swing into action  only after disruption of troop command and control and  elimination of the enemy's information about itself. The  Syrian-Israeli and British-Argentine conflicts, the war in  Vietnam, and combat operations in the Persian Gulf zone confirm  that axiom.    Unfortunately, despite this situation, the NPO is not  receiving a sufficient number of orders to develop EW systems.  They tell us that there are other more important concerns.    [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] Do we supply EW systems  to other countries?    [Perunov] I don't know about such cases. Moreover, the  Americans also practically do not supply EW weapons to other  countries. All of the world's leading countries develop these  kinds of weapons for themselves, although some sort of  coordination exists in Western Europe. I need to say that the  West imparts a great deal of significance to EW weapons and the  issues that are associated with these weapons are among the most  restricted.    Right now negotiations are being conducted on the sale of  domestically-produced EW weapons along with platforms and also  on the installations of systems produced in our country on  foreign platforms and the sale of individual EW systems  components. However, the rates at which these negotiations are  being conducted is defining the actually quite long time periods  for their execution.</p>

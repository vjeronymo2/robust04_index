			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Allied Colloids ahead after better second half A 'markedly better' second half enabled Allied Colloids, the speciality chemicals group, to increase full year profits by 3.5 per cent from Pounds 44.4m to Pounds 45.9m, in spite of a 15 per cent drop in interim profits. The group forecast a 'better growth in profits' in the current year. Group margins, which had been depressed in the first half, bounced back. After suffering from adverse exchange rates in the first half, currencies contributed about Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m in the second, and a further Pounds 1m profit came from the group's captive insurance subsidiary, set up after the fire at one group plant in 1992, as no claims were made. Margins also improved through tighter cost control, higher prices and more stable raw material prices and greater efficiencies, Mr Gordon Senior, finance director, said. Group sales in the year to April 2 were up 10.8 per cent to Pounds 326.8m. Its customers are in a wide range of industries around the world, with many seeing signs of a recovery. Only in the UK, which accounts for 13 per cent of total sales, were sales not ahead, with the sharpest growth reported from Asia, and 'substantial increases' in continental Europe and North America. The company said all the main product divisions recorded increased sales, with pollution control overtaking paper products as the largest. Operating profits were 5.4 per cent higher at Pounds 46.7m (Pounds 44.3m) giving a margin of 14.3 per cent for the year, down from the 1993 figure of 15 per cent, but well up from the first half's 12.1 per cent. There was a Pounds 258,000 loss from the new joint venture with Courtaulds, representing start-up costs, and the net interest charge was Pounds 499,000 (credit Pounds 124,000). Net debt at the year end was less than Pounds 1m, but the charge reflected lower rates on the cash balances of Pounds 24.1m while the borrowings are at fixed rates. A tax rate of 28.8 per cent (33.2 per cent) reflected higher capital expenditure of Pounds 26.7m compared to a depreciation charge of Pounds 14m, and a tax refund in Germany. The rate is expected to rise to about 30 per cent in the current year. That left earnings per share up 9.6 per cent to 12.45p, and a proposed final dividend of 3.72p (3.35p) gives a total payment of 4.72p (4.29p) - up 10 per cent. A one-for-one scrip is planned. COMMENT Allied Colloids has long been a favoured stock and was quickly forgiven its interim profit blip. After these figures, forecasts for the current year were being increased with top estimates now up to Pounds 57m pre-tax, and the shares rose 11p to 260p. Those numbers depend on another good sales increase and a full year of margins at the level of the second half, which may be a bit much to hope for. However, the high continuing level of capital spending, expected at Pounds 35m this year, should keep profits moving ahead in coming years. On more conservative estimates of Pounds 54m, the prospective p/e is 18.4. That looks on the high side, but may not stop the shares outperforming in the longer term.</p>

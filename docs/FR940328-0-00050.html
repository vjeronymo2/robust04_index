			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A large processor commented that the Agency did not include in its cost estimate many of the significant costs associated with label redesign. The analysis did recognize that the cost of revising a label varies widely and that variation is included in the estimate of a one-time cost for processors of $50 to $100 million. The Agency is aware that some firms spend several thousand dollars on label revisions. Other firms spend far less. The Department considers an average cost of $1,000 per label to be a reasonable estimate for an average cost for a label revision of this type. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A supermarket chain from a large urban area submitted a detailed estimate of its costs using a labor rate of $24.00 per hour. The cost analysis used a labor rate of approximately $10.00 per hour. The Department recognizes that wages will vary widely. Aggregate cost and benefit analyses must, however, be based on national averages. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12778 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. States and local jurisdictions are preempted under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) from imposing any marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient requirement on federally inspected meat and poultry products that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under the FMIA or PPIA. States and local jurisdictions may, however, exercise concurrent jurisdiction over meat and poultry products that are outside official establishments for the purpose of preventing the distribution of meat and poultry products that are misbranded or adulterated under the FMIA or PPIA, or, in the case of imported articles, which are not at such an establishment, after their entry into the United States. Under the FMIA and PPIA, States that maintain meat and poultry inspection programs must impose requirements that are at least equal to those required under the FMIA and PPIA. The States may, however, impose more stringent requirements on such State inspected products and establishments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No retroactive effect will be given to this rule. The administrative procedures specified in 9 CFR 306.5 and 381.35 must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge of the application of the provisions of this rule, if the challenge involves any decision of an inspector relating to inspection services provided under the FMIA or PPIA. The administrative procedures specified in 9 CFR 335 and 381, Subpart W, must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge of the application of the provisions of this rule with respect to labeling decisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Effect on Small Entities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Administrator has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). The rule will affect a substantial number of small entities, but the economic impact on such small entities will not be significant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule affects both retail stores and inspected establishments. In 1991, USDA estimated there were 253,000 foodstores in the United States. These stores are categorized as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s25,8 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Supermarkets  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 23,813 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=12 g=1 f=1 --> (Sales >$2.5 million each) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Superettes  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 94,647 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=12 g=1 f=1 --> (Sales &lt;$2.5 million each) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Convenience Stores  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 51,700 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specialty stores  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 82,895 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Total  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 253,055 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most of the small businesses affected would be superettes and specialty stores, such as meat markets, butcher shops, and locker plants. The specialty store category includes a large number of small businesses that do not sell meat and poultry products, e.g., confectionery stores. Most convenience stores do not sell raw or partially cooked meat and poultry products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department recognizes that small retail firms would experience the greatest relative ongoing costs because they may not be able to afford new or modified equipment that can minimize costs. However, the public health risks do not allow for alternative small business considerations. At least one of the recent foodborne illness incidents described in the interim rule referred to earlier involved ground beef sold through a small market in a small community. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary of Agriculture has statutory authority to require meat and poultry products to bear labels including such ``information as the Secretary may require *&blank;*&blank;* to assure that *&blank;*&blank;* the public will be informed of the manner of handling required to maintain the article in a wholesome condition.'' Federal Meat Inspection Act, 21 U.S.C. 601 (n) (12); Poultry Products Inspection Act, 21 U.S.C. 453 (h) (12). The Secretary issued an interim final rule on August 16, 1993, requiring raw and partially cooked meat and poultry products to carry safe handling instructions, effective October 15, 1993 (58 FR 43478), and solicited comments for 30 days. In light of these comments, the Secretary issued a final rule on October 12, 1993, which made significant changes in response to the comments (58 FR 52856). Due to continued outbreaks of foodborne illness involving meat and poultry products which resulted in serious illness and death, the Secretary invoked the ``good cause'' exception to the notice and comment requirement of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(13)(B)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: Getting to the root - Is fluoridated water good for teeth? / A debate still raging after nearly 40 years The most emotive issue in environmental dentistry - whether to add fluoride to public water supplies - is back on the agenda of local politics in the UK. This month the health authorities in two regions, Strathclyde in the west of Scotland and Yorkshire in the north of England, launched separate campaigns to introduce fluoridation for a total of 5m people at a cost of Pounds 13m. To succeed, they have to win over a substantial majority of local councillors in the face of a vocal anti-fluoride lobby. Some opponents believe 'mass medication' is wrong in principle because it infringes the rights of the individual. Others have linked fluoridation with health problems ranging from headaches and indigestion to brittle bones and cancer. However, bodies representing mainstream medical and dental opinion are unanimously in favour. The World Health Organisation, British Medical Association, American Medical Association, General Dental Council, Royal College of Physicians and many similar organisations have put out statements supporting fluoridation. They say drinking fluoride at the recommended level of one part per million of water brings no health risks. The only proven ill effect of fluoride is 'dental fluorosis', a mottling of the teeth that occurs occasionally in places that have very high natural levels in drinking water - well above the recommended 1ppm. Comprehensive reviews of possible links between fluoridation and cancer were published by the UK government in 1985 and the US government in 1991. They found no health risks. As James Mason, US assistant secretary of health, put it last year, the risks 'are so small that they have been impossible to detect in epidemiological studies to date. In contrast, the benefits are great and easy to detect'. Fluoride reduces the solubility of tooth enamel in acid and can help to remineralise enamel that has started to decay. Although children with growing teeth receive the most benefit, there is evidence that regular fluoride helps to strengthen adults' teeth too. Regular surveys of children's dental health, co-ordinated by the British Association for the Study of Community Dentistry, show great geographical differences, which are clearly related to fluoridation. Average DMFT scores (decayed, missing and filled teeth) vary by a factor of more than five between the best areas and the worst (see table). Despite the proven medical benefits - and the fact that opinion polls have shown public support rising steadily, with 79 per cent in favour of fluoridation in a NOP survey this year - only 6m people in the UK drink water with fluoride added. A further 2m live in areas with naturally high fluoride levels. In other words, 15 per cent of the UK population benefits from fluoridation, compared with more than half of the US population. Fluoridation is most widespread in the West Midlands and Tyneside. Nowhere in Scotland, the London area or the industrial north-west of England has fluoride been added. Anti-fluoride campaigners say it is up to individuals to administer the chemical to themselves or their children, in the form of fluoride tablets, rinses or toothpaste. But health authorities argue that poorer families, who have the worst dental health, are least likely to do so. The UK government pays for agreed fluoridation schemes. The necessary equipment, which pumps fluoride solution into the mains, costs about Pounds 300,000. The capital cost per head of population varies according to the number of people served by each treatment plant but is typically in the region of Pounds 1 to Pounds 5. Running costs are 15p to 50p per person per year. The 1985 Fluoridation Act provided a legal framework for water authorities or companies to add fluoride at the request of local health authorities. It overturned the 1983 Scottish court judgment in what became known as the 'toothless granny' case: after a long legal battle, Catherine McCall, a Glasgow pensioner and anti-fluoride campaigner, obtained a ruling that water authorities did not have the necessary powers to add fluoride to public supplies. Although the Act was intended to lead to more widespread fluoridation, no significant new schemes have got under way since 1985.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TEN BEST DISTRICTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- District                          Decayed             Population                                   teeth*               receiving                                                      fluoridated                                                            water  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hartlepool                         0.86              100 percent Mid Essex                          0.98                       ** North Birmingham                   1.02              100 percent North Bedfordshire                 1.18               76 percent Rugby                              1.25              100 percent Southend                           1.26                      nil North East Essex                   1.28               83 percent South Birmingham                   1.29              100 percent Tower Hamlets                      1.30                      nil Gateshead                          1.35              100 percent  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TEN WORST DISTRICTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- District                          Decayed             Population                                   teeth*               receiving                                                      fluoridated                                                            water  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ayrshire &amp; Arran                   3.89                      nil Greater Glasgow                    3.89                      nil Tameside &amp; Glossop                 3.90                      nil Argyll &amp; Clyde                     3.92                      nil Fife                               4.00                      nil Western Isles                      4.32                      nil Bury                               4.39                      nil Lanarkshire                        4.70                      nil Burley                             4.87                      nil Salford                            5.81                      nil  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *  Decayed, missing or filled ** Variable levels of natural fluoride  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Associaion for the Study of Community Dentistry  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

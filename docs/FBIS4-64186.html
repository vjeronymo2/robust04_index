			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The Bundestag today approved an  increase in the coal subsidy over the votes of the opposition.  This means the surcharge on electricity bills to subsidize the  German coal industry will increase in 1995 from 7.5 to 8.5  percent. The subsidy is to be introduced in eastern Germany in  1996 at a rate of around 4.25 percent. The new arrangement is  necessary because the Century Agreement, which governs the use  of German coal for electricity supplies, runs out at the end of  next year. [passage omitted]</p>

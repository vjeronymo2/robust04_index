			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: The pick of the publishing year - From politics to poetry, history to humour - our writers choose the best books of 1994 Top of my list is Claire Tomalin's Mrs Jordan's Profession (Viking, Pounds 18), the haunting tale of the great actress who lived with King William 1V, bore him 10 children and was then ditched in favour of a wealthy royal wife. Tomalin's reflection on public and private lives, on royalty, on theatre and society, have a blazing contemporary interest. Her backcloth of 18th-century good living shading into 19th century morality is spirited cultural history seen through the prism of a passionate, fragile woman. A book glowing with both ideas and warmth. David Cannadine's Aspects of Aristocracy (Yale, Pounds 19.95) is a hugely enjoyable portrait of the upper classes at play and at work, in debt and in love, on the way up and on the way down. It is the perfect history book for the non-historian. Ample in scope but full of human detail, accessible and graceful in its scholarship, witty and opinionated in style. Most beautiful book of the year must be the exhibition catalogue The Glory of Venice (Yale, Pounds 22.50) - a celebration of familiar masterpieces and an introduction to exquisite drawings, prints and book illustrations by artists such as Canaletto, Guardi, Piazzetta and Tiepolo.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Amsterdam sells Hoogovens stake THE CITY of Amsterdam yesterday sold its 5.24 per cent stake in Hoogovens, the Dutch steel group, to domestic and international institutions. The shares, worth Fl 47m (Dollars 25m), were placed with the institutions by ABN Amro, the Dutch bank. The city of Amsterdam, which has owned shares in the company since before the Second World War, said it stood to make a book profit of Fl 19m on the deal. The proceeds will be used to reduce borrowing, saving the Dutch capital an annual Fl 2m in interest charges. Hoogovens has not paid a dividend for two years. Its net loss widened sharply to Fl 595m in 1992 from Fl 51m in 1991, partly reflecting heavy provisions for job cuts and write-offs as it struggles to weather the difficult economic climate in Europe. The sale of the shares was announced after the close of trading on the Amsterdam bourse, where Hoogovens' shares closed barely changed at Fl 39.80 compared with Fl 40.10 on Wednesday. Like other cyclical shares, Hoogovens has risen sharply in recent weeks on expectations of economic recovery in 1994. Amsterdam said its shareholding had been a legacy of its involvement in job creation schemes in the region before the Second World War. This type of industrial policy in the steel sector was now a matter for national and international authorities, it noted. The national government owns slightly more than 12 per cent of Hoogovens, which is based in Ijmuiden on the North Sea coast near Amsterdam. Its shareholding was reduced in the mid-1980s from an original 20 per cent. The city spokesman said he believed Hoogovens was Amsterdam's only holding in a bourse-listed company. The city does, however, participate in the capital of organisations such as Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport. Government ownership of companies is relatively rare in the Netherlands. In the late 1980s, the Dutch state sold nearly 70 per cent of its shares in DSM, the chemicals group, in two tranches. In early 1994, it is planning to sell the first tranche of shares in the Dutch PTT in a transaction that will rank as the country's biggest privatisation.</p>

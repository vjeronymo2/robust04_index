			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Too little, too late THE ONE percentage point cut in the UK's base rate of interest, announced yesterday, was necessary. But it will probably prove yet another case of too little, because too late. The FT argued last October for an immediate cut in base rate to 6 per cent, combined with a new fiscal strategy and, more important still, with radical institutional reform, including an independent central bank. The government clung, instead, to caution, when it should have been decisive. It remained conservative, when it should have been radical. It is paying the price. Economic forecasts are inescapably imprecise. But the extrapolations of current trends presented by the Institute of Fiscal Studies in yesterday's Green Budget demonstrates why caution is probably the riskiest policy that the government can now adopt. The probable developments in the fiscal deficit and the current account mean, first, that the economy has to grow and, second, that this growth has to be export-led. Even if the economy were to expand by 1.8 per cent between 1992-93 and 1993-94 and 3 per cent a year thereafter, the public sector borrowing requirement would still fall very slowly, argues the IFS, from its highest peacetime level of 9 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product (excluding privatisation receipts) in 1993-94. Balancing the budget over the cycle has become a discredited slogan; the Conservative party's reputation for fiscal prudence is in tatters. The government has no option but to push for recovery. A slow recovery would be riskier - given the prospective build-up of public debt, even riskier for inflation - than a fast one. The grim fiscal picture, the worsening prospects for external demand, particularly in continental Europe, and the overhang of personal indebtedness make interest rate cuts not merely necessary, but inescapable. Exchange rate depreciation is a valuable bonus. Goldman Sachs argues, for example, that the UK needs a further 10 per cent improvement in competitiveness if it is to combine recovery with a current account deficit below 3 per cent of gross domestic product. Base rates must be pushed to a level at which early recovery becomes not just possible, nor likely, but virtually certain. Moreover, they will be pushed that low in the end, however cautious the government wishes to be. The mistake has been not to push interest rates down faster. A principal excuse for the caution is fear that the public would fail to believe in the government's willingness to raise interest rates once more. Yet such caution would be unnecessary if the government were not so determined to hold on to all the levers of monetary policy. It is, after all, this determination which makes the public doubt the government's willingness to raise interest rates. This government does not just keep on getting its monetary policy wrong. Its determination to be able to do so has become an important reason for its continuing to do so.</p>

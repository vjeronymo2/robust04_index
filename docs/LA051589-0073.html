			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Greer Garson, who was known in the 1940s as "The First Lady of the Screen," has  made a $3 million gift to open a communication arts center at the College of  Santa Fe, expected to be utilized by year's end. The donations include two  professional sound stages for motion pictures and television productions and  video recording studios for academic use. "The gift is especially gratifying to  me because it will bring together two dominant interests in my life -- the  academic study of the moving image and the professional management of the art,"  Garson said in a statement. The college president, James Fries, expects the  Garson Communication Center to serve as headquarters for film production in New  Mexico. CLAUDIA PUIG and ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Letter: Too beefy an argument Sir, Michael Prowse, in reviewing Jeremy Rifkin's book entitled 'Beyond Beef', (April 10) does not appear to have completely suspended his critical faculties since he describes it as a tirade, an exaggeration and a metaphor. But he was at fault in re-cycling so much misinformation in the context of his review. For example, he says 'the argument about poverty is straightforward'. Would that it were] The land conversion factors comparing the productivity of cereals, legumes, leafy vegetables and cattle assume the same high quality land, whereas most grazing land is too cool, too wet, too dry, too high, too steep or too rough to be used for crops. And so, worldwide, 80-85 per cent of the nutrients fed to cattle are not edible by humans. World hunger experts know the real causes of hunger are poverty and distribution - not cows. This is just one example of the incorrect information in Mr Rifkin's book. There are many others. It is sad that Mr Prowse has chosen to reiterate Mr Rifkin's book rather than offer a critical review. British consumers can continue to consume grass-based British beef from the hills of Scotland or well-managed English and Welsh mixed farming systems without guilt about environmental impact or resource misuse.

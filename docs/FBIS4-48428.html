			<p>BFN     [Text] President of the Republic Joaquim Chissano has been  urged by Nacala residents to contest the multiparty elections  scheduled for October 1994. The call was made today at a rally  he chaired in Nacala as part of his working visit to Nampula  Province. More than 13,000 people attended the rally during  which the head of state urged Nacala and Nacala-a-Velha  residents to vote en masse in the upcoming elections to choose  the finest representatives of Mozambican society as the  country's future leaders. President Chissano's speech at the  rally focused on the need to uphold peace and national  reconciliation and hard work to secure unity among all  Mozambicans from north to south.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / World Trade News: Fresh hurdle in US-EC aircraft subsidies deal THE US and EC have returned to bargaining over the terms of direct and indirect government support to civil aircraft manufacturers in the wake of a deal reached on April 1. The agreement was due to be referred back to the US and EC governments for ratification before final agreement. In Washington, the US Trade Representative's office played down the talks as a meeting 'to tidy up loose ends in the agreement.'  McDonnell Douglas said at issue was a need to develop a formula to identify indirect benefits gained by commercial manufacturers from military contracts. Sen John Danforth, a senior Republican on trade matters, yesterday strongly criticised the Airbus deal as 'a travesty' because it gave the EC 'an all-clear' for Dollars 26bn in government subsidies.  He introduced a resolution demanding the US not approve agreements ratifying foreign subsidies. Both McDonnell Douglas, based in Mr Danforth's home state of Missouri, and Boeing are supporting the tenetative agreemtn as 'a first step in the right direction. In Brussels, a senior EC trade official said objections from US government departments to last week's EC-US deal on subsidies for civil aircraft manufacturers were putting the whole agreement in danger. The official said the US had not attempted to reopen bilateral negotiations  -which ended last week after six years of intermittent discussion - but that Nasa, and the US defence and commerce departments had reacted strongly against limits on indirect government support to the civil aircraft industry. The agreement, if ratified, would set a 33 per cent limit on direct subsidies, as a proportion of total aircraft development costs, and a double-limit on indirect support.  As a whole, Airbus or the US manufacturers would be unable to receive indirect grants worth more than 3 per cent of total civil aircraft turnover, while indirect subsidies for individual manufacturers would be restricted to 4 per cent of civil aircraft turnover.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The parliamentary opposition is blaming the ruling  HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union] for the breakdown in inter-party  negotiations. It sees a way out of the deadlock in a settlement  before the next assembly session, and it predicts early  elections. This is a brief summary of a news conference held  today by the HSLS [Croatian Social Liberal Party], the HNS  [Croatian People's Party], the HSS [Croatian Peasants' Party],  the SDP [Social Democratic Party], the HND [Croatian Independent  Democrats] and the IDS [Istrian Democratic Assembly]. Jasnka  Dudic reporting:    [Dudic] Opposition representatives denied the HDZ's claims  that the opposition was less cooperative yesterday than usual  and said that the HDZ was inflexible and unwilling to accept any  compromise. They stressed that the opposition had decided not to  put forward any candidates for the position of vice-presidents,  suggested that it would abandon the issue of legality, but  demanded that it be allowed to vote on the dismissal and  election of the president of the assembly. Since this was  rejected, we came to a deadlock, Ivica Racan [SDP chairman] said  and announced a meeting of the opposition for Monday [20 June].    [Begin Racan recording] At the meeting we will discuss the  possibility of the opposition offering resignations from all its  positions in the Croatian Assembly. We will also decide in  which way we will take part in the further work of the assembly,  but I do not think that we will attend the sessions scheduled  for Tuesday. [end recording]    [Dudic] The opposition believes that the situation in the  assembly does not need to be solved through early elections, but  if no agreement is reached, the opposition is ready to accept  even that challenge.</p>

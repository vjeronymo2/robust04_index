			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: UK groups buy into NZ liquor business LION NATHAN has sold half its liquor manufacturing and distribution business, New Zealand Wines and Spirits, to International Distillers and Vintners, owned by GandMet, and Hiram Walker, owned by Allied Llyons. The two UK-based international liquor groups are paying a total NZDollars 61m (USDollars 33m) and each is acquiring a 25 per cent shareholding. NZ Wines and Spirits was the family company of Lion Nathan's managing director and big shareholder, Mr Douglas Myers, and there was surprise in New Zealand yesterday that he should sell. However, Mr Myers said the money raised would be used to repay debt. NZ Wines and Spirits would continue to be managed by Lion Nathan, and the deal would ensure that existing brand distribution agreements would continue, and allow access to new brands. He added that the move was a logical step in a trend for brand owning companies to fully or partly own regional distributors. Mr Malcolm Don, Lion Nathan's corporate treasurer, said the money raised by the sale would be treated as an extraordinary gain for the year to August 31. NZ Wines and Spirits was estimated to be making profits of NZDollars 20m a year before interest payments and tax. The new joint venture arrangement is conditional on certain approvals being obtained, but Mr Don said no difficulties were expected.</p>

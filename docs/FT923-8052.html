			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Absenteeism due to illness passes 500m days a year, report says ABSENCE from work through illness in Britain passed half a billion days for the first time last year - nearly double the annual figure of a decade ago - a report published yesterday claims. The report, by Mr Rowland Goodwin, a stress expert, is based on an annual sample of doctors' certificates conducted by the Department of Social Security. Female absenteeism has risen especially fast, by 111 per cent, since 1982 when self-certification was introduced, compared with a rise of 55 per cent for men. Self-certification allows employees to stay off work for slightly longer without a doctor's certificate. A sick note signed by a doctor is needed only if the illness lasts over a week. Under the old system a doctor had to be consulted after three days. However, Mr Goodwin, of the Greater Manchester Industrial Mission, a church-based organisation, said self-certification was not necessarily to blame for the increase in absenteeism, and that the rate fell slightly after self-certification was introduced. There is no single explanation for the increase, according to Mr Goodwin, but he points to the ageing workforce and increasing pressure at work. He also claims that 35 per cent of the overall total of days lost is stress-related. His report concludes: 'At half a billion days per year, the cost to the health service and the loss in terms of efficiency and productivity at the workplace must now be taken seriously.' The report's findings provoked some scepticism, with Ms Lucy Mason of the Robens Institute for occupational health at Surrey University questioning Mr Goodwin's categorisation of stress-related diseases. The Confederation of British Industry said it worked out absenteeism only in money terms. Its latest figure, calculated in 1987, puts the annual cost to the economy at Pounds 5bn.

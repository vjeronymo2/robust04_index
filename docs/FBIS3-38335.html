			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed al, rp: "Davos Forum: Amid the Mysteries of </F> Russian Poliitcs"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database]    [Text] Davos, 31 January (ATS) -- For three days, Russian  policy has held a prominent place in the Davos Forum. Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, former Economy Minister Boris  Fedorov, Viktor Gerashchenko, president of the central bank, and  Anatoliy Chubays, deputy prime minister responsible for  privatizations, clashed through contradictory statements.    Speaking to the press on Saturday [29 January], Viktor  Chernomyrdin forcefully expressed his intention to continue the  transformation of the economy and Russian society. Questioned  on his government's monetary policy, the prime minister gave as  his objective keeping inflation to between 15 and 18 percent  until September.  <H5>  Mr. Fedorov's Criticisms </H5>   Accompanied by two former economics advisers to the Russian  Government, Boris Fedorov strongly criticized the present  government's policy on Monday. The former economy minister, who  resigned on 20 January, predicted the failure of a policy  consisting of reviving production by a massive injection of  capital. This measure is fueling inflation and delaying the  stabilization of the economy, which is the only thing that would  make development possible.    Inflation is prompting both poor and rich to hoard strong  currencies. The spread of special stores in which you pay in  foreign currency is prompting the former minister to fear a  "dangerous polarization of society." He thinks that the  inflationist policy currently being pursued would increase  pressure in favor of the reformers. "Boris Yeltsin has  distanced himself from this government, he has the means of  changing it when the alarm signals are too strong."  <H5>  Anatoliy Chubays Is Voting for Fedorov </H5>   Anatoliy Chubays made a thinly veiled criticism of Viktor  Chernomyrdin by stating to the press on Monday that Mr.  Fedorov's resignation could have been avoided. "Being a  minister in this government, I regret it," he added. The deputy  prime minister, who is regarded as ultraliberal, said no  political power could block the privatizations.    He clearly advocated a monetarist policy, by defining the  dangers threatening privatization. "If the economic situation  remains unstable, investments will be rare, and companies are  likely to go bankrupt."  <H5>  Limits for Foreign Banks </H5>   Finally, Viktor Gerashchenko, president of the Central Bank,  told AFP on Monday that the activity of foreign banks on Russian  territory would be limited. "We need to promote our own  commercial banks."    Mr. Gerashchenko said that the money supply plays an  "insignificant" role in inflation in Russia. "Without a  government policy of investment, the fight against inflation by  monetarist means would be ineffective," he added.</p>

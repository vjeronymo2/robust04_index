			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Age and fame no barrier to Kidder's fall from grace: PaineWebber to reap the benefits as GE's investment banking unit is pulled apart EF Hutton, Drexel Burnham Lambert, Shearson .. and now Kidder Peabody. The list of famous names that have become casualties in the US stockbroking and investment banking industry gained another entry yesterday. The 128-year-old Wall Street firm, battered by scandal and tumbling bond markets this year, is to be dismantled, and up to 2,000 of its staff laid off. Many aspects of the deal, agreed in principle on Sunday, have to be sorted out. However, the broad outline is clear. The General Electric unit will be split for PaineWebber to pick over, allowing PaineWebber to expand in a number of areas - without having to take on any of Kidder's operations it does not want. 'GE is indemnifying us against all the liabilities of Kidder,' says Mr Donald Marron, PaineWebber's chairman. 'GE is paying for all the down-sizing.' PaineWebber, whose 5,000-strong retail broking force puts it among the ranks of mid-sized brokers, is effectively raising Dollars 580m (Pounds 367m) of new capital through the transaction, the amount of Kidder's liquid net assets that will transfered, and it will expand its equity capital base, which stands at Dollars 1.2bn. In return, it welcomes GE as a minority shareholder . GE will have a seat on PaineWebber's board. Net of the additional capital it acquires through the transaction, PaineWebber is paying GE Dollars 90m for the Kidder businesses it chooses. Chief among the assets on PaineWebber's target list is Kidder's retail salesforce - 1,150 brokers around the country who are among the most productive in the US. Between them, these brokers generate about Dollars 500m in commissions and fees a year. Their average of Dollars 425,000 each is well ahead of PaineWebber's estimated Dollars 300,000 average. The problem for PaineWebber - other than the question of how it merges this network of brokers with its own, bigger salesforce - is that every other retail stockbroker of size in the US is likely to attempt to lure away Kidder's most productive offices. 'There is bound to be scepticism regarding PaineWebber's ability to pull it off,' says Mr Michael Flanagan, a securities industry analyst at Lipper Analytical. If the firm retains all of Kidder's brokers, it will cement its position as the fourth biggest US retail brokerage network. On PaineWebber's immediate target list are Kidder's investment management activities. Assets under discretionary management in this part of the business amount to Dollars 9bn, compared with some Dollars 37bn at PaineWebber, says Mr Marron. The firm will also take over Kidder's equity research group; Kidder's mortgage business; and parts of its investment banking and trading operations. It is these areas that raise the biggest questions. Kidder, under former chairman Mr Michael Carpenter, had turned itself into a big fixed income trading house, amassing a balance sheet with assets of more than Dollars 100bn. PaineWebber, by contrast, has assets of little more than Dollars 30bn and a far less leveraged balance sheet. While Mr Marron talked yesterday about acquiring parts of Kidder's fixed income trading businesses - including those in London, where the firm's bond operations provide no overlap with Kidder's US operation - he was studiously vague about what this would involve. Of particular interest to Wall Street is the fate of Kidder's mortgage-backed bonds business, the biggest of its kind and the operation which in recent years has provided the bulk of the firm's profits. GE ten days ago said it would transfer Kidder's mortgage-backed bond portfolio to another part of the group. For General Electric, meanwhile, the announcement marks an ignominious end to its eight-year involvement with Kidder - though the industrial giant was at pains to point out that it has a substantial continuing interest in the securities industry through its stake in PaineWebber. 'Over the long term, they don't want to be in this business,' says Mr Michael Bunyaner, an analyst who follows GE at Oppenheimer in New York. 'They want to let someone else who knows the industry manage it.' But GE may not rush to sell off its stake, he adds: it has a similar substantial minority stake in the defence group Martin Marietta, demonstrating that it is content to remain a minority partner over the long term.

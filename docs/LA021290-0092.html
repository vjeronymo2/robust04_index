			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BULLET STRIKES 8-YEAR-OLD GIRL AT DISNEYLAND  </P> <P> An 8-year-old girl was hit in the back by an apparently errant bullet about 6  p.m. Sunday as she rode an open-car train through the Fantasyland section of  Disneyland.  </P> <P> Anaheim Police Lt. John Cross said the that shot apparently was fired from  outside the park, but that there were no reports of shooting in the area.  </P> <P> Nayeli Diane Placentia of Downey was in guarded condition Sunday night in the  pediatrics intensive care unit at UCI Medical Center in Orange after surgery to  remove the bullet from her back.  </P> <P> Cross said the girl did not realize she had been shot.  </P> <P> "She complained to her parents that something struck her back," he said.  </P> <P> The girl's parents, whose names were not released, took her to Western Medical  Center-Anaheim, where doctors discovered the bullet wound. Cross said police  were called at 6:43 p.m. by hospital officials.  </P> <P> The girl was transferred to UCI Medical Center for surgery.  </P> <P> "Apparently the operation was successful," Cross said. He added that the bullet  removed by doctors was of small caliber, most likely from a handgun.  </P> <P> He said investigators were on the scene Sunday night attempting to discover  where the shot came from. The girl and her family had been sitting together in  one of the train's open-sided cars with a canvas roof.  </P> <P> I don't think this was intentional at all," Cross said. "It probably was  someone firing a shot into the air." He added that it almost certainly occurred  off park property.  </P> <P> A Disneyland night manager said that park representatives had ordered him not  to say anything about the shooting except that park public information officers  would answer news media questions today.  </P> <P> Operations at the park, which remained open until midnight Sunday, were not  affected.  </P> <P> Cross said there were no reports that anyone near the girl heard any shots or  knew what had happened.  </P></p>

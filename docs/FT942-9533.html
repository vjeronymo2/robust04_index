			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Arts: A romantic revolutionary After Snoo Wilson's portentous marginalia on the Duke of Windsor, Mold's Theatre Clwyd has meatier fare: Shaw's Saint Joan, some fatty verbosity and deceptively chewy intellectual gristle apart, still offers a fair amount of theatrical protein. The mercifully streamlined production by Gale Edwards, distinguished work in Australia behind her, is unabashedly romantic, not afraid to add red lighting or dry ice effects to Peter J. Davison's handsome settings. The opening scene's straight rows of breast plates that bristle across the stage, sent sprawling even into the stalls by the squire's contemptuously clouted steward, provide a surreal image of a nation ravaged by war. Sliding hangar doors in the austere box set give on to giant fleur de lys and a long corridor down which the shackled Joan clunks towards her trial. If Shaw, with gadfly evasive shallowness, declared Joan to be the first Protestant, this production emphasises her status as romantic revolutionary: the idealist who becomes a thorn in the side of the new establishment, the fundamentalist who embarrasses the compromises of power. All memorable Joans seize a particular aspect of the Maid to make their own. Images linger of Joan Plowright's warm, womanly earthiness; Frances de la Tour's gawky, heart-broken passion; Eileen Atkins' wry knowingness; Angela Pleasence's vulnerable, whey-faced tenaciousness. At Mold the Maid is Imogen Stubbs, who gives us a little-girl Joan, the innocent, unwitting iconoclast. A small figure as some Joans go, Stubbs excels at compact, fizzy spitfire energy. She bounds on for her first entrance like an Enid Blyton heroine plus Geordie accent. Hair shorn, she is suddenly boyish at the siege of Orleans. In the trial scene she is a child, with a child's compliance to adult authority but also a child's infuriatingly logical stubbornness. Her recantation reduces her to a whimpering little girl. She must avoid the danger of sentimentalising the role, at the moment just achieved. The reading, already touching, will doubtless get tougher before the production reaches London. Shaw's schoolmarmish tendency to wag a garrulous forefinger and his clumping facetiousness are rare in this play, though today the caricature English cleric, Stogumber, would be reversed into an anti-English Englishman, given our mania for obliterating anything that resembles a native culture or tradition. Good support from all, notably Peter Jeffrey's Inquisitor and Philip Quast's Bastard of Orleans. Only Jasper Britton's gratingly clownish Dauphin irritates: silly walks, funny voices, a sub-suburban sit-com accent suggest that he shares the family defect of dottiness, like his father Charles VI and his unfortunate nephew Henry VI of England. But that is in another, and better, play.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's Of all the self-regulatory structures put in place during the 1980s, the policing of Lloyd's insurance market has proved the least satisfactory. The sheer scale of yesterday's losses lends support to such a claim. But Lloyd's is also a uniquely opaque marketplace. As Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, admits, not even its management has a firm grip on the figures. Faced with such a paucity of information, and without a price mechanism for guidance, individual Names have been left in the not always capable hands of market professionals. The proposed reform of the agency system - with more emphasis on syndicate analysis - should help improve the quality of information available to investors. The introduction of corporate members might also provide individual Names with useful signals as market conditions change. But that is no substitute for effective supervision. Lloyd's answer is to split the regulatory and commercial functions of its council, and promise a more vigorous approach to regulation. That echoes the approach championed for the wider City last month by Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board. In both cases, this may be the last chance to make self-regulation work.</p>

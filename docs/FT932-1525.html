			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Crabtree rises to 204p in first day of dealing SHARES OF Crabtree Group, the Gateshead-based metal decorating printing press producer, closed at 204p yesterday, the first day of dealing since the reversal into Somerset Trust. Dealings in Somerset, which acquired Crabtree for Pounds 19.4m, were suspended at 178p on May 4. Mr Karl Watkin, chairman, welcomed yesterday's outcome. 'I'd rather see a stable share price, gradually increasing, than a flash in the pan,' he said. He was also pleased at the rise in value of his own 12.7 per cent holding, from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 3.8m. About 1m of the 11.25m fully paid shares changed hands in the first three hours of dealing. Some 2m of the 3.6m nil paid rights were also sold. Mr Nick Donaldson, a corporate finance director with Credit Lyonnais Laing, whose placing of 6.6m shares at 150p had been oversubscribed, said the rise was 'healthy' and very much as expected. Multitrust sold its entire holding of 100,000 Crabtree ordinary and 300,000 rights over the nil-paid for a total of Pounds 352,000, a profit of Pounds 297,000 over cost.</p>

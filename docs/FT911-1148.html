			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Business and the Environment: Shell chairman to lead green group When a Shell refinery near Liverpool spilled 150 tonnes of oil into the River Mersey two years ago, John Collins, then a director of the company, took it personally. Shell was fined Pounds 1m - the highest pollution fine ever levied in the UK. Collins, now chairman of Shell UK, was chosen recently by Michael Heseltine, secretary of state for the environment, to lead a committee of top businessmen which will be advising the government on issues affecting business and the environment. Heseltine said last night in a speech to the Royal Society of Arts that he hoped the committee would be able to offer clear advice on achieving international environmental goals. As head of a group of business leaders who have been selected for their interest and commitment to the environment, Collins is conscious that Shell must improve its own record. 'Our risk as a polluter is high . . . Shell cannot give any guarantees, but we are willing to meet certain standards. I don't pretend that we're starting as a leader, we are all in a pioneering role on this committee.' When David Gee, director of Friends of the Earth, heard of Collins's appointment, he said: 'Anyone from Shell certainly knows about pollution and the government needs all the advice it can get.' Collins is keen that the committee not be dismissed as yet another talking shop. On his agenda are issues such as environmental management, recycling and global warming. He wants to move quickly in setting goals to be achieved in the committee's two-year life. 'There is no doubt that countries like Holland and Germany are a step ahead of us, because of their determination to remain competitive in export markets. But UK industry has woken up to the environment and is starting to see it as a business opportunity.' The learning curve is long, however. Industry typically takes an initial look at environmental measures and is put off by the cost. Then it starts to realise its competitors overseas are taking environmental initiatives and begins to see that there would be a business opportunity in implementing them. It is Collins's brief to try and turn some of this thinking into concrete action. Since the committee will advise and be consulted by Heseltine and Peter Lilley, secretary of state for trade and industry, it can push for government legislation as well as fiscal incentives. 'But I am hoping we can get industry to deliver some of these things on its own. We will have to move at a faster pace to be alongside the Netherlands and Germany in two years, but if we don't do this we will be at a competitive disadvantage.' Environmental management is one of his top priorities and he believes the committee should draw up guidelines and help companies do an environmental audit. In addition, he wants the body to look closely at recycling where one company's waste product could be another firm's raw material. The committee runs the gamut of UK industry including IBM, ICI, British Gas, British Nuclear Fuels, Wessex Water, National Westminster Bank and environmental consultants in a mix that is likely to provoke lively and tough debate. An important challenge for the group will be to restore the public's confidence in industry's environmental record, particularly sectors that are perceived as polluters such as the oil and nuclear industries. The US has introduced comprehensive right-to-know laws which require companies to publish regularly the levels of emissions they make, and environmental groups have been pushing for the same standards in the UK. Collins supports the public's right to this sort of information. 'The key to succeeding in this is transparency and if we measure our emissions it can make us more objective on what to do about them.' He is optimistic that at the end of the committee's two-year life industry will have met many of its environmental objectives and be clear about its future aims. 'In the end, any body like this will be judged on what it does, and we are looking for bold action, not rhetoric,' said Gee.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Luo Kangxiong (5012 1660 7160)] </F>   [Text] Shanghai, 27 May (XINHUA) -- The State Council  Office for Checking Unhealthy Tendencies in Business Activities  held a discussion meeting of some provinces and municipalities  on the work of checking unhealthy tendencies from 24 to 27 May  in Shanghai. Xu Qing, deputy secretary of the Central  Commission for Discipline Inspection and director of the State  Council Office for Checking Unhealthy Tendencies in Business  Activities, emphatically pointed out at the meeting: The work of  checking unhealthy tendencies this year is a continuation and  deepening of last year's work. Our tasks are heavier and even  more difficult. If we fail to exert efforts to do solid work,  we will make the mistake of only going through the motions.  Leading cadres at all levels must clearly understand the  situation of the work of checking unhealthy tendencies this  year, resolutely overcome slack and tired dispositions,  concentrate on major objectives, seriously "rectify three  irregularities and stop some unhealthy tendencies," and make  more interim achievements in this year's work of checking  unhealthy tendencies.    Xu Qing emphatically pointed out: To sum up, the major tasks  of this year's work of checking unhealthy tendencies are to  "rectify three irregularities and stop some unhealthy  tendencies." Namely, we should rectify any wanton collection of  fees, any overseas sightseeing travel in disguised form at  government expense, and the abuse of power by party and  government organizations and their personnel to obtain money and  goods from enterprises, and we should vehemently stop  conspicuous unhealthy tendencies in various departments and  trades. He elaborated more specifically: In rectifying wanton  collection of fees this year, we should see to it that all  officially abolished fees are no longer collected, especially at  the grass-roots units. We should particularly pay attention to  preventing people from collecting abolished fees under new  names. In rectifying overseas sightseeing travel in disguised  form at government expense, we should apply more effort to  stopping irregularities and strictly enforcing discipline. At  the same time, we should get at the root of the problem and  strictly examine travel applications. If the problem happens in  a department due to failure in strictly examining travel  applications, the department head shall be to blame. In  rectifying the abuse of power by party and government  organizations and their personnel to obtain money and goods from  enterprises, the leading cadres of party and government  organizations should attach importance to the work, know the  situation of their organizations, adopt a clear and definite  policy, and be determined to deal with the problem. They must  sternly deal with any problems discovered and seriously prevent  problems from recurring in the future. To vehemently stop  conspicuous unhealthy tendencies in various departments and  trades is an important part of the work of checking unhealthy  tendencies this year. All localities should set concrete goals  in correcting major unhealthy tendencies in various departments,  and organize more personnel to deal with the problem so as to  achieve breakthroughs.    Xu Qing said: In order to accomplish this year's work of  checking unhealthy tendencies, ordinary measures and methods are  hardly effective. We must adopt new, tough measures. We must  do solid and more effective work to attain our objectives so  that we have desired results to report to the Central Committee  and to the people. He said: While applying our main efforts to  checking unhealthy tendencies and enforcing discipline, we  should pay attention to exploring ways for bringing about both  stopgap results and permanent results. We should deal with any  loopholes and weak links discovered during the course of  "rectifying three irregularities and stopping some unhealthy  tendencies." We should rectify wrong attitudes and work styles,  and improve the administrative work and relevant systems, laws,  and regulations through the reform measures of our locality and  department.    In conclusion, Xu Qing said: The promotion of work ethics  meets our objective needs, and is the fundamental way to deepen  the work of checking unhealthy tendencies. We should continue  to promote work ethics on an experimental basis at selected  units. The experiment should be conducted in conjunction with  the work of checking unhealthy tendencies. More attention  should be paid to education, standards of conduct, and  motivating mechanisms. Coordinated efforts should be made to  explore effective ways, boldly reform and blaze new trails, and  popularize the successful experience of selected units in large  areas.    Delegates from 15 provinces and municipalities, including  Beijing, Tianjin, Jiangsu and Shandong, exchanged information  and experience on "hot topics" and "difficulties" of the work of  checking unhealthy tendencies during the meeting. They put  forward many good ideas and suggestions.</p>

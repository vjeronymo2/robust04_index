The visit was concluded on  Friday [11 March] with a news conference in Berlin, where  Grachev and his host, Volker Ruehe, concurrently assessed the  visit as a success. Ruehe said that the intention to make  special efforts to intensify cooperation after the withdrawal of  the Russian armed forces ran through the visit "like a red  thread." Grachev said that the point is that cooperation  between the German and Russian armed forces will not only be  improved by the stipulated joint maneuvers and the exchange of  officers who will participate in General Staff courses in  Hamburg and Moscow. What is more, it is important to secure  both the quantity and quality of the armed forces' relations  with each other "for the foreseeable future." Grachev thanked  Ruehe for his hospitality. Ruehe, for his part, paid tribute to  Grachev's preparedness to honor the members of the military  resistance against Hitler and the assassins of 20 July 1944 by  laying a wreath in the courtyard of the Bendler Block. The fact  that the uprising of 20 July had been attempted from the Bendler  Block is the reason for his decision to set up his official seat  in Berlin in this building.    Grachev and Ruehe largely evaded questions about the  organization of the ceremonies on the withdrawal of the Russian  soldiers, which is to take place in August. Grachev said that a  celebration with the Germans that emphasizes the friendly  character of the Russian soldiers' return is wanted. Ruehe  added that the point is to lay the foundation for good relations  in the future by a worthy celebration. Kohl and Yeltsin have  made it a business of the bosses. Questions about Russia's  attitude toward NATO, the Partnership for Peace, and the East  European states took up a lot of space. Grachev resolutely  contradicted the allegation that he had advocated a delimitation  of responsibilities in Europe. The contrary is the case.  Russia is in favor of a uniform European security system that  comprises Russia and NATO. At the same time, he confirmed his  assessment that he had made in Bonn -- that is, that the project  Partnership for Peace is conceived for a transition period. In  response to the question of how long this transition period will  last, in his opinion, the Russian defense minister said that  this transition period started with the Warsaw Pact's  dissolution. It will last until the former Warsaw Pact states  have found their place in the European security system and the  world. This process also includes their economic recovery. They  must stop being debtors who have to beg for unlimited loans. Not  only NATO but also the CSCE, the European Community, and other  organizations belong to a pan-European security system. In his  opinion, they should all cooperate under the CSCE's leadership.  He did not rule out that NATO will also become a partner of the  CSCE. Grachev evaded questions about the relationship that the  East European states should have with NATO, in his opinion.  Moscow wants to see by the example of other countries that  they, like Russia, are also prepared for cooperation with NATO,  he said.    In response to questions about Russia's behavior toward the  Baltic states, Grachev said that the view that Foreign Minister  Kinkel took during his meeting with the foreign ministers of the  Baltic states corresponds to the current position. Russia  continues to be in favor of a speedy withdrawal of its troops  from the Baltic states. However, it does not forego the  fulfillment of the demands made by it. It will not accept  apartheid. This statement was understood as Moscow's demand  that the Russian inhabitants of the Baltic states have the same  rights as the citizens of these countries.</p>

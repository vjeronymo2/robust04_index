			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Arts (Openings): Munich Edvard Munch is the centrepiece of an exhibition opening on Friday at the Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung. It aims to trace the formative influence which Germany had on the Norwegian painter, and to show how he in turn influenced German art. Alongside 100 works by Munch, there will be paintings by German artists he admired and a selection of early Expressionists who found inspiration in works like 'The Scream'. The show later moves to Hamburg and Berlin.</p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Arts: Camp and corn rule - Theatre you remember - liked boys. No wonder, then, that he is the subject of a new show by the all-camp almost-all-drag company Bloolips. In he comes; throws down his sword, shield, helmet and breastplate; heaves a sigh; 'Can't stand wars.' Now he dons the gilded laurel crown; fluffs out his long hair; preens himself; 'Much more me.' From then on, Hadrian keepes changing from one glam frock into another. In one soignee appearance, he wears ostrich feathers and high heels. Now you see why the show is called Get Hur. The Bloolips troupe loves not only camp but also corn. A servant goes to the oracle, to fetch the priestess - 'She who sees and knows everything.' He knocks on her door. From offstage, she calls: 'Who is it?' He gives us a weary look and remarks: 'Not very good, is she?' Hard would he be of heart who did not giggle at some of this tosh. Often it's as if Up Pompeii had been carted out of the closet, as when two slaves prod a drunken corpse in a frock: 'He's like a left over from the Praetorian Guards' scratch-your-eyes-out Drag ball.' From time to time, this absurd affair is a hoot - but only from time to time. On this point, mind you, I differ from the Bloolips audience, which is loyally pro-camp, pro-gay, happily indulgent to the whole show and doting on lines that in 'straight' theatre would earn only a quick titter. Here's an example. 'We've got a secret weapon.?' 'What is it?' 'It's a secret.' On press night, this exchange - far from original - stopped the show for 10 seconds. The Bloolips performers are happy to let the show stop as often as possible. This is nudge-nudge theatre, far from brisk, low on energy, but full of nods, becks, winks. It keeps sagging in between the gags. Still, some of the gags are good. Hadrian tells the Sibyl about the way his love for the boy Antinus grew: 'Then I began to pine and suffer - Oh, it was glorious.' I also liked Rim and Fammy Tay Baker, the two new believers from Jerusalem, who chant in unison: 'We believe that there is one God and his name is Sandy.' I even joined in Fammy's song: 'Sandy, Sandy, You are so handy . . . Give us each day our daily candy . . . Send us restraint when we're randy.' Fammy has Dame Edna glasses and a Bronx accent. She tells Hadrian about her god: 'Sandy will have no homosexuals with trucks - I mean, no truck with homosexuals.' Hadrian is not amused. Get Hur continues at the Drill Hall Arts Centre, London N1</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Political row grows over Bangladesh relief effort RELIEF operations for cyclone victims in Bangladesh are being hampered by political infighting and the failure of promised international aid to arrive in significant quantities. A bitter political row erupted yesterday in Dhaka during a special parliamentary debate on the cyclone when Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and her ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party came under sharp attack from the opposition Awami League, led by Sheikh Hasina. Although the Awami League is a bitter opponent of the armed forces, which have ruled Bangladesh for most of its 20-year history, its leaders demanded that the entire relief operation be handed over to the army. Sheikh Hasina, who has just returned to Dhaka after visiting the affected areas, made a scathing attack on Mrs Zia's government for its handling of the crisis. Much of the relief work is, in fact, being carried out by the army, which is providing food and medical aid to the victims and tents as temporary shelters.</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WILANDER AND BECKER GET TO QUARTERFINALS  </P> <P> Mats Wilander and Boris Becker, the top two seeds, played streaky tennis but  still qualified for the quarterfinals of the $607,500 Monte Carlo Open tennis  tournament today.  </P> <P> Wilander, ranked second in the world, ran off four games in a row in both the  first and second sets to beat Uruguay's Marcelo Filippini 6-4, 6-4.  </P> <P> The Swede, a two-time French Open champion, was joined in the quarterfinals by  two-time Wimbledon champion Becker. The No. 2 seed downed 16th-seeded Jordi  Arrese of Spain 6-1, 6-3, winning six games in a row in the second set.  </P> <P> In other third-round play, Carl Uwe Steeb of West Germany made short work of  Paolo Cane, Monday's winner over Jimmy Connors, 6-4, 6-1. Horst Skoff of  Austria, the 13th seed, ousted last year's finalist, Martin Jaite of Argentina,  7-5, 7-6 (7-5). Alberto Mancini of Argentina, seeded 14th, topped Carl  Limberger of Australia 6-1, 6-3.  </P> <P> Also, Ronald Agenor of Haiti, the No. 10 seed, eliminated the last Frenchman,  Guy Forget, 6-2, 7-5; Guillermo Perez-Roldan of Argentina, seeded eighth, beat  ninth-seeded Jonas Svensson of Sweden 7-5, 7-6 (7-5); and Jan Gunnasson of  Sweden defeated Patrick Kuhnen of West Germany 7-5, 6-2.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Good Mental Test'  </P> <P> After an early rain, the sun broke out in the afternoon, but it started raining  again in the middle of Wilander's match.  </P> <P> "It's difficult conditions to play in, but it's a good mental test," Wilander  said.  </P> <P> Wilander came from 2-4 down in both the first and second sets, turning his game  around and forcing mistakes from the 21-year-old Uruguayan, rated 46th in the  world.  </P> <P> Wilander has had a poor season after losing his No. 1 ranking after the  Australian Open. He has failed to go past the third round of any tournament in  1988 and lost twice in the Davis Cup against Austria, although Sweden won.  </P> <P> "I'm not putting any pressure on myself yet. Maybe later, before the French  Open," Wilander said. "But I'm happy with every win."  </P></p>

At a news conference, Zamora said: "We are concerned that  we have detected a military presence in urban centers in seven  towns in the departments of La Union, Chalatenango, Ahuachapan,  Cabanas, San Vicente, Cojutepeque (Cuscatlan), and San Martin  (Cuscatlan)."    At least 2.5 million Salvadorans will elect a new president,  vice president, 84 Legislative Assembly deputies, 262 municipal  mayors, and 20 representatives to the Central American  Parliament (Parlacen) in the first elections since the civil war  (1980-92).    According to the peace agreements signed by the government  and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, FMLN, in  January 1992, the new National Civilian Police (PNC) should be  solely in charge of public security, but since the PNC has only  been deployed in seven of the country's 14 departments, the old  National Police also participates in those tasks. A total of  8,000 members from these two organizations are in charge of  security for the elections.    Zamora also reported other "irregularities" in the voting,  like propaganda "abuse" by the ruling Nationalist Republican  Alliance (rightist ARENA). He said, "The law absolutely  prohibits this." He also reported an excessive number of cars  with ARENA banners and symbols and a delay in opening voting  centers, which has "hindered" the people's right to vote.    Zamora also asked the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) to  provide voters with more transportation because, according to  him, this is another problem in the electoral process. Despite  these charges, Zamora said he can give "a positive assessment of  the process," and he added that no major incidents have occurred  in the centers where the 6,981 voting tables are installed.</p>

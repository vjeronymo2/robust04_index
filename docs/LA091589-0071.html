			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> WRITER-DIRECTOR FAILS TO SEE OR SELL 'THE BIG PICTURE'  </P> <P> "The Big Picture" (selected theaters) is an attempted satire on the banalities  and venalities of Hollywood that turns into a kind of celebrity roast. Somehow,  the jokesters and their target get promiscuously intertwined.  </P> <P> This is supposedly a movie about idealistic film makers trapped in the  Hollywood system. Yet it looks like a standard '80s sell-out comedy, full of  lame dialogue, guest stars and shticky gags, with a young hero seduced away  from his steadfast girlfriend by the daffy, goofy, corrupt Establishment -- and  then finding himself, and integrity, in time for the rock song under the  closing credits.  </P> <P> This attack on compromise -- in which Nick Chapman (Kevin Bacon), a  student-film prize winner, is wooed and dumped by the dream factory -- looks  like all the other rib-digging sex-and-success comedies: the end result of the  same marketing-research, cookie-cutter methods it's trying to spoof. It's as if  a film maker wanted to make a satire about a young genius trying to make  another "Persona" inside the Hollywood system, and being forced to turn it into  "Beach Blanket Bingo" -- and then somebody decided to play it safe by sticking  in sex and beaches and shooting it in the style of "National Lampoon's  Vacation."  </P> <P> Writer-director Christopher Guest blows his wad early. He and his hip  cinematographer, Jeff Jur ("Dirty Dancing"), stage a student film awards  banquet with four amusing parodies of typical student films. This scene, emceed  by Eddie Albert, is clever but no gem. And, if it weren't for later appearances  by Martin Short (unbilled) as an effete agent and J. T. Walsh and Don Franklin  as a bland exec and his crafty secretary, it would be the best the movie has to  offer.  </P> <P> "The Big Picture" has the same flaws as most student films. It's underwritten  and overdirected. The laborious, one-note gags include old movie parodies of  Bogart, "Psycho" and "The Lost Weekend," opulent parties with starlets who  ditch you when you're down, funny fat snobs, rock videos and swishy agents.  Guest, who has wonderful delayed comic timing when he acts, delays the timing  too much here: The whole picture seems sapped.  </P> <P> Scriptwriters Guest and Michael McKean ("This Is Spinal Tap") and Michael  Varhol ("Pee-wee's Big Adventure") have amusing credits; McKean also doubles as  a lovable buddy cinematographer. But their dialogue here has the monomaniacally  spare quality of the average '80s studio screenplay, as if the speeches were  being held under seven to 10 words apiece to keep readers from eye-strain. The  few observant bits of Hollywood jargon ("Call my secretary and I'll call you  back") rattle around like manufactured bon mots in a sea of tinseled blather.  </P> <P> Guest's heart is in the right place. But "The Big Picture" (MPAA-rated PG-13)  is closer to a jiggle movie than to a truly trenchant Hollywood satire like  Preston Sturges' "Sullivan's Travels" or Ben Hecht's "Woman of Sin." And, as  for the brilliant personal drama that Chapman wants to shoot: It looks pretty  terrible, too -- as if Nick were trying to remake "The Passion of Anna" on a  set built for a Frosty the Snowman commercial. If you're going to mock  commercialism and stand up for art, you'd better make sure you know the  difference between them.  </P></p>

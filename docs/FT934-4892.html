			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Moscow looks set for Baltic withdrawal Russia appears ready to rethink its regional military presence in the Baltics after it recently proposed to withdraw from all but one of its strategic bases in the Baltic states. In recent bilateral talks with Latvia and Estonia, which resume tomorrow, Russia offered to return the nuclear submarine training base at Paldiski, Estonia, as well as the Ventspils satellite listening post and Liepaja naval base by next August, or soon after. Although no agreement has been signed, western diplomats note a change of tone in the long-running negotiations, and place special weight on the explicit offer to leave Liepaja. A military expert said this means Russia must now reduce its Baltic Sea naval fleet since the some 50 vessels at Liepaja cannot be restationed in Baltiisk, the Kaliningrad port, or Kronstadt, near St Petersburg, which are both full. However, Russia wants to keep the early warning radar station in Skrunda in Latvia under military control for six more years, until a similar facility is built in Baranovich, in Belarus. Mr Valdis Birkavs, Latvian prime minster, said Latvia could accept civilian control for 18 months, but only with 'international guarantees'. Roughly 16,500 soldiers are left in Latvia and Estonia. Russia's defence ministry is said to want some troops from the Baltic rim moved to 'hot spots' in the trans-Caucus and central Asian states. Until then, however, neighbouring states are worried about the troop build-up in Kaliningrad, where more than 100,000 soldiers plus equipment are concentrated.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 11 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu asked China Monday to persuade North Korea  that the nuclear card will not work to its benefit. Talking  with Wu Xueqian, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, Han praised Beijing's role in trying to  defuse the North Korean nuclear crisis. He asked Beijing to  persuade Pyongyang that nuclear development will not succeed and  to bring its ally into the international fold, ministry  spokesman Chang Ki-ho said after the 40-minute meeting.    Former Foreign Minister and Deputy Premier Wu, saying his  country had tried to help before and would continue its efforts,  nevertheless explained that Beijing's scope of influence was  limited. But he promised to urge North Korea to work for peace  and stability on the Korean peninsula, the spokesman said.    Wu came to Seoul Sunday on an eight-day visit at Han's  invitation.    He predicted improvement in inter-Korean relations and urged  persuasion through patient dialogue, Chang said.</p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SCRIPPS MEMORIAL AND SCRIPPS CLINIC PLAN TO MERGE  </P> <P> After a whirlwind courtship, Scripps Memorial Hospitals and Scripps Clinic  &amp; Research Foundation have agreed to unify next Jan. 1, leaving Sharp  HealthCare as the jilted party in a health-care triangle.  </P> <P> The surprise union announced Friday will create the largest health-care concern  in San Diego County, an $820-million-a-year conglomerate that will be the  county's No. 2 non-governmental employer.  </P> <P> It also effectively scuttles Scripps Clinic-Sharp HealthCare merger talks that  had been going on for a year. There had been reports in the health-care  community over the last month that those talks had broken down.  </P> <P> A Sharp spokeswoman tersely said Friday that Sharp was surprised by the move.  </P> <P> "We didn't participate in the (Scripps-Scripps) deliberations, nor were we  advised of them. We had continued our discussions with the clinic regarding  development of joint clinical programs literally until today," said Cindy  Cohagen.  </P> <P> She said she had no comment on the future of the joint organ transplant program  that Sharp and Scripps Clinic inaugurated last year.  </P> <P> Ironically, it was publicity in early June about the potential Scripps  Clinic-Sharp merger that helped bring about the union of the two Scripps  facilities.  </P> <P> After reading about the Sharp merger talks, trustees of the two Scrippses began  talking informally later in June, said Ames S. Early, president of Scripps  Memorial.  </P> <P> The discussions quickly snowballed. Over the last two weeks, administrators  entered the talks, and the deal was set, Early said.  </P> <P> Discussions moved so quickly, he added, because Scripps Memorial and Scripps  Clinic share a common corporate culture from their roots in the philanthropy of  Ellen Browning Scripps.  </P> <P> The newspaper heiress established both the hospital and the research foundation  jointly in 1924, but they split in 1946.  </P> <P> Participants rapidly became engaged and enthusiastic as the merger talks  progressed, Early said.  </P> <P> "We have tended to share many similar values over the years, so culturally we  tend to be very much alike," he said. "Once you can step above the daily  situations, you can see the appropriateness and the potential of this  reunification. People very rapidly became convinced that it's the right thing  to do and that it would really be a loss if every attempt were not made to  bring this result about."  </P> <P> Hospital officials said the average patient won't notice any differences in  services at either institution as a result of the merger.  </P> <P> Like Scripps Clinic and Scripps Memorial, Sharp's hospitals are nonprofit and  rooted in private philanthropy. However, Sharp over the last several years has  consolidated into what is regarded in the health-care community as one of the  most rigid, bottom-line medical organizations in the county.  </P> <P> Dr. Charles C. Edwards, president of Scripps Clinic, downplayed the idea that  corporate culture influenced the decision to pursue a merger with Scripps  Memorial instead of Sharp. He emphasized instead the longstanding community  spirit of La Jolla.  </P> <P> "There is a strong feeling in La Jolla and surrounding areas for these two  institutions," Edwards said. "This gained enthusiasm and moved as fast as it  did because it made so much sense -- to our joint constituencies, (to) our  trustees it made immediate sense."  </P> <P> The alignment of the two Scripps institutions with each other will create the  largest health-care conglomerate in the county.  </P> <P> It also will improve the chances of both institutions maintaining a steady  supply of patients in a very competitive environment. Some analysts believe  hospital closures are inevitable as San Diego's health-care industry realigns  itself for this tight marketplace.  </P> <P> "There's no question in my mind that this is the direction of the way  health-care is going to go," Edwards said of the merger. "I think this is going  to be a prototype that is going to be watched very closely around the country."  </P> <P> Early noted that the two facilities will be able to share costly new machines  instead of both buying the same ones.  </P> <P> The merger between the two institutions also positions both of them for the  competition expected when UCSD opens its Thornton Hospital, being built less  than a mile down Interstate 5 from Scripps Memorial -- La Jolla.  </P> <P> Edwards would not comment on that, but added, "I think that a combination of  Scripps Memorial and Scripps Clinic is a far bigger and stronger institution  than either one of them individually and can better compete together than  independently, regardless of what the issue."  </P> <P> Early noted, however, the spirit of cooperation is even extending toward UCSD.  </P> <P> Scripps Memorial officials are in active discussions with UCSD on the  possibility of running cooperative programs when the new hospital opens, he  said.  </P> <P> In addition to a large private biomedical research institute, Scripps Clinic  operates a 173-bed hospital and seven outpatient clinics. More than 350  physicians are affiliated with these operations.  </P> <P> Scripps Memorial operates a 456-bed hospital in La Jolla, a half-mile away from  Scripps Clinic, as well as acute-care hospitals in Chula Vista and Encinitas,  and convalescent hospitals in La Jolla and Encinitas. It is planning another  hospital in San Marcos.  </P> <P> Early and Edwards said discussions are not final on how to meld the two  institutions, particularly since both have research institutes.  </P> <P> Scripps Clinic scientists are at the forefront of a variety of biomedical and  genetic engineering research. At Scripps Memorial, the Whittier Institute has  been established to research basic science issues in diabetes and related  conditions.  </P> <P> The agreement announced Friday is a letter of intent, not the final unification  agreement. Further negotiations will continue, with the goal of completing the  union by Jan. 1.  </P></p>

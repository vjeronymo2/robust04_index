			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (10): Central planners who cannot let go - State industries losses spiral out of control / David Dodwell examines the parlous state of Chinese industry and its continuing decline CHINA'S state industry is in a parlous condition. Everyone from premier Li Peng, through finance minister Wang Bingqian to the State Statistical Bureau is in agreement on this. But the narrow gap between listing industry's failings to formulating solutions seems to be unbreachable since the leap involves espousing market forces and dismantling control over giant industrial machines that have for decades been the focus of political power and patronage. According to the State Statistical Bureau (SSB), more than one third of China's state enterprises - which employ 50m of the country's 150m urban workers - are making losses. Wang Bingqian, finance minister, noted in the recent National People's Congress that the government spent the equivalent of Dollars 11bn in 1990 subsidising state factories, with another Dollars 7.3bn spent on price subsidies for workers. Noting that more than one third of the government's budget is now consumed by subsidy payments, Wang admitted that enterprise losses 'have already reached the point where the state treasury cannot sustain them.' Urgent needs to improve housing, medical care and the country's rudimentary welfare system - not to mention modernising industry - are being preempted by the political imperative of keeping state factories on life support machines. While the gross value of industrial output (GVIO) rose 7.6 per cent in 1990, the impetus for growth came from light industry (+9.1 per cent), private industry (+21.6 per cent) and joint ventures (+56 per cent). State industry lifted output by 2.9 per cent, according to the SSB. Even these figures mislead, since much of the rise in output was fuelled in the middle of 1990 by a bank lending spree that was intended to lift output to the level that would allow the central government to argue that state plan targets for the five year plan ending last December had been met. Much of this additional output went straight on to stockpiles - which increased by RMB 30bn in 1990, according to the SSB. While state enterprise losses doubled from 1989 to RMB 28bn, profits fell 58 per cent, and government tax receipts from state industry fell 18.5 per cent between 1989 and 1990 to RMB 127bn, the SSB said. Over the five year period from 1985-1990 the economic return on every RMB 100 of working capital fell from RMB 23.8 to RMB 16.8, while profits fell from an average of 11.8 per cent to 6.3 per cent. The present leadership talks of the need for reform, but appears unable to accept the loss of central control that would follow. Leaders are also traumatised by a fear that the upheavals inevitably associated with root-and-branch reform would foment political rebellion. Small steps have been taken: the price of basic inputs such as coal, steel and electricity is being raised closer to real market prices. A rudimentary and confused tax system has begun to give companies more independence to invest profits as they think best. A free market in most goods is beginning to grow up as companies are allowed to sell for themselves goods produced above plan commitments. Collective and private enterprises have also come to play a bigger part in the economy, particularly in the coastal provinces and southern China, reducing the political clout of state enterprises, as well as their dominant impact on the national economy. However, there is cold comfort in this growth, since many of these collective enterprises have little intrinsic economic value, thriving mainly because of the monstrous inefficiency of the state industrial machine. The World Bank, in a recent analysis of China's economy*, praises the government's success in progressively increasing production of industrial raw materials such as oil, coal and steel, but then argues that none of this massive investment in raising output would have been needed if industry used these materials more efficiently. It points to 'high energy and steel dependency' that is a result of being sheltered from external competition, being technologically backward, using obsolete capacity, and achieving very low productivof factories producing one-thirtieth of the output possible using more efficient technologies. Staff at Wuhan Iron &amp; Steel, one of the country's leading high-quality steel makers, endorse this view. They say only 25 per cent of China's 66m tonnes-per-year steel output is usable in modern industry. 'Heavy industry absorbs far too much capital,' the World Bank says: 'It provides below average returns, and its appetite for energy is one of the root causes of chronic shortages. 'By targetting machinery and metal industries for promotion, China will starve more deserving sectors of capital, perpetuate an artificial shortage of investment funds in a situation of resource availability few countries can rival, and limit its growth potential. 'The quantum of investment alone is not enough.' Rather than spend more on power generation, the government should spend on replacing old and power hungry machinery, the Bank says: rather than pay subsidies for factories to produce for stockpiles, government should spend on redeploying workers in new and more efficient factories. Enterprise reform is at the heart of this debate. For western economists, this means plant closures on a significant scale, and willingness to allow market forces to sort the survivors. Peking's central planners have preferred to investigate 'enterprise groups', where profitable companies absorb chronic loss-makers with the aim of turning them round. For example, Shanghai Vacuum, the largest of the seven companies publicly quoted on the infant Shanghai stock exchange, was forced by the municipality to take on 2,400 workers from failed local enterprises in 1989. This added RMB 7m to its annual payroll, and did nothing for profits. Yanzheng Industrial, a smaller quoted stock on the Shanghai exchange, had just 100 staff until the local Jing An district government forced it to assume responsibility for 100 workers from a failed factory nearby. Because there is no work for these people, they have to stay at home on full pay at Yanzheng's expense. A further 200 retired workers from the failed factory were put on Yanzheng's pension scheme. Chinese companies complain this practice is like 'whipping the fast ox'. In place of practical proposals aimed at resolving the crisis at the heart of China's industry, leaders in Peking have invoked the slogan of 'Quality, Variety and Efficiency' in 1991. The slogan's principal virtue is that it inflicts no damage on the icon of Marxist central planning. The longer leaders indulge in slogans rather than face head-on the problems of China's industry, the more painful the solutions are likely to be. *China: Between Plan &amp; Market.

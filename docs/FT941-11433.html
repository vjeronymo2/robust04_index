			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / End of centralised NHS pay signalled The end of the present system of central pay determination in the National Health Service was signalled yesterday. Pay increases of 3 per cent for nearly 500,000 doctors, dentists, nurses, midwives and other health professionals will come into effect from April 1. But Mr John Major, the prime minister, announcing acceptance of the recommendations from the NHS review bodies, said the government intended to ensure that pay arrangements in the service provided for a 'significant measure of local pay determination from next year'. Shifting pay to local level is one of the biggest items of unfinished business from the 1991 NHS reforms. NHS trusts - which from April will run almost all hospital, community and ambulance services - have powers to seek to vary national pay agreements, but few do so. The government's determination to move to local performance pay received ample encouragement in yesterday's review body reports. The doctors' and dentists' report said a 'significant shift from central to local pay determination' over the coming years was inevitable in the NHS internal market. It had 'little doubt that the focal point for productivity bargaining should be the trusts'. The review body believes that even the pay of general practitioners - who are self-employed contractors - could be related more to local circumstances. The report shows that the government argued in its evidence for 'exceptionally modest' national increases this April, leaving maximum scope for local bargaining. But the review body did not believe enough progress would be made to introduce local productivity arrangements by April. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, welcomed the review bodies' 'enthusiasm' for local determination of performance pay, and said she attached 'the highest priority' to the introduction of arrangements from next year. The proposal will meet strong opposition from NHS professional organisations and unions, on both industrial relations and medical grounds. Dr Sandy Macara, chairman of the British Medical Association council, said nationally determined pay had ensured equitable standards across the UK. The Royal College of Nursing - which condemned this year's 3 per cent increase as inadequate - was also cautious over the call by its pay review body for a national enabling agreement to facilitate the introduction of local pay. The nurses' review body said it expected to see by next year 'a framework established for effective local pay determination, with clear prospects for achieving pay increases based on local achievements and needs'.</p>

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / BAe may build train body shells BRITISH Aerospace, Britain's biggest aircraft maker, is considering a return to its roots in the locomotive business. Executives at the company's Chadderton site at Oldham, Lancashire, are considering bidding for the contract to build train body shells for the extension to London's Jubilee line. The go-ahead for the extension is expected to be announced today. The company, confirming a report in Modern Railways magazine, said yesterday: 'We have had some exploratory work into the rolling stock business.' A rail contract would take BAe back to an industry it forsook more than 50 years ago to build military air-craft for Britain's war effort. The move would be logical for the company, which has seen markets eroded by cuts in defence spending, heavy competition in civil aircraft and the recession. The Chadderton site specialises in machining aluminium components for Airbus aircraft. This technology would be applied to lightweight train wagons. GEC-Alsthom is leading the race to win the main Pounds 300m contract to build 59 six-wagon trains for the Jubilee line. If BAe is successful in its bid, it will build body shells for the winner of the main contract.</p>

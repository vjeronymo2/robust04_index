			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Subway Sultan: Adnan Khashoggi, the Saudi wheeler-dealer once considered the  richest man in the world, was just another subway straphanger in New York last  week. Khashoggi took the subway home after making one of his twice-a-week  visits to federal authorities, fulfilling a requirement of his bail while  awaiting trial for fraud with Imelda Marcos. A reporter asked him if he was  interested in buying New York, and Khashoggi responded: "Is it for sale?"  </P> <P> On Friars' Menu: As if there haven't been enough jokes about her, Zsa Zsa Gabor  has agreed to be roasted by the Friars Club at the Beverly Hilton in May.  Actually, Milton Berle, who will be master of ceremonies, says the occasion  will be more like "the modern version of Joan of Arc burning at the stake" than  a roast. "We plan to send a limousine for her so she doesn't have to drive in  Beverly Hills," Berle said. Gabor, who was convicted last year of slapping a  Beverly Hills policeman, says she hopes her Friars friends won't be "too rough"  on her.  </P> <P> Book Bound: There is speculation in Washington that there will soon be a Marion  Barry book. Just three days after the mayor was arrested at the Vista Hotel,  his lawyer-agents Ron Goldfarb and Carol Randolph were up early making calls to  see if there was any interest in a book. Stephen Rubin, president of Doubleday,  said Thursday that he had talked with Goldfarb, but he has to talk to the mayor  first. "I'm not buying air. . . . It's simply an idea," said Marie Arana-Ward,  a Simon &amp; Schuster vice president and senior editor, who also talked with  Goldfarb. "The question is whether he will write it, or even wants to write  it."  </P> <P> Almost Legal: John F. Kennedy Jr. is getting his first taste of crime-busting.  Kennedy, 29, an assistant district attorney in New York City, helped with the  investigation that led to the arrests of five travel agency workers accused of  laundering money for drug dealers. The son of President John F. Kennedy won't  be able to prosecute the suspects in court because he failed the bar exam in  his first try last year. He's scheduled to take the test again next month.  </P></p>

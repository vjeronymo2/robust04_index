			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Caribbean pact with Cuba draws US fire - A look at the regional repercussions of plans for trade and technical co-operation SEVERAL Central American states have stepped into a simmering diplomatic dispute between the US and the Caribbean Community (Caricom) over a recent trade and technical co-operation agreement between the community and Cuba. Amid indications of increasing US concern over the agreement, Central American diplomats in Washington told US congressmen their governments opposed the pact. They fear the region could suffer from any action taken by the US against the Caribbean countries. Earlier this month a US House of Representatives foreign affairs subcommittee sent a letter to the governments of the 13 members of Caricom condemning the Cuban agreement. It said that the pact could have adverse implications for future trade agreements between the Caribbean and the US, and that Caricom should rescind its decision. The US government says the agreement does not oblige Cuba to improve its human rights record or move towards democratic government. But leaders of Caricom - set up in 1973 and consisting of English-speaking countries in the Caribbean basin, Belize in Central America and Guyana in South America - have rejected the US criticism. They say the agreement is part of a programme to improve relations with all countries in the region, and that they have not asked other countries with which they have concluded similar pacts for commitments on human rights and democracy. Discontent in Washington has been fuelled by revelations that the draft of the agreement setting up a joint commission between Caricom and Cuba did contain references to human rights and democracy. The scheduled signing of the pact in Havana in April was aborted when Cubans objected to the 'political' nature of the draft. But at the annual summit in the Bahamas last month, Caricom's leaders agreed to the changes. 'Clearly we are disappointed that the agreement signed by Caricom with Cuba did not include any human rights or democracy conditions,' Ms Donna Hrinak, deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs in the US State Department, said in a radio interview. 'I think it is particularly unfortunate as it is coming from Caribbean countries which have their own, very strong democratic traditions, and which have been supporting efforts to restore democracy in Haiti.' While some Caricom leaders, including Mr P J Patterson, the Jamaican prime minister, say that they understand the reaction, they are not moved by it. 'I think there are particular groups in the US which will have reservations, but we have to decide on our own affairs,' Mr Patterson said. 'The cold war is over. Countries in Europe are negotiating with Cuba. It is appropriate for us to have agreements with Cuba in the framework of a joint commission.' The community represents a market of 5.5m people and is attempting to create a customs union and a common market by next year. The setting up of the joint commission with Cuba to oversee co-operation in several areas follows several years of Cuban efforts - with little reward - to improve relations with its neighbours. The commission is aimed at increasing the volume of trade between Cuba and Caricom, enhancing sugar cane yields, boosting co-operation in developing livestock and fisheries, and will combine research in biotechnology, particularly for agricultural and technical applications. Caricom officials say the wording of the agreement was changed to make it consistent with that of similar agreements signed with countries such as Venezuela and Mexico, and one which is being negotiated with Colombia. 'People will need to have it explained to them why Caricom believed that Cuba should, in effect, be given a bye on democracy,' said Ms Hrinak. US officials had earlier complained that Caricom was 'rewarding' Cuba by improving links without winning commitment to political change. 'I do not expect the US to be happy with what Caricom has done,' said Mr John Compton, the prime minister of St Lucia. 'But the Caribbean is consistent in its position. Mexico and Canada never broke ties with Cuba, yet the US has embraced both of these countries warmly in the North American Free Trade Agreement.' US President Bill Clinton has invited the leaders of Bahamas, Guyana, Jamaica, Barbados, and Trinidad and Tobago to discuss hemispheric issues on August 30. 'The meeting will provide an opportunity for the president and the Caribbean leaders to advance their common agenda of promoting democracy and good governance, stimulating trade opportunities and job creation, protecting the environment and fighting drug trafficking,' a statement from the White House said yesterday. Meanwhile, Cubans are clearly happy that the agreement with their neighbours has been concluded to their satisfaction. Mr Lazaro Cabezas, Cuba's ambassador to the eastern Caribbean, said it represented a deepening of links between his country and others in the region. 'Cuba has been training doctors from Caricom countries and providing technical assistance to many,' he said. 'But the prospects for trade between Cuba and the Caricom states has increased significantly with this agreement on the joint commission.'</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Letter: Opportunity for electorate to vote for Europe they want Sir, Without being 'provocatively unconventional' allow me to complete Ian Davidson's perceptive analysis of the implications of the Maastricht Treaty ('No more Maastrichts', May 24). For all its faults, the treaty marks a considerable step forward in the process of European integration, not solely by virtue of the policies brought within its remit but also by virtue of new procedures it introduces. Not the least of these are new powers given to the European parliament. The co-decision procedure (in UK parlance often referred to as 'negative assent') and the extension of the co-operation procedure beyond measures strictly necessary for completing the Single Market are the two most important examples. There is also the enhanced power of the parliament to appoint special committees of inquiry and to empower an ombudsman to investigate maladministration. Last, but not least, there is the new power to endorse the appointment of the next Commission in January 1995. This vote will be the more important as it will express the views of the majority that emerges from the June 1994 European elections. Ian Davidson argues for 'broader acquiescence' among the electorate to legitimise the process of integration. Closer co-operation between the European parliament and the parliaments of the 12 Member States - as recommended in the Commons foreign affairs committee's recent report, 'Europe after Maastricht' - is one way. Elections next year are another opportunity for voters to express their opinions about what sort of Europe they want. Consent of the governed is expressed through national and European parliaments.

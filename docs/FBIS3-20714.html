			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. Vasic and S. Colakovski: "Party Boomerang: </F> Youth on the Margins of Political Life"]    [Text] Does the formation of a new generation for the  parties, immediately before the elections, mean that young  people will only stick up election posters or serve as stage  decoration in the electoral campaign?    To "those for whom the future waits," there is a feeling of  disorientation, that the compass shows a constantly changing  direction in the current social environment. It is reflected  impressionably in political undertakings; young people do not  eagerly attend our political gatherings. In the last election,  not a single party considered them a serious part of the voting  public. They were only -- literally only -- used by the parties  with extremely nationalistic orientation. By the same token,  their voice and considerations (isn't there a paradigm: youth  means progress?) could be heard to the same extent that they  would obtain in commitments. In the final analysis, it adds up  to negligence.    In the domestic political atmosphere, only some parties  formed their own political youth groups and, then, two years  after the first multiparty election. First of all, it was done  when the necessity of "fresh blood for the party" finally became  clear and probably when the significance of the youth factor  began to be seriously considered. What is perhaps symptomatic,  everything that is happening now is precisely for encountering a  new election. Up to now, young people were only one of the  marginalized items in prescriptions in the party programs.  Perhaps because of the already mentioned reasons, the political  life this autumn, despite other distractions, also emphasized  the trend of forming political youth groups in a few more  parties.    Except for brief party announcements to the public about the  formation of their youth groups, the public has had little way  to discern young political activism. Perhaps, it was a matter of  strictly controlled party secrets or because the youth groups  existed only formally.  <H5>  "We Are Not `Guerrillas'" </H5>   How do all the political youth groups that currently exist  on  the Macedonian political scene work? The first parties that  formed youth groups, approximately at the same time two years  ago, were the SDSM [Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia]  with the Social Democratic Youth and the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal  Macedonian Revolutionary Organization -- Democratic Party for  Macedonian National Unity] with the Union of Youth Forces.  During the next few months, the political ambience was enriched  by another three youth groups: the Democratic Youth of the DP  [Democratic Party], the Youth Forum of the PDP [Party for  Democratic Prosperity], and the Liberal Youth Union of the LP  [Liberal Party]. Generally, the organizational appointments of  all the youth groups are arranged according to the model of the  senior part of the respective party, and in every case, without  exception, the primary people in the youth groups are  incorporated in the leading body of the mother party.    We already mentioned that the SDMM [Social Democratic Youth  of Macedonia] and the UMS [Union of Youth Forces] have had the  longest period of existence. According to Toni Apostolovski,  general secretary of the SDMM: "The Social Democratic Youth of  Macedonia fundamentally acts in an independent manner. It  clearly understands that fact and usually expresses its opinion  on all the problems of young people. Through the speakers'  platforms, which we often organize, we try to listen to the  views of our members and, more broadly, those of young people.  All the activities of the SDMM are financed by the party, and we  have formed our own projects, but things have not worked as it  should up to now."    While the young social democrats are proud of their  international collaboration with foreign youth groups sharing  similar origins, the extent of cooperation with youth groups  from the other Macedonian parties is a different matter. The  SDMM maintains that there is no concrete cooperation. The  reasons were reflected in the political situation existing at  the time of their formation and in the difference in attitudes  the groups represented. In connection with the approaching  election, it is said that the SDMM will participate in the  development of the electoral campaign. A definite number of  young people are expected to appear on the electoral lists, and  Apostolovski concludes that, "considering the fact that the  majority of our members are students, we are focusing on that  part of the population in the approaching election."    Bearing in mind the current activeness of our political  youth  groups, one gets the impression that the Union of Youth Forces  of the VMRO-DPMNE started out in a more organized way. "The UMS  has autonomy in its work and a degree of financial  independence," asserts Robert Ljusev, chairman of the UMS.  According to him, unlike the other youth groups, those under age  18 can become members of the UMS, but only those of legal age  can commit themselves politically.    Frequently, the fan clubs of the "guerrillas" are identified  with the youth group of the VMRO-DPMNE, however, Ljusev says  that: "The `guerrillas' are something different. The UMSM  [UMS-Macedonia] has no connection with them; it does not work  with them. Some of the `guerrillas' are, however, members of our  youth group. Sometimes, we have even tried to make an armistice  between the `tripe-eaters' [ckembarite] and the `guerrillas,'  but without success. I think it is a matter of an unhealthy  rivalry between Skopje and Bitola."    In a subsequent conversation concerning his international  contacts, the UMS chairman said that their basic goal is to join  the European organization of right-wing-oriented youth groups of  the political parties, DEMYS [Democratic Youth Community of  Europe]. As far as cooperation with other political youth groups  in Macedonia, the UMS thinks that it is at a correct level. They  had made arrangements for their mutual debut with the SDMM at an  international youth meeting that was held in Bulgaria where only  the views of Macedonia's youth were represented. Finally, Ljusev  explained the basic political strategy of the UMS: "from the  members of our youth group, we will try to create an elite of  skilled young cadres who will be educated abroad and will, in  some future election, be the `thrusting needle' of the  VMRO-DPMNE."  <H5>  Juniors and Seniors </H5>   The Democratic Youth of the DP, the Liberal Youth of the LP,  and the Youth Forum of the PDP are political youth groups of a  more recent vintage. Characteristic of them is the fact that  they were established initially throughout the country, but up  to now, they have lacked particular activeness. Nevertheless,  they have announced a serious commitment to the approaching  election.    "The function of the youth group is to assist the seniors,  but we are independent in conveying the resolutions of the  organization and its activities," says Vesna Jovanova, the  general secretary of the Democratic Youth. "In our youth group,  we will try to work in a decentralized manner, and the  Coordinating Body is the highest organ. We have not had  international contacts up to now, and probably will not  implement any until the party makes [similar] ones. We expect a  victory in the coming election, and that is the basis for our  ever-increasing membership," Jovanova concludes optimistically.    The Youth Forum of the PDP was formed three months ago. The  members of the Forum say that among young people there is the  greatest interest in the organization. Drita Osmani, secretary  of the Youth Forum, emphasizes: "We do not act independently,  but only within the framework of the party. That means that we  pursue the tasks which are already endorsed in the program. Up  to now, we have been active only in the jurisdiction of the PDP  in Opstina Centar [possibly Tetovo] where the initiative to form  the Forum also arose. First of all, we will propose changes in  the educational system, as well as for the eradication of the  anomalies of life: drug adiction, prostitution, and alcoholism."    The youth group of the LP -- the Liberal Youth Union -- was  established formally not quite 30 days ago. The Chairman of the  Liberal Youth Union Andjelka Peeva tells us: "The initiative to  form such a union already existed two years ago, but our  appraisal was that for Macedonians, liberalism was still early  and, therefore, our Initiative Committee attended international  meetings of liberal youth groups in Europe and benefitted from  their ideas and experiences in order to develop a program like  the one the LUM now has." She continues: "The opstina committees  do not currently operate as they should; we will have to work on  that. We have some projects in mind, and sports days and media  presentations to promote the message and to inform drug abusers  that it is possible to live without drugs."    The formation of youth groups opens a new chapter in our  political life. The necessity of rejuvenating party ranks is a  customary practice in countries with much longer democratic  traditions. When will it finally be understood that it is the  parties that need young people, not the reverse? Does the  formation of youth groups, coming immediately ahead of an  election, mean that these young people will mainly serve by  sticking up campaign posters or by providing stage decoration  for the electoral campaign? Shortsightedness about domestic  political supporters along those lines could, doubtlessly, come  back like a boomerang!</p>

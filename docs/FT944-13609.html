			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / N Korea army chief may go The arrival in France for medical treatment of Marshal Oh Jin-u, 77, North Korea's defence minister, may provide an opportunity for Mr Kim Jong-il, the country's new leader, to curb possible military opposition to his rule. Marshal Oh, who ranks second behind Mr Kim, is believed to be suffering from lung cancer and his trip to France indicates his condition has become serious. He was a friend of the late President Kim Il-sung and is chief representative of the conservative old guard that established North Korea in the late 1940s. The defence ministry, in a show of independence, last month publicly rejected a US demand for special inspections of suspected nuclear facilities, which Pyongyang subsequently accepted in the recent accord. Analysts believe Mr Kim may appoint Gen Oh Guk-ryol, who is seen as his chief military supporter. Gen Oh advocates a more professional military by reducing the role of political officers.</p>

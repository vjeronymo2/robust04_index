			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: CRT to acquire Systems Resources for Pounds 6.35m CRT, the recruitment and training group, yesterday announced it was to expand its information technology recruitment business with the acquisition of Systems Resources. The consideration, excluding fees and expenses, is Pounds 6.35m. Of this, Pounds 1.5m will be satisfied by the allotment to the vendors of 1.52m ordinary shares in CRT, the issue of Pounds 2.36m of guaranteed unsecured loan notes, with the balance of Pounds 2.49m in cash. CRT also announced it was to raise Pounds 9.5m net of expenses via an issue of 11.9m new ordinary shares on a 2-for-9 basis at 85p apiece. The rights issue has been fully underwritten by SG Warburg Securities which, together with James Capel, will act as broker. Some Pounds 4.85m of the funds raised will be used to finance the cash and loan note element of the acquisition. The balance will fund the integration and working capital requirements of the enlarged business. Systems Resources made Pounds 65,000 (Pounds 175,000) pre-tax on turnover of Pounds 13.3m (Pounds 10.1m) in the year to September 30 1993. The announcement came as CRT reported its results for the year to April 30. On turnover up from Pounds 47m to Pounds 47.4m, which included Pounds 4.39m (Pounds 11.8m) from discontinued operations, pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 532,000. However, stripping out losses and closure costs of discontinued activities, continuing operations showed a 25 per cent advance from Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 4.9m. The group has withdrawn from its consultancy activities and repositioned Pitman Training by replacing the traditional college-based activities with new training centres. Losses per share emerged at 0.13p (4.22p earnings). A recommended final dividend of 2.5p makes 3.25p (2.8p) for the year. The shares closed down 4p to 101p.</p>

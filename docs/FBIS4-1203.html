			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by E van Wyk] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 23 SAPA -- An accord on Afrikaner  self- determination, including the concept of a Volkstaat  [homeland], was on Saturday [23 April] formally signed between  negotiators of the Freedom Front, the government and the African  National Congress. Present at the signing ceremony at the Union  Buildings in Pretoria were Freedom Front leader Gen Constand  Viljoen, ANC National Chairman Thabo Mbeki, and government chief  negotiator Roelf Meyer. All three signatories to the accord  hailed it as underlining the importance of peaceful negotiations  to reach solutions and avoiding conflict.    Gen Viljoen said had it not been for the forum negotiating  the accord, "major conflict might by now have erupted". It was  also a demonstration of the desire to reconcile the two major  indigenous groups. This was the beginning of a process which  offered hope of peaceful co-existence. The FF [Freedom Front]  had chosen the path of negotiation to avert senseless and futile  violence.    Gen Viljoen called on Afrikaners to come out in support of  his strategy to realise self-determination. ANC National  Chairman Thabo Mbeki said the accord lay the basis for  addressing Afrikaner self- determination. Alluding to the  Conservative Party [CP], he added it was regretful that some  still chose to stay outside the peaceful democratic process. In  the aftermath of the elections, the discussions would continue,  he said. "This sends a message that there is no need to resist  change through violence. We need to accommodate each other.  This is another step to create a South Africa in which all  citizens will feel they belong to one common whole. It is  important that all of us commit ourselves to seek solutions  through peaceful negotiations (rather) than by war," Mr Mbeki  said.    Mr Roelf Meyer said the accord removed all the reasons the  CP  had advanced for not taking part in the elections. The accord  provided for the debate on self-determination to carry on after  the elections. The government believed a volkstaat was not  viable, he added. "It remains an unrealiseable idea because  Afrikaners do not form the majority of the population in any  region of the country," Mr Meyer said. The government and the  National Party believed self- determination could be exercised  in other ways and through other mechanisms than through a  volkstaat with demarcated geographical boundaries, he said.    Responding to a question about the ANC sending out mixed  messages on the "volkstaat" issue by Nelson Mandela saying there  "will never be a volkstaat", Mr Mbeki said the ANC would not  have been involved in nine months of negotiations on the accord  if the organisation did not believe it necessary to discuss  Afrikaner self-determination. No volkstaat had been presented  as yet to approve or disapprove of, he said. However, the ANC  would never accept an Afrikaner "volkstaat" where the objectives  of non- racialism and democracy were subverted. The accord, he  said, provided for the election results, non-racialism and the  encouragement of peace to be taken into account. If the  election results signified "substantial support" for a  "volkstaat", it would not be the only criteria, Mr Mbeki said.    Gen Viljoen said he would regard "above 35 to 40 per cent"  of  the estimated 1.8-million-strong Afrikaner electorate as proven  support, but the interpretation of "sufficient" support lay with  the constitutional court.    Asked how the move would affect the National Party's  support,  Mr Meyer said "more than half of those people calling themselves  Afrikaners don't want an own geographical area".    On the chances of the CP now joining the process, Gen  Viljoen  said CP leader Ferdi Hartzenberg had insisted on 800,000 votes  to be agreed on as "substantial support". In addition, Dr  Hartzenberg sought agreement that the polling of 800,000 votes  would guarantee an Afrikaner Volkstaat. If these demands were  not met, the FF should withdraw from the elections. The CP also  felt that participation in the polls would legitimise the  elections, Gen Viljoen said. Nevertheless, the interim  constitution's principle 34 provided for a volkstaat council to  be established and the FF might also include experts of the  Afrikaner Volksfront on the council.    Gen Viljoen said he was concerned about the far-rightwing's  threats to destabilise the country and disrupt the elections.  He said they should be "wisely" dealt with to avoid bloodshed.  Their serious emotional commitment was not difficult for him to  understand, he added. He called on them to rather join the FF's  strategy and offered to negotiate, facilitate and mediate to  avoid violence.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Survey of Massachusetts (5): Budget cuts put 10,000 out of work - Defence The Massachusetts economy has relied heavily on defence spending for 50 years, and is now paying the price. The starkest illustration comes from Raytheon, maker of the Patriot missile and the state's biggest private-sector employer. Since 1990, the federal defence procurement budget has halved. In the same period Raytheon has cut its Massachusetts workforce by a third, or 10,000 people. At the start of this year it had four missile plants in the state: it now has one. According to Mr Dennis Picard, Raytheon's chairman: 'Our employment will stabilise when the defence budget does.' Like so much else in the Massachusetts economy, the defence industry is intimately connected with the state's universities. Raytheon was born out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology: one of the company's founders in 1922, Vannevar Bush, later became MIT's dean of engineering. Professor Merton Flemings, the present head of MIT's department of materials science and engineering, takes up the story. 'During World War Two, MIT and its research were turned entirely to the war effort. MIT was central to the atom bomb and the development of radar. The inertial guidance system for ballistic missiles was developed by faculty members here. 'From then until this year, there was a partnership between MIT and the federal government. Their largesse has allowed us buildings and equipment, and we have contributed especially to national security.' Much of the government's spending has been concentrated on the Lincoln Laboratory, a defence-centred establishment controlled by the government but operated by MIT. On top of that comes MIT's own research budget, now running at Dollars 360m a year. A large part of that, says Professor Flemings, has historically been defence-related. 'That's going down rapidly now. The so-called partnership with government over the past 50 years is changing, and should do. The national needs are changing, and MIT's as well.' This raises the central question of how far defence-related research and manufacture can be converted to civilian use. In general terms, Professor Flemings is not sanguine. 'In the period to around 1975, I think the research sponsored by the Department of Defence was a significant contributor to the industrial sector. It produced some very important information technologies and new materials. 'After that, the technological advances needed for military systems moved further and further from things of commercial value and significance. There was more and more emphasis on performance regardless of cost. It's been very difficult to translate much of that to the commercial sector, where the emphasis is on high volume and low cost.' Mr Picard of Raytheon agrees with much of this. Cost is obviously a problem, he says, and neither defence products nor defence plants can readily be switched to commercial use. 'There is no commercial use for a guided missile or a warhead, and we build a lot of missiles.' As for converting plants, 'I have a refrigeration plant in Iowa. Suppose I tried to move it to one of our plants here. Besides the fact that the politicians would object, trying to build that kind of product in a missile plant doesn't work. The workforce isn't trained for it, and the rules are different.' He is more optimistic about conversion to civil use on other grounds. Granted, the product may be uncommercial. 'That's not to say you can't use the technology, or the concept, or the systems engineering. Radar is a good example. In a military context, you work to very high specifications and expense, and put in special features to stop jamming and so forth. But it's not too hard to commercialise the components: you just don't test them to the same levels. As for the special counter-measures, you just take them out.' He cites the high-tech electronic medium of gallium arsenide as another example. 'We developed that for monolithic integrated circuits used in ground-based radar to detect things like Scud missiles. Now, you can still grow chips and circuits on gallium arsenide, but you do it much more efficiently by sample testing at the end of the line rather than testing individually'. Nevertheless, he remains gloomy about defence employment overall. 'I'd love to be able to say to our people that we'll stabilise tomorrow. The problem is that the defence budget is coming down as a step function, otherwise known as a cliff. We have to hope that it will turn into a slope. It would be absolutely wonderful to build our defence business back up, and re-employ those skilled and talented people we've laid off. But I don't think it's going to happen.' Despite all that, Raytheon is an encouraging symbol of Massachusetts resilience. It remains an immensely strong company, with good cash flow and a strong balance sheet. Year by year, its profits have increased, and its latest quarter was an all-time record. This results partly from brutal cost-saving, partly from a heroic and singularly successful effort to diversify. In 1990, when the cuts began to bite, defence accounted for 53 per cent of Raytheon's turnover. The figure this year will be around 35 per cent. Part of this is due to plunging defence revenues, but the company has also been active in finding business elsewhere. Last year, it bought the corporate jet business of British Aerospace, causing a local commotion when it shut down UK production. More recently, it paid Dollars 172m for Xyplex, a US manufacturer of products linking desk-top computers. In a classic instance of turning swords into ploughshares, it has just landed a hotly-contested Dollars 1bn-plus contract to supply environmental monitoring for the Amazon basin. From a Massachusetts viewpoint, the big remaining question is whether Raytheon will follow the route of other US defence giants such as Lockheed and Martin Marietta, and combine forces with a rival to cut costs and reduce jobs further. Mr Picard's answer is encouraging. 'I've got a five-year programme which is on plan, and a very strong company. I do have a problem with the order book. If we could acquire a defence company which wouldn't dilute earnings, had synergy and would help protect jobs, then we'd do it. But I'm not interested in buying lay-offs. We've done 10,000 already, and we're getting to some very talented people. You have an obligation to the stockholders, but also to our people.'</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Kalamazoo poised for Pounds 20m buy Kalamazoo, the Birmingham-based computer services and printing systems group, is on the verge of spending up to Pounds 20m on the acquisition of a computer software company. 'I'd like to see us make one or two substantial acquisitions this year, both in the computer software arena. To do that we will have to go to the City to raise some cash,' said Mr Mike Langmore, chief executive. The acquisitions will emphasise the shift in the group's direction. Some 10 years ago, printed systems provided 66 per cent of turnover; they now provide 25 per cent and the main thrust of profits growth is coming from the computer services business. Kalamazoo will, for the first time, be able to finance expansion through paper as well as borrowing. Earlier this year the Kalamazoo Trust, set up in 1948 for the benefit of employees and holding 51.5 per cent of the equity, agreed to accept some dilution. The board now has freedom, without any further approval from the Trust, to increase the capital by 5 per cent. However, acquisitions which demand further dilution would have to be sanctioned by the Trust. No decisions have been made on the how the financing of acquisitions will be structured, but the group is in a relatively strong position either to issue new shares or to raise borrowings. Yesterday's share price of 140p is near the top of its 1994 range and has climbed from a 1993 low of 26p. The group ended the year to March 31 with cash balances of Pounds 8m; they have now reached Pounds 9m, Mr Langmore said. 'To borrow would not be difficult,' he added. Kalamazoo is likely to buy a UK company but it is searching for a continental European acquisition to supplement its first small overseas purchase, CBA Nederland, a software systems business servicing the motor trade - Kalamazoo's speciality. The group claims 45 per cent of the UK motor trade systems support business and has ambitions of spreading into France and Germany but, with recession in the background, it has been cautious. 'We didn't want to buy anything which would immediately fall into lossmaking,' said Mr Langmore. Concentration on expansion of the computer services business seemed to cast doubt on the future of Kalamazoo's printed systems, the historical base of the company. 'We looked at selling it; we examined that alternative with great seriousness, but there is a series of specialised markets which Kalamazoo, with its design capability, can serve.' The printed systems business has been internally overhauled and externally focused on higher margin business such as security printing with a product range reduced from 10,000 to 2,000 in recent years. 'It's generating lots of cash - more than Pounds 2m on turnover of Pounds 16m,' said Mr Langmore. In the year to March 31, Kalamazoo made pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.35m on turnover of Pounds 60.9m.</p>

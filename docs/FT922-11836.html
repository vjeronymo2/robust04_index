			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Peru to wait a year for democracy PRESIDENT Alberto Fujimori of Peru has announced a 12-month timetable for the restoration of democracy, in an attempt to avert international economic sanctions against his military-backed government. Mr Fujimori, who closed Congress and suspended the judiciary on April 5, said parliamentary elections would be held next February. In his speech the president said he would hold a referendum on July 5 to obtain an endorsement for his 'emergency government'. Constitutional amendments would be announced at the end of August, and these would be put to another vote in November. Mr Fujimori said it was not his intention to install a dictatorship, but to build a 'more efficient democracy'. There was no immediate reaction from a delegation of the Organisation of American States (OAS) that arrived in Lima this week to press Mr Fujimori to restore constitutional rule. But the president's speech was clearly timed to impress the visiting diplomats. At home, Mr Fujimori is struggling to maintain business confidence following the resignation of Mr Carlos Bolona, the finance minister. The Lima stock exchange plunged on news of the resignation. Mr Augusto Blacker Miller, the current foreign minister, is expected to take over the finance portfolio.</p>

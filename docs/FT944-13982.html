			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Sale of surplus Japan Tobacco stock delayed Japan's ministry of finance has decided to wait until the next fiscal year, starting on April 1, before attempting to sell the large number of Japan Tobacco shares left over after an initial offer that failed to attract widespread investor demand, agencies report from Tokyo. The ministry said yesterday that 272,390 of the 666,666 shares offered in the partial privatisation were left unsold. The public offering price had been set at Y1.438m for JT shares which have a face value of Y50,000 (Dollars 500). In the first round of the share offer lottery, 145,302 winners exercised their rights to buy JT shares out of a total of 429,339 successful bidders. In the second round, 278,000 applicants won the right to buy shares, but only 12,054 of these actually bought the shares, the ministry said. The ministry was attempting to sell 436,666 JT shares through offerings ahead of the company's listing on October 27. Of these, 7,000 have been sold to the JT employees shareholders' group. Apart from this, the ministry had sold 230,000 shares to investors in an auction in August.</p>

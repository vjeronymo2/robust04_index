			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / A matter of national honour: The arcane world of merit awards The president of Turkmenistan dispenses prize stallions; the Canadian government awards elegant snowflake-shaped medals; the Poles have revived the Order of the White Eagle. In the UK, the Queen presents the Order of the Bath, Thistle and Garter. Though the methods vary, the controversy that honours provoke is widespread. Honours might be rooted in history - but they highlight contemporary political and social concerns and reveal the changing attitudes of governments and the governed. Britain's annual honours, being unveiled today in the Queen's New Year list, will represent one attempt by John Major, the prime minister, to modernise a 1,000-year-old tradition which for some has lost touch with the realities of life. The reforms have two main thrusts. In line with Mr Major's rhetoric of a classless society, honours based on military and civilian rank are being phased out. For the first time, the public has been allowed to nominate candidates, stressing community work. The changes are unlikely to be radical, however. Only 300 of the 900 awards reflect voluntary work, compared with the more usual 200. The government has refused to end the practice of presenting honours for political service, and has decided not to put the system into the hands of an independent body. This year's list was compiled by Downing Street civil servants, as always. Neither does the government have plans to abolish most of the obscure titles which give the list its mystique - or oddity. 'Making people the Commander of the British Empire when we don't have an empire any more is not just ridiculous. It's Ruritanian,' says Professor Stephen Haseler of London Guildhall University, who says the current system is still too imbued with political patronage and social snobbery to reflect merit. But if he looked abroad, he would find similar anomalies. Though the UK is unusual because it is the Queen who personally confers the awards, decorations are by no means the preserve of royalty. France, for example, has procedures almost as convoluted as those of the UK. Its top decoration is the Legion d'Honneur, originally awarded for bravery in battle, though recent French governments have presented it to film stars such as Elizabeth Taylor. The former arts minister, Jack Lang, prompted a furore last year by awarding the Arts et Lettres literary award to Sylvester Stallone; the current arts minister, Jacques Toubon, gave it to Elton John in May. Royalist Netherlands has partly avoided such contentiousness by almost never honouring film stars. About 5,500 orders, mostly the Orange-Nassau, are given annually, in a list that promotes women. Germany also has an egalitarian model, insisting that half its annual 4,500 Orders of Merit go to 'ordinary citizens' - above all people involved in nursing or charity work. In addition, about 100 special medals are distributed every year to sportsmen and women. But it is the US that provides the greatest contrast between public and private awards. In spite of its egalitarian ethos, professional awards are prolific. US presidents, though, have been among the most restrained players in the honours game. President John F Kennedy established the the highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in its present form in 1963, and on average there have been only nine recipients a year. Lech Walesa has received one, along with Lady Thatcher and - memorably - Frank Sinatra. The American public is free to nominate candidates, though the list is decided by the president. Paul Nitze, 86, a foreign policy adviser to every US president except Jimmy Carter in the past 50 years, received the freedom medal in 1985. 'I suppose it had something to do with my role in arms control,' says America's best-known arms controller, who admits that he wears it 'from time to time'. Soviet leaders have been less restrained. Leonid Brezhnev not only loved receiving medals but handed out thousands of titles, such as the Lenin Prize and Hero of Socialist Labour. 'They showed you on television. It was an important recognition of genuine labour,' says Valentin Vdovin, a former Russian diplomat, who received a clutch of medals which he washed, according to tradition, in vodka. The collapse of the Soviet Union has brought chaos to the honours system. Although the Russian government has replaced the Hero of the Soviet Union with the Hero of Russia, and reinstated the Russian equivalent of the Nobel prize, most honours have vanished. Poland has also abolished its communist medals - the Builder of the Polish People's Republic, and Banner of Work, which were colloquially known as 'bread' orders, because of the privileges they provided. However, President Walesa has reinstated the prewar Order of the White Eagle - and presented it to the Pope and to Czech President Vaclav Havel. Political change has also touched the British Commonwealth. Australia's citizens now receive the Order of Australia, created in 1975. The list is drawn up by an independent committee, although it is still rubber-stamped by the Queen. The Australian George Ivan-Smith, a former UN diplomat, whose exploits include being kidnapped in the Congo in the 1960s, says he was delighted to receive the Order. 'What I liked best was that they had recognised international service,' he says. Canada has made similar changes, and discourages citizens from accepting honours conferred by foreign governments. To avoid linguistic wrangles, its own snowflake-shaped medals are tactfully inscribed in Latin, instead of French or English. There is not much opportunity to wear medals in casual Canada, admits Mr Fredrik Eaton, Canadian High Commissioner in London, an Officer of the Order of Canada. However, he often sports his gong in London - even though it is sometimes mistaken for membership of the Rotary Club. Mr Eaton does not think Canadian practice could replace the UK's time-honoured traditions. 'I don't think there is much Britain can learn from Canada - we learnt it from you,' he says. And though some Britons might blush at the imperial past enshrined in their medals, the honours list shows no signs of losing its popularity.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by K. Venizelos] </F>   [Excerpt] President Glavkos Kliridhis will not participate  in talks on the so-called confidence-building measures nor in  proximity talks on this package as proposed by UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. According to information received  by I SIMERINI, President Kliridhis told the UN envoys Joe Clark,  Gustave Feissel and John Paul Kavanagh, who presented him with a  copy of the official reply letter of the Turkish Cypriot side,  that, "this cannot be considered a positive answer on the  package of confidence-building measures."    The same sources told I SIMERINI that the UN officials asked  President Kliridhis to set aside the terms and conditions raised  by Turkish Cypriot Leader Rauf Denktas so that talks may begin  immediately. "Consider that the terms have not been set and  that a the issue of the confidence-building measures will be  resolved during the talks," the UN envoys insisted. But the  president was not convinced. Things will certainly be clarified  today when the UN secretary general's envoys again meet with  President Kliridhis and Denktas. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Dollars 31.5m US aggregates acquisition for ECC English China Clays, the industrial minerals, speciality chemicals and construction materials group, has bought Kost Brothers, a US aggregates, ready-mix concrete, contracting and building block manufacturer, for Dollars 31.5m (Pounds 21.5m) cash. Kost has net cash of Dollars 7m, giving a net purchase price of Dollars 24.5m, and assets worth Dollars 17m before a revaluation of its reserves. In the year to February 28 Kost is expected to have made an operating profit of Dollars 4.7m. Mr Alan Shearer, managing director of the construction materials division, said that Kost was a private company and its reserves had not been valued for several years, so were likely to be worth more than book value. Kost's reserves were 'substantial' with a life of over 50 years. He said there was likely to be a small goodwill element in the purchase. ECC is expected to announce details shortly of the demerger of the construction materials division, possibly at the time of its full year results on March 14. This will involve giving new shares in the division to ECC shareholders on a pro rata basis. Kost is based in the Fargo/Moorhead area on the North Dakota/Minnesota border where it has a leading market share. As such it is relatively close to ECC's other US construction materials operations in Denver, Colorado and Minneapolis/St Pauls, Minnesota. ECC said the deal furthered its strategy of being an aggregate-led, regionally based business in the US.</p>

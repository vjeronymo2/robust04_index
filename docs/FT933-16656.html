			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Punishment meted out / Examining London's new carrot-and-stick approach to parking control Is Mr Nick Lester about to become the most hated man in London? He stands a chance: for as the capital's first parking director, he is about to launch the biggest crackdown on illegal parking the capital's motorists have yet known. The good news for drivers is that, under the Road Traffic Act 1991, illegal parking is to be decriminalised. This means responsibility for enforcing parking restrictions on all but the main strategic routes will be transferred from the police to local authorities, with fines being treated as civil debts rather than an issue for the magistrates' courts. The bad news is that motorists will stand much less chance of parking illegally without being caught; and that those who do break the rules, particularly persistent offenders, will suffer through swingeing penalties and targeted use of wheel-clamping and vehicle removal. Under the existing system, parking restrictions in the capital are enforced by about 1,500 traffic wardens employed by the Metropolitan Police. In addition, some local authorities employ wardens to patrol parking meters and residents' parking spaces. The system, however, is hopelessly ineffective. On average, the London motorist can expect to pick up only one parking ticket for every 50 infringements. With odds as favourable as that, illegal parking has become an epidemic, so worsening congestion and increasing journey times. The main reason why so few offenders are caught is that the Pounds 60m collected in penalty income each year goes not to the Metropolitan Police, but to the exchequer. As a result, the police have little incentive to invest scant resources in employing more wardens or to increase the productivity of the existing warden force. Under the new system, local authorities will be able to keep the proceeds of parking fines instead of passing them on to central government, so they will be seeking to maximise revenues. By the end of next year, the London boroughs expect to employ an extra 1,000 wardens - or parking attendants, as they are to be known. The increase in numbers will be reinforced by an increase in productivity because local authorities will aim to make a profit from this new source of revenue. If they succeed, they will be able to use the surpluses to provide more off-street parking or to improve roads or public transport. According to Mr Lester, director of the Parking Committee for London which is funded jointly by the capital's 33 local authorities, the aim of the new regime is to adopt a carrot-and-stick approach to parking enforcement. 'On the one hand, we are introducing rules that make sense and are easily explained, but on the other, we are getting away from the 'lucky dip' approach as far as parking illegally is concerned.' Briefly, the system will work like this: Responsibility for parking enforcement will be transferred area by area to local authorities over the next year. Pilot schemes will start in the Clapham Junction and Putney areas of Wandsworth on Monday, followed by the first three fully fledged schemes covering the boroughs of Hammersmith and Fulham, Lewisham and Bromley in October. When the transfer is complete, the 1,500-strong Metropolitan Police warden force will concentrate solely on the capital's main strategic roads, now being redesignated 'red routes', with much stricter curbs on parking. All other roads will be patrolled by local authority forces - separately managed, but following the same rules. The Pounds 40 parking penalty on red routes will be unchanged, but on other roads, the Pounds 30 penalty will rise to Pounds 60 in central London and Pounds 40 in the rest of inner London. In outer London, it will stay the same. Mr Lester says the carrot for motorists will be much better signposting for motorists explaining when and where they can park legally, together with a review of existing restrictions to see where more parking space can be released. Conversely, the stick will be the very much greater likelihood of being caught when parking illegally, combined with the prospect of tougher penalties. Attendants will also be able to mete out punishment selectively, for they will carry hand-held computers enabling them to check vehicles' records. While occasional wrong-doers will get a ticket, frequent offenders will have their vehicles clamped or towed away - and from next year, their vehicles will not be released until all outstanding penalties have been paid. The carrot-and-stick approach will continue after the ticket has been issued. The sanction against a motorist who does not pay up will be the same as that for any other civil debt - registration of the fine in a county court and, ultimately, a visit from the bailiffs. But motorists will be encouraged to pay promptly by the offer of a 50 per cent discount for penalties paid in 14 days and the threat of a 50 per cent surcharge after two months. Those who believe they have been wronged will be able to book an appointment for an informal adjudication, at which they will get an on-the-spot decision after a five-minute hearing. Although new to Britain, the London enforcement system is largely modelled on schemes introduced in US cities over the past two years - notably in Chicago, where a similar regime has succeeded in reducing congestion and cutting journey times. It will be closely watched by cities elsewhere in the UK and Europe. Yet, as Mr Lester acknowledges, in one sense it is attacking the symptoms rather than the cause of London's traffic problems. The real issue is the fact that, at present rates of growth, the number of vehicles owned by Londoners will sooner or later outstrip the amount of roadside space available to accommodate them. No one has yet thought of a solution to that particular conundrum, for few of the possible solutions are attractive. Available evidence does not support the notion that improvements in public transport would stop people wanting to own cars. Building underground car parks is rarely feasible and always expensive. Knocking down houses to create more space would not win many votes. In all likelihood, therefore, the answer will lie in ever-greater extension of parking restrictions and ever-higher parking charges, using price as the regulator between supply and demand. The regime about to come into force may just be a foretaste of more draconian measures to come. Not that Mr Lester need worry: he cannot drive. 'But I come from a car-owning household,' he protests. 'And no one's in this business to bash motorists over the head.' At least, that is, not yet.</p>

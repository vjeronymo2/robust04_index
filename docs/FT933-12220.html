			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Cuban telephone links eased THE US State Department has issued new guidelines for telecommunications companies seeking to provide telephone links to Cuba, opening a small, symbolic breach in the US trade embargo against the government of President Fidel Castro, reports George Graham in Washington. The new rules do not release Cuba's estimated Dollars 80m share of earlier telecommunications revenues, frozen in an escrow account in New York, but they allow Cuba to receive half of future telephone revenues. Cuban exiles are allowed to make small remittances to relatives in Cuba, but other dollar transfers to the island are banned by the US. The relaxation of rules for telephone services was authorised by US legislation last year that otherwise sought to tighten the US embargo against Cuba by extending restrictions to the foreign subsidiaries of US companies. This was hotly contested by foreign countries, including the UK, as an unwarranted extension of US jurisdiction. Cuban exiles in the US, including those who otherwise oppose any thaw in relations with the Castro government, strongly favour improved telephone links. Telephone links with Cuba have always been difficult, but became even more so after Hurricane Andrew last year knocked out AT&amp;T's transmission towers in south Florida. It is not clear whether Cuba, which has insisted on receiving its money from escrow, will accept the proposal, but its increasingly desperate need for foreign exchange may well cause it to settle for the offer under the new rules.</p>

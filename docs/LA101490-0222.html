			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READERS RESPOND TO ELDERLY HOUSING SERIES  </P> <P> "Having It All" by David W. Myers on elderly housing (Sept. 23) proves that it  pays to read the Real Estate section. The article not only covers senior living  possibilities, but the statistics explain attitudes toward seniors,  particularly women.  </P> <P> Recently retired, 60-plus and widowed since age 49, I've sensed hostility  against independence in older women from both male and female peers.  </P> <P> In the travel realm, (including Elderhostel), brochures make it patently clear  that accommodations are on a Noah's Ark basis. Many of us single women are  perfectly willing to pay double if only we could be roommate-less. Although the  tour/conference/ whatever would lose not a cent, it insists on pairing us up.  </P> <P> I assume this true in some retirement communities. Could this attitude be  because so few middle-class women have either education or recent work  experience? Although I've never been a women's righter, I'm beginning to  wonder.  </P> <P> MARY MEYER  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

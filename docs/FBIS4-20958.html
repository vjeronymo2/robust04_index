			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria by Maria </F> Teresa Ronderos and Francisco Celis; place and date not given]    [Text] The president was beaming. "It is not a matter of  good luck," he laughed. "When things are done right, they come  out right." Gaviria believes that Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin  and the rest of the team that consolidated his election as the  new OAS secretary general did things very well. Gaviria  announced that he will not get involved in national politics in  the next few years and added: "More than one person will be  happy about that."    He appears confused when told what many people in the  streets  are saying, that he was put in the position by the United  States. But he defends himself without hesitation and says  firmly that he would not have been elected if the international  community had not viewed Colombia as a very independent country.  This is what he plans to do from his post at the OAS.    [EL TIEMPO] Why did you want to head the OAS, an institution  in crisis?    [Gaviria] Late last year, some presidents and foreign  ministers suggested that I should submit my name for the  position. It looked like an interesting challenge. Although  Joao Baena did a good job at the OAS and the organization has  modernized itself in the past few years, nearly all  international organizations lag behind in terms of the  tremendous changes that have taken place and the speed with  which the agenda has shifted. For those reasons, I thought I  could do something worthwhile after I complete my term.    [EL TIEMPO] Aren't you interested in resting? Isn't this  decision like getting off one bucking bronco to get on another?    [Gaviria] Yes. I would say it is a coincidence--not a very  happy one--that I will have to leave one position and assume  another without respite. But the situation was not under my  control. I have not set the date, but I will have to assume  office as OAS secretary general a few weeks after the end of my  administration, maybe early in September.    [EL TIEMPO] What will have to change to make the OAS a true  instrument of integration and to overcome the rhetoric that has  gone on for the last 30 years?    [Gaviria] First, I perceive a great desire on the continent  for the OAS to play a more important role in economic issues and  in the integration processes of various countries. There is an  American ideal to create a great free trade zone. I hope to  make some progress along those lines in the next few years.  Second, there is a general idea that the OAS must be more  prepared and equipped to cope with the problems of democracy on  the continent, problems such as ruptures and difficulties. It  must also encourage democracy. Third, we are convinced that much  more has to be done regarding human rights, not only studying  specific cases but stimulating compliance with these rights.    [EL TIEMPO] Do these things depend on your leadership or on  a  change in the institution?    [Gaviria] I do not think it depends on my leadership. It  truly depends on our capacity for political willingness and our  ability to express it through institutional change, something  that was not always possible in the world. Sometimes the  willingness is there but no way is found to make changes or to  use the means at our disposal, or maybe the adequate instruments  are not found. I hope we will succeed.    [EL TIEMPO] Which case requires the most urgent attention:  Cuba, Haiti, or Peru? Which is the most difficult?    [Gaviria] I think the Peruvian problem is a thing of the  past following the Democratic Constituent Congress. I do not  think Peru is a case at all anymore, nor do I think Cuba is on  the organization's immediate agenda. Haiti, however, is on that  agenda. Other than stating--as I have several times before--that  we must continue to work to reestablish democracy in Haiti and  to reinstall President Aristide, I have nothing new to add,  except that I will have to study the situation carefully when I  take office. There are still a few months to go yet, and I have  no way of foreseeing what additional proposals or solutions  could be adopted.    [EL TIEMPO] Among the most recent Colombian presidents, you  have been one of the most open toward Cuba. You built bridges  for them; you reestablished diplomatic relations; you met Fidel  Castro; and now there is talk of selling oil to Cuba. Does this  mean it will be easier for you to bring Cuba back into the  Inter-American system?    [Gaviria] Nations all across the continent believe that if  there is political and economic change in Cuba, approved, of  course, by the organization, we could try to move Cuba back into  the inter-American system. There is no way to assess the degree  of such changes or the country's willingness to make them  happen. If changes are made, it would be desirable to bring  Cuba back into the system.    [EL TIEMPO] How will you maintain and guarantee your  neutrality in conflicts involving Colombia?    [Gaviria] As soon as I take my oath, I will be the secretary  general of the OAS. My opinion as the president of Colombia  should have no bearing on my performance as secretary general.  I will become the interpreter of the organization's mandates.    [EL TIEMPO] Trade, poverty, the environment, and drug  trafficking are some issues on the continent's agenda. What are  the priorities?    [Gaviria] I think the priorities are trade, the defense and  conservation of democracy, human rights, the environment, and  poverty. In the next few years we will have to work hard and  see what happens. We need institutional reforms and new  instruments. We must study everything carefully and see how to  handle each specific situation.    [EL TIEMPO] Rumor has it that you were put in this position  by the gringos. Niehaus said that after losing. How will you  demonstrate your independence?    [Gaviria] I have no reason to demonstrate my independence.  Colombia's foreign policy over the last few years should remove  any doubt about the Colombian president's independence.  Contrary to what one may expect to result from that policy,  many countries backed Colombia because of its international  policies and its independence. Colombia's success is due to the  great work by Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin and the ministry  itself in spreading our message. It was not Colombia's message  but the message of the nations that accompanied Colombia. My  candidacy was successful because of the way Colombia presented  its arguments and convinced 20 countries to support it. The  United States publicly expressed its support for Colombia early  in the race and gave us its vote. I don't think it did anything  more than that.    [EL TIEMPO] Will you remain on the sidelines of national  politics over the next five years?    [Gaviria] Without any doubt whatsoever.    [EL TIEMPO] Is there anyone who is particularly happy  because  of this decision?    [Gaviria] More than one person will be happy about that. Of  course, I am going to be on the sidelines of Colombian politics.  There is no possibility whatsoever that I will be able to  participate at any level.    [EL TIEMPO] Mr. President, with respect to the issue of drug  trafficking, it is being said that Colombia has no autonomy and  that it agrees with what the United States believes must be done  with the drug cartels.    [Gaviria] I strongly disagree with that assessment.  Colombia's policy on drug trafficking has been independent and  in agreement with our convictions and the country's fundamental  interests, and we have been able register a high degree of  international cooperation. Keep in mind that during the past few  years we outlined a uniquely Colombian policy. Colombia  eliminated extradition, we undertook the surrender program, and  we decided to strengthen the justice system. In the beginning,  the international community viewed these policies with  skepticism, and yet, these policies proved to be successful and  effective. I would like to know where you got the idea that  these policies were imposed by the Americans. None of these  policies...    [EL TIEMPO] I was referring to recent statements and  positions regarding the Cali Cartel, and comparing them with  what the United States believes must be done.    [Gaviria] Statements from whom?    [EL TIEMPO] For example, the U.S. drug czar and the attorney  general.    [Gaviria] We must understand that judicial cooperation is a  very difficult process and that the two countries' judicial  systems are different. We got into instituting some programs,  and also into a somewhat disturbing public discussion in an  effort to determine whether we could cooperate. It is logical  that differences should arise. The U.S. Justice Department has  significant differences with the Prosecutor General's Office.  In the past, the executive branch also had differences of  opinion, but I believe we are overcoming these now.  Nevertheless, we cannot be surprised by this. The president is  usually very careful when he issues an opinion with regard to  U.S. drug trafficking policies. However, the Prosecutor  General's Office does not always react in the same manner. If  this happens here, then we must expect to receive criticism from  over there.    [EL TIEMPO] In light of your experience in dealing with drug  trafficking, what do you think the struggle against this problem  will be like within the OAS?    [Gaviria] I believe that for now the OAS has a very narrow  program which basically focuses on prevention and crop  substitution. I also believe that no one has proposed going any  further; at least, I do not see any worthwhile proposals being  evaluated at this time.    [EL TIEMPO] How will Colombia benefit from your being in the  OAS?    [Gaviria] I believe my election already represents something  positive, because it represents a recognition of the country's  international policies. I also believe it is going to be  positive in the future. If Latin America progresses, the  integration process develops, and cooperation increases, then  Colombia will benefit just as all the other countries will  benefit.    [EL TIEMPO] It has been said that you were born under a very  auspicious star, and, under such a star, we are going to end up  as world soccer champions. What do you think about the team?    [Gaviria] I do indeed believe I am often considered a very  lucky person. Of course, that is a somewhat fatalistic  explanation. No, it is not a matter of good luck. When things  are done right, they come out right. Obviously, those things  that started out on the wrong foot turned out badly. Public  opinion and the media pointed out these mistakes. I believe it  is time the country learns that things can go right and that it  is not simply a matter of good luck. No. I believe we  Colombians are doing things right in areas such as the economy,  politics, institutional change, the struggle against drug  trafficking, and sports. In fact, things cannot go wrong all of  the time.</p>

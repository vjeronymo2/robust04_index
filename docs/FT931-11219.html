			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Knives out for UK potato scheme GOVERNMENT MINISTERS are determined to sweep away the UK's present potato marketing scheme, despite this week's setbacks to the necessary legislation. The reverse came when a cross-party alliance of peers twice voted against the government's advice in the Lords on Tuesday night, backing first a move to protect the scheme ahead of an impending European Community declaration and then an amendment requiring a poll of registered producers before the Potato Marketing Board could apply for approval of a successor scheme. Ministers believe there is scope for common promotion and research and development within the industry, but are convinced they should move swiftly to end the current marketing regime. Their resolve has been hardened by this week's cabinet deregulation seminar, chaired by prime minister John Major, in which ending the present scheme was among the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food's main contributions. This week's developments come ten weeks after the PMB's future was called into question by the emergence of proposals for a lightweight Ecu1.5m (Pounds 1.2m) EC potato regime aimed at harmonising the different mechanisms applied in member states in the run-up to the Single European Market. Though final decisions on how to deal with the issues on which the government was defeated have not yet been reached, the priority for ministers is expected to be removing the new requirement for a producers' poll. It is understood the government might accept some restriction on the timing of the end of the regime, which is dependent on EC decisions. The government's commitment to changing the scheme, which it holds responsible for rising imports of processed potato products, has been underlined by Mr David Curry, the agriculture minister, in the face of concerted cross-party opposition from MPs with potato-growing constituents. It would be sacrificing the interests of UK potato farmers 'if we agreed a scheme in which everyone in the Community could plant what they wanted. . . but the United Kingdom alone was pegged back by acreage quotas,' Mr Curry argued. But Mr Bill Walker, Tory MP for Tayside North where 46 per cent of the Scottish potato crop is grown, has warned that if the present scheme were scrapped, 'the probability is that. . . farmers will be forced into cereals'. Low prices have led to substantial PMB intervention in the market this year, increasing the strength of many farmers' allegiance to the existing regime.</p>

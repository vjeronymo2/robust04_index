			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> "Batman" continued its torrid record-breaking box office pace during its second  weekend in release, and the second sequel to "The Karate Kid" got off to a much  stronger start than expected, according to weekend projections made Sunday by  industry sources. Those sources said "Batman's" grosses would total about $30  million over the weekend, and that the Warner Bros. film would break the  $100-million mark by the end of the Fourth of July holiday. Disney's surprise  hit, "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," held onto second place, with a projected $13  million for its second weekend. Columbia had the third- and fourth-best  performing films in theaters with "The Karate Kid Part III" (more than $10  million in grosses expected) and "Ghostbusters II" (between $9 million and $10  million). "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" (about $7 million) and "Dead  Poets Society" (about $6.5 million) were next, followed by Orion's  just-released "Great Balls of Fire" (less than $4 million, according to  projections). No figures were available on Universal's "Do the Right Thing,"  which opened on a limited basis around the country, but exhibitors showing the  film said it opened very strong.

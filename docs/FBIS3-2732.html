Around the  Lunar New Year, prices of basic necessities including grain,  edible oil, and so on rose and fluctuated by 20 to 30 percent in  various localities across the country, which elicited  pessimistic sentiments about the economic prospects for 1994 and  a premonition of uneasiness among mainland people. The  phenomenon of panic purchasing, which has seldom been seen in  recent years, suddenly emerged again. Given the emergency  measures adopted by the CPC hierarchy and the temporary  stability of commodity prices, the dark economic shadow cast on  people's minds by the earlier fluctuations cannot be removed.    Moreover, the "Decisions Concerning Several Issues on the  Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure" adopted  by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee  last year were partially put into practice at the start of this  year. However, mainland people are still unfamiliar with most of  the contents of the "Decisions." In various localities, people  were resentful or felt puzzled to varying degrees about the  policies made according to the "Decisions." Some local  officials in the economically developed regions or provinces are  dissatisfied with the value-added tax and revenue-sharing  systems and think that these policies, which are aimed at  intensifying the controlling ability of the central authorities  and weakening the financial powers and resources of localities,  will substantially retard their economic development speed. In  many areas, people once again started an investment craze by  taking the opportunity of relaxed macroeconomic regulation and  control by the central authorities to seek more loans to expand  local economic development, which has intensified inflationary  pressures on the mainland considerably.    Furthermore, millions of workers and staff members  throughout  the country who work in large and medium state enterprises,  two-thirds of which are bogged down in the predicament of open  or hidden losses, feel uneasy and greatly dissatisfied in the  face of soaring prices. Since the end of last year, social  security conditions on the mainland have deteriorated again,  with the proportion of serious cases increasing and the  phenomena of organized crime worsening....    The CPC hierarchy is very worried about the above situation.  For this reason, while stressing the importance of intensifying  social security, cracking down on various criminal activities,  stabilizing commodity prices, and properly arranging the masses'  lives, it recently decided to reiterate those policies and  measures practiced by the central government since last June to  stabilize the economy, rectify the monetary order, strictly  control the total amount of credit, reinforce supervision and  management of finance, and intensify central macroeconomic  regulation and control. In addition, it particularly stressed  the need to "continue exercising strict management by mandatory  planning in granting loans for investment in fixed assets."  <H5>  The CPC Recently Put Forth a "20-Character Principle" </H5>   Additionally, the CPC hierarchy also held an unprecedentedly  large-scale national propaganda and ideological work meeting in  the second half of January to make "work arrangements" for  controlling social opinion and preventing the media from  engendering social disturbances.    It is thus obvious that the work focus of the CPC hierarchy  has now been put entirely on "stability." The guiding policy  ideology of "accelerating both reform and development" has  faded. Apart from retaining the former wording of "sustained,  rapid, and healthy" economic development, it has lately put  forth a "20-character principle:" "Seize the opportunity,  deepen reform, open the door wider, promote development, and  maintain stability." This is the overall requirement for work  this year, so various tasks should be carried out to serve and  meet this requirement. Meanwhile, authoritative personalities  in economic circles feel that basic stability should be  maintained in five areas--prices, speed, agriculture, money, and  society.    Since the second half of last year, Zhu Rongji, State  Council  vice premier and concurrently president of the People's Bank of  China, has been widely criticized and complained about by local  officials because of the measures he adopted to stabilize the  economy and intensify central macroeconomic regulation and  control. However, he has broken silence and become very active  recently, and his position and views have been highlighted again.    Models of Decentralization and Centralization  Originated From Third Plenary Session    Within the CPC hierarchy, there is generally no divergence  of  views on the issue of "whether or not the central capability in  macroeconomic regulation and control should be augmented and  whether or not the central committee should have powerful  authority." The CPC hierarchy has been deeply worried about  this issue over the past few years. During the last 10 years or  so, every upsurge of economic development on the mainland has  been generated from the practice of various policies and  measures to repeatedly decentralize or delegate power to the  lower levels, and every standstill or slowdown in economic  reform and development has been caused by centralizing or  withdrawing power from the lower levels. As a matter of fact,  all such moves, decentralization, centralization, and the  delegation or withdrawal of power, no matter how they are looked  upon, comprise the basic content of reforms, anti-reforms,  development, and stagnation on the mainland over the past 10  years or so. The problem is: the centralization,  decentralization, and the withdrawal and delegation of power  were all carried out under the precondition that the political  and economic structures generally remained unchanged, so that  decentralization and the delegation of power to the lower levels  became a special means to mitigate crises in the old structures  and to display their structural functions, while centralization  and the withdrawal of power became an act of intensifying and  supporting the old structure by amassing achievements scored  through decentralization and the delegation of power to the  lower levels. The "mutually complementary" effect which was  unexpectedly obtained from these two opposite and contradictory  actions in the old structure caused interest groups in the CPC  and its administrative officials at various levels to expand.  This has enabled them to form "common interests" on a greater  scale and caused their motive of relying on the old structure to  gain more interests through decentralization. As a result, the  old structure has been able to maintain its existence for a long  period of time.    However, within the original structural framework of  decentralization, centralization, and the delegation and  withdrawal of powers, the mainland's economic development has  been unable to avoid and overcome the malpractice of big  fluctuations, haphazard expansion, and rigid uniformity. The  major development of factors of a market economy obtained from  the decentralization of power cannot be transformed into any  wealth in the old structure through the centralization and  withdrawal of power from the lower levels, nor can it continue  to form factors for healthy economic development under the model  of decentralization and the delegation of powers to the lower  levels. Therefore, a model of combined decentralization and  centralization emerged in the "Decisions" passed by the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Starting  from the overall transformation of the economic structure, the  CPC attempted to create and provide a brand new structural  framework for the mainland's economic development. Under this  framework, a modern enterprise system would be instituted as a  supporting point, which would be propped up by a market system,  taxation, finance, state macroeconomic regulation and control,  and a social insurance system; the administrative division of  power would be determined by the scale of assets comprising the  market; and a new power structure would be established under the  conditions of a market economy.  <H5>  Zhu Rongji Braves Wind and Waves </H5>   Therefore, when we assess economic reform on the mainland  today, we can no longer use criteria such as whether it is  decentralization, centralization, and the delegation and  withdrawal of powers. Instead, we should have our eyes on  whether or not it is beneficial to fostering the main body of  activities in a market economy and effectively allocates  resources in accordance with the laws governing the market  economy. Judging from these new criteria, the decentralization  and delegation of power to the lower levels is not necessarily  tantamount to reform, and the centralization and withdrawal of  power from the lower levels is not necessarily tantamount to  anti-reform either. In fact, the withdrawal of powers in  unrestrained and arbitrary fund-raising, the arbitrary  establishment of projects, and arbitrary investments, which  concentrates energy on several infrastructure facilities which  have a significant bearing on the national economy and the  people's livelihood, may even be more conducive to the  establishment of a market economy structure. Of course, powers  withdrawn from the lower levels should not be held in the hands  of the relevant government departments as they were in the past  under the planned economy. Rather, they should be concentrated  in the hands of enterprise organizations which are responsible  for activities, such as state investment and development banks,  and so on. In short, it will not do to follow the beaten track  of seeking interests through the decentralization of powers on  the strength of the old structure to spur economic development.  However, the complexity of the issue lies in the fact that,  under the situation where the current market economy system on  the mainland is unsolid and the institutions of the market  economy are relatively weak, in order to achieve comparatively  rapid economic growth, the administrative decentralization of  power is still regarded by most provinces, cities, and  localities as the only effective measure to choose. Therefore,  since the second half of last year, Zhu Rongji has adopted a  series of policies to rectify the monetary order and intensify  macroeconomic regulation and control. As he has totally blocked  financial resources obtained by localities before, he was  universally criticized and resented. Moreover, the new taxation  system proposed in the "Decisions" has also considerably reduced  the local revenues of many localities. This evoked the  dissatisfaction of local governments even more intensely so that  Zhu Rongji was condemned for "taking the old path of the planned  economy" and "retrogressing in reform."    At present, government departments in various localities  are still the principal planners and organizers of local  economic activities, and are still handicapped by the  "decentralization of powers is equal to reform" model. They do  not understand very well the complete series of new measures for  the establishment of a market economic structure put forward in  the "Decisions," and, therefore, are not very enthusiastic about  the above policies. At present, when the CPC hierarchy is  reiterating such measures as "continuing to rectify the monetary  order and reinforcing management of investment in fixed assets  by mandatory planning," they inevitably sharpen conflicts  between the central and local authorities, and Zhu Rongji is  precisely braving the wind and waves in these conflicts. If  conflict continues to grow, economic and political turbulence on  the mainland is unavoidable, and the person running the greatest  risk is none other than Zhu Rongji.  <H3>  CPC Bedeviled by Large Numbers of Unemployed Personnel in  State-Owned Enterprises </H3>   Increased inflationary pressure is regarded by the CPC  hierarchy as the most important factor affecting stability, and  several dozen million staff and workers in the vast number of  state-owned enterprises on the mainland are the people who are  most seriously victimized by inflation. Because two-thirds of  state-owned enterprises have had production suspended or  semi-suspended due to known or hidden losses, the vast number of  staff and workers are in low spirits and resentful as they have  lost wage income and have found no way of becoming rich, thus  becoming the most unstable social force in mainland society at  present. Since the CPC's rectification of the monetary order  and the intensification of macroeconomic regulation and control  last year, loss-making enterprises and the vast number of  workers in them were the first to be adversely affected. The  shortage of circulating funds has caused more than half of the  mainland's large and medium state enterprises to land in the  predicament of being tied up by enormous "debt chains" amounting  to 370 billion yuan, and several dozen million enterprise staff  and workers are receiving less than a half of their original  wages to live on. With the price surges facing the mainland at  present, staff and workers in these enterprises are almost  unable to support their families. The CPC hierarchy is worried  about inflation, but in fact it is worried that workers from  these loss-making enterprise workers in the cities may take to  the streets to create trouble. If workers adopt an antagonistic  attitude toward the government, this will become one of the most  acute contradictions on the mainland now.  <H3>  Corruption Deepens Misunderstanding Between Officials,  Civilians </H3>   Naturally, economic problems should be resolved through  economic measures. However, under the present circumstances  where there are still no effective policies to resolve economic  contradictions rapidly, the use of political means is  indispensable. However, it is precisely in this aspect that  many measures adopted by the CPC hierarchy have been barely  satisfactory. Since the second half of last year, various  fields of endeavor, including the anticorruption campaign,  controls on the press, emphasis on building spiritual  civilization, the crack down on criminal activities in society,  and so on have all been political measures taken by the CPC to  coordinate with stabilizing the economy and eliminating unstable  social factors. Judging from their current actual effects,  however, these political measures have not had marked results.  This is manifested by the lack of good relations of mutual  trust, understanding, and support between the government and the  people like in the past. For this reason, the government is  bent on preventing the people from "creating trouble," and the  people regard government cadres as "corrupt officials" who are  "degenerate and incompetent," "imperious and despotic," and  "scrambling for power and profit." There are a lot of barriers  between officials and civilians but very few channels for  straightening out misunderstandings between them, with  grievances constantly accumulating and their removal becoming  increasingly difeels deeply that it has limited advantageous  resources to tap and exploit while using political means to  alleviate contradictions in economic development.    One of the barriers between mainland officials and civilians  is the corruption among quite a number of officials. Although  the CPC hierarchy has conducted an anticorruption campaign on a  grand scale since the second half of last year, and has really  exposed and handled a number of cases involving government  officials who took bribes and perverted the law, it has failed  to win more faith and understanding from the masses. This is  due to a lack of transparency in the course of handling cases.  As the results are not publicized (in most cases), and  adjudication according to the law is not strictly conducted, the  way cases are handled has been castigated by the public. People  ask: "How many cases involving corrupt acts by officials have  there been after all? How senior are the officials involved in  corrupt deals? How many option struggle should be waged, but a  certain yardstick should be applied to avoid causing harmful  social effects which indicate `the overall decay of the  Communist Party and its cadres.'"    These stipulations did not come up to the masses'  expectations of the anticorruption struggle, so they have not  won more understanding, trust, and support from the masses.  This being the case, the reform propositions and programs  introduced by the CPC and its appeal to the masses to maintain  social stability do not have adequate basic social conditions,  and its call on the masses to participate in the building of  spiritual civilization has become a mere formality of making  empty talk.  <H3>  Officials, Civilians Have No Channels for Mutual  Understanding, Exchanging Views </H3>   Another barrier between officials and civilians is the lack  of channels for mutual understanding and the exchange of views.  The mainland's press and propaganda media are under direct  official control so they can only "give lectures," "instill the  party's views," and "provide guidance" to the masses; more often  than not, the "reflection of the people's voices" is restricted  to giving support and endorsement to the policy decisions of the  ruling party and government, while the substantial volume of  divergent voices and views from the masses representing  different interest groups are rejected. Officials and civilians  cannot exchange views and reach consensus through the public  opinion media, hence the masses can only build up an opinion  atmosphere centering around matters with which they are  concerned in a covert sphere, which runs counter to the opinions  of the ruling party and government. Then, the authorities only  conduct "self-propaganda and self-performance" without any  audience or spectators in a public arena for public opinion. In  this way, they have lost an effective means to eliminate  unstable social factors in a timely manner.    As viewed from the mainland's political structure, the  organizations of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference [CPPCC] and so-called "multi-party cooperation" are  at most a number of "CPPCC branches" of the ruling party. They  have no unique political program, sound organizational system,  and political function of running for elections, voting, and  directly engaging in administrative affairs. The composition of  aging personalities has long lost its ability to "participate in  the deliberation and administration of state affairs," and the  social strata they previously represented have been unable to  conduct an effective flow of political views with the ruling  party through them. As for the people's congress being the  "fundamental political system" directly controlled and "led" by  the ruling party, the election of deputies is subject to strict  official selection. Hence, deputies do not represent the  electorate, and the level of their participation in the  deliberation and administration of state affairs is low. At  ordinary times, they can "keep in step with the central  authorities," but when a major political event takes place, they  can simply do nothing. Around the time of the 4 June incident  in Beijing in 1989, the insignificance and impotence of the  people's congress system fully proved that it could not be a  political organization capable of ensuring social stability on  the mainland, and that the people's will cannot really form  harmonious unity with that of the ruling party through this  organization.  <H3>  Politburo Standing Committee Broke Rule To Fete Party Organ  Officials </H3>   To sum up, the only measure the CPC hierarchy can choose to  surmount the predicament of social instability encountered by  the mainland's economy and development at present is to mobilize  all traditional means to strive to "provide against possible  trouble." A source on familiar terms with the CPC hierarchy  disclosed a few days ago that the phrase, "birds startled by the  mere twang of a bow-string," is the most accurate expression  used to describe the general mood of the mainland people and  senior personalities in the CPC. In the case of the people, the  "frightened birds" are worried about inflation and price surges  this year, and the "frightened birds" among senior CPC  personalities fear that the masses will stir up large-scale  turmoil and social unrest. Against this background, the CPC  hierarchy recently decided to continue practicing the policy of  "rectifying the monetary order and stabilizing the economy"  introduced in the second half of last year, appropriately slow  down the pace of large-scale economic structural reform, curb  ever-expanding investment in fixed assets, conduct some basic  work and break through monetary structural reform first, and, at  the same time, allocate large amounts of funds to properly  arrange the lives of staff and workers in urban loss-making  state enterprises so that they can have a happy Spring Festival.    At the national propaganda and ideological work meeting held  in the second half of January, the CPC hierarchy promulgated  various policies to control media opinion, intensify the  management of the cultural market, and called for press circle  to "closely center around the themes and avoid making noises,  engaging in controversies, or committing mistakes to do a good  job of maintaining social stability." Before the above  meeting began, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of  the CPC Central Committee specially summoned the leading cadres  from RENMIN RIBAO for a talk, and broke the rules by laying on a  banquet for them. CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin greeted them  by cupping one hand in the other and saying: "Would you be kind  enough to do propaganda work well this year? When public  opinion work is properly performed, we can set our minds at ease  in resolving reform and development issues. This is what the  central authorities are most concerned about and have heeded  seriously." This remark is regarded as "words uttered at a  moment of desperation."    According to the latest analysis by a mainland economist,  the  CPC hierarchy is now caught in a dilemma: The economy must be  stabilized at the expense of the growth rate, which will evoke  universal dissatisfaction from local government officials and  which will affect the CPC's authority. However, the  encouragement of growth and the relaxation of macroeconomic  regulation and control will trigger off higher inflation,  thereby infringing upon the people's immediate interests and  engendering social unrest. To tackle this dilemma, the CPC  hierarchy lacks advantageous political capital to handle various  contradictions, so it can only intensify the functions of the  traditional political structure. As a result, the contradiction  where political structural reform lags behind economic  structural reform will become ever more conspicuous. In this  regard, people should not be blindly optimistic about the  situation on the mainland this year.</p>

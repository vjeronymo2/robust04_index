Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> L.A.-BAY AREA AIR FARE GOES TO $148  </P> <P> The unrestricted fare between the San Francisco Bay area and Los Angeles has  been raised by 15%, making it the most expensive shuttle in the country.  </P> <P> Beginning on Thursday, American, United and USAir raised the fare on the  315-mile trip to $148 from $129 each way.  </P> <P> The fare hike applies to flights from San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose in  the Bay Area and to airports in Los Angeles, Burbank, Long Beach, Ontario and  Orange County.  </P> <P> United said the fare hike was necessary to keep pace with fare increases  elsewhere, and the airline called the increase "modest."  </P> <P> The fare hike means the per-mile cost to fly between the Bay Area and Los  Angeles is 47 cents. In contrast, the unrestricted fare between Washington,  D.C., and New York is $99 each way, or 46 cents per mile. The Dallas to Houston  shuttle is $59 one way, or 25 cents per mile.  </P> <P> American, United and USAir control more than 90% of the business on flights  between the Bay Area and the Los Angeles Basin, according to the U.S.  Department of Transportation.  </P></p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / People (Names in the News): Champalimaud empire restored Antonio Champalimaud, the 76-year-old Portuguese entrepreneur who last week bought back another part of the business empire wrested from him after the revolution of 1974, is admired and abominated with equal fervour, writes Peter Wise. He has been both lauded as 'Portugal's greatest industrialist' and loathed as an incarnation of capitalist exploitation. During the Salazar-Caetano dictatorship, he was estimated to control two-thirds of Portugal's industrial capacity. Starting with an inherited cement company, he moved into steel, banking and insurance. Making a fortune was easy the first time round in an economy protected from outside competition and benefiting from captive colonial markets. But Champalimaud, whose blunt, autocratic style leaves few people indifferent, believes he has proved his worth as an entrepreneur by rebuilding the group that was seized from him by a short-lived Communist-leaning government. Last week he paid Es37.3bn (Pounds 5.74bn) to regain control of Banco Pinto e Sotto Mayor, Portugal's sixth largest bank. He had already bought back the insurance company Mundial Confianca in 1992. Champalimaud once put in a claim for more than Es1000bn in compensation for the nationalisation of his assets but has received only a small fraction of that amount. Instead, he is buying back his Portuguese companies, through a reprivatisation programme begun in 1989, with earnings from Brazil, where he fled in 1975 and built an extensive business centred on cement and livestock. After years in the wilderness, Champalimaud is indisputably back at the top. Portugal's Fortuna magazine ranks him as by far the country's richest individual, with a personal net worth estimated at Es170bn. But he admits Portugal is too small for him and is not expected to make any more important re-acquisitions. He remains in Brazil, leaving the day-to-day management of the family's Portuguese interests to his son Luis, chairman of Mundial Confianca.</p>

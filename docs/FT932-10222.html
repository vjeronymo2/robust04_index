			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Economics Notebook: Upbeat Gaidar sees minds won over by reform MR Yegor Gaidar, the former Russian prime minister, concluded three lectures at the London School of Economics last week with an upbeat message which left his audience of economists, academics and businessmen with the impression that Russia has found a new Stolypin. 'If we can maintain political stability, Russia will continue to be a very poor country into the 21st century. But it will also be one of the most dynamically developing markets in the world, in which western businessmen will fail to participate at their peril,' the 36-year-old economist and former journalist predicted in his fluent but heavily accented English. With the slogan 'order, then reform' Pyotr Stolypin, Russia's last great reforming prime minister, picked up the pieces after the failed 1905 revolution. He set out to create a prosperous peasantry and a stable middle class and so underpin Russia's transformation into a modern, constitutional monarchy. Tragically, he died from an assassin's bullet in 1911. Russia's current reformers faced a similar task as they sought to fill the vacuum created by the failure of the August 1991 attempt to restore the old Soviet power structure. They moved to cut bloated military spending by 70 per cent, started to tackle an inflationary monetary overhang and opted for rapid mass privatisation as the main instrument of socio-economic transformation. Stolypin, whose readiness to jail or execute violent opponents led to the gallows being nicknamed the 'Stolypin necktie', took a tough line with those in the way of his reforms. By contrast, Mr Gaidar explained how Russia's post-coup reform team went out of their way to bring opponents round and argued that privatisation in particular must be drafted to benefit all its potential opponents. What that meant in practice, he told his LSE audience, was a mass privatisation programme that allocated shares to enterprise managers and the work collectives directly involved, as well as to power centres such as local governments, security forces and teachers with the passive power to block any reform. 'We have created a new social basis behind our economic policy and this in my view is the reason for our success in the referendum. Life has changed in the ordinary Russian city. People are suffering from higher prices and corruption and face the prospect of rising unemployment. But there are enormous opportunities, especially for the young and energetic, to earn good money. People no longer have to travel 1,000km to Moscow to buy a terrible salami sausage, or wait hours in line for bread, milk or meat. They can even buy luxuries which they never imagined would appear in their shops - like bananas,' he said. This is the optimistic, post-referendum perspective. The picture looked less rosy last December when Mr Gaidar, identified as the arch-reformer by conservatives, was sacrificed by President Boris Yeltsin to quieten the baying of the anti-reform lobby. Mr Gaidar's explanation for what went wrong harked back to the previous spring and summer when Russia had been hit by a flood of easy credits issued by Ukraine. This recreated all the old financial imbalances and created a near universal opposition to reform and a universal demand for the printing of more money. The reformers got close to restoring confidence in the rouble in early 1992, by eliminating the inherited budget deficit of nearly 20 per cent of GDP. But the lack of customs posts and tax collectors and inability to control the spending of republics like Ukraine inside the rouble zone sparked off a flood of money from the Russian central bank to bail out Russian enterprises, he explained. In December, Mr Gaidar was replaced as prime minister by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, a typical Soviet era enterprise manager, and the flow of easy credits to enterprises resumed. At this point, Mr Gaidar explained, all that remained of the reform programme was the momentum behind the privatisation programme and the determination of the reformers still in the government to try to regain control over the money supply. Four months later, however, the referendum vote showed strong support for continuing the reforms. Mr Gaidar believes the result shows that the close relationship between easy credit and higher prices is now better understood. He also believes that the start of the biggest mass privatisation programme ever seen has swung many enterprise managers and sceptical workers into the reform camp. 'The change of attitude has been dramatic,' he said. 'Last spring factory managers combined against the government, clamouring for easy credit. By autumn there was a clear divide between those nostalgic for the old days of easy credit and state orders and the younger, more energetic managers who saw their future as the heads of big private companies, competing with western companies and enjoying a high standard of living.' As for workers, he added, 'they used to complain about high prices and low wages. By September they were asking what should we do with our vouchers and is the management plan for the future of our factory sensible, or are they fooling us?' The reformers initial success in cutting the budget deficit and pursuading the central bank to raise interest rates showed it was possible to change from soft-budget constraints and supply shortages to a demand determined economy facing hard budget constraints. Mr Gaidar's insider account, drawn from memory and delivered without notes, underlined the parallels between the window of opportunity opened up by the failed coup of August 1991 and the new opportunity to take reform further which has opened up in the wake of last month's referendum. Enriched by the mass of compressed experience since the collapse of the Soviet Union and made wiser by the mistakes committed, the reformers are again seeking to wrest the initiative. Among their targets - to regain control of the money supply, raise energy prices to world levels, and bring Yegor Gaidar back into the team.</p>

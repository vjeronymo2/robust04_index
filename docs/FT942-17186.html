			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / UK Company News: Readicut sells Firth group to Swiss for Pounds 9.8m Readicut International has sold Firth Furnishings, a maker of car carpets, and its subsidiary, Firth Europe, to Rieter-Scragg, part of Rieter Holding, a Swiss-based group, for Pounds 9.8m cash. Total net borrowings of the companies at the end of March were about Pounds 6.5m. The freehold property occupied by Firth and its textile bonding business have been retained by Readicut, but Firth will continue to use the property under lease from Readicut. The sale proceeds will be used to reduce borrowings.</p>

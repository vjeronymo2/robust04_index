			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EMPIRE OF THE OLD  </P> <P> I hope I never reach the age when I look forward to reading AARP's mindless  magazine, Modern Maturity. AARP claims to be interested in the economics of us  old folks, but when I sent for an insurance quote from a company they endorsed,  I found it to be $1,000 a year more than I now pay.  </P> <P> If AARP is my salvation for old age, I'll just continue on my own, thanks.  </P> <P> WILLIAM H.

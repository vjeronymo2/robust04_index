			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BERNSON IS COUNCIL'S TOP TRAVEL SPENDER;  </P> <P> CITY HALL: HE SPENT $120,622 IN CAMPAIGN FUNDS ON TRAVEL DURING THE LAST THREE  YEARS -- FAR MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNCIL MEMBER.  </P> <P> In 1987, Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson, his wife and three daughters  jetted overseas for a 17-day visit. In Israel, he toured a day-care center and  a Red Sea kibbutz and met with the mayor of Tel Aviv. In Italy, he discussed  earthquake preparedness with a former government official. In both countries,  he stayed in luxury hotels.  </P> <P> The tab for the trip -- more than $24,000 -- was paid through the councilman's  private treasury of political contributions.  </P> <P> Records show that Bernson has spent $120,622 in campaign funds on travel during  the last three years -- far more than anyone else on the 15-member City  Council.  </P> <P> Bernson's privately financed travel expenses were nearly three times as high as  those of Mayor Tom Bradley, who spent $44,939, and exceeded those of Gov.  George Deukmejian, who spent $72,260 during the same period.  </P> <P> Council members spent an annual average of $8,635 in privately raised funds and  $2,427 in city funds on travel during the last three years, a Times survey  found.  </P> <P> Like Bernson, a number of council members used private funds -- from their  reelection accounts, political action committees, officeholder accounts and  "friends committees" -- to travel extensively in the United States and abroad  for a variety of conferences, tours and meetings.  </P> <P> Use of private political funds for travel is legal, providing it is related to  government or political purposes. Pleasure trips are prohibited. But state  officials acknowledge that the law is vague and difficult to enforce.  </P> <P> "Many statutes are enforced by public opinion, and I think this is one where  that's an important ingredient," Asst. Atty. Gen. N. Eugene Hill said.  </P> <P> Between Jan. 1, 1987, and Dec. 31, 1989, Bernson and his wife traveled not only  to Italy and Israel, but also to Paris, Hong Kong, London, Beijing and British  Columbia, plus New Orleans, New York, Seattle, Boston, Carmel and Hilo, Hawaii.  </P> <P> Bernson said in a recent interview that his privately funded travel was not  excessive and all his trips were proper. Much of his travel, he said, was to  attend conferences related to his membership on the state Seismic Safety  Commission and in the National League of Cities.  </P> <P> The San Fernando Valley councilman also said information acquired while  traveling helps him "to do my job and to accomplish the things I've  accomplished for the city."  </P> <P> Bernson's nearest rival, Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, used $93,883 in  campaign funds for travel, according to reports required by the state.  </P> <P> During the last half of 1989, Flores -- now a candidate for secretary of state  -- spent $7,500 on air and rail fare and an additional $13,000 on  accommodations for her aides and herself, records show. She visited Montreal,  London, Paris, Brussels, Moscow and Bordeaux, France, where she attended a  world oceanology conference. She also toured Eastern Europe -- including stops  in Prague, Warsaw and Berlin -- last December and January.  </P> <P> Flores spent nearly $9,000 for a midsummer staff retreat at the Biltmore Hotel  in Phoenix, Ariz. The councilwoman normally holds the retreat in the Los  Angeles area, but aides said it was moved to Arizona because airlines and the  hotel offered reduced off-season rates.  </P> <P> Flores said the travel is relevant to her duties as chairwoman of the council's  Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which oversees operation of  the Port of Los Angeles and the city's airports.  </P> <P> In Paris, for example, she met with French railroad officials. In Montreal, she  toured the control room for that city's subway system.  </P> <P> From 1987 to 1989, Councilman Robert Farrell spent $76,214 in campaign funds on  travel, visiting Atlanta, New York City, Washington and South Africa. Last  July, Farrell went to Egypt for a week to help formalize a sister-city  relationship between Los Angeles and Giza and to attend a political conference  of black women.  </P> <P> Farrell said the trips "all helped me to better represent my constituency."  </P> <P> In privately financed travel, Farrell was followed by council members Richard  Alatorre with $32,754; Joel Wachs, $28,489; Gloria Molina, $9,255; Michael Woo,  $8,139, and Zev Yaroslavsky, $8,639. Ernani Bernardi, Ruth Galanter and John  Ferraro spent no campaign funds for travel. However, Ferraro, the council  president, spent $32,083 in public funds on travel -- roughly twice what the  mayor spent.  </P> <P> Most of Alatorre's trips were to U.S. cities and were related to National  League of Cities conferences and posts the councilman has held with the  Democratic National Committee, his staff said.  </P> <P> Alatorre traveled to Mexico in 1988 to meet with students and government  officials in a university exchange program, said his chief deputy, Al Avila.  </P> <P> Wachs, an art collector and arts advocate, attributed most of his $28,489 in  campaign-paid travel -- including a dozen trips to New York City -- to his  interest in public art.  </P> <P> Last year Wachs made a one-week trip to Venice for a "livable cities"  conference. In 1987, he toured museums in the Netherlands, France, Italy,  Germany and Switzerland. Wachs said the purpose of the $6,000 tour was to seek  exhibits for the privately run Museum of Contemporary Art.  </P> <P> "The arts are really critical to the city," he said.  </P> <P> In recent years, Bernson's campaign-financed travel has far outstripped that of  the other council members.  </P> <P> A conservative Republican who has represented the northwestern San Fernando  Valley since 1979, Bernson collects a council salary of $61,522 a year and owns  a modest Granada Hills home.  </P> <P> But, using campaign funds, he has been able to fly first-class, stay in plush  hotels and pick up large meal tabs for himself and others. From 1987 to 1989,  records show, he spent at least $25,210 in political funds for hotel rooms and  meals on the road. The expenses ranged from $3,203 for his family's stay at the  landmark King David Hotel in Jerusalem to $410 Bernson spent on meals and  drinks for 10 political supporters at the Del Mar race track two years ago.  </P> <P> Bernson said much of his privately raised money has been spent on fact-finding  missions involving land-use regulation and transportation matters.  </P> <P> "Personally . . . I'd rather not travel at all," he said. "I mean, it gets to  be a real pain, even at its best."  </P> <P> Bernson's private contributions have soared since 1987 when he became chairman  of the council's powerful Planning and Land Use Management Committee, which  recommends development projects to the full council. Although contributions to  Bernson averaged $135,500 a year from 1981 to 1985, they jumped to $457,000 in  1988 and $258,000 in 1989, campaign reports show. More than half of the  donations came from development- and real estate-related interests.  </P> <P> Under a 1981 state law, such funds can be used for travel if the trips have a  "reasonable relationship" to government, legislative or political business.  Guidelines issued by the state attorney general in 1986 said the funds can be  used for travel only if at least half the time abroad is spent on official or  political matters.  </P> <P> Some of Bernson's campaign-financed travels -- such as a 1988 trip to attend  the Republican National Convention in New Orleans -- are well within the law.  </P> <P> But Bernson's 1987 Hawaii trip appeared to violate state guidelines, state  Asst. Atty. Gen. Hill said.  </P> <P> Bernson said he and his wife were in Hawaii for two days and three nights. His  campaign funds paid at least $2,232 for the trip, including a $1,196 hotel  bill.  </P> <P> The councilman -- who has taken a lead role in seismic safety issues in Los  Angeles -- said he went to gather information on Hawaiian  emergency-preparedness operations and to see how local officials coped with the  then-erupting Kilauea volcano.  </P> <P> On his first day in Hawaii, Bernson said, he met for about an hour with Harry  Kim, head of Hawaii County civil defense operations, to discuss disaster relief  efforts.  </P> <P> Kim disputed that account, saying the meeting lasted about 20 minutes. "There  was little in-depth discussion as far as our operations or his operations, or  our problems or his problems," said Kim, adding that Bernson appeared for the  meeting in Bermuda shorts.  </P> <P> The next day, Bernson said, he took a helicopter flight over the volcano that  lasted "the morning." He acknowledged that there were no disaster officials  with him on the flight, only tourists.  </P> <P> Bernson said he overflew the volcano in his capacity as a state seismic safety  commissioner. He said he was gathering information on volcano-induced earth  movement in connection with the Mammoth Lakes area, in which geologists say  there may one day be volcanic activity.  </P> <P> However, the state Seismic Safety Commission has no jurisdiction over  volcano-related issues, said L. Thomas Tobin, the panel's executive director.  </P> <P> Asst. Atty. Gen. Hill, after a Times reporter related details of the Hawaii  trip, said it appeared that the journey "probably would not meet" state  guidelines on campaign-paid travel.  </P> <P> However, Hill said it is unlikely that the councilman could be charged with  violating the state travel law, which Hill described as very broadly written  and difficult to enforce. "It's very difficult for us to say a trip doesn't  have a political or legislative purpose when an elected official says it does,"  he said.  </P> <P> Moreover, Hill said, the law carried only a one-year statute of limitations and  was replaced last Jan. 1 by a new law, which transfers its enforcement from the  attorney general to the state Fair Political Practices Commission.  </P> <P> Since the law's 1981 enactment, no elected official has been charged for not  devoting enough time to business while on a trip financed by private political  funds, Hill said. Violations are punishable by civil fines of up to two times  the amount of campaign money improperly spent.  </P> <P> Bernson, his wife and at least six friends took a one-day bus tour from London  to the village of Brockenhurst, about 60 miles away, during a four-day trip to  England in 1988.  </P> <P> Although he acknowledged that he spoke to no government officials, Bernson said  he visited historical monuments and small villages because England's land-use  patterns have possible applications in Porter Ranch, a massive residential  development that has been proposed for his council district.  </P> <P> The Times described the trip and Bernson's reasons for taking it to Mark  Haarer, assistant director of Common Cause, a public-interest lobbying group  that has criticized Bernson campaign fund-raising in the past.  </P> <P> Haarer said it appeared that Bernson had gone abroad to perform some  government-related business that could have been carried out in the United  States. "If I were a Hal Bernson campaign contributor," he said, "I'd wonder  why campaign funds were used to go to Europe to study small towns where there  is an abundance of small-town examples in our own back yard."  </P> <P> Bernson's biggest recent year for travel was 1988, during which he spent  $79,312 in campaign money. In 1987, he spent $36,053. Last year the figure  dropped to $5,257, after local newspapers printed stories regarding some trips.  </P> <P> Bernson said one reason his campaign-paid travel tab is so high is that he  rarely bills the city for his journeys.  </P> <P> "I don't travel any more than any other member of the council; in fact, I  probably travel less," he said. "The difference is they charge theirs to the  city. I could do that but I don't feel comfortable doing that."  </P> <P> City records show Bernson was the council's fourth-heaviest spender of public  funds for travel during 1987-89, billing the city $11,487.  </P> <P> Bernson sometimes uses campaign dollars to enhance amenities on trips where he  bills the city for basic expenses, thereby avoiding the city's more restrictive  travel reimbursement rules. He has used campaign funds to bring along his wife,  upgrade airline tickets and pay large meal bills.  </P> <P> On a 1988 trip to Beijing to attend an international earthquake conference, for  example, Bernson billed the city $1,277 for air fare but flew on a first-class  ticket that actually cost $3,307, city documents show. The difference was paid  with campaign money, he said.  </P> <P> Bernson said he must travel first class on lengthy trips because his wife has a  bad back and comfort is important on a long flight. He often stays in plush  hotels because "I don't have to stay in fleabags," he said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Dean Murphy contributed to this story.  </P> <P> POLITICIANS' TRAVEL  </P> <P> Travel

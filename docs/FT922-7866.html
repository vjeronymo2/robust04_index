			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Letter: A banking bid based on a faulty premise Sir, It is not clear how Prof Littler and Dr Ciancanelli of UMIST (Letters, May 12) can legitimately discriminate with regard to the Midland takeover in favour of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's 'international' bid. This is yet another example of the discredited 1980s cross-border bank acquisition mania. From the standpoint of Hongkong Bank shareholders, such an acquisition is frankly a nonsense as the bank can perform its own diversification without paying the penalty of a control premium. Even without such costs, the 'international' bid lacks sense. The experience of banks in international acquisitions has been devastatingly bad. Concepts such as global networks and international connections are now thoroughly discredited. To our knowledge, no research has demonstrated enhanced economies of scale at the international level. In fact, quite the reverse: real savings are best achieved in the 'in-market' situation. It is now obvious that customers can easily 'unbundle' these so-called global services to the detriment of international banking conglomerates. Because of poor profitability, not least in their international networks, banks everywhere are retreating to core or least-cost producer positions and ruthlessly discarding poorly performing services. This is the change that is now overdue in the UK banking sector and only now being undertaken, spurred on by monumental loan losses in the current recession. The emphasis is on cost-effective services as epitomised by the Lloyd's alternative. For Hongkong Bank to take over Midland will do nothing for Midland's dismal profit record. The rationalisation and job losses the international option would seemingly avoid will happen none the less. Lloyd's bid has the virtue that it can identify significant cost savings benefits from eliminating Midland's overheads. If Hongkong Bank wins due to the monopoly reason, it may yet dispose of the retail operation after taking the cream investment banking business and once it establishes its beachhead in Europe. Because its bid is based on a faulty premise, it is merely postponing the inevitable restructuring of Midland Bank. Fighting against valid market forces makes for strange bedfellows and for long-term hangovers] Joe McCue, executive in residence, Peter Moles, lecturer in finance, University of Edinburgh, department of business studies, 50 George Square, Edinburgh EH8 9JY</p>

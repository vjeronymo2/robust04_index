The  union threatened to go on strike several times last year, but  every time a compromise was reached after the negotiations with  the government. The main demand presented by the organizers of  the strike is to increase produce purchase prices, to solve the  problems of settlements with processing enterprises and their  monopoly.    Professor Jonas Ciulevicius, chairman of the union, said  that  a quarter of 4,000 agricultural companies should go bankrupt  this year because of the high purchase prices.    "The preparation for the strike have brought some positive  results. Some milk processing enterprises pay the prices we  required, however, this is not the achievment of the government.  We will try to influence the government through the milk  processing industry in order the demands of farmers to be  fulfilled", Ciulevicius said.    The questions of supplying hospitals and kindergartens with  milk and its products during the days of the strike were  discussed at the meeting of the union.</p>

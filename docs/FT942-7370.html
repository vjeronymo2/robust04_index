			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / European Elections - June 9 and 12: Europe's Greens expect a patchy performance - The environmentalists' election prospects In their own eyes, the Greens are the only political movement to have penetrated every European country. But the elections for the European parliament are likely to show that while they have established some strongholds, in other countries they are facing near-extinction. The UK's Green Party, in particular, knows that it will face a tough fight. In the 1989 elections it scored 15 per cent of the poll, the highest Green vote in Europe, and pushed the Liberal-Social Democrat Alliance into third place. But that success was due partly to special factors. The unpopularity of the government at that point, the collapse of the Alliance, and the low electoral turn-out helped. Green issues were also high in people's minds after the 1986 Chernobyl explosion, the death of North Sea seals, and rising concern about global warming following several hot summers. Recession and a perception that some environmentalists have been too prone to doom-mongering have since made the Greens' task harder. It is fielding 85 candidates for the forthcoming elections, contesting every seat. But the Green Party won only 1.3 per cent in the 1992 general election, although that had picked up to some 5 per cent in the local elections last month. According to Mr Shane Collins, candidate for the very un-green London South Inner constituency, urban areas have an additional problem. 'Most of our natural voters are disenfranchised', he says - they have dropped off the electoral register because they are homeless, or objected to the now-abandoned poll tax. But both he and Mr David Taylor, candidate for Somerset and North Devon, where Greens came second last time, stress that one issue has been reviving Green concerns: the government's roadbuilding programme. Protests against the widening of the M25 road orbiting London, the extension of the M3 motorway through Twyford Down, and most recently, the Batheaston bypass at Solsbury Hill near Bath have attracted supporters of all ages and social backgrounds. Despite this new stimulus, British Greens are labouring under a handicap not suffered by their continental European colleagues: the UK's first-past-the-post electoral system. Ms Penny Kemp, of the Green Party's national executive, believes this is one reason why environmental enthusiasm on the continent is a vigorous political force. Although Greens won a smaller share of the vote on the continent in 1989 than they did in the UK, proportional representation allowed Greens from seven of the 12 countries to secure 28 seats in the European Parliament. The German Greens' support arose originally out of national fury over the corrosion of German forests by acid rain. They were largely dismissed as a fringe group of radicals after failing to retain seats in the Bundestag four years ago. But their success in the early rounds of the German electoral marathon shows that they pose a threat of replacing the Free Democrats as the third force in German politics. On March 20, in the Schleswig-Holstein local elections, their share of the vote rose from 6 per cent to 10.3 per cent. The previous week in Lower Saxony state elections, and in Hamburg city state elections last autumn, they seized some 13 per cent of the vote. The Italian Green movement, which gained prominence during the reign of Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana as European environment commissioner, is also in buoyant mood. It has seen a Green candidate elected as mayor of Rome, and has high hopes for the European Parliament elections, for which Mr Ripa di Meana has pledged his support. Ms Kemp and others in the UK Green Party hope that these signs mean that European Greens will win more than 40 seats in the parliament this year. However they acknowledge that despite their best efforts, the UK contribution may continue to be low.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Green feeling across Europe  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- % of population saying that the European parliament should give priority to environmental protection*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Country      Environmental priority    Environmental expenditure                     rating, %            as % of GDP  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Denmark               91                    1.0 Netherlands           95                    N/A Ireland               87                    N/A UK                    86                    0.4 Portugal              83                    N/A Spain                 83                    0.6 France                84                    0.5 Greece                97                    N/A Italy                 80                    N/A Germany               80                    0.8 Luxembourg            73                    N/A Belgium               84                    N/A  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Eurobarometer, EU Commission  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Improving the transport system will be a first and  crucial step in the promotion of trade and investment to support  growth and diversification in the sub-region, Deputy Prime  Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said yesterday.    Mr Suphachai was speaking at the third  Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand growth triangle (IMT-GT) tripartite  meeting in Indonesia.    The Royal Thai government has made an allocation of US$36  million in the budget for 1995 for the creation of physical  infrastructure and related facilities he pointed out.    The Thai government fully supports the IMT-GT project and  would like to concretise co-operation projects, particularly in  the fields of trade and investment, infrastructure linkages, and  agreements in fishery development, he said.    "We should select, to start off with projects that are most  feasible, least costly and therefore eligible for concessional  financing," he observed.    "We must collectively agree on fair terms in the utilisation  of the infrastructural network," he stated.    Private sector companies must be encouraged to work more  closely together, as the projects will have to be executed by  them. Governments will offer the right framework and the  necessary facilities.    Dr Suphachai observed that the Thai side has made  significant  progress in several infrastructural projects.    These include upgrading the road linking Satun province to  Songkhla province, paving the way for the creation of a lower  southern seaboard area, and upgrading the seaport in Pattani and  Satun provinces to support sea transportation links between  Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.    The engineering design for a bridge on the Narathiwat border  to facilitate more cross-border trade with Malaysia has been  completed.    The industrial zone projects, particularly at Chaulung in  Songkhla province, are being speeded up and should be completed  in the third quarter of this year, said Dr Suphachai.    He went on: "These projects, when completed, will help  reduce  the weakness of the infrastructural links between southern  Thailand and northern Malaysia.    "Improvement in the air and shipping services in the  sub-region should be treated as a priority.    "Our IMT-GT sub-regional economic co-operation is now  becoming widely known as an effective instrument of AFTA  intra-regional cooperation within the context of free trade  areas that can also help in the redistribution of income to the  regional areas."</p>

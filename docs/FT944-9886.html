			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Australian claims irk Thailand Australia's prospects for winning defence orders from Thailand may suffer after a dispute in Jakarta over allegations by Mr Gareth Evans, foreign minister, that Thai businessmen and soldiers were harbouring Khmer Rouge guerrillas. Australia tried yesterday to calm the row, which blew up after autopsies revealed that an Australian, Mr David Wilson, and two other tourists were bludgeoned to death by Khmer Rouge guerrillas in Cambodia in September. After a meeting with Thailand's new foreign minister, Mr Thaksin Shinawatra, Mr Evans said his evidence of Thai support for the guerrillas was out of date, and he now accepted that controls on immigration and arms, gems and logs, had been tightened up. The bilateral relationship was now 'in very good shape', he said. However, Thai officials said concern remained about Australia's use of old evidence to make the allegations. Mr Chuan Leekpai, prime minister, might tell the Defence Ministry not to place defence orders with Australia, they said.</p>

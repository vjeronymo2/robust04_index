			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Mikheyev report: "Process of Russia's Joining </F> NATO Postponed. Until Fall, as President's Press Secretary  Said, Or Forever?]    [Text] The pent-up storm potential of criticism of the  "marriage contract" the Americans have drawn up with former  members of the Warsaw Pact, known as the "Partnership for Peace"  program, has been eased by a statement by the president's press  secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov, who declared that Yeltsin will  not rush to join Russia to the Atlantic alliance.    Before making a final decision the president will hold  consultations with all political forces. The process of joining  NATO has been put on hold for six or seven months.    Establishing partnership relations with NATO of an  indeterminate quality and unclear status constitutes a  "political step" for Russia, Kostikov said, and therefore  "public consent" has to be reached first.    The document prepared within the bowels of NATO fails to  mention key problems, Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma  Committee for International Affairs, has said. Who will defend  whom? In what circumstances? On what terms?    It is not clear how equal the command of this complex  international organism will be. What if Moscow objects to any  joint actions planned in Brussels, but which have to be carried  out by all members? Will Moscow have a voice that will be  heeded?    The scope of the enlarged NATO's powers also remains  unclear.  Will it be confined to "peacekeeping" operations or might there  be a question of operations "to establish peace," that is,  coercive measures using armed force?    How does the NATO sphere of interests tie in with the  process  of European cooperation within the CSCE framework? The CSCE has  an internationally recognized mandate to ensure security and  stability but at the same time it has no mechanism for  peacekeeping activity. NATO on the other hand has no such  mandate, but it does have force of arms.    What is to be done with the slowly developing CIS collective  security structure? Russia is not pressing for the dissolution  of NATO, but it cannot predict how this alliance will behave  toward the CIS.    The sixth question concerns a demand common to all the  bloc's  members -- to arrive at uniformity in the armaments system. How  far will standardization undermine the positions of Russian  manufacturers of military hardware?    Lastly, the financial situation -- amid industrial decline  and inflation will Russia be able to bear the burden that will  be asked of it?    There is every indication that the postponement decision was  viewed with understanding in the upper echelons of NATO.</p>

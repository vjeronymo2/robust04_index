			<p>BFN     [Text] VILNIUS, Jun 08, BNS - The two-day round of  Lithuanian- Russian talks that started in Vilnius Tuesday is  unlikely to produce as many results as were expected by the  Lithuanian side.    Before the meeting, Russia did not comment on any possible  results whereas the Lithuanian side said it expects to make  progress in a number of issues, including Russian transit  through Lithuania and implementation of bilateral economic  treaties that have been signed earlier.    But according to unofficial reports from the Lithuanian  Foreign Ministry, the number of issues on the meeting's agenda  was considerably reduced and primary attention is paid only to  several most important problems.    On Tuesday, Lithuanian and Russian negotiators initialed an  agreement on contract employees. The accord mainly deals with  social guarantees to people temporarily employed in one of the  two countries.    The Russian delegation refused to discuss a draft agreement  on additional border crossings between Lithuania and the  Kaliningrad region, saying it has no such authorizations.    The Lithuanian side once again suggested to clear up the  region's status in the process of Lithuanian-Russian talks.  Russian negotiators said the problem can be resolved by a  special Russian law.</p>

			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / International Bond Markets: Return of the nightmare on Eurobond Street IT WAS like a bad sequel. The horror was over, tranquility had returned. The placid folk of the Eurobond market were going about their innocent business, making money. And then, just when they thought it was safe to go back into the water . . . To the casual bather, the international bond markets certainly looked inviting at the start of this year. The bad, cut-throat days of the late 1980s were over. 1991 had brought rallies in most major bond markets. The fixed price reoffer method of selling bonds, introduced to the international market by Morgan Stanley, had helped to raise the profits of intermediaries. This was going to be the year when banks sat back and raked in their fees. A strong US Treasury market, convergence among European currencies and big planned borrowings from sovereign and other top names all pointed to a banner year. The shark had other ideas. Before the first quarter was out, some savage bidding and a deluge of bond offerings had churned up the placid waters of the market. Unwary swimmers lost a limb here or there, most notably when Finland sold Ecu500m of seven-year bonds through Yamaichi in February. As in all bad sequels, the innocent Eurobond folk looked stunned and retreated to lick their wounds. They did not realise that worse was to come. No sooner had they plucked up the courage to dip a toe back in the lagoon than the shark struck again, this time swimming in from a different direction: Denmark. European bond convergence was not going to be achieved as smoothly as most had expected. Exit several more limbs. At this point, the inhabitants of the bond markets demonstrated the sort of stoic heroism one expects at such times. They were not going to let it get them down. The Ecu still had a future, after all - in fact, it was now trading at well below its theoretical value (bonds denominated in this basket currency were yielding more than the sum of their constituent parts). Surely, some suggested, it was a good time to buy? This presumably had nothing to do with the fact that most market-makers were sitting on a mountain of the stuff. By July, however, the Ecu market-makers had let the cat out of the bag: they stopped making markets to each other, tacitly admitting to the world that this particular EC surplus was likely to take some time to shift. The shark was circling, waiting to strike again. When it came in September, the denouement was frenzied and bloody. Even before French voters got to cast their verdict on the Maastricht treaty, the dream of bond market convergence in Europe had been dragged under in the churning waters of the ERM. No sequel is complete without an unexpected twist. This one was provided by the Italian authorities, who decided that now was the moment to withdraw their withholding tax exemption for supranational borrowers - a concession which had effectively held down the yield spreads paid by all borrowers in the international bond markets. Already damaged by credit concerns, bond spreads duly widened. As if that was not enough, the Italians returned for a second go, introducing the 12.5 per cent tax to repurchase agreements as well. This spelt the death of the international repo market in Italy, through which banks had recycled the tax concession to provide lower borrowing costs to their Italian customers. Some Dollars 20bn of international bonds would be released on to the secondary market as a result, it was estimated. Was anyone brave enough to enter this maelstrom? Apparently so. The Kingdom of Spain decided now was the time to come up with its first Eurodollar bond issue, a Dollars 1.5bn seven-year effort. It was forced to increase the yield on its bonds by 10 basis points, to a spread over US Treasuries of 55 basis points - and even then the yield rose by another 10 basis points in the secondary market. To add insult to injury, Moody's Investors Service, the US rating agency, decided days later to put Spain's AA2 rating under review (though it later confirmed the rating at its existing level). The waters calmed again. The shark was gone. The US election came and went and the Eurodollar market decided the world was not going to come to an end. Peace and normality returned. Big borrowers paid their underwriters fat commissions to produce successful transactions for them: the UK's DM5.5bn deal, for instance, and Sweden's Dollars 2.5bn issue. Finland made good past errors with a Dollars 2bn blow-out of a deal in November. Even Spain's Eurodollar issue was trading close to its issue price. The Eurobond folk went about their innocent business. It was time to survey the damage. The camera panned back to take in the battered wreckage of this small-town community, revealing some marked difference in the features of the landscape. Things would never be the same again: The Ecu was nowhere to be seen, presumed lost at sea. In the first half of the year, the basket European currency had accounted for around 15 per cent of all international bond issues by value. In the second half, it made up less than 2 per cent. The D-Mark had swum to the rescue. From 10 per cent of the market in the first nine months, the D-Mark's share jumped to 24 per cent in the final quarter. Liberalisation of issuing rules in the German bond market in the summer had come just in time (this removed the requirement to list all D-Mark bonds on a German stock exchange, use a German bank as an issuing house and make the bonds subject to German law). Also, Morgan Stanley brought the fixed price reoffer system to Germany in the autumn. It was too early to tell, though, whether the D-Mark had really broken out of its retail origins to become a cornerstone of the international bond market. The US dollar had proved its value as a long-term vehicle for the Euromarkets. The days when it accounted for virtually all activity in the international markets may be long gone, with the currency accounting for less than 30 per cent of activity in the first half of the year. But with European currencies paralysed in the third quarter, the dollar made up 54 per cent of new bond issues (slipping back again to around a third in the final three months). Many of the swimmers were looking rather dishevelled. Most banks had invested heavily in the future of the Ecu (some, even now, could be heard singing its praises). A scattering of badly-priced deals had punctuated the year, the memory of which was not totally expunged by the placid ending. Some appeared healthier than others. J. P. Morgan, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs were reckoned to have had a more profitable time than most. Two other US banks had also impressed: Lehman Brothers, which clawed its way up the league table to 13th place, and Salomon, which had managed to hold onto its market share despite being effectively shut out of the market in the early months as punishment for last year's Treasuries scandal. Deutsche Bank, meanwhile, had clawed its way to the top of the pile (claiming all the way that it had not been buying market share), supported by the two other big-volume houses, Nomura and Credit Suisse First Boston. There were also some new additions to the landscape. One was the structured floating rate note, designed to attract fixed-rate investors who thought dollar interest rates were about to rise. Kidder Peabody took the credit for introducing the cap-and-collar floater, which promised a minimum interest rate (usually of 5 per cent) higher than the current market rate. In return, investors gave up some of their yield if rates rose above this floor, and also accepted a ceiling above which their return could not rise. Contrary to most predictions, more than Dollars 7bn of such notes were sold, as UBS joined in by bringing a number of top-rated names to this market. There were dark predictions that such instruments could yet disturb the tranquility. As interest rates rose towards or above the floor, who would want to buy them? Would the banks that helped issue them continue to bid actively, or would the market disappear? These, though, were distant thoughts as the year drew to a close. 1993 was going to be a good year. Bond markets would rally. Underwriters would hold the line on fees and issuers were going to be sensible on pricing. Even the Ecu might stage a come-back. The next sequel really would be much happier - wouldn't it?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP EUROBOND LEAD MANAGERS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   1992 Manager            Dollars bn    Rank     %   Issues  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Deutsche Bank        21.58        1      7.87     69 Nomura Int.

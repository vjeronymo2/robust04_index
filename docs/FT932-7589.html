			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: LIG declines Condom manufacturer and photo processor London International saw its shares fall 7 to 178p on news that Superdrug the high street retailer had slashed the price of condoms by a third. The news led to fears of a price war in the same mould as recent battles over perfume and suncare products. One analyst pointed out that prices cuts were most likely to be suffered by the retailer rather than the manufacturer. Nevertheless, the concerns gave an opportunity for dealers to mark down the price of what has become an unloved stock following a poor performance by its photo processing arm and a recent censure by the stock exchange over the selective dispensing of information. Also dragged into the mire was Boots, which fell 11 to 435p, with Morgan Stanley said to have also downgraded its profit forecast. Lubricants and chemicals company Burmah Castrol fell sharply as financial advisers drew parallels with Brent Chemicals, which issued a profits warning on Thursday. Both companies have significant exposure to Germany - Burmah generates a fifth of its turnover there - and there was additional pressure from a weak D-Mark. Burmah's shares were off 22 at one stage but securities house SGST argued that the company was 'one of the few reliable success stories around', and advised clients to see the price weakness as a buying opportunity. The shares recovered to close 15 lower at 688p. Brent bounced 3 to 102p but other chemicals groups were dragged down by the worries it expressed. Courtaulds fell 10 to 517p and Laporte lost 6 to 607p. Kleinwort Benson was one broker said to be recommending the regional electricity stocks, strong in recent sessions on dividend hunting ahead of the results season. East Midlands, which announced a restructuring yesterday, added 8 1/2 to 457p and Norweb 12 to 503p. British Gas fell 8 1/2 to 285 1/2 p on renewed concern over an on-going Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry, due to report at the end of July, and negative press coverage of the company's earnings prospects. Profit-taking in Next, following the group's agm, sent the shares down 6 1/2 to 164 1/2 p. retail sales were in line with forecasts but hopes had been raised after bullish noises from other retailers - with a consequent rise in the shares. An agency cross in Morrison Supermarkets of 4.8m, left the shares a penny adrift at 161p. Shares in Bass, which have fallen 15 per cent in three days following poor results, tested the 450p level before finding support. They closed 2 ahead at 464p. P&amp;O, with substantial property interests, was one of the main beneficiaries of the re-appraisal of property stocks. Strong demand from Salomons saw the shares jump sharply but they came back on subsequent profit-taking to close 11 better at 603p. Ladbroke Group, also exposed to property, gained 3 to 179p. Recovery buying boosted British Airways and the shares put on 9 to 310p. Volume was 4.3m at the close. Volume in Vickers jumped to 4.7m after an agency cross of 2.2m shares. The stock hardened a penny to 142p. Strong two-way business in British Steel saw the shares firm 1 1/4 to 99 1/2 p. Securiguard, the subject of a bid from Rentokil Group, added 2 to 292p, on speculation that its predator would be forced to make a higher offer to win control. Talk of an alternative offer was also heard. Rentokil eased 3 to 185p.</p>

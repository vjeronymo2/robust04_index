			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> NO BUSH INCOME TAXES PLEDGE  </P> <P> The White House denied today that President Bush had assured Republican  lawmakers that he will not propose income tax rate increases. The denial came a  day after Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said he does not expect  the President to propose an increase in the rates.  </P> <P> "He has not made any assurances on anything. Everything is up for discussion,"  White House press spokeswoman Alixe Glen told reporters accompanying Bush on a  Fourth of July vacation in Kennebunkport, Me.  </P> <P> Dole said he expects Bush will not back tax rate increases, but will support  higher oil import fees and taxes on alcohol and tobacco.  </P> <P> Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) countered Sunday on ABC's "This Week With  David Brinkley" that such an approach would not raise enough money to reduce  huge budget deficits.  </P> <P> Glen refused to characterize any proposals that are under discussion by  Administration and congressional negotiators who are trying to reach an  agreement on reducing the deficit.  </P></p>

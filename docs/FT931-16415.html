			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Australian unions to fight cuts AUSTRALIAN trade unions yesterday forecast an industrial battle in Victoria after the conservative state government announced plans to make 8,500 transport workers redundant over the next three years, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney. Mr Alan Brown, the Victorian transport minister, said the redundancies were essential to reduce losses of more than ADollars 2bn (Pounds 900m) a year in 'Australia's worst performing government-owned business enterprise'. Mr Brown said the shake-up would also include cuts in night-time transport, replacement of many tram and train services with buses, and widespread use of private contractors. The government claimed the proposals would save taxpayers ADollars 250m a year. The Victorian trades council, which groups most trade unions in the state, said it would fight to maintain services and jobs.</p>

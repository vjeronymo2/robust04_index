Akshonov is 27; Bray, ranked third by the USA Amateur Boxing  Federation, will turn 19 on Saturday.  </P> <P> The United States seemed headed for a win, capturing the first five fights. But  the Soviets won the last five, with light middleweight Dimitri Korsun taking a  2-1 decision from Paul Vaden of Puyallup, Wash., in the final bout.  </P> <P> The Soviets have dominated the series, which began in 1969, winning 33 times  while losing seven.

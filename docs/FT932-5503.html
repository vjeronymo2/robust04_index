			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Sales plans by US drugs group set back by committee reports SYNTEX, the Californian-based drugs group, was told yesterday by two US Food and Drug Administration committees they could not recommend that Naprosyn, the company's best-selling prescription product, be switched to over-the-counter status. The decision shows that the switch of products from prescription status to OTC being attempted by many companies is far from automatic. Mr Jonathan Gelles, pharmaceuticals analyst at Wertheim Schroder, the New-York based brokers, suggested the market had not absorbed the implications for SmithKline Beecham and Merck &amp; Co, which are trying to switch the anti-ulcer treatments Tagamet and Pepcid. The decision is a severe blow for Syntex, which had hoped to counter the expiry of Naprosyn's US patents in December by selling the medicine over-the-counter (OTC) at pharmacies without a prescription. On Wall Street, Syntex's shares closed down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 19 1/8 . The committees' recommendations, whose advice is nearly always accepted by the FDA, are also a setback to Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer group and the US's largest OTC company, which formed a marketing alliance with Syntex in 1987. Mr Gelles said American sales of Syntex's Naprosyn, an anti-inflammatory medicine used to treat arthritis, were Dollars 759m (Pounds 492m), equivalent to 42 per cent of the group's worldwide drugs sales. He estimated Naprosyn generated more than 75 per cent of group profits last year. Recent US patent expiries have resulted in sales falling more than 50 per cent during the first year, as cheap generic equivalents gain market share. Committee members expressed concern about the safety of the product and the high level of dosing proposed by Syntex. The product has been available OTC in Australia for a decade.</p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Macquarie Bank aims for 1996 listing Macquarie Bank, the Sydney-based investment bank owned by institutional shareholders including Hill Samuel of the UK, said yesterday it would list on the Australian Stock Exchange by the end of 1996. It added that it was unlikely to seek significant new capital as part of the process. Mr David Clarke, chairman, said the listing's main purpose would be 'to accommodate the desire of the bank's shareholders to see a more liquid market for the shares'. The bank, he added, regarded its capital base as 'extremely strong' and , at this stage, did not plan to raise any significant new capital when it lists. The bank had indicated it would canvas shareholders about the listing option in early-1995. However, it said yesterday this process had already been done in a more informal fashion. Mr Allan Moss, managing director, said the majority had been in favour, and were relaxed about the timing 'provided it was ' within a reasonable period'.</p>

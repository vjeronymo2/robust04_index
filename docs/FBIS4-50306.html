			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Cable-stayed bridges  will become increasingly popular all over the world, according  to leading international bridge engineers.    The engineers, attending the 1994 international symposium  here on cable-stayed bridges, agreed that more and more such  bridges will be erected throughout the world for their beauty  and sophisticated technology.    In a paper read at the symposium, Man-chung Tang, a  professor  at Columbia University in the United States, said that some 300  cable- stayed bridges have appeared worldwide since the first  such bridge was built at Stromsund, Switzerland, 40 years ago.    "Cable-stayed bridges fill the gap of efficient span range  between conventional medium-span girder bridges and the very  long- span suspended bridges," he said.    "The beauty of the cable-stayed bridge is so overwhelming  that the general public will quickly fall in love with it. For  this reason, more cable-stayed bridges will be built around the  world in the future," he added.    German Bridge Engineer Holger Svensson said that three  cable-  stayed bridges have erected on the Rhine River in Germany alone.    He said in a paper that such bridges to be built in Europe  will have an increasingly bigger span.    For example, such a bridge with a span of 1,204 m will be  erected in Denmark.    He said that a feasibility study of building another  cable-stayed bridge with a span of 1,500 m in Europe has been  completed.    The bridge is expected to use conventional materials such as  steel and concrete, he added.    Chang Song-pil, a professor at Seoul National University,  said that several cable-stayed bridges have been built in the  Republic of Korea in the past decade.    Engineers from Malaysia, Japan, Norway and France also read  papers during the symposium, which is scheduled to close today.</p>

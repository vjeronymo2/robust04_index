			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / UK poised to retaliate against California tax rules THE BRITISH government is expected to announce today that it will retaliate against US companies if the long-running dispute over California's unitary taxation system is not resolved by the end of the year. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is expected to announce that the UK will cancel a tax break given to US companies on the dividends they receive from their British subsidiaries. This would cost them about Pounds 250m a year. The retaliation would come the day before the US Supreme Court is expected to decide whether to hear the case brought by Barclays Bank, the UK clearing bank, against California's unitary tax system. Under this system, California may assess tax on a proportion of the worldwide profits of a group, calculated by the size of its payroll, sales and property in the state, instead of only taxing profits actually made in the state. Foreign businesses say this conflicts with the method used in almost all other countries, and exposes them to paying tax twice on the same profits. The UK passed legislation authorising the government to retaliate against US companies in 1986, but that law has never yet been implemented. Although the UK Treasury had wanted to wait to see if the Supreme Court settled the matter in Barclays' favour, Mr Lamont and Mr John Major, the prime minister, have been heavily lobbied by backbench members of parliament and by British companies such as Guinness, SmithKline Beecham and BAT, who argued for immediate retaliation. The European Community has also threatened retaliation, although any EC action is likely to be much later. The UK Treasury declined to comment. The Barclays case has been making its way through the courts for more than 10 years, but the Supreme Court is Barclays' last chance of reversing a ruling by the California supreme court in favour of the state. Previous US administrations have sided with Barclays against California. But President Bill Clinton earlier this month decided not to file a brief on Barclays' side, motivated principally by worries about the possible financial loss to the almost bankrupt California treasury. California estimates that if it lost the suit, it would have to refund about Dollars 520m (Pounds 337.6m) of tax and interest and would miss out on another Dollars 350m of taxes it has not yet collected. Another Dollars 3.1bn could be at stake if it also lost a connected suit brought by Colgate-Palmolive. For Barclays, the case involves over Dollars 30m. The cancellation of advance corporation tax credits to US companies - which might be backdated two years - would raise the tax rate paid by their UK subsidiaries from 28 per cent to the standard 33 per cent.</p>

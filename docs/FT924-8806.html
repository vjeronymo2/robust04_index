			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Getting ready for take-off - Gatwick expects a boost from the Dan-Air deal BAA, the privatised airport group, is expecting to see London's Gatwick airport stage a revival following the recent takeover of Dan-Air, the airport's single biggest operator, by British Airways. Long regarded as a poor relation to Heathrow, which continues to account for about three quarters of BAA's group profits, Gatwick has suffered during the past two years not only from the recession but from the government's decision to scrap its London air traffic distribution rules, the collapse of Air Europe and now the demise of Dan-Air. Big international airlines have taken advantage of the removal of London air traffic restrictions to transfer all or a large portion of their operations from Gatwick to Heathrow. The lack of a dense network of connecting flights has made it hard for carriers to operate a profitable scheduled network out of Gatwick. And the lingering recession has inevitably had a dampening effect on the airport's charter business. But it has been the lack of a strong national carrier underpinning the airport's business which has been at the heart of Gatwick's problems. 'The strong commitment of a major carrier at an airport is an incalculable advantage,' said BAA. Even after its takeover of British Caledonian five years ago, BA continued to adopt a half-hearted approach to Gatwick, concentrating most of its efforts in developing its profitable operations out of its main Heathrow hub. But BA has now clearly indicated its intention to develop a new low-cost short-haul airline operation at Gatwick, amalgamating the former Dan-Air scheduled operations it is absorbing with its own short-haul operations. BAA believes this new short-haul airline subsidiary being set up by BA will give Gatwick the boost it has been seeking. Sir John Egan, BAA's chief executive said yesterday: 'It is clear that over the years scheduled operators have found it difficult to operate viable short-haul networks out of Gatwick, but we believe that such short-haul routes are important to the successful development of the whole airport.' 'The worldwide marketing strength of BA offers the best chance of fully developing the available runway and terminal capacity at the airport,' he added. BA's takeover of Dan-Air has been fiercely criticised on anti-competitive grounds by other UK independent airlines including Virgin Atlantic, British Midland Airways, Air UK and Britannia. But none have the same marketing muscle required to revive Gatwick, according to BAA and many other airline industry analysts. Although BA is not taking over Dan-Air's charter business, which is being shut down, and is picking up directly only about 70 per cent of its scheduled operations, BAA expects the merger to boost in the longer term overall traffic at Gatwick. It also believes the new BA operation will ultimately provide greater opportunities at Gatwick for airline passenger transfer business which already accounts for one third of total activity at Heathrow. BAA expects Dan-Air's charter services to be picked up quickly by other charter operators as was the case with Air Europe after it failed two years ago. The process is not likely to be as swift for the Dan-Air scheduled services which BA is not taking over.</p>

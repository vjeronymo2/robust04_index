"One should only welcome special attention of the president  given to the issue in his message to the Federal Assembly. But  I would not hurry to rejoice as there may be forces to urge the  president on unjustified decisions," he said.    In the words of Poltoranin, he "repulsed the attacks of  forces wishing to divide the material-technical basis of mass  media and break the single information space for the past two  years."    His parliamentary committee receives inquiries of deputies  who are alarmed with the attempts to divide the influence  spheres in mass media bodies. "The president said that TV and  radio channels are not liable for privatization and shall be  state, but one cannot say for sure whether they will remain  state in future," added Poltoranin.    In his words, the parliamentary committee aims to create  conditions for economic independence of mass media, which "is  the only guarantee of observation of constitutional rights in  Russia at a time of anarchy." "If mass media fails to get the  economic basis for its independence it will be suppressed and  this process has begun. The president shall say the word in  order not to allow this to happen," said the committee chairman.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Olovo, Nisici, 13 Jan (TANJUG) -- Following  unprecedented four-day fighting, members of the Combined Brigade  of the Herzegovina Corps this morning managed to pierce Muslim  defense lines in several parts of the Olovo battlefield [50 km  north of Sarajevo on Sarajevo-Tuzla road], the brigade command  has announced. Some Muslim units have been cut off following an  unstoppable advance by Serb infantry and tank forces, and they  are currently surrounded. These units keep asking for help from  Tuzla which has not arrived because of severed communications.  A large number of Muslim soldiers are leaving the battlefield  in panic fleeing toward Olovo. The Muslim population from  Krusevo and other villages near Olovo is already fleeing toward  Tuzla.    The Muslim defeat can neither be helped by three rows of  bunkers deeply dug in and covered by planks and earth by which  Olovo and neighboring villages are surrounded. In the bloody  four-day conflicts near Olovo, four members of the Combined  Brigade of the Herzegovina Corps have been killed, while a few  fighters have been wounded, three of them seriously. In the  fighting today, up to the time when this dispatch was sent, the  Serb side had not suffered any losses.</p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Salenko still leads goal chase Oleg Salenko still tops the World Cup scoring race though he hasn't had a chance to add to his tally: Russia bowed out after the first round. To overtake him, someone has to crack a six-goal barrier that has not been broken in 20 years. Salenko, 24, netted five goals - a World Cup record for a single game - in Russia's 6-1 rout of Cameroon on June 28. Then he and his team went home. Possessing the top scorer was not enough to win the World Cup trophy at the last two tournaments, where the leading marksmen were Italy's Toto Schillaci (1990) and England's Gary Lineker (1986). But Paolo Rossi scored most goals when Italy won the championship in 1982, as did Mario Kempes when Argentina won in 1978. Grzegorz Lato's seven goals for Poland in 1974 was the last six-plus total. Just Fontaine's 13 goals for France have stood as all-time high since 1958.</p>

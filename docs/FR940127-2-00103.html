The rules of the other options exchanges allow opening rotations to commence following the opening of the underlying security. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  In order to conform its rules to the rules of the other options exchanges, the CBOE proposes to amend Interpretation and Policy .01(a) to state that the opening rotation in each class of options shall be held promptly following the opening of the underlying security on the principal market where the security is traded. Under proposed paragraph (d) to Commentary .01, an underlying security shall be deemed to have opened on the principal market where it is traded if the market has (i) reported a transaction in the underlying security or (ii) disseminated opening quotations for the underlying security and not given an indication of a delayed opening, whichever first occurs. In addition, the CBOE proposes to amend Interpretation and Policy .01 to provide that any member appointed as a Designated Primary Market-Maker (``DPM'') shall participate in opening rotations to the same extent as an Order Book Official (``OBO''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See American Stock Exchange (``Amex'') Rule 918(a)(1); New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') Rule 717(a); Pacific Stock Exchange (``PSE'') Rule 6.64, Commentary .01; and Philadelphia Stock Exchange (``PHLX'') Rule 1047, Commentary .01. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE and at the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II.

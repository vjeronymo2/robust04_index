			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> URBAN CORPS INTRODUCES FIRST GROUP  </P> <P> The San Diego Urban Corps, a newly formed organization designed to provide jobs  for unemployed San Diegans from 18 to 23 years old, introduced its first 25  inductees to the public Friday in a ceremony in Balboa Park.  </P> <P> Executive director Sam Duran said the goal of the corps is not just to provide  jobs to young adults but to involve them more extensively "and more  meaningfully" in the community as a whole. Duran said he hopes the corps will  serve as a deterrent to drug abuse and lawlessness but added that it "is hardly  limited to the underprivileged."  </P> <P> "We took in three homeless people," he said, "but is the corps open to a rich  kid from La Jolla who needs a job? Certainly. We'll take people who have  anything ranging from an eighth-grade education to a college degree. If, for  some reason, they're stifled, maybe we can help them. We want these kids to  learn the experience of the work ethic. We want them to know the experience of  going to work at a certain hour and doing so clean and sober."  </P> <P> As a veteran with 12 years in the conservation field, Duran said he was hired  by the board of directors with the aim of placing some in jobs related to  conservation.  </P> <P> Duran said that $93,000 had been collected from individuals and charities as  "start-up" money. He said the corps' headquarters are at 13th and Market  streets downtown.  </P> <P> City Councilman Wes Pratt, a member of the corps' board, said, "Now we're able  to put unemployed youth to work on conservation projects that benefit all San  Diegans. This is truly an investment in our natural resource, the youth of San  Diego."  </P> <P> Duran said none of the members has a job yet, "but we hope to be placing some  real soon."  </P></p>

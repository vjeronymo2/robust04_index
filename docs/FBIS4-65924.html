			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bolkestein Expresses Doubts About </F> `Purple' Coalition"]    [Text] "The subjects we have to discuss are difficult in  themselves," Bolkestein, VVD [People's Party for Freedom and  Democracy] leader, stated on Tuesday [24 May] evening. He was  referrring to progress on forming a government following  discussions with his fellow party leaders and the three  politicians charged by the Crown to assess the feasibility of  the various coalitions. This was the first time that Bolkestein  had expressed any doubts regarding the chances of achieving a  "purple" coalition [composed of the Democrats 66, D66, the Labor  Party, PvdA, and the VVD]. He had previously refrained from  making any judgment.    Bolkestein indicated that the negotiations proper have not  yet begun. Leaving the First Chamber, where talks are being  held, PvdA leader Kok said "we have listed all the subjects that  need to be discussed." Bolkestein said later: "That is  somewhat of an exaggeration on the part of Mr. Kok. There are  subjects which we have not yet looked at."    The VVD leader stated that the talks are still in their  initial phase and they have not yet gotten down to discussing  the details. Bolkestein: "And as you know, it is in the  details that the problems lie." When asked why the process has  to take so long, he replied: "Because it is so difficult." He  said that he did not know when the negotiations proper would be  able to begin. Addressing the assembled journalists, he quoted  an Arab saying: "It is difficult to predict anything,  especially about the future."    The D66's Van Mierlo, the last of the group to leave the  building, was rather more optimistic. He termed the talks  "fruitful." "It is a typical example of a fruitful process."    Are the negotiators rather fearful of the prospect of  beginning the negotiations proper? Van Mierlo: "No, this is a  calm, prudent approach. Tomorrow, I believe it will be tougher.  We are probing deeper all the time. Tomorrow we are going to  really get down to discussing specific points rather than taking  stock of the situation."    The politicians responsible for assessing the coalitions'  feasibility drew up an agenda last Wednesday based on the  subjects raised by the party leaders. They are now putting the  finishing touches to a timetable covering around 20 meeting  hours. According to this timetable, a provisional assessment of  the situation should be made on Friday. Then they will be able  to reply to the question as to whether there is any point in  pursuing the attempt to form a "purple" coalition.</p>

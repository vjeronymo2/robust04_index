			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by DELOVOY MIR correspondent Gennadiy Shilin: "Let </F> Us Be Realists"]    [Text] It seemed that just recently Russian  newspapers were full of articles and commentaries on the  developing cooperation in the area of combating terrorism and  the drug mafia between the FIS [Foreign Intelligence Service]  and the CIA, and the intelligence services of other countries.  It is well understood by everyone that this is a delicate issue  and requires a special approach. But the most important point,  which has been mentioned both here in Russia and over there in  the West, is that this greatly needed interaction between the  special services of different states requires a certain level of  trust and, if you wish, sincerity, although it is hard to speak  of the latter as applied to special service operations.  Whatever--the interaction between Russian foreign intelligence  and analogous structures in the West and the East over the past  year has acquired real form. From searching for ways toward  understanding we have progressed to exchanging information and  developing promising problems that concern the entire world  today. True, observers in the United States, Europe, and Russia  could not help noticing that CIA Director James Woolsey has been  increasingly often displaying greater activity in making public  statements. And, what is especially remarkable, his statements  have, as a rule, recently involved his agency's work in Russia,  with whose foreign intelligence the CIA has begun to establish  direct contacts and undertake interaction.  <H5>  On the List of Priorities </H5>   Actually, the enlightened reader will say, what is so  strange  about the chief of American intelligence supporting the  continuation of work in a country that only recently was the  main target of its intelligence penetration?    What attracts one's attention is the peremptory tone of  these  statements.    Speaking at hearings in the U.S. Congress special Senate  Intelligence Committee, the CIA director said at the beginning  of February this year (even before the arrest of high-ranking  CIA official Aldrich Ames, suspected of working for the KGB and  later for the FIS), that the United States has "four extensive  areas" in Russia where American intelligence is active.    First, the CIA "supplies the politicians (of the United  States) with important, and sometimes unique... analytical  materials containing warning of potential dangers Russia is  encountering."    Second, U.S. intelligence "continues to track the deployment  and status of about 27,000 of Russian nuclear warheads."    The third "Russian" line of its work remains "monitoring the  state of Russian Federation general-purpose armed forces." And,  finally, the fourth is "analysis of Russia's policy with respect  to its neighbors."    "The future of Russia, Ukraine, and other states of the  former USSR, as well as potential problems that may arise there,  are on the list of priority tasks of American intelligence  activities," he said at the end of February, speaking at  hearings at the Intelligence Committee of the U.S. House of  Representatives. The changing political climate in Moscow,  Russian policy with respect to the new independent states, and  Russia's growing concern regarding the West's goals in East  Europe and the CIS continue to be the subjects of the CIA's  attention, Woolsey emphasized.  <H5>  ...That Is What Intelligence Is About </H5>   As we can see, the range of American intelligence interests  is quite broad and its intent to conduct active operations with  respect to Russia is beyond doubt, despite the developing  cooperation between the two countries.    In this connection it would be proper to note that Moscow  never hyped a situation in which an American intelligence  officer was suddenly apprehended, or a Russian citizen actively  working for American special services was caught red-handed.  That is what intelligence is about, knowledgeable people  say--learning other countries' secrets, analyzing them, and  reporting observations to the government.    There are, however, some differences in the activities of  the  two special services: While Russian intelligence in the case of  the Ameses, according to American sources, was interested in CIA  operations in the Soviet Union (and later Russia), as Woolsey's  statements demonstrate, American intelligence is interested in  "high politics." The latter, as a sophisticated leader  understands, is conducted in the Kremlin offices, and a limited  number of people have access to it.    Is it worthwhile under such circumstances to raise such a  clamor, as some American Congressmen and CIA top officials did,  on the subject of detaining a CIA officer who shared secrets  with foreign intelligence? If we approach this soberly, calmly,  from the standpoint of developing partnership relations--hardly.  <H5>  Double Bookkeeping </H5>   Perhaps we should have put a period at this point, had it  not  been for one piece of news, which came practically  simultaneously from faraway Australia, where local newspapers,  as though on command, raised the subject of Russian intelligence  activities. The topic--several Russian diplomats who had left  the country back in the middle and second part of last year. In  response to the inquiry of a liberal party representative in  parliament, Australian Minister of Foreign Affairs Evans Gareth  especially emphasized that the de facto expulsion had not been  made public because Australia did not wish to aggravate  relations with Russia.    Interestingly, the SYDNEY MORNING HERALD newspaper, quoting  informed sources, reported that information on Russian  intelligence officers working in Australia had been received by  Australian special services at the end of 1992-beginning of  1993... from the American CIA. (Note: During this period the CIA  and the FIS were moving toward searching for areas of  interaction!) Also, the CIA, together with British intelligence  (which, by the way, also began talking about partnership  relations with the FIS at the time), insisted that the  activities of aforementioned persons were energetic and  dangerous to Australian security and that insufficiently  decisive actions with respect to Russian representatives on the  part of Australian special services allegedly compromised these  organizations.    Today, after the arrest in the United States of CIA officer  Aldrich Ames, American-British pressure apparently was brought  to bear all the way up. Gentlemen's agreements, which had  previously been lauded in England and the United States, were  forgotten this time.  <H5>  Learn To Be Peaceful Rivals </H5>   The campaign of unmasking Russian intelligence agents is  gathering speed, and it is clear that its organizers have little  concern for the development of interstate relations, which may  to a certain extent be jeopardized, or the development of  partnership ties, which are just beginning to produce the first  results along lines important for many countries, including the  United States.    Political salvos have already had a negative impact on the  economic sphere of U.S.-Russian relations. The mass media have  already reported numerous times on the blunt statements of some  American Congressmen, who believe it necessary to immediately  suspend appropriations of any money whatsoever to support the  program of reforms in Russia. Now we are getting the first  reactions from experts and direct capital holders. It should be  noted that they reflect a much more realistic approach to the  problem.    "The effect of the Ames affair should be short-lived," the  REUTER agency quotes Aleksis Rodzyanko, managing director of the  Chemical Bank--the largest in the United States. Neither do  representatives of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and Johnson &amp;  Johnson foresee any problems for their companies. But this, it  should be noted in parentheses, mainly goes for companies  already actively doing business in Russia, who have invested  serious capital in the country and have established themselves  in the market.    The spy scandal per se will undoubtedly die down; however,  the reverberations of the noise raised around it will long serve  as an irritant, causing excessive caution among  investors--especially those who are just contemplating investing  their capital in Russia. Thus, they are in a way being pushed in  the direction of thinking that with all the attractiveness of  the Russian market, there exist numerous others--East European,  Asian, or Latin American--where investment can bring no less  profit to American companies, and without fear of being "accused  of collaborationism."    At this point, as a counterbalance, I want to quote the  remarks of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher at  hearings on the federal budget for the 1995 fiscal year at the  subcommittee for operations abroad of the U.S. House of  Representatives Appropriations Committee. The United States  "must be a realist" in conducting policy with respect to Russia,  he said, expressing the administration's opinion.    As American-Russian relations develop, disagreements are  inevitable, believes W. Christopher, and in this case the United  States must act on the basis of its national interests.  Recalling some Congressmen's calls for cutting or suspending aid  to Russia entirely in connection with the Ames case, he said:  "It is not in our interests to be mere spectators watching the  course of reforms in Russia." The secretary of state reminded  legislators of the words of President Clinton, who considers aid  to Russian reform not charity but an investment in American  security and prosperity. "Our dollars... will turn into credit  guarantees for American exporters and investors," he emphasized.  To change the current course toward Russia would mean to damage  American interests first and foremost.    Realists understand perfectly well that in politics one  should not mix two unrelated things. The cold war is a thing of  the past, and it is not in our common interests to resurrect it.  As the Paris newspaper L'ECHO writes, the "Ames case" will be  good for both Russia and the United States if it helps them  understand that the end of ideological confrontation between the  two grandees does not mean the end of rivalry between them,  which is natural for such major powers, and that now they have  to learn to compete peacefully.</p>

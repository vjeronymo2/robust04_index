Doonan] </F>   [Text] Durban March 29 SAPA -- King Zwelithini said  Monday's violence in Johannesburg had "further compounded  problems", explaining that his subjects' anger "is such that an  early meeting is quite out of the question".    "I must, I think, call for a moratorium on all negotiations  about the future of the kingdom until people have been given the  opportunity to bury their dead, and until such time as the  fierce anger in their breasts has abated somewhat."    The king said he also feared for his safety after Monday's  events. His advisors would be reluctant to put their king in  the hands of "those whom they believed killed them" and in the  hands of a government which had been powerless to do anything to  prevent Monday's tragedy.    Reacting to the king's request, a spokesman for the state  president's office said Mr de Klerk felt the present situation  warranted the holding of the meeting before the weekend.  Efforts to hold the summit as soon as possible would continue  and Mr de Klerk was trying to get in touch with King Goodwill  about the matter, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation]  radio news quoted the spokesman as saying.    ANC [African National Congress] Spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa  said  his organisation had not been formally notified of the king's  requests. Mr Mamoepa said it would be unfortunate if the  meeting, scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, was postponed  "given the gravity of the current situation in the PWV  [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] and Natal". He said the  situation demanded the leaders meet urgently "to ensure the  whole democratic process moves forward".    "It's crucial and critical that all players must be  involved... To bring about a stable situation to ensure our  people participate freely in the forthcoming elections," he said.</p>

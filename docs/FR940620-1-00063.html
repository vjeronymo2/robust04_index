			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)(1) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation'' in solicitations and contracts when the successful offeror(s) will be required to deliver computer software or computer software documentation. Do not use the clause when the only deliverable items are technical data (other than computer software documentation), commercial computer software of commercial computer software documentation, commercial items (see 227.402&hyph;3), special works (see 277.505), contracts under the Small Business Innovative Research Program (see 227.404), or in Architect-Engineer and construction contracts (see 227.407).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Use the clause with the Alternate I in research contracts when the contracting officer determines, in consultation with counsel, that public dissemination by the contractor would be_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) In the interest of the Government; and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Facilitated by the Government relinquishing its right to publish the work for sale, or to have others publish the work for sale on behalf of the Government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7019, ``Validation of Asserted Restrictions_Computer Software'' in solicitations and contracts that include the clause at 252.227&hyph;7014. The clause provides procedures for the validation of asserted restrictions on the Government's rights to use, release, or disclose computer software.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7037, ``Validation of Asserted Restrictions'', in solicitations and contracts that include the clause at 252.227&hyph;7014 when the contractor will be required to deliver noncommercial computer software documentation (technical data). The clause implements statutory requirements under 10 U.S.C. 2321. Paragraph (d) of the clause contains information that must be included in a formal challenge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7016, ``Rights in Bid or Proposal Data'', in solicitations and contracts when the Government anticipates a need to use, subsequent to contract award, computer software or computer software documentation included in a bid or proposal that are not required to be delivered under the contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7025, ``Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends'', in solicitations and contracts when it is anticipated that the Government will provide the contractor, for performance of its contract, computer software or computer software documentation marked with another contractor's restrictive legend(s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Use the provision at 252.227&hyph;7028, ``Technical Data or Computer Software Previously Delivered to the Government'', in solicitations when the resulting contract will require the contractor to deliver computer software or computer software documentation. The provision requires offerors to identify any software or documentation specified in the solicitation as deliverable items that are the same or substantially the same as software or documentation which the offeror has delivered or is obligated to deliver, either as a contractor or subcontractor, under any other federal agency contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 227.503&hyph;7  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> [Reserved]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 227.503&hyph;8  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Deferred delivery and deferred ordering of computer software and computer software documentation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Deferred delivery. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7026, ``Deferred Delivery of Technical Data and Computer Software'', when it is in the Government's interests to defer the delivery of computer software or computer software documentation. The clause permits the contracting officer to require the delivery of data identified as ``deferred delivery'' data or computer software at any time until two years after acceptance by the Government of all items (other than technical data or computer software) under the contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors or suppliers to deliver such data expires two years after the date the prime contractor accepts the last item from the subcontractor or supplier for use in the performance of the contract. The contract must specify the computer software or computer software documentation that is subject to deferred delivery. The contracting officer shall notify the contractor sufficiently in advance of the desired delivery date for such software or documentation to permit timely delivery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Deferred ordering. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7027, ``Deferred Ordering of Technical Data or Computer Software'', when a firm requirement for software or documentation has not been established prior to contract award but there is a potential need for computer software or computer software documentation. Under this clause, the contracting officer may order any computer software or computer software documentation generated in the performance of the contract or any subcontract thereunder at any time until three years after acceptance of all items (other than technical data or computer software) under the contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors to deliver such technical data or computer software expires three years after the date the contractor accepts the last item under the subcontract. When the software or documentation are ordered, the delivery dates shall be negotiated and the contractor compensated only for converting the software or documentation into the prescribed form, reproduction costs, and delivery costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 227.503&hyph;9  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Copyright.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Copyright license.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation'', requires a contractor to grant, or obtain for the government license rights which permit the government to reproduce the software or documentation, distribute copies, perform or display the software or documentation and, through the right to modify data, prepare derivative works. The extent to which the government, and others acting on its behalf, may exercise these rights varies for each of the standard data rights licenses obtained under the clause. When non-standard license rights in computer software or computer software documentation will be negotiated, negotiate the extent of the copyright license concurrent with negotiations for the data rights license. Do not negotiate copyright licenses for computer software that provide less rights than the standard restricted rights in computer software license. For computer software documentation, do not negotiate a copyright license that provides less rights than the standard limited rights in technical data license.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

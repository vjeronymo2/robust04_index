			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, defrocked last year after confessing to  unspecified "sins" with a New Orleans prostitute, has been expelled from the  National Religious Broadcasters, the group that represents about three-fourths  of the nation's television ministries. The organization's directors, who said  his "moral failure" and "confessed misconduct" were damaging to the group's  interests, voted Swaggart out at their annual meeting in Washington. Meanwhile,  Swaggart's lawyer threatened to sue Penthouse magazine for publishing a new  account of sexual misconduct against the Baton Rouge, La., minister. The  article claims Swaggart conned a New Orleans stripper into performing  sadomasochistic acts while he watched, and that he asked her 13-year-old  daughter to have sex with him.  </P></p>

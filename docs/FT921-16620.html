			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Europe's role in the world THE TIME of adolescent introspection is past. Free of the benevolent tutelage of the US, the EC must now make its own destiny as an adult. It must do so as mindful of the ruin that succeeded Europe's last period of autonomy, as of the opportunities and dangers that confront it today. Though Europe's child, the US has played a parental role towards it over the past 50 years. Success has crowned that effort, but the US is now weary and disillusioned. Europe must share the burden of leadership, but should beware substituting a destructive rivalry for the co-operation that is in its higher interest. Co-operation between Europe, the US, and Japan is the sine qua non of global stability and progress. Little of global significance can be done if they fail to co-operate; should they do so, little is beyond them. At the top of the agenda in the post-cold war era is economic co-operation, the first item of all being the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Nothing could justify the damage to international trade that would follow failure of these negotiations. Still less could the Gatt's collapse be justified by defence of a policy as wasteful and corrupting as the common agricultural policy. The EC will argue that it should not yield to US bullying. But it should remember what it owes the US, and repay a part of that debt. In the world, Europe must be an equal partner; vis-a-vis its neighbours it should be the leading one. The implosion of the old adversary has created a unique opportunity and a mortal danger. Stable market-oriented democracies need to be established in some 20 enfeebled and fractious states, polluted remnants of the last European empire. Russia's case The Russian colossus must be the starting point. Once again, there could be but a brief interlude of democracy between tyrannies. The Russian government, under Boris Yeltsin, is determined on economic reform in conditions that are nigh on hopeless. The west cannot afford to let him fail and, given the scale of the resources that had to be invested in defence against the Soviet Union, can afford what he needs to succeed. A huge effort of technical and financial assistance is needed, not next year, but now. Stability cannot be achieved in Eurasia if Russia remains in chaos. But other countries of the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe should not be forgotten. Europe must try to do for them what the US once did for it. The first thing to give to all, to Europe's own great benefit, is free access to its markets. Also important, however, will be technical and financial support. Economically hopeful Inevitably the focus will be on the larger countries, such as Ukraine, and the more economically hopeful, such as the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, Hungary and Poland. The smaller countries can then be lifted by the buoyancy of their larger neighbours and those in the rear by the successes of those in the van. Finally, there is the challenge of enlargement. But this should come after the Gatt and after the problems of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. None of these countries will be ready for membership in the next few years, but their problems are far more urgent than those of such prosperous democracies as Austria or Sweden. However desirable early expansion of the EC may be, it must not divert attention from the threats and opportunities on the EC's eastern borders. Among those threats is that to security. The EC's failure to halt Yugoslavia's agonies offers a warning of what could follow in the erstwhile Soviet Union. The European Union has neither the military means, nor the will, to deal with such threats on its own. All the more important, therefore, that it develop the means and show the will to deal with the economic challenge before it boils over in civil war. Co-operation with its partners; generosity towards its erstwhile foes. These must be the guiding lights of a European Union, which was not born great, is yet to achieve greatness, but has had the opportunity for greatness thrust upon it.</p>

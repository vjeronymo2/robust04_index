			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Letter: CEOs not encouraged nor trained to lead Sir, When Andrew Dyke (Letters, August 3) observes that chief executive officers may copy Roman generals with the team briefings but still lack their leadership skills, he touches a bigger issue: chief executive officers are neither encouraged to lead, nor trained in leadership. There are many styles of leadership, but all strive for the same end - to get individuals to take personal risks to achieve goals that benefit others. This is well understood in the military, where the risks are ultimate and the goal may be survival. In war, leadership demands courage, determination, vision and the ability to inspire. Management training - taught or experienced - gives us consensus, 'managing upwards' and the golden parachute. For any CEO or aspirant wanting to get back to basics, I recommend a text that I believe has yet to appear on Masters of Business Administration book lists. It is Masks of Command (Penguin Books), in which John Keegan, a Sandhurst lecturer and defence correspondent, analyses the leadership of famous (and infamous) historical generals, from Alexander to Hitler. After reading it, I defy any manager to think that addressing his or her staff once a week is leadership.

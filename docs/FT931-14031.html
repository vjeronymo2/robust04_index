			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Brazil's leader takes over state sell-off THE Brazilian government yesterday announced new privatisation rules. These confirmed President Itamar Franco's direct command over the process and barred state companies' pension funds from taking part, prompting investor fears that the programme may cease to be viable. The rules, in the form of a 63-part decree, establish Mr Franco as head of the privatisation process with the right to intervene at any stage. He can also decide on a case-by-case basis the level of participation of foreign capital and 'rotten money' - domestic debt swapped at par, which has accounted for 97 per cent of the Dollars 4bn raised so far. Announcing the changes, Mr Paulo Haddad, economy minister, said foreign participation might be more than the current 40 per cent, and as much as 100 per cent, depending on the company. However, the decision to disqualify the state company pension funds caused concern among investors, who fear that without them there might not be enough money in the economy to make the sell-offs feasible. The Sao Paulo stock exchange index fell back from a 2 per cent rise to a 0.9 per cent loss on the news. The pension funds represent an investor potential of Dollars 25bn (Pounds 16.4bn), Mr Haddad says, and they have been the main participants in the programme so far. For example, 95 per cent of rail carriage maker Mafersa was bought by the federal railways pension fund. Mr Francisco Baker, the presidential spokesman, said: 'Mr Franco feels that the participation of parastatal pension funds benefits a very small group of Brazilians and constitutes using state money to buy state companies.' However, some investors suspect Mr Franco, a past critic of privatisation, of trying to slow it down. One foreign banker commented: 'There seems little doubt now that he is trying to scupper the process.' The programme has been suspended since early December, but Mr Franco has promised that it will resume in March.</p>

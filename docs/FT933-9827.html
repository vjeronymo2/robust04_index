			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Investor safety net pays out Pounds 18.6m A SHARP rise in claims from victims of alleged negligent investment advice brought a big increase in compensation payments by the Investors Compensation Scheme last year. In its annual report, published yesterday, the scheme said it had paid compensation of Pounds 18.6m to 1,723 investors in the year ending March 31. In the previous year it had paid Pounds 12.5m to 1,598 investors. ICS, run by the Securities and Investments Board, acts as a safety net to compensate private investors when a firm authorised under the scheme fails and is unable to pay investors their claims. It declared 38 firms in default last year, bringing the total to 91 since ICS began in August 1988. Since April, another 11 firms have been declared in default. Mr Richard Lawson, ICS chairman, said: 'The number of defaults by firms and the volume of claims has continued to rise.' The firms declared in default during 1992-93 were smaller than those affected in earlier years. Mr Lawson said claims were being based on the grounds of negligent advice rather than misappropriation or theft. In 1991-92, negligence-related claims made up a third of all compensation claims, compared with two-thirds in 1992-93. Mr Lawson singled out home income plans as being of particular concern. During the property boom of the 1980s many investors took out loans against their homes and entered investment schemes to pay the loan's interest and give them some income. The fall in house values in the early 1990s and the subsequent rise in interest rates left many investors paying out more than they received. Many compensation claims were filed against such schemes. Mr Lawson said the ICS had made 'considerable headway with claims arising from home income plans where investors were advised by authorised firms to enter into generally inappropriate, complex and financially hazardous arrangements'. The ICS has received more than 1,600 claims over home-income plans and paid or offered compensation of more than Pounds 16m. Mr Lawson said ICS had dealt with more than two-thirds of the claims, but said lack of information from investors and firms meant claims were not being processed as quickly as he wanted. He said: 'We are keenly aware, particularly in home-income plan defaults, of the urgency relating to claims, and through direct contact with the claimants we appreciate the distress they have suffered.' The ICS has declared in default Money Flow - the Exeter firm trading as D. Lacy-Hulbert - which was authorised as a life assurance, unit trusts and pensions intermediary.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / No Pyongyang N-deal in sight Mr Robert Gallucci, US ambassador-at-large, and Mr Kang Sok-ju, North Korea's first deputy foreign minister, met yesterday morning in a bid to unblock stalled negotiations on eliminating Pyongyang's nuclear capability, Frances Williams writes from Geneva The US said afterwards there had been 'an extensive exchange of views' while North Korea described the discussions as 'serious and businesslike'. The two sides plan to meet again today. US officials had hoped to wrap up a deal with North Korea this week granting the isolated communist state safer atomic reactor technology in return for full disclosure of its nuclear activities, current and past. But additional demands by Pyongyang, going well beyond an outline agreement reached last month, quickly brought the talks to a standstill.</p>

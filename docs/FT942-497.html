			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Big guns take aim on prairies - US anger at surging Canadian wheat exports Formal talks between the US and Canada over Canadian wheat exports have ended inconclusively with no sign of an agreement, although a timetable for renewed negotiations remained under discussion. Charging Ottawa with unfair trade, the US has threatened tariffs on surging Canadian wheat sales from August. Canada, in turn, has vowed to retaliate against a range of US farm goods. The two sides face a Friday deadline to iron out their differences over wheat. The long-simmering dispute over Canadian wheat has been given more urgency by the political pull of prairie state farmers and has grown into an international trade dispute. Although agricultural trade comprises only Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.8bn) of the total Dollars 210bn in annual trade between the US and Canada, and wheat trade comprises only a fraction of that, the Clinton administration has decided to aim its big guns at the issue. Washington is seeking to limit Canadian wheat imports by half while gaining access to Canada's highly restricted poultry and dairy sectors. Although Canada has agreed to end rail subsidies and modify some marketing practices as a result of the complaint, the US has continued to put on the pressure. At the heart of the dispute, but rarely talked about, are dislocations in US grower and export subsidy programmes that have left US grain processors short of high quality wheat, creating a vacuum filled by imports. Exchange rates have also encouraged wheat to flow south. The immediate dispute revolves around a tiny portion of the 2.5bn-bushel US wheat crop, the durum wheat grown mainly in North Dakota. Durum is the raw material for semolina flour, the main ingredient in pasta. US durum production plunged to 69m bushels last year, from 122m in 1991. Farmers abandoned durum for other crops and bad weather further reduced the harvest. Production was inadequate to meet the 77m bushel domestic demand last year, much less the 50m bushels of exports encouraged by the main US export subsidy programme, known as EEP. The effect was a sharp rise in the domestic prices, a drop in world prices, and a compensating 10m-bushel increase in durum imports to the US. The durum price increase delighted US growers and outraged pasta processors who were already battling against low-priced pasta imports. In at least one case, the durum sold at cut-rate prices overseas appears to have come back to the US as cheap pasta. The US sold Turkey about 43,000 tonnes of durum wheat last year, subsidising the sales at an average rate of Dollars 33 per tonne, or about 20 per cent below world prices. Turkey is the second largest exporter of pasta to the US, and the National Pasta Association says Turkish pasta is marketed in the US at prices 20 to 50 per cent below those of domestic brands. Mr Luke Marano, chairman of the NPA and president of Philadelphia Macaroni Company, is determined to end EEP-subsidised sales of US durum if the US shuts off Canadian supplies. He says the wheat talks neglect the realities of world trade. 'If they knock out Canadian wheat, domestic durum prices would go sky-high, while the Canadian wheat would just be sold to Italy and Algeria, and become cheap pasta imports. It would be hard for us to stay in business.' Canadian negotiators point out that much of the wheat exported to the US comes back to Canada as Dollars 77m in annual pasta purchases from the US. Veteran durum traders shrug off the controversy, saying it doesn't warrant such a high profile. 'Durum is a small crop, and prices have always been volatile. This year the crop should be larger and the quality better, so the incentive to import from Canada is already diminishing,' one said.</p>

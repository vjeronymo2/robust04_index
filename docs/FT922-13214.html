			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Letter: Reasons for veto of Irish Republic companies from FT-SE 100 Index 'unconvincing and discriminatory' Sir, Peter Jones (April 1) seeks to justify the refusal of the FT-SE 100 Steering Committee to consider large Irish companies for inclusion in the FT-SE 100 Index. As Mr Jones has chosen to go public on the matter, I would like to explain why I consider the position of the steering committee to be wholly unconvincing and seriously discriminatory. The full name of the stock exchange is 'The International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland Limited'. The Dublin exchange is currently a constituent part of the stock exchange. Both the Dublin and London exchanges are likely to maintain the closest operational links within the EC - such as dual listing and equal access to equity settlement and market information systems. Including Irish companies in the FT-SE 100 Index would involve minimal change to its overall balance since at present only three Irish companies have a sufficiently large market capitalisation. In this context, for Mr Jones to compare Irish companies quoted in London with American, Japanese or other non-EC companies is simply disingenuous. It is suggested that the purpose of the Index is to provide an indicator of performance of UK companies. Yet, a substantial number of FT-SE 100 companies have a considerable proportion of their assets abroad or generate most of their turnover or profit outside the UK. Inclusion of the eligible Irish companies would not alter in any fundamental sense investors' exposure to companies with a primary listing on the stock exchange. Indeed, not only would some of the eligible Irish companies provide an exposure to sectors not currently reflected adequately in the Index, they also interact substantially with the UK economy and provide significant employment. In this context, the steering committee's rule requiring a company to be incorporated and registered for tax in the UK simply does not reflect economic or industrial reality. The FT-SE 100 Index is widely perceived to be the premier index, representative of those blue chip companies which have their primary listing on the stock exchange. That is the common sense understanding of equity market observers everywhere and the Index is presented and marketed as such in the print and TV media throughout the world. The other indices mentioned by Mr Jones do not have the same economic impact. Are not market participants entitled to expect that eligible Irish companies will be included in the premier representative index of the stock exchange? Mr Jones is trying to defend the indefensible. The current practice of the steering committee has the effect of limiting the market in shares of Irish companies, to the prejudice of investors, and of imposing on them dissimilar conditions to those applied to companies incorporated in the UK. The steering committee should think again and act quickly to redress this injustice. Peter D Sutherland, chairman, AIB Group, Bankcentre, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4</p>

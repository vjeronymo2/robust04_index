Statistics published by the National Cancer Institute indicate that cigarette smoking and chewing of tobacco are responsible for as many as 1,500 deaths per day in the United States. Recent studies conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency indicate that prolonged exposure to second-hand smoke significantly increases the probability of developing heart and lung disease. Therefore, the CMHS strongly encourages all grantees to provide smoke-free project and work environments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This program supports one of the tenants of health care reform that appropriate and adequate care be provided by trained providers.

			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GULF WATCH: DAY 148;  </P> <P> A DAILY BRIEFING PAPER ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CRISIS;  </P> <P> MILITARY FRONT:  </P> <P> President Bush has decided that problems caused by postponing military action  against Iraq outweigh the political and military risks of an early offensive,  senior Administration officials said. His conclusion is based on the belief  that delaying an attack much beyond the U.N. Security Council's Jan. 15  deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait would significantly increase the  number of American casualties, the officials said.  </P> <P> Responding to concerns expressed by top military officials, the President told  reporters: "Don't believe these reports you're reading" that U.S. forces will  not be fully prepared to launch a military offensive action by mid-January.  "The situation is just right," he said.  </P> <P> Members of Company A from the Marines Barracks in Washington, D.C., are being  sent to the Persian Gulf, the first such deployment since 1906. Company A  Marines are known for their ceremonial duties as guards at the White House and  other tourist attractions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Diplomatic Front:  </P> <P> President Saddam Hussein told Iraqi ambassadors summoned to an emergency  session in Baghdad that he is ready for "serious and constructive dialogue"  with the United States, but he insisted that any talks also address the  Palestinian issue, the official Iraqi News Agency reported. If talks occur,  President Bush told reporters, "there's not going to be a compromise with this  man" over demands that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 15.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Political Front:  </P> <P> Thousands of Iraqi women and children demonstrated outside the U.S. Embassy in  Baghdad to protest the forced diversion of an Iraqi cargo vessel carrying food  bound for Iraq.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Sea Blockade:  </P> <P> * Number of ship interceptions: 5,833  </P> <P> * Number of ships boarded: 713  </P> <P> * Number of ships diverted: 30  </P> <P> * Number of participating countries: 17  </P></p>

The production should be launched this year. In  this context, it is also advancing the offer of cooperation to  the RDP [Research, Development, Production] Group, the  association of Czech arms manufacturers. This transpired from  an interview given by Peter Koncier, director of ZTS Dubnica nad  Vahom, to a CTK correspondent yesterday. According to  information provided by Koncier, ZTS Dubnica expects an overall  increase of its special production this year. The increase will  be secured by the production of a trial run of the 155-mm  howitzer code-named "Zuzana," which conforms to NATO  specifications. It will come, in part, also from the expected  growth in sales of spare parts and from the modernized tank  turret. The modernization of the tank turret, which has been  virtually completed, concerns the control systems, the  night-vision system, the firing-control system, and the like,  Koncier said.</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Vauxhall returns to engine making GENERAL Motors started production yesterday at its Pounds 190m engine facility at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire - the single biggest investment by the world's leading vehicle maker in the UK. The complex, with 450 workers, will produce 135,000 engines a year when it reaches full production in 1994-95. It will make a new range of top-of-the-line V6 engines developed during a four-year programme at the company's European research and development centre at Russelsheim near Frankfurt. The investment at Ellesmere Port, GM's sole source for the new V6 engines, marks a watershed for the US group's operations in the UK. It reverses the company's retreat from manufacturing in Britain up to the mid 1980s. GM ceased all UK car engine making in 1984. The V6 plant marks the first time GM has chosen the UK as sole source for a principal component for its European vehicle operations. The site was selected against fierce competition from Kaiserslautern, one of GM's leading German engine and components plants. The facility has extensive machining operations for main engine components including blocks, cylinder heads, crankshafts, camshafts and con-rods. It has capacity to produce 500,000 cylinder heads and 1m camshafts a year, with some output being exported to GM engine plants in Germany and Brazil. The V6 engines are destined for GM's European Opel/Vauxhall executive cars and for Saab Automobile, the Swedish car maker in which GM holds a 50 per cent stake and management control. The 170-brake-horsepower V6 engine will be fitted in a top-of-the-range model of the Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Vectra large family car to be launched early next year. It will then go into the next generation Vauxhall Carlton/Opel Omega executive car, to be launched in 1994. A variant will be used by Saab when it replaces its ageing Saab 900 range in the second half of next year.</p>

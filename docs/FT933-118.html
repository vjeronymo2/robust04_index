			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Athena losses put Pentos in red PENTOS, the specialist retailer that owns the Dillons, Ryman and Athena chains, yesterday reported a first-half loss, passed its interim dividend, and warned that full year results would be influenced by exceptional losses at the Athena poster and card shops. The group also announced that Mr Terry Maher, chairman and chief executive, would retire by the end of the year. In the six months to June 30 the pre-tax loss was Pounds 400,000 compared with a Pounds 2.4m profit. Losses per share were 0.3p, against earnings of 1.3p when a 0.7p interim dividend was declared. In the wake of the announcement the shares fell 1 1/2 p to close at 46 1/2 p. The shares have fallen steadily over the past 24 months from a high of 170p. Commenting on the results Mr Maher said: 'Dillons and Ryman again made progress although sales were below expectations. Office furniture made a welcome return to profit after the losses of the second half. 'At Athena, however, in a still depressed market, increased losses were incurred as stock levels were reduced at the expense of margins.' Sales rose to Pounds 101.2m, against Pounds 99.3m, which included Pounds 2.9m from discontinued activities. There was a 5 per cent increase in sales of the continuing operations. However, trading profits fell from Pounds 4.9m to Pounds 2.2m, insufficient to cover interest costs which increased by 4 per cent to Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 2.5m). Trading profits in the core specialist retailing division fell by 63 per cent to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 3.8m), mainly reflecting problems at Athena. Within the division, sales at the flagship Dillons bookshops increased by 9 per cent to Pounds 53.8m in a flat market, and by 4 per cent on a like-for-like basis. Ryman, the stationers which now includes the former Wilding stores trading under the Ryman Computer Store name, increased sales by 4 per cent to Pounds 22.8m. Sales were slightly ahead on a like-for-like basis despite the severe price cutting in the personal computer market. Athena's sales were up 7 per cent to Pounds 19m, with UK retail sales showing an 8 per cent gain but the chain's like-for-like sales were down 3 per cent. Mr Maher said market conditions remained difficult with margins depressed by the action taken to reduce overall stock levels, particularly at Athena, and to improve stock quality. He added: 'Significant losses will be incurred for the year as a whole, but the actions taken to reduce overheads, increase product focus and reduce funds employed will improve our longer term prospects.' Pentos's occupancy costs are now stabilising having risen over the past four years to represent 35 per cent of sales, equivalent to an additional Pounds 9m in costs. The office furniture division, which is earmarked for sale, achieved a significant turnround to profits, compared with losses in the previous six months by cutting costs and improving manufacturing efficiencies. However, sales were 2 per cent lower and profits were 23 per cent down at Pounds 1m, against last year's first six months. Analysts believe Pentos' debt this year will average about Pounds 60m, little changed from a year earlier.</p>

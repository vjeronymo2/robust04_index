			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE BEEN BULLDOZED FOR IT, RESIDENTS COMPLAIN;  </P> <P> DOMINICAN READIES 'LIGHTHOUSE TO COLUMBUS'  </P> <P> Near this capital city, a gigantic, cross-shaped laser beam that will be  visible for miles all over the Caribbean is being readied for the 500th  anniversary of Christopher Columbus' historic arrival in the New World.  </P> <P> But residents of this island nation, which the explorer first sighted in 1492,  aren't universally taken with President Joaquin Balaguer's "Lighthouse to  Columbus" and other preparations being made for the 1992 anniversary. Entire  neighborhoods have been bulldozed to make way for tourist hotels and  restaurants, museums and highways, giving rise to sharp protests from those  affected.  </P> <P> One of the ironies of the anniversary preparations is the enormous amount of  electricity the Columbus Lighthouse will consume -- in a land that suffers from  a chronic power shortage and frequent blackouts and where people in outlying  areas often have to depend on candlelight.  </P> <P> The heavy expenditures on public works have generated large government budget  deficits, and many economists blame the shortfall for last year's 50% inflation  rate. The minimum wage of about $80 a month barely covers basic necessities.  </P> <P> The government says that the ambitious projects are meant to spruce up the  country for the expected tourist influx. Officials point out that tourism is  now the country's economic lifeline, replacing the traditional money-earner,  sugar exports.  </P> <P> The lighthouse's defenders say the island needs to exploit its current boom as  a tourist hotspot with modern services. And Balaguer regularly appears at  ceremonies to inaugurate apartments, roads, and bridges and to argue that it  helps the infrastructure for development.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, community groups are digging in their heels to resist further  demolition such as that which has left Mirador Park, an area near the  lighthouse, looking like a battleground.  </P> <P> "Every poor person in this city is faced with the threat of displacement," says  Nicolas Guevara of the Committee to Defend Neighborhood Rights (Copadeba). "The  project engineers promise them new homes," he says. But once their old homes  are demolished, residents find that the promised new homes have been given to  someone else.  </P> <P> An official of the 500th anniversary committee, Jose Chez Checo, denies the  charge. "There have been problems with some projects, but near the lighthouse  area the displaced persons have been moved back into the new residences," he  says.  </P> <P> Extensions of major traffic arteries also are scheduled to plow through crowded  barrios.  </P> <P> "We are convinced that this is a conscious plan to remove poor people from the  city," Guevara says. "The tourist industry wants them out for aesthetic  reasons, and the government wants to remove centers of protest."  </P> <P> Some of the affected zones were, in fact, hotbeds of activism in 1984 when more  than 100 people died in rioting over price increases of basic necessities.  </P> <P> Affected residents say the officials' main aim is to pressure people to leave.  </P> <P> "They asked me if I wanted money or a shack," relates Salvador Rincon, who  refused a cash payment of $700 for his demolished house. He now lives with his  family of five in a precarious hut next to an open sewer while awaiting a  promised apartment.  </P> <P> "How could I take a couple of pesos and end up in the street?" he asks.  </P> <P> The Copadeba group has managed to modify some demolition and change government  procedures in others. Ismaela Jimenez de Blanco fought the authorities for a  written promise of new housing before giving up her home: "They wanted me to  just accept their verbal promises, but I said they could knock down the house  on top of me first."  </P> <P> Many Dominicans say that corrupt officials accept bribes to locate families in  the new homes. The Roman Catholic archbishop of Santo Domingo, Nicolas de Jesus  Lopez Rodrigues, confirmed that the country's bureaucratic practices are  dubious. Dominican justice, he said in a February speech, is "in the hands of  drug dealers and thieves."  </P> <P> In addition, critics say, the government is building too much, too fast.  </P> <P> "They have put too much money into circulation," says former President Juan  Bosch, a candidate to replace Balaguer in next year's election. "This county  needs industrialization, not more dependence on foreign tourists." (The army  ousted Bosch in 1963. When civil war broke out two years later, U.S. military  forces intervened to impose a truce while Balaguer was put in office.)  </P> <P> The government scoffs at criticism of its plans, particularly for the  lighthouse.  </P> <P> "Every great project of human imagination has had its naysayers," declares  Technical Secretary Guillermo Caram, ticking off "the Panama Canal, the Eiffel  Tower, the Palace of Versailles." "But Versailles, for example, was later the  site of great triumphs of mankind -- the French Revolution, the 1918 armistice,  the founding of the League of Nations," he says. "Despite the criticism, the  authors of these works left their stamp on history."  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> VIDEO A 'CELEBRATION OF SEX' -- MADONNA  </P> <P> ABC's "Nightline" today aired Madonna's too-hot-for-MTV video in its steamy  entirety, and Madonna -- the picture of propriety in a buttoned-up black dress  -- defended the clip as a "celebration of sex."  </P> <P> "Why are we willing to deal with the reality of violence and sexism and why  aren't we willing to deal with sexuality?" she asked in an interview.  </P> <P> "If we're going to have censorship, let's not be hypocrites about this," the  pop singer added. "Why is it OK for 10-year-olds to see someone's body being  ripped to shreds? . . . Why do parents not have a problem with that?"  </P> <P> Her "Justify My Love" video, which was rejected by the cable music station last  week, features the bra-and-garter-belt-clad singer in an encounter with a  lover, played by her real-life boyfriend, Tony Ward, in a Paris hotel.  </P> <P> The video portrays the couple's fantasies, which run to bisexuality, voyeurism,  group sex, cross-dressing and mild sadomasochism.  </P> <P> "Half of me thought I was going to get away with it," said Madonna, speaking  via satellite from Los Angeles.  </P> <P> She said the video -- with its chains, black leather and crucifixes -- was  about "honesty . . . and the celebration of sex. There's nothing wrong with  that."  </P> <P> The video -- with some naughty bits electronically altered -- had appeared  previously on NBC's "Saturday Night Live" and on CNN. It also was shown  uncensored on The Jukebox Network, a pay-TV channel.  </P> <P> Before it was shown on "Nightline," ABC lawyers screened the video, said Laura  Wessner, a spokeswoman for the program.  </P> <P> "They determined to go ahead with it because of the news value of the video,  the late air time, and the focus of the discussion," Wessner said.  </P> <P> Interviewer Forrest Sawyer asked Madonna to address herself to feminists who  have criticized her boy-toy image.  </P> <P> "I may be dressing like the typical bimbo, whatever, but I'm in charge," she  answered. "I'm in charge of my fantasies, I put myself in these situations with  men."  </P></p>

Mikhailidhis also repeated the  government's position that the confidence-building measures do  not constitute a solution nor are they an aspect of a solution  to the Cyprus issue. That it why, he said, no arrangement  arising during implementation of the confidence-building  measures should prejudge or influence the form of solution.    Mikhailidhis made the above statement following a meeting  today in London with British Deputy Foreign Secretary David  Amory. Mikhailidhis described his meeting with the British  official as useful and constructive and added that his talks  covered not only the confidence-building measures, but also the  substance of the Cyprus issue.</p>

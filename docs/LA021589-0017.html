			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGST IN AFGHANISTAN  </P> <P> With the departure of the last Soviet combat troops from Afghanistan, the  nine-year-long war seems poised to enter a new and perhaps more violent phase.  President Najibullah's Marxistregime and defection-ridden army are coming under  intensified siege from the estimated 200,000 armed guerrillas scattered around  the Texas-size country -- 30,000 of whom already surround Kabul, the capital.  Virtually everyone believes that the regime must fall. Whether it lasts days,  weeks or months could depend on how well the resistance groups coordinate their  military activities. But even if tactical cooperation is achieved -- and the  war has seen precious little of that -- it is unlikely that an effective  coalition government will soon emerge to supplant what the Red Army left  behind.  </P> <P> Afghanistan, the world is about to reminded, remains a country riven by tribal  loyalties and ethnic jealousies. Seven major guerrilla groups have emerged from  the 3 million Afghan refugees in next-door Pakistan; other forces have come  from among the 2 million refugees who fled to neighboring Iran. A council of  resistance organizations summoned to form an interim government hasn't been  able to agree on how power should be apportioned. Muslim fundamentalists dream  of an Afghanistan reborn as an Iran-style Islamic republic, repressive and  reactionary. Many oppose the fundamentalists. They know what they are against;  the problem is that they don't always agree on what they are for.  </P> <P> President Bush says that American military aid to the resistance groups -- $2  billion worth has so far been delivered -- will go on until the Soviet Union  stops supplying Najibullah. A quick rethinking of that policy will be called  for, however, if tribal and ideological turbulence produces not a consensus for  post-Marxist unity but a renewal of civil strife. Some in Washington are  already talking in terms of an Afghanistan faced with chronic conflict, like  Ethiopia or Sudan. Some, fearing the worst, even warn about the possible  Lebanonization of the country. Already different factions are getting money,  arms and advice from Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia and perhaps other Islamic  countries. It would be naive to think these are selfless gifts.  </P> <P> This war has taken a terrible toll. Nearly one-third of Afghanistan's 16  million people have been forced to flee the country, hundreds of thousands have  died, tens of thousands have been maimed. But even if peace were somehow  miraculously to take hold, Afghans will probably continue to die of war wounds  for years to come, victims of the millions of anti-personnel mines  indiscriminately left strewn over the landscape by the Soviets. To this grim  prospect must be added the chances of high-toll internecine warfare as the  competition for power and influence deepens.  </P> <P> The Afghan resistance movement, with help from its friends, has reached a point  where its triumph seems assured. The foreign invader has been driven out, a  regime with only the barest popular support seems on the edge of being  overthrown. Now comes a new challenge, the unsettled and deeply contentious  question of how the political nature of Afghanistan's future will be decided.  </P></p>

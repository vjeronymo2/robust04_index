			<p>BFN     [Text] President Joaquim Chissano, who is visiting Cabo  Delgado Province, may be addressing a mass rally in the capital  of Palma District, 400 km from the city of Pemba. Yesterday the  head of state attended a banquet with a group of women, members  of the Mozambique Liberation Front in Pemba. In a message, the  group says that the Mozambique National Resistance and other  unarmed opposition parties have already recognized defeat in the  forthcoming October elections by calling for a government of  national unity without defining valid criteria.    On the occasion, Joaquim Chissano said the women should  educate the citizens to vote for the party and candidate  offering them prestige and representation. The head of state is  scheduled to return to Pemba tomorrow afternoon after addressing  a rally in the capital of Nangade District.</p>

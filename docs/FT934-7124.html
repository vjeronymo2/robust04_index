			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Private View: Doctor on call for science THE BICYCLING embryologist took off his clips and declared: 'Potholes are much more dangerous than genetic engineering.' Lewis Wolpert, a professor of medical biology, blames Mary Shelley ('the evil fairy godmother of science') for frightening people down to this day. 'The Frankenstein image touches something very deep in our psyche,' he said. Monday sees the start of a 'European week for scientific culture,' a programme of conferences, films, school visits, including a ballet based on the Big Bang theory of the birth of the universe. The aim is to encourage more career scientists, to stimulate popular participation in policy-making and restore science to its place in European culture. This is very much Prof Wolpert's theme, although he expresses it more energetically and provocatively than does Directorate XII of the European Commission, sponsor of next week's programme. 'Even the most intelligent of my friends worry about armies of human clones. I say: where will they go to school? Where are all the mothers going to come from? We know from the Hitler Youth that you don't have to go through cloning to get people to think along the same lines. The fears are grotesquely exaggerated.' Wolpert, a Fellow of the Royal Society, is shortly to take over chairmanship of the Committee for the Public Understanding of Science, a UK body founded apparently on the premiss that public ignorance of science is creating fear, and fear hostility. This harks back to the famous Two Cultures jeremiad delivered by CP Snow in 1959. Was there still a problem, I asked? 'Snow was putting forward the idea that for most people true culture - in the wonderful phrase of Max Perutz - is carried by the humanities while scientists have merely been the plumbers of civilisation,' Wolpert replied. Yet people were fascinated by science, he added. They were not so much hostile as ambivalent, because science was so difficult, an unnatural way of thinking (he has written a book on this theme*). Science lacked role models and suffered from media stereotyping: practitioners were portrayed as detached, boring people without spouses, children or passions. Anyway, he concluded, press and television were run by arts graduates. He thinks there has always been a gulf between scientific knowledge and public understanding, probably even in Archimedes' day. Perhaps, I suggested, mankind is not biologically adapted to contemplating the cosmic or the atomic. 'I don't think it's even that. The real difficulty is that you can live your life - I hate saying this - extremely comfortably without knowing any science whatsoever. And most people do. 'You see science is a peculiar thing. But if you want to take your part as a citizen, to take decisions about nuclear power and so forth, then you need to know.' Why do you think people still read horoscopes? 'People like a mystical idea of the world. They like magic. I don't have an explanation for that. The New Age people love the discovery of quantum mechanics and black holes. They take this hard-won hard science and they use it for mysticism. 'Look', they say, 'we always told you the universe was magical.'' I said: you can't blame them if our ultimate knowledge turns out so bizarre . . .' 'No, it's such hard, difficult mathematical stuff.' He sounded quite angry. 'Science doesn't make you feel better: it doesn't lead to an afterlife, it doesn't give you any purpose in your life. It removes magical powers like the ability to predict the future, read minds and so on. So you feel less comfortable.' You see such people as poor, lost children? 'Yes'. The professor grinned wolfishly as if he'd eaten a New Ager for breakfast. 'I do. You're wicked.' Do you want them to give up astrology? 'No. That would be an absurd view . . .' But when I pressed him he eventually admitted that was what he wanted. 'I'd rather they did the pools,' he said. Prof Wolpert is by turns dogmatic and doubtful; he thrives on controversy, loves to be provocative and is easily provoked in turn. His betes noires include disparaging journalists (he named some) and 'relativist' sociologists who regard scientific knowledge as no more than another human invention. Philosophers were good, but irrelevant. 'I'd like to see myself as a liberal,' he said. I'm terribly permissive really. On the other hand I love being politically incorrect.' He paused as a doubt surfaced. 'Although I'm totally against PC, the fact that there is a discussion about it has sensitized people to the way our society works. I would have to recognise that the sensitivity is really quite positive.' Wolpert works at University College and Middlesex School of Medicine in London. He studies the mechanism by which the fertilised egg gives rise to limbs and is best known for his account of how cells know what to do. (Like mass flagwavers in a stadium display they get the same instruction sheet telling them what to do in whatever position they occupy.) He was born in Johannesburg, to a middle-class Lithuanian Jewish family, swung to the Left but had no stomach for politics. He studied civil engineering because he was good at maths. 'I couldn't stand it. They were so boring. No, I liked them. They were very good friends. I loathed the course. All my friends in the arts were pretty girls reading DH Lawrence and there was I in the beastly room doing engineering drawings. Even on holidays I used to have to work in the sewers of the municipality.' He worked in South Africa, hitch-hiked north to Israel, and moved to London where he converted to zoology at the age of 25, taking his BA and PhD simultaneously at King's College. He has the Scientific Medal of the Zoological Society and has been a member of the Medical Research Council. Discussing the technical and moral limitations of genetic engineering, Wolpert insisted that scientists have nothing more to say about ethical dilemmas than any other citizen. It was for the scientists to advise, the public to debate, and parliaments to legislate. But as an out-and-out materialist (biologists tend to be), he looks forwards to the day when science will enable us to isolate and treat criminal tendencies, say, as readily as any disease. 'I can think of no situation in which knowledge would make things in principle worse. Because knowledge is neutral. I feel very strongly about that. This nonsense that science has some sort of value attached. Rubbish.' The molecular biologist is interested in humans as organisations of cells. Would he not always be regarded with suspicion by those who see the human being as a whole? 'I dont think you're right. It's no longer regarded as murder to turn off a life-support machine. Abortion is allowed. My materialist position has no bearing on this whatsover. As a person you have one construct of the world, as a scientist another? 'Absolutely.' And the two things should not be confused? 'Absolutely. My responsibilities as a citizen have nothing to do with my responsibilities as a scientist.' It is a familiar argument. Yet this emphasis on detachment, on privileged status for scientific inquiry may be what most worries the non-scientist. Wolpert insists that scientific knowledge is superior knowledge. When you say it is superior, what do you mean? 'It's the only way to understand the world.' But you've just said that as a citizen you have to look at it in one way, as a scientist in another. 'There is a big difference between understanding and making judgments.' I thought of the non-sciences which lay claim to understanding: economics, history, religion. Why should science be 'superior'? 'In the sense that there are no alternative explanations. And superior in that it is also probably true and can be shown to be true - or false.' Wolpert mentioned religion, and said he agreed with the sociologist Max Weber that the secularisation of the western world owes more to capitalism than to scientific knowledge. Although a hard-line materialist, he said, he easily understood why religion was so attractive. (His brother-in-law, the Australian Richard Neville of Oz trial fame in the Sixties had recently given him The Tibetan Book of the Dead.) 'Many very distinguished scientists - living and dead - are deeply religious. Now, for me, religion is not all that different from astrology. But I wouldn't want people to give up their religion.' Are you a non-believer because you are a biologist? 'I gave up religion long before I took up science.' Science and religion are contradictory but plainly can co-exist in the same mind, he said. 'I claim that is because one is natural and the other totally unnatural.' (Science, of course, is the unnatural one). Religion may be more important to people than science, then? 'No question. Because it tells them how to live their lives.' Wolpert quotes Tolstoy, who said science is meaningless because it does not answer the questions What Shall We Do? and How Shall We Be? He quotes Einstein, who said that there was no conflict between the two because 'science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind'. So to many people the knowledge they get from religion is superior? 'I agree with you. It doesn't mean to say that they're right.' But science remains a privileged kind of knowledge? 'I couldn't agree more.' Perhaps it's just this word 'superior' that you'll have to drop? Wolpert grinned. 'I don't think I'm prepared to do that.' The professor donned his red anorak, put on his clips and safety helmet and wheeled his bicycle to the lift. As he whizzed gleefully away to Mayfair to hear a lecture on gene therapy it seemed to me I had missed a dialectical trick. It was not knowledge we had been arguing about here, but wisdom. *The Unnatural Nature of Science; Faber.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Recovery continues at Frederick Cooper Frederick Cooper, the architectural hardware, metal finishing and electrical products group, continued its recovery with a 30 per cent advance in annual pre-tax profits from 'underlying operations' to Pounds 5.45m. On an FRS 3 basis the rise was greater at 53 per cent to Pounds 6.31m (Pounds 4.12m) for the year to July 31. Turnover grew to Pounds 89.1m (Pounds 84.3m). The focusing on core businesses continued with the sale of Cooper Handling in June for Pounds 1.46m. This resulted in a Pounds 896,000 exceptional profit. Mr Ed Kirk, chairman, said the surplus gave a distorted impression of group progress. Since the year-end, Futters (London), an electrical component company was sold for Pounds 3.75m. Three businesses in the electrical products division remained, generating only Pounds 7m of turnover. He expected to dispose of at least one within the next 12 months. In spite of the profits rise and a 3 per cent increase in first-quarter sales in the current year, Mr Kirk remained cautious on prospects. He said the UK economy remained fragile and the architectural products side, which makes locks and other door and window fittings, catered for the 'back end of the construction market'. Also, in the past 12 months the price of aluminium had risen 30 per cent; steel had risen 6 per cent since the start of the year and would rise another 6 per cent in January; and European polymer prices had risen 10 per cent. Cooper was now also sourcing from Brazil and altering its plastic compounds 'mix' to help circumvent this. In the architectural hardware division, profits jumped to Pounds 1.56m (Pounds 570,000) on turnover up slightly at Pounds 50.1m (Pounds 49.6m). In metal finishing, profits were Pounds 3.13m (Pounds 2.8m) on turnover of Pounds 24.4m (Pounds 20m). Organic growth for the group would come in the US metal finishing side, said Mr Kirk, with any acquisitions also in that area. At the year-end borrowings were Pounds 7m; they were now less than Pounds 5m and by July 1995 were expected to be about Pounds 2.5m. Basic earnings on underlying operations were 6p (3.5p) and under FRS 3 8.2p (3.4p). The final dividend is lifted to 1.7p (1.5p) for a total of 2.5p (2.2p).</p>

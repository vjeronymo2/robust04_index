			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: Lufthansa wakes up to global game / Examining the German airline's bid for Continental LUFTHANSA, one of the sleeping giants of the aviation industry, has finally decided to join in the world airline game of monopoly with a Dollars 400m proposal to acquire Continental Airlines of the US in partnership with Mr Marvin Davis, the Californian financier. The move comes barely a fortnight after the German national carrier, the world's fifth-largest in terms of revenue, unveiled a restructuring programme to cut operating losses which are expected to rise to DM1.2bn (Dollars 807m) this year from DM800m in 1991. On the surface, the bid may look odd from an airline which has traditionally shunned buying stakes in other airlines, preferring to negotiate commercial and marketing agreements to strengthen its international network. It is all the more surprising since Lufthansa is in the throes of scaling back some operations, delaying delivery of new aircraft into its fleet and planning to cut 6 000 jobs over the next two years. But the carrier clearly felt it could no longer sit on the sidelines and watch its main competitors on both sides of the Atlantic jostling for position in an increasingly global airline market. The big three US carriers - American, United and Delta - have all been aggressively expanding their European operations. For Lufthansa, the biggest threat has come from Atlanta-based Delta, which last year acquired the European routes and Frankfurt hub of the now defunct Pan Am. The German carrier has also bitterly complained that the current bilateral aviation agreement between Germany and the US is heavily unbalanced in favour of US carriers. Mr Jurgen Weber, Lufthansa's chairman, has campaigned vigorously to persuade his government to renegotiate the agreement with the US. But the threat has not only come from the American side. BA, which Mr Weber views as his principal European competitor, is seeking to strengthen its position in the US market with its proposed Dollars 750m investment in USAir while challenging Lufthansa in the German market through its Deutsche BA German airline venture. Dutch carrier KLM, another big Lufthansa competitor, has been strengthening its ties with Northwest Airlines of the US. The 'open skies' agreement reached last week between the Netherlands and the US is also expected to give KLM an additional boost. However, while seeking to put his house in order at home, Mr Weber has started looking more aggressively at forging alliances and buying stakes in other carriers to secure his group's long-term future. This summer, Lufthansa's Condor unit took a 26.5 per cent stake in Lauda Air, the Austrian carrier founded by Nikki Lauda, the former world motor racing champion. Mr Weber has also been considering a joint airline venture in Moscow which would challenge directly BA's plans to set up an international airline with Aeroflot called Air Russia. Lufthansa is also considering acquiring a stake in Malev, the Hungarian airline. Now comes the bid for Continental. Of all the US airline bankruptcies, Continental's has probably been the most complex and, in many respects, the most interesting. The end-game now under way looks to be no different. When Continental filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code in late 1990, it was clear that the airline comprised a mixed bag of corporate possibilities and drawbacks. On the plus side, Continental operated a fairly attractive network, especially in terms of its Far Eastern route authorities. It also possessed a low operating-cost structure - a hangover from the days when Mr Frank Lorenzo, notorious for his union-busting strategies, ran and owned the airline. On the minus side, Continental was burdened by enormous debts - another Lorenzo bequest and the proximate cause of the bankruptcy filing. These amounted to Dollars 2.2bn of on-balance sheet borrowings, and approximately Dollars 4bn-worth of off-balance sheet aircraft operating leases. A second drawback was the extent to which Continental's fate was intertwined with that of Eastern Airlines, another ailing carrier formerly run by Mr Lorenzo which grounded its fleet in early 1991. Finally, Continental's reputation among the public was poor. Periodically over the next 18 months, Continental held talks with a variety of interested suitors and investors. These ranged from Northwest Airlines to the bankrupt Trans World Airlines and even British Airways. However, it is only over the past six months that progress has finally become evident. In February, Continental filed a reorganisation plan which essentially proposed slashing long-term debt from about Dollars 5.8bn to Dollars 1.7bn, and passing equity ownership of the reorganised company to unsecured creditors. With its reorganisation scheme starting to take shape, interested investors began to supply more serious bids. The first came in July - from an investor group headed by Charles Hurwitz, a Texas-based businessman. This was accepted by Continental and, technically, has preliminary approval from the bankruptcy court. However, the Hurwitz offer was quickly followed by a proposal from Mr Alfredo Brener, whose family owns a sizeable stake in Mexicana Airlines. Last month, Air Canada - in conjunction with another Texan investment group - joined the party. Then, this week, the Lufthansa/Marvin Davis proposal arrived. All four proposals are somewhat similar in design. The investors would put up cash in return for a majority equity stake in the carrier once it emerged from bankruptcy, with creditors being offered a minority interest. This would be done in conjunction with the airline's reorganisation plan. The investors would also receive loan notes, backed by Continental assets, which they would probably sell on to other investors. The total face value of these packages has steadily risen from Dollars 350m to Dollars 400m. But the story is unlikely to end here. Continental's board has a fiduciary duty to examine all offers and pick the best. There is increasing pressure from the bankruptcy judge, Ms Helen Balick, to move matters along, but no date has even been set for the airline to deliver its preferred solution to the court. In fact, technically, a new offer could be delivered up until five days before Continental's reorganisation plan is confirmed.</p>

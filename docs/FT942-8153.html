			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: How to grill your adviser You know a financial product is moving in deep waters when even City regulators believe investors need advice about how to talk to their financial advisers. That is what happened this week with personal pensions sold to people leaving a present or former employer's pension scheme. The Securities and Investments Board (SIB), the chief regulator, has published two fact sheets intended to help consumers make well-informed decisions about whether it is in their interests to take out a personal pension in those circumstances. One deals with pension transfers - where someone moves a lump sum from a pension scheme - and the other covers opt-outs where people choose not to join or decide to leave occupational schemes for which they are eligible. The lists should be available by the end of the month from public libraries, citizens advice bureaux and (SIB hopes) through other organisations such as the Trades Union Congress and occupational pension schemes. SIB chairman Andrew Large stressed that a personal pension could be the right decision for many people, but the leaflets themselves point to many possible pitfalls while making it clear that they are not DIY pension kits. Each fact sheet has, as its front page, a flow diagram which begins by asking whether you are, or ever have been, a member of an employer's pension scheme. After further 'yes or no' questions, it reaches one of the following conclusions: that you should consult a financial adviser about your pension arrangements; that you should read the fact sheet on transfers; that you should read the fact sheet on opt-outs; or that you are safely in an occupational scheme and do not need either fact sheet. Both leaflets follow similar patterns in advising people what issues they should consider. In particular, these include knowing enough about their employers' scheme to be aware what they would be giving up by transferring or opting out. They then offer a list of questions intended to make sure that the adviser - whether an IFA or a sales agent linked to a single company - and the investor have raised all the relevant issues. For transfers, these are: Have your personal circumstances - including your attitude to risk - been discussed in detail? Has your adviser discussed benefits such as early retirement which you might lose through leaving the scheme? Have you discussed the decision with your spouse or partner? Have you had all the options explained to you? Has your adviser explained the differences between occupational schemes based on final salary and a personal pension? Do you realise that taking a personal pension means taking an investment risk; and that the pension you receive will depend on annuity rates, which reflect interest rates? For opt-outs, the questions cover some of the same ground, but also warn you not to take out a personal pension unless you can pay the contributions for a number of years. Both leaflets point out that good reasons are needed to take out a pension transfer, and that very good reasons are needed to opt out of an employers' scheme. They urge investors to get their advisers to explain in writing why the decision makes financial sense. Investors also should ask about charges and commission, since these will affect the pension available on retirement, and should shop around to try to make sure they get good service. Individual copies of the leaflets are available free by sending a 9in by 7in stamped, addressed envelope to the Securities and Investments Board, Gavrelle House, 2-14 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8RA.</p>

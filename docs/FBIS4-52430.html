			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Justice Is Sure To Win" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- The great victory of the  people of the former Soviet Union in the patriotic war (May 9,  1945) was a demonstration of the superiority of the socialist  system to the capitalist system and its invincible might, says  NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article today.    The article says:    By defeating fascist Germany in the past patriotic war, the  people and Army of the former Soviet Union defended the  socialist state, the first of its kind in the world, relieved  peoples of many countries from the danger of fascist enslavement  and greatly contributed to the human cause of liberation.    After the downfall of international fascism with the end of  the Second World War, the popular masses, who had been the  objects of history in the past, have now become the driving  forces of history, shouldering the cause of independence.    But, the old forces of imperialism still remain and they are  seeking the ambition for domination over the world as ever.    They are economically blockading and strangling and  militarily threatening and crushing the countries that are going  against them, while fostering national and regional  contradictions, confrontations and division in different areas  of the world.    The facts show that the aggressive nature of imperialism has  never been changed and cannot be changed.    The obtaining situation requires the people the world over  to  unite for an active struggle against imperialism under the  banner of anti-imperialist independence.    Only when the people of the world vigorously conduct the  peace- defending movement against imperialism and war, will  imperialism and dominationism become impotent and the people's  cause of independence and socialism advance.</p>

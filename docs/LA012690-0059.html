			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> STATE SENATE PASSES ETHICS REFORMS  </P> <P> The state Senate unanimously passed a legislative ethics reform package,  including a ban on honorariums and gifts valued at more than $250 from special  interests and strengthening of prohibitions against conflict of interest. The  proposal is linked to voter enactment in June of a separate ballot proposition  approved by the Legislature last year that would create a new state agency to  set lawmaker salaries. The package sailed out of the Senate to the Assembly,  which is expected to act next week on a similar ethics program.  </P></p>

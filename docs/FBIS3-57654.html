This was reported on 26 January at the collegium of  the State Committee on the Defense Industry by committee  chairman Viktor Glukhikh. Export, according to him, should  become one of the main sources of funds for the upkeep of the  military production and research facilities because the  purchases of armaments and military hardware, as well as budget  appropriations for Russia's Defense Ministry, have been sharply  curtailed. To be successful on the foreign market it is  necessary to create a new system of organization of foreign  economic activity by Defense Ministry enterprises. With this in  mind, the State Committee on the Defense Industry has drawn up a  draft law on Russia's military-technological cooperation with  other countries, and a draft government decree granting to  enterprises independence in foreign economic activities. Viktor  Glukhikh thinks that the main role in the weapons market should  belong to the developer and producer.</p>

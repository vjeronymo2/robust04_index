			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Abbey National It seems the market is never satisfied. Having registered alarm at the prospect of industrial companies cutting or even passing their dividends, it ought to be delighted by the rare spectacle of a bank whose dividend is covered three times. Instead, yesterday's results presented an opportunity to lop 4 per cent off the value of Abbey National. Investors are right, however, to pause for thought over Abbey's dependency on treasury business. Without the Pounds 60m increase from this quarter, pre-tax profits would actually have fallen by 4 per cent. Management's extreme risk aversion should mean there is no particular danger inherent in this activity, but the sudden prominence of low-margin treasury income does underline the weakness of Abbey's core operations in the retail sphere. Growth is hampered on several fronts despite Abbey's remarkable ability to force down deposit rates faster than lending charges. The housing market is not out yet out of the woods; costs are rising as the heavy spend on branch development continues and it will be next year before its new insurance venture starts to pay off. All this leaves Abbey flawed as a recovery stock, especially since it has fewer provisions to unwind than the other clearing banks when the economic climate finally improves. But at its current level it is not attractive in yield terms either, despite the prospect of a real increase in the dividend this year. Abbey's historic yield of 4.8 per cent compares with 5.2 per cent from Lloyds. The shares may have a little further to fall before they again find favour even with investors to whom the bank's safe but unexciting image appeals.</p>

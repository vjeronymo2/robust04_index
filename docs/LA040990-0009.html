			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS RUN, ANGELS STUMBLE INTO OPENERS  </P> <P> The important thing, as any baseball fan will tell you, is that today both  teams are 0-0.  </P> <P> Their exhibition records have been rendered meaningless. Spring training is  officially finished, if not forgotten.  </P> <P> But cliches are one thing and appearances are another. And it was hard not to  notice Sunday at Dodger Stadium that the Dodgers and Angels are entering 1990s  opening day at vastly different gaits.  </P> <P> The Dodgers, who defeated the Angels, 4-2, to sweep the three-game Freeway  Series for the fourth time in 21 years, are sprinting. They won six of their  last seven exhibition games. Their rebuilt offense scored fewer than four runs  just twice in the 12-game spring season, during which they finished 8-4.  </P> <P> And for a bunch of old guys, they are fairly healthy. With the exception of  Kirk Gibson, their opening day lineup against the San Diego Padres at Dodger  Stadium at 1:35 p.m. today is just as they envisioned it last January.  </P> <P> This includes Kal Daniels playing left field, and starter Orel Hershiser  showing scant effects of the shortened spring training. Hershiser threw 80  pitches in his last workout Thursday and could translate that into as many as  eight innings today.  </P> <P> "We are already having fun again," said catcher Rick Dempsey, whose bloop  double and two RBIs Sunday led the Dodgers. "We feel like we're jelling just in  time. We're getting all that old enthusiasm back."  </P> <P> The Angels are stumbling, having lost their last seven exhibition games. On  Sunday it was announced they had lost their starting third baseman for at least  a couple of days. Jack Howell's sprained left ankle will not be ready for  tonight's 6 game in Anaheim against Seattle.  </P> <P> With shortstop Dick Schofield already on the disabled list, the left side of  the infield likely will feature backups Mark McLemore and Donnie Hill. And  Chili Davis' groin soreness could keep him out of the starting lineup. None of  this would be so bad if the Angel pitchers hadn't accumulated a spring earned  run average of 6.28.  </P> <P> Not that Manager Doug Rader is the least bit worried.  </P> <P> "What have we lost?" Rader responded when asked about the spring losing streak.  "We've lost seven exhibition games. The games start tomorrow . . . I don't see  anything wrong with the effort or competitiveness of our ballclub."  </P> <P> The Angels competed well Sunday until three Dodger doubles in a four-batter  stretch in the fourth inning against starter and loser Jim Abbott broke a 1-1  tie. Jeff Hamilton doubled to left field, Mike Scioscia doubled to right to  score him and -- one out later -- Dempsey blooped a double down the left field  line, dropping it between Wally Joyner, Kent Anderson and Claudell Washington.  </P> <P> It was more than enough runs for Dodger starter Ramon Martinez, who was let off  the hook by an Angel offense that couldn't capitalize on five walks in four  innings. Kirk McCaskill was given three innings of work, and, of the Angels'  six hits against five Dodger pitchers, one was by him.  </P> <P> "All I'm going to say is that competing against the pitching staffs of the  Padres and Dodgers, I can understand our lack of offense," Rader said,  referring to earlier spring losses to San Diego.  </P> <P> The biggest Dodger worry appears to be the health of reliever Jay Howell, who  this weekend reported shoulder stiffness after throwing four scoreless innings  with four strikeouts in Florida. Howell threw on the side Sunday, and the  Dodgers will know more about his availability this morning.  </P> <P> If Howell cannot go for a couple of days, Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda will have  extra right-handed relievers Don Aase and Mike Hartley at his disposal, due to  the 27-man expanded rosters.  </P> <P> Lasorda is already at midseason form, setting a pair of Angel pitcher Bert  Blyleven's shoes on fire in front of the dugout after the sixth inning Sunday.  It was revenge for the pie Blyleven shoved in Lasorda's face Friday while the  Dodger manager was doing a television interview.  </P> <P> "Right now, our enthusiasm and teamwork seems great, even better than going  into last season," Mickey Hatcher observed about the Dodgers. "Of course, you  never know. But we can't wait."  </P> <P> Angel-Dodger Notes  </P> <P> As expected, Mike Morgan will begin the season in the starting rotation. Dodger  pitching coach Ron Perranoski confirmed Sunday that Morgan would start Friday  in Houston, and John Wetteland would begin the season in the bullpen. That, of  course, could change in a couple of weeks. "Both guys are capable, but Mike is  a little more experienced. He had the great first half last year, and we felt  we would go with that," Perranoski said. "But John is an important member of  the staff, and you never know what happens down the road."  </P> <P> Mike Hartley became the final Dodger to learn he made the team Sunday, but in a  most unusual way. After spending a sleepless Saturday night worrying about his  status, he walked up to pitching coach Perranoski and volunteered to pitch in  the Freeway Series finale. "He told me I wouldn't be pitching today, because  they needed me ready for Monday," Hartley said. "I said, 'Does this mean I made  the team?' He said, 'You don't know?' Then they called me in and talked to me  about it." Hartley is one of four players filling expanded roster spots --  three spots due to the spring-training lockout and one vacated by disabled  pitcher Jim Gott. The three other fill-ins are pitchers Don Aase and Mike Munoz  and outfielder John Shelby. Munoz and Aase were two of the Dodgers with former  big-league experience who have had a full six weeks of spring training during  the lockout because the Dodgers, unlike other big league teams, allowed their  non-roster former big leaguers to work with the minor leaguers at the annual  mini-camp. "As it turns out, that was a blessing for me," Munoz said.  </P> <P> The Dodger opening day batting order against San Diego's left-handed starter  Bruce Hurst: Juan Samuel, Willie Randolph, Hubie Brooks, Eddie Murray, Kal  Daniels, Jeff Hamilton, Mike Scioscia, Alfredo Griffin, Orel Hershiser. Look  for the left-handed hitting Daniels to bat third against right-handers, with  Brooks moving behind Murray . . . Angel pitcher Bob McClure, suffering from an  inflamed left elbow, has shown some improvement but might be placed on the  disabled list pending an examination today . . . Catcher Bill Schroeder, who  was placed on the 15-day disabled Saturday, has an inflamed right elbow, the  same elbow which was surgically repaired last September. Rookie John Orton will  take his place on the opening day roster.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SDSU SOCCER GOALIE BREAKS SCHOOL SHUTOUT RECORD IN  5-0 AZTEC VICTORY  </P> <P> * Goalie Brian Finnerty broke San Diego State's all-time soccer shutout record  in Sunday's 5-0 victory at Cal State Dominguez Hills. Finnerty, with 22.5  shutouts, moved past Mark Stepovich, who had 21.5.  </P> <P> The game was a scoreless tie at halftime, but the Aztecs (10-3-1) broke loose  with goals by Eric Wynalda (two), Brian Craft-Negrete (two) and Andy Morroney.  </P> <P> * The University of San Diego entered the top 20 for the first time in its  history last Monday but has since lost two in a row, the latest s 2-1 loss to  Washington in Portland, Ore.  </P> <P> Vince Bianchi put the Toreros (11-4, No. 18) in front some 16 minutes into the  game, but Washington scored 10 minutes later and again late in the second half  to pull it out.  </P> <P> * U.S. International went into overtime with Denver in Colorado before dropping  its 13th game of the year, 3-1. The Gulls (2-13) got their lone score from Mark  Giacimto.  </P> <P> VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> USIU, playing at the Jewish Community Center in La Jolla, took Virginia to five  games before falling, 15-5, 15-11, 6-15, 13-15, 15-6. April Devine led USIU  (3-11) with 15 kills.  </P> <P> SURFING  </P> <P> Mike Lambresi of Oceanside took second in the U.S. surfing championships in San  Francisco, the last stop on an 11-city tour, and in so doing edged Dino Andino  by 19 points to win the tour's overall championship.  </P> <P> Andino, who did not make it out of Saturday's qualifying rounds, went into the  event with what appeared to be an insurmountable lead.  </P> <P> Lambresi needed almost all of the 1,800 second-place points to unseat Andino  and claim his third title as many years. Lambresi finished with 7,583 points to  Andino's 7,564.  </P> <P> WOMEN'S SOCCER  </P> <P> UC San Diego goalie Julie Friess came up with 10 saves against Cal State  Dominguez Hills -- she entered the game with just eight on the season -- but  nevertheless lost her record shutout streak of 11 games as Laura Johnson scored  in the 34th minute for a 1-0 victory.  </P> <P> UCSD, which suffered its first loss after 11 victories, came in ranked second  in Division III. Dominguez Hills (15-1) was ranked second in Division II.  </P> <P> * U.S. International fell to 5-10 with a 2-0 loss to host San Francisco.  </P></p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Aluminium touches 40-month highs - Market report Late profit-taking kept London Metal Exchange ALUMINIUM prices from building on an early move to 40-month highs, although the market still closed firmer and looked set for fresh advances, dealers said. The three months price closed reached Dollars 1,549 a tonne, but closed at Dollars 1,540.50 a tonne, up just Dollars 1. Buyers had been encouraged early on by the International Primary Aluminium Institute's announcement that stocks held in member countries fell by 64,000 tonnes in May; and a further fall in LME warehouse stocks is expected today. Looming supply tightness from September onwards was also underpinning the market. At the London bullion market the GOLD price profited from the continued weakness of the US dollar, ending Dollars 2.60 higher at Dollars 386 a troy ounce. The London Commodity Exchange COCOA market, although operating in the shadow of the extraordinary rise in coffee futures (see story above), itself posted quite respectable gains. The September futures position closed at Dollars 1,049 a tonne, adding Dollars 33 to Friday's Dollars 22 rally, as market sentiment improved. This was helped, some traders suggested, by 'sympathetic buying' linked to coffee's surge. Compiled from Reuters</p>

Yi Su-ik as director of the Defense  Logistics Agency (DLA) effective Saturday in connection with its  investigation of a scandal involving false purchases of  artillery ammunition. The Ministry immediately named Maj. Gen.  Yim Sam, Chief of Staff of the ROK Army Logistic Command, to  replace Yi.    The joint military and civilian prosecution team  investigating the fraud announced Friday that it was perpetrated  by French arms dealer Jean-Rene Fuan and a Korean intermediary,  Chu Kwang-yong.    Fuan, 53, and Chu, 52, who fled the country shortly before  the start of the investigation, defrauded the Defense Ministry  of 5.3 billion won using forged documents, the prosecution team  said.    In a related development, the Ministry said that it will  form  a committee for reform of the defense system between Jan. 10 and  Feb. 28.    The committee, to be chaired by Superintendent of the Korea  Military Academy Chang Song, will be divided into two  subcommittees with one investigating the Yulgok military buildup  project and the other probing military supplies.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Supply and Trade warns all wholesale  and retail dealers in the Republic of Yemen about the need to  comply fully with the prices for all commodities that prevailed  before the emergency was declared in the country. Anyone  breaching this warning will be find, have his trade registration  confiscated, and his shop closed. He will also be subject to  direct imprisonment.    The ministry will launch a supply monitoring campaign to  control commodity prices. A team from the Ministry of Supply  and Trade, the Interior Ministry, and the capital's municipality  will take part in the campaign. The ministry's Aden branch and  the supply offices in the republic's governorates should also  form committees from the offices, the ministry's monitors, and  the governorate's security operations for this purpose.    We hope everyone will comply and cooperate. It is God who  grants success.</p>

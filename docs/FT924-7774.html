			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Bankers foresee Germany at centre of new grouping THE 'fast-track reformers' of central Europe, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, have been much more successful than expected in reorganising their economies along western market lines. They should be seen as prime candidates for inclusion in a new 'core Europe' centred on Germany, according to this year's Global Strategy Survey by Morgan Stanley, the US-based investment bankers. The development of such a grouping, including the Benelux countries, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden - but only 'possibly' France and Ireland - would signify that the Maastricht integration process is dead, and would 'strain to the breaking point' the Franco-German axis which was the basis of postwar west European integration, according to Mr David Roche, the bank's senior analyst. Germany's fate is closely linked to the issue of central Europe's integration into the disciplined, hard-currency European core region. 'If the process works Germany will be the regional headquarters of a vast area of economic dynamism and prosperity.' But if the economics of integration fail, Germany will relapse into 'a dark, gloomy and troubled giant,' the report warns. A new Europe is about to be forged which, unlike the doomed Maastricht process, takes into account the realities created by the collapse of Soviet power. Some EC members - such as the UK, Italy, Spain and possibly France - will circulate on the periphery of the D-Mark-dominated core. Some non-EC members like Austria and Switzerland will be part of the core while some of the new core candidates, like the three central European states are not even members of the EC and have been considered until now as economically weak. What has changed the bank's perspective is the speed with which the 'fast-track' central Europeans have re-orientated their trade to EC markets, especially Germany, reduced inflation and managed to run substantial current account surpluses in spite of the collapse in Comecon trade. The secret of their success lies in the acceptance of a substantial cut in living standards by many of their 69m citizens, and a sharp rise in savings in spite of wage rates less than 10 per cent of the German level. 'Workers in these countries receive in a month what the average skilled German worker receives in five hours. Little wonder that Mercedes Benz has indefinitely postponed its planned DM1bn truck plant in eastern Germany. German companies will increasingly shift their manufacturing investment eastward, and German unemployment could rise to 4m during the difficult adjustment to a more service-orientated, post-industrial society,' Mr Roche predicted.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Carlos Menem has agreed to pay an  extensive visit to the PRC, as he had to cut his last visit to  that country short after a couple of days due to domestic  problems. The date for this state visit has not yet been  established. Menem extended this promise to PRC Deputy Foreign  Minister Liu Huaqiu during a meeting they had yesterday on the  occasion of the latter's visit to Argentina.    According to the Foreign Ministry's tentative program, Menem  will travel to the PRC this year as part of a tour that would  also include the ROK. Sources close to the Foreign Ministry  told CLARIN that a final confirmation of this trip is still  pending.    Liu, a career diplomat specialized in Latin American  affairs,  was accompanied to the meeting with Menem by PRC Ambassador to  Argentina Tang Yonggui and Argentine Deputy Foreign Minister  Fernando Petrella, among other officials.</p>

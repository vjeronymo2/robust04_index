			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: BES deals sprout - Take advice before you invest DEALS concerning arranged-exit business expansion scheme continue to mushroom amid a proliferation of trading company issues. PAYE investors should note when BES 3 tax relief certificates will be sent out. If these are sent much beyond mid-February next year, there is unlikely to be enough time to get a tax coding change which may result in a lower projected return. The following are the latest releases - but there are many good schemes still available, so it is well worth taking advice before making an investment. Sponsors Close Brothers and Save &amp; Prosper have launched a second issue of BESSA Oxbridge after the first issue was fully subscribed at Pounds 41m. There are two choices. The fixed exit price is 121p, equivalent to a return of 13.5 per cent for higher rate taxpayers. Alternatively investors can opt for a fixed return of 60p plus 2.5p for every 1 per cent increase in the FT-SE 100 index, capped at a 36 per cent increase. There are lock-ins at increases of 24 per cent and 36 per cent. Both options are fully cash backed. The minimum investment is Pounds 2,000. The Tweed Premier Return Companies is sponsored by the British Linen bank with a Bank of Scotland guarantee to pay a fixed return of 122p after five years for every Pounds 1 invested. The company will buy residential properties from the Bank of Scotland for assured tenancy lets. The scheme is recommended by BES analysts, Allenbridge Group which are publishers of Best BES investment, and by BESt Investment for its low risk and good return. Since BES 3 certificates will not be available until the end of April, returns will be higher for Schedule D taxpayers than for those on PAYE, according to BESt Investment . The Cavendish CHG Scheme sponsored by Smith &amp; Williamson offers a cash-backed fixed return of 121p. The company will buy up residential properties from Community Hospitals plc, a quoted company, which will form part of CH's nursing home expansion. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000. BESt Investment says the relatively high minimum subscription of Pounds 1.6m raises the risk of the scheme. Image III sponsored by IM Group, which specialises in property and car distribution, is offering a fixed return of 123p after five years for every Pounds 1 invested, equating to 14.5 per cent for a higher-rate taxpayer. The return assumes that the investor paid 99p a share before December 10. IM Group is providing the cash backing but, according to BESt Investment, 'unlike previous IMAGE issues, there is no Bank of America guarantee and there are accordingly better returns available elsewhere.' Queens College Tenancies and Capital Reversions are both sponsored by Capital Ventures. The first is to raise money for the Cambridge College. Investors are being offered 75p after five years plus 2.1p for every 1 per cent increase in the FT-SE 100 with a lock-in at 25 per cent growth in the index. Capital Reversions is a residential property investment which is already trading. The size of returns on this and other commercial property ventures depend on the degree to which the property market recovers in five years time. The London Opportunity Fund has been buying up undervalued properties in the London area for letting as assured tenancies. It is seeking to raise up to Pounds 4.8m and costs have been contained to 3.5 per cent of the amount raised if the maximum is reached. BESt Investment describes it as 'a lower cost offering with reasonable dilution.' Raptor will buy up unmodernised London properties for refurbishment and letting as assured tenancies. Best BES Investment says this is a low cost issue but in a market which offers lots of choice. Trading ventures include Bloomsbury Films which aims to produce 'commercially viable films structured to return monies to investors before cast and crew are paid their deferred fees.' Bruce Sherman, the chairman, was producer of Henry V and the directors include Christopher Parkinson of city law firm Gouldens, which has raised BES money for Leon the Pig Farmer and Staggered. Johnson Fry is sponsoring Criterion Productions to raise up to Pounds 750,000 to stage productions usually at the Criterion theatre in London's Piccadilly Circus. Another famous West End name, the L'Escargot restaurant in Greek street is launching a BES comprising two companies, one of which aims to raise money to expand the existing restaurant and to open a second L'Escargot in Kensington or Chelsea, while the other company seeks to acquire flats to rent to restaurant employees.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The first activity prohibited is exploring for, developing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or producing oil, gas or minerals within the Sanctuary. With  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regard to oil and gas, this regulation implements the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of Section 2207 of the Oceans Act of 1992 which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibits ``oil or gas leasing or pre-leasing activity [from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being] conducted within the area designated as the Olympic Coast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Marine Sanctuary *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The resources and qualities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the coastal and offshore waters of the Olympic Peninsula,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly the sea birds and pinnipeds that use the haul-out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sites, kelp forests and rocks along the Olympic Coast, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high water quality of the area, are especially vulnerable to oil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and gas activities in the area. A prohibition on oil and gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exploration, development and production activities within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sanctuary boundary partially protects Sanctuary resources and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualities from oil and gas activities. Only partial protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be provided due to the remaining threat from oil and gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from vessel traffic transiting through and near the Sanctuary,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly oil tankers not operating in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> voluntary agreement of the Western States Petroleum Association  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to remain 50 nautical miles from shore. A prohibition on mineral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities within the Sanctuary is consistent with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibition on alteration of or construction on the seabed as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed below. ``Mineral'' is defined to mean clay, stone, sand,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gravel, metalliferous ore, nonmetalliferous ore, or any other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solid material or other solid matter of commercial value. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibition on oil, gas and mineral activities additionally will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent the negative effects of physical and possible chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disturbances associated with extraction activities, e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction of benthic biota; resuspension of fine sediments;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interference with filtering, feeding and respiratory functions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marine organisms; loss of food sources and habitats; and lowered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> photosynthesis and oxygen levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second activity prohibited is depositing or discharging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from within the boundary of the Sanctuary any material or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matter except:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Fish, fish parts, chumming materials or bait  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in or resulting from traditional fishing operations in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sanctuary;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Biodegradable effluent incidental to vessel use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and generated by marine sanitation devices approved in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with Section 312 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended (FWPCA), 33 U.S.C. 1322  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Water generated by routine vessel operations (e.g., cooling water, deck wash down and graywater as defined by Section 312 of the FWPCA) excluding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oily-wastes from bilge pumping;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Engine exhaust; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Dredge spoil in connection with beach nourishment projects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related to harbor maintenance activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This prohibition is necessary to protect Sanctuary resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and qualities from the effects of pollutants deposited or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharged into the Sanctuary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After expiration of current permits, discharges from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> municipal treatment plants will be subject to the review process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of &sect;925.11. At a minimum, secondary treatment will be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Depending on the risk to Sanctuary resources and qualities,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater treatment may be required. The intent of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibition is to protect Sanctuary resources and qualities from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the effects of land and sea originating pollutants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third activity prohibited is depositing or discharging,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from beyond the boundary of the Sanctuary, any material or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matter that subsequently enters the Sanctuary and injures a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sanctuary resource or quality, except for the five exclusions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed above for the second prohibited activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fourth activity prohibited is moving, removing or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injuring or attempting to move, remove or injure a Sanctuary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> historical resource. Historical resources in the marine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment are fragile, finite and non-renewable. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibition is designed to protect these resources so that they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be researched and information about their contents and type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made available for the benefit of the public. This prohibition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not apply to moving, removing or injury resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incidentally from traditional fishing operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Historical resources located within the Sanctuary that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of significance to an Indian tribe(s) (e.g., submerged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indian villages) will be managed so as to protect other Sanctuary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources and the interests of the governing body of an Indian  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tribe(s) in such historical resources. If an Indian tribe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines that a historical resource of tribal significance may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be researched, excavated or salvaged, the Sanctuary manager may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue a Sanctuary permit if the criteria for issuance have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> met (See &sect;925.9). Removal or attempted removal of any Indian  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cultural resource or artifact may only occur with the express  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written consent of the governing body of the tribe or tribes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which such resource or artifact pertains.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

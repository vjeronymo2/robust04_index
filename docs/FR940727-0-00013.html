			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.02 per hundredweight, the same as last season. This rate, when applied to anticipated potato shipments of 1,476,750 hundredweight, will yield $29,535 in assessment income, which is adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the reserve at the beginning of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period, estimated at $31,113, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of two fiscal periods' expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Colorado, both a State and a Federal marketing order operate simultaneously. The State order authorizes promotion, including paid advertising, which the Federal order does not. All expenses in this category are financed under the State order. The jointly operated programs consume about equal administrative time and the two orders continue to split administrative costs equally. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Southeastern Potato Committee met April 20, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994&hyph;95 budget of $11,000, the same as last year. Major expense items include $6,800 for Committee staff salaries and $900 for travel expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee also recommended an assessment rate of $0.0075 per hundredweight, $0.0025 less than last season's rate. When the Committee met, planting for the 1994&hyph;95 crop season had not been completed. However, the manager estimated shipments would generate about $7,000 in assessment income. This, along with funds from the Committee's $15,000 reserve, will be adequate to cover the expenses incurred. Funds remaining at the end of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period should be about the maximum permitted by the order of approximately one fiscal period's expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interim final rules were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 26, 1994, for 7 CFR part 948 (59 FR 27223) and 7 CFR part 953 (59 FR 27222). Those rules added &sect;948.211 and &sect;953.251 which authorized expenses, and established assessment rates for the Committees. Those rules provided that interested persons could file comments through June 27, 1994. No comments were received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived by the operation of the marketing orders. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing orders covered in this rulemaking are reasonable and likely to be incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rates to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (5 U.S.C. 553) because the Committees need to have sufficient funds to pay their expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis. The 1994&hyph;95 fiscal periods for the programs began on June 1, 1994, for Southeastern potatoes and July 1, 1994, for Colorado Area III potatoes. The marketing orders require that the rates of assessment for the fiscal periods apply to all assessable potatoes handled during the fiscal periods. In addition, handlers are aware of these actions which were recommended by the Committees at public meetings and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as interim final rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Parts 948 and 953 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Marketing agreements, Potatoes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR parts 948 and 953 are amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

"Despite this ultimatum, the Serb artillery will not move an  inch," said their main spokesman, Miroslav Toholj. "We are ready  to retaliate."    He called the NATO threat to hit Serb positions with air  strikes if the artillery is not pulled back within 10 days as "a  terrorist threat" and said the Serbs would respond "by all  means" to any attack.</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Country Notes: Walks with stray dogs and roe deer: WHILE THERE are several good reasons I do not have a dog, from time to time a passing pooch will try to rectify this by adopting me. Pleasant though this can be, there have been times when the consequences have been embarrassing. On one occasion, a farm dog left his post to accompany me on a walk to the beach, losing interest only when he discovered a family picnicking. He leapt with enthusiasm into the middle of their carefully-laid meal. As they drove the animal away and I fled, I could hear loud and angry protests to the effect that owners who could not control their charges should not be allowed to keep dogs. Sometimes, though, the results have been more positive. When a perky little terrier joined me for a walk one June, I welcomed his cheerful presence as he ferreted through the undergrowth and returned to me, grinning, from time to time. We climbed through a local wood and into an area of scrubby gorse, where he disappeared. A couple of minutes later, there was a commotion accompanied by frantic barks. I was about to creep away when the dog emerged, pursued by a determined female roe deer. I helped her to drive away the dog but she hung around, peeping out from behind various bushes. After searching for a few moments, I discovered why: a tiny, spotted kid, still too young to forage, lying motionless but unharmed at the base of a gorse clump. The roe is a surprisingly small deer and, with its glossy chestnut summer coat, can often resemble a red setter at a distance. Certainly, it is an animal skilled at hiding in the sparsest of cover. Badger-watching one evening, I remember seeing a roe rise suddenly from a tiny patch of stinging nettles between me and the sett. It looked around, sniffed the air and wandered slowly into the woods, nibbling a bit of bramble here and there. The reference books generally portray roe as solitary deer, meaning that, in Britain, they do not form herds. In the summer months, it is often the case that a female will be accompanied by her kid or kids (for they often have twins), and she could have a buck in attendance, too. In winter, roe will be seen feeding in groups at a good food source but, if disturbed, they tend to scatter and flee rather than bunch up and stay together, as herd deer will. In areas where they become numerous, their paths are well worn and marked by their slots, or hoof prints. Roe deer appear to be spreading. At present, they are common throughout most of Scotland and the north of England. Further south they occupy much of the area between London and Cornwall and parts of East Anglia. According to the Handbook of British Mammals, they are spreading northwards into Gloucestershire and westwards into the Midlands from these strongholds. And although absent previously from Wales, roe deer have been recorded recently around Llandrindod Wells; one wonders how they have popped up in such a central area of the country without previous detection. Their spread will be greeted with delight by many who enjoy glimpsing these graceful little animals during walks in the country. And if the nesting habits of our local blue and great tits are anything to go by, there will rejoicing in that direction, too. Roe deer moult just as these birds are building their nests, and every one I find contains numerous roe hairs gleaned by the builders from the tufts shed on the woodland floor while the deer are sleeping.</p>

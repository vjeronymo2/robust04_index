			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / International Company News: Cross-border M&amp;A deals in publishing decline Cross-border merger and acquisition activity in the publishing industry, has seen a dramatic decline, according to a survey by KPMG Peat Marwick, the international accountancy and management consultancy firm. In 1989 there were 106 acquisitions worth Dollars 5.35bn (Pounds 3bn) in newspapers, books, periodicals and printing. In the six months to June 1992 there were only 23 acquisitions worth Dollars 56m. Mr Richard Paterson of KPMG said the common view in the 1980's that international multi-media groups were the way forward had fuelled an acquisition boom. 'The companies which won the takeover battles were often the ones that lost out in the long run: now they are burdened with debts and seeing the value of their acquisitions plummet,' Mr Patterson said. The recent announcement that Reed International and Elsevier, the Dutch international publishers intended to merge was strong confirmation that a longer running trend towards greater international integration in the publishing industry was continuing. In the four and a half years to June 1992 the UK was the top purchaser in the industry by a wide margin with 145 deals worth a total of Dollars 6.958bn. More than half of that was, however, accounted for by 22 deals done by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. The UK was also the second largest seller of publishing companies with 39 deals worth a total of Dollars 1.76bn. But Britain was a long way behind the US which had 156 deals worth Dollars 13.6bn.</p>

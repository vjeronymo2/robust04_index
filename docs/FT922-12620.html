			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bolivia prepares mining industry for reincarnation - A wave of foreign investor interest is raising hopes for the sector's recovery BOLIVIA, LEFT for dead by the world mining industry when the bottom fell out of the tin market during the 1980s, may yet see the resurgence of its once flourishing mining sector. Excited mining analysts and businessmen claim the country is on the threshold of a boom the like of which it has not seen since the days of the tin barons of the 19th century. A timely combination of new pro-business legislation and important discoveries have attracted a swarm of international mining groups. Mr Scotty Bruce, a mining consultant in La Paz, says: 'Out of 37 companies that have recently come to Bolivia to look around, 21 have registered (with the government) and have begun exploring'. Most of the companies are searching for gold, silver and zinc. Mr Bruce expects mining investment to rise to Dollars 120m this year. That may be small change in the international mining game, but it is three times the 1991 level. He believes that Bolivia 'can double export sales in the next five years, from Dollars 400m now'. In fact, the mining boom has been in gestation for some time. Inti Raymi, a US-owned mining company, was set up seven years ago to develop gold deposits around the Andean town of Oruro. It invested Dollars 17m to create Bolivia's first open pit mine, marking an important shift in mining technologies. Until then, Bolivian mining was limited to working narrow, dangerous and labour-intensive underground veins. Inti Raymi now produces 50,000 troy ounces of gold and 350,000 ounces of silver annually - all of which is exported. In 1991 it reported sales of Dollars 18m and net profit of Dollars 2.7m. It is expanding the mine at a cost of Dollars 160m, in one of the largest private investment projects ever undertaken in Bolivia. Mr Alvaro Ugalde Canedo, Inti Raymi's general manager, says the expansion is well ahead of schedule and should raise gold output to 240,000 ounces a year in 1993. The company is 85 per cent-owned by Texas-based Battle Mountain Gold Company and financed 63 per cent of the project with multilateral loans and the rest with equity capital. In another major advance, after years of negotiation, Bolivia has allowed Lithium Corporation of the US to work a vast salt lake close to Oruro. It awarded Lithco a 40-year concession to produce potassium, strontium and boron at Salar de Uyuni, originally designated a national mineral reserve and off-limits to private foreign companies. But it was last year's approval of new mining legislation and foreign investment regulations that put Bolivia back on the world mining map. Bolivia treats local and foreign capital equally and has established what is said to be the most pro-business tax regime in South America. Congress also eased a constitutional ban on mining by foreign-owned companies in border regions. One of Bolivia's most powerful attractions may be the fact that it has never been thoroughly surveyed. Newly-arrived companies are particularly active in the little-explored eastern lowlands. The discovery seven months ago of a major copper deposit known as Don Mario confirmed earlier suspicions that the east was rich in minerals. That followed the discovery in 1989 of similar deposits in the region by Comsur, a company part-owned by RTZ of Britain. Inconclusive studies in the region by the British Geological Survey between 1976 and 1984 are now being re-evaluated in the light of these discoveries. However, more work is needed before the lowlands can be proclaimed a Bolivian El Dorado. Not all the action is in the east. After nationalising most of the mining industry in 1952, the government made no great effort to explore the Andean region or modernise technology; and private companies are now looking closely at the Andes. The western cordillera is particularly attractive because it abuts Chile's exhaustively surveyed Andes. Veins known to continue over the border into Bolivia may now be brought into operation. Also, Comibol, the moribund state mining corporation, is seeking joint venture partners to take over management of its virtually exhausted mines. Several companies have signed contracts, among them Paranapanema of Brazil, whose discovery of huge tin deposits in the Amazon helped to destroy Bolivia's tin industry. The government is privatising one of Comibol's few promising properties. Comsur outbid competitors for the high grade silver and zinc Bolivar mine. But negotiations to transfer control are bogged Comsur is owned by the Sanchez de Lozada family, which also dominates the largest opposition party. However, mining in Bolivia will always be an uphill struggle, despite its promising geology, cheap labour and attractive investment environment. Labour accounts for only about 10 per cent of a project's costs. But equipment and chemicals have to be imported. To be competitive, Bolivia must achieve economies of scale, use expensive modern technologies and keep exploring to add reserves. That is not easy, especially with low world prices. As a landlocked country with difficult topography and a hopelessly inadequate transport infrastructure, shipping minerals to port is a heavy additional cost. And Bolivia is far from attaining political and economic stability. It adopted rigidly orthodox economic policies in 1985 to cope with hyperinflation of 24,000 per cent a year, but has never achieved high growth. Discontent is growing and there is a risk of an anti-business, anti-multinational backlash in next year's presidential election campaign. Companies therefore seek correspondingly high rates of return. But the first phase of Inti Raymi's Oruro mine provided a rate of return of only 17 per cent, far short of an ideal rate of 25-30 per cent. The new phase, using state of the art carbon in leach processes, should boost to only 22-24 per cent. Still, businessmen say, more in hope than with great conviction, that the next government's hands will be tied by the country's critical financial constraints. Said a Comsur executive: 'Bolivia has a very narrow path to tread, determined by economic realities. There is not much room for populism'.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Carrington seeks to speed Yugoslav peace LORD Carrington, chairman of the European Community peace conference on Yugoslavia, arrived in Belgrade yesterday on a mission aimed at hammering out differences over the UN peace initiative and reviving the EC's role as mediator. At the same time, about 4,000 people turned out in Belgrade in support of Mr Milan Babic, leader of the self-proclaimed Serbian republic of Krajina in southern Croatia. Mr Babic is seen by Serb leaders as the main obstacle to deployment of 10,000 UN peacekeepers in Serb-populated regions of Croatia. But at yesterday's low-key rally, as a Belgrade journalist reported, 'most of the crowd were refugees from Croatia. Mr Babic has little support in war-weary Serbia.' A western diplomat based in Belgrade said Lord Carrington would see if he 'can knock some heads together' in an effort to iron out differences between Mr Babic and the republic of Serbia, led by President Slobodan Milosevic. During his two-day mission Lord Carrington, a former British foreign secretary, will assess whether the EC conference can be reconvened. Serbia has called on the UN to take over as political mediator, accusing the EC of taking sides in the conflict. After talks with Serb leaders yesterday, Lord Carrington was due to travel to Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina. Many fear an eruption of violence between Slavic Moslems, Serbs and Croats in the run-up to a referendum on independence for the central republic on February 29. Lord Carrington will later meet Croat leaders in Zagreb. Croatia has come under criticism for stalling the UN plan. It says the peacekeepers' mandate should be limited to one year. Recent statements from the Croat leadership have heightened fears in Krajina that Croatia intends to reimpose authority over the region, which is currently under Serb and federal army con-trol.</p>

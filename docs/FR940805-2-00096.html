			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Principles of Program Implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> III.1. Regulatory Program Excellence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The principles of excellence contained in this section provide a common philosophical basis on which Agreement States and NRC regulatory programs should be formulated and implemented. NRC and the Agreement States should strive for excellence in the administration of their programs and in their collective efforts to establish a credible, coherent, consistent program for the regulation of Atomic Energy Act materials throughout the United States. Both the NRC and the Agreement States should continually improve their regulatory program effectiveness and efficiency based on their respective and collective experience. Excellence in radiation safety regulation should include striving to improve assurance of the adequacy of public health and safety. In order to achieve excellence, the highest standards of public accountability, ethical conduct, and professionalism should be applied to individual and organizational performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory decisions and actions should be developed and implemented in an open and publicly credible manner and should be able to withstand scrutiny. Such scrutiny should be welcomed by the regulator. The regulator should be, and appear to be, independent and impartial in its actions and free from pressure and inappropriate influences from the regulated community. Regulations and regulatory decisions should be based on assessments of the best available information from affected and interested individuals and organizations, as well as on the best available knowledge from research and operational experience. Significant decisions should be documented with the rationale for such decisions explained. The public should have an opportunity for early involvement in significant regulatory program decisions. Where several effective alternatives are available, the alternative that best assures safety while considering differing views should be adopted, considering the resources needed to implement that alternative. Regulations should be necessary, or appropriate, to assure safety, and should be clear, coherent, logical, and practical. Regulatory actions should be fully consistent with regulations and good public policy and should lead to stability and predictability in the planning and implementation of radiation control programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Failure to adhere to these principles of excellence in the conduct of operations should be a sufficient reason for a regulatory program to self-initiate program changes that will result in needed improvements. There is an obligation by all involved to identify and express concerns relating to a program that appears to be operating contrary to these principles of excellence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is not intended that these principles of excellence be established as formal criteria against which NRC and Agreement State programs would be assessed. Rather, the expectation is that these principles will be incorporated into the day-to-day operational fabric of NRC and Agreement State materials programs. These principles should be used in the formulation of policies and programs, implementation of those policies and programs, and assessments of program effectiveness. Application of these principles will ensure that complacency will be minimized, that adequate levels of protection of public health and safety are being provided, and that government employees tasked with the responsibility for these Federal and State regulatory programs serve the public in an effective, efficient, and responsive manner. These principles are primarily for the use of materials program managers and staff in the self assessment of their programs and to use in the establishment of goals and objectives for the continual improvement of their respective programs. However, in the normal conduct of NRC Region and Agreement State formal program performance reviews, any deficiencies that indicate the program is not adhering to these principles of excellence should be noted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> III.2. Coherent National Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NRC acknowledges its responsibility to ensure that there is a coherent national radiation control program and NRC through this program establishes national radiation protection standards. The basic elements of such a program include ability to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety, compatibility in areas of national interest, sufficient flexibility to accommodate local needs and conditions, ability to assess program performance on a consistent and systematic basis, and excellence in program administration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each of these elements is reflected and addressed in specific sections of this policy statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

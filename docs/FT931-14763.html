			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Council chiefs fear that 33,000 staff will be shed MORE THAN 33,000 jobs will be lost in local government in England over the next year mainly because of government spending curbs according to a survey of council chief executives published yesterday. But those figures could be exaggerated, judging from another study released yesterday. It found that the number of job losses in local government last year was far lower than that expected before final budgets for 1992-93 were agreed in March. A survey by Local Government Chronicle of 140 councils employing 1.3m of the 1.6m staff in English councils found chief executives estimating that at least 33,000 jobs will be lost between now and April 1994. They thought that 13,000 of those would occur within the next three months. 'Other councils contacted said there would be job losses, but they had yet to calculate them - making the LGC figure an absolute minimum,' it said. The 140 councils surveyed said that they would need an extra Pounds 1.23bn from the government to maintain existing staffing and service levels, in addition to the Pounds 21bn of government support already pledged for 1993-94. When this year's grant settlement was announced, Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, said that it would 'enable councils to maintain existing service provision', with 'no need for job losses'. However, a Municipal Journal survey of local government job losses in the year to September 1992 reports that 10,300 jobs were lost. That was well below the predictions that were made by councils earlier in the year. Several authorities that had predicted redundancies in fact increased their staffing levels. Mr Michael Burton, the survey editor, said: 'The picture in the end was unpleasant but considerably less gloomy than envisaged as far as jobs went.' Mr John Redwood, local government minister, dismissed reports of large-scale compulsory redundancies as 'speculative'.</p>

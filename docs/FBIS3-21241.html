			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text]  <H5>  Current Situation in Japan </H5>   Japan's space development activities began in 1955 when the  University of Tokyo succeeded in launching pencil-like small  rockets. Later, in 1970, Japan's first satellite ``Ohsumi'' was  successfully launched.    In 1957, the Soviet Union succeeded in launching the first  satellite ``Sputnik-1.'' In 1969, an American made man's first  landing on the moon, using Apollo-11. In those days, Japan was  considerably behind these advanced countries in the technology  level. The National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA)  was set up also in 1969.    Through efforts made to enhance its own technology, Japan's  space development has made steady progress, however, and is  about to establish its own technology equal to that at the top  international level, as witnessed in the progress of the  development of the H-II rocket for launching large-sized  satellites.  <H5>  Significance of Space Development </H5>   First of all, space has infinite possibilities for those who  seek the truth. The scientific research on space may clarify the  origins of the universe and organisms and should lead to the  creation of a cultural era for all mankind.    Secondly, the quality of life can be improved, and the  economy and society can progress through the space activities,  such as communication broadcasting via satellites,  meteorological observation and earth observation from space.    Thirdly, space development can create new spheres for  mankind's activities, including space environment utilization  activities, in which the development of new materials is  expected. Space activities enable mankind to make use of outer  space and its resources.    Fourthly, the challenge of developing space will require  interweaving of mankind's wisdom and various advanced  technologies. This will contribute to intellectual creation and  the development of new technology. In this sense, space  activities inherently require international cooperation and will  promote creation of an international cooperative society.  <H5>  Fundamental Principles of Space Activities </H5>   The highest decision-making organization of Japan's space  activities policy is the Space Activities Commission (SAC). SAC  has published the national fundamental policy of Japan's space  development which established long-term goals and political  guidelines for Japan's space development activities covering 10  to 15 years. The latest review of the Long-Term Policy was made  in June 1989.    Based on the aforementioned significance of space  activities,  this policy says the following three fundamental principles to  be followed in Japan's space activities:  <H5>  (1) Response to advancing and diversifying needs </H5>   As our economy and society progress, needs of society and  people will become more sophisticated and diverse. Japan must  execute its space activities in order to enable its space  development to respond to these needs properly and to create  efficient systems so that anyone can conduct space activities  and use space.  <H3>  (2) Consistency with Japan's role in the international  society </H3>   Since space development inherently requires international  cooperation, Japan, as a member of the international society, is  expected to make an appropriate contribution consistent with its  international status. Japan must conduct space activities,  promoting such international cooperation positively and  willingly. It is expected of Japan to maintain and improve its  capabilities to continuously and freely conduct space activities  which are consistent with its status in the international  society.  <H5>  (3) Role of private sector </H5>   Space development has been conducted primarily by the  government. With the recent technical developments in this  field, however, Japan will encourage the private sector to  obtain sufficient capability considering the proper balance  between government and private sector's responsibilities.  <H5>  New Trends in Space Development </H5>   Following the end of the East-West Cold War era, the world  is  now looking for a new international order. The same thing can be  said in the world of space development. The space development  policies of the United States and Russia were forced to change.  The old significance of enhancing the national dignity and of  supporting military strategies has faded. As a result, advanced  nations in space development, including the two countries,  recognize the importance of international cooperation. Now, they  are cultivating closer international relationships.    Today, global issues, such as the earth environment problem,  which the world faces require global cooperation. The space  technology that contributes to protection of the earth  environment, namely earth observation from space, has been  recognized as a very important activity. Hope for this activity  is increasing among developing countries in the Asia-Pacific and  other regions.    In Japan, the development of the H-II rocket, with  international-level launch capability, has progressed, and its  maiden launch has been set on February 1, next year.    Japan also has good prospect in developing large-sized  satellites. Thus, Japan's space development is steadily  advancing. Japan now faces the need to establish a future space  infrastructure as space activities progress.    In such new circumstances, Japan must actively promote  cooperation with advanced countries in developing space taking  the responsibility for efficient space development in the world.  She must willingly join the global-scale operations of earth  observation and other missions to meet the expectation of  developing countries in the Asia-Pacific and other regions.    Furthermore, Japan must make constant efforts to maintain,  improve and develop her own technology, which is necessary to  positively and willingly promoting such international  cooperation and making such international contribution.</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Australia's big parties ponder voter backlash: Independent win upsets main groupings - The recent by-election victory by a protectionist independent candidate reflects growing concern over reduced tariff protection and industrial deregulation AUSTRALIA'S mainstream political parties are facing up to some uncomfortable questions following the unexpected victory of an independent protectionist candidate in a weekend by-election. Mr Phil Cleary, a local sporting hero, took 34 per cent of first preference votes in the inner-Melbourne seat of Wills to become only the second independent MP in Australia's federal parliament. Mr Cleary's victory was a severe embarrassment to the governing Labor Party, which called the by-election following the resignation from parliament of Mr Bob Hawke, the former prime minister. It also dashed hopes of an electoral breakthrough by the conservative Liberal/National Party coalition, which failed to take advantage of Australia's worst recession since 1983. Like many by-elections, the result was affected by local factors which make it an unreliable guide to the outcome of the next general election, due by mid-1993. Both main political groupings chose inarticulate candidates who were unable to overcome Mr Cleary's high profile as the successful coach of the local Australian Rules football club. However, Mr Cleary's victory reflected opposition to the government's attempts to increase the efficiency of the economy by reducing tariff protection and winding back industrial regulation. Under a programme drafted by Mr Paul Keating, who replaced Mr Hawke as prime minister in December, average effective tariffs for most industries will be cut to 5 per cent by the year 2000, from more than 20 per cent in 1983. The government has also tried to improve the efficiency of investment allocation by deregulating the financial sector, floating the Australian dollar and reforming the labour market. The argument that high tariffs protect inefficient industries at the expense of the efficient mining and rural sectors has become economic orthodoxy in the federal leadership of all three main parties. But it has never been accepted in Victoria, the heartland of Australian manufacturing, where both the Labor state government and the Liberal opposition remain wedded to protection. As a result, Labor found it difficult to respond to Mr Cleary's claims that tariff reductions have closed factories and put 11.6 per cent of Victorians out of work, compared to a national average of 10.5 per cent. The government was also reluctant to accept the alternative explanation that high unemployment has been caused largely by 18 months of flat or negative economic growth triggered by tight monetary policy. Some leading members of the government, mostly left wingers from Victoria, see the by-election as a warning to Labor not to risk moving too quickly away from the party's protectionist roots. Mr Gerry Hand, the immigration minister, was the most outspoken of several who suggested the government should reconsider its economic reform programme in the light of Mr Cleary's victory. A slowdown in tariff reform is unlikely because it would embarrass Mr Keating, the chief supporter of free trade, and lay the government open to opposition charges of inconsistency. However, the left is likely to use the by-election result to reopen an earlier debate on whether the government should try to offset the impact of tariff reform by supporting successful industries. This approach, championed by Mr Simon Crean, the primary industries minister, would offer limited government assistance to industries believed to have a competitive future, such as food processing for export to Asia. The idea has widespread support within the federal Labor Party, but is opposed by the prime minister, who fears it would quickly degenerate into a means of delivering disguised subsidies. Mr Keating also indicated in a private speech to Labor MPs that he believes the government can win the 1993 election without a potentially damaging change of policy. His view is that the Wills by-election came too early to allow Labor to benefit from signs of economic recovery over the last six months, which he believes will be reinforced by a ADollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1bn) public spending stimulus announced last month. National opinion polls show a steady drift to Labor since Mr Keating took over from Mr Hawke. The government trailed the opposition coalition by only 5 percentage points in the latest opinion poll published on Tuesday compared with 18 points in January. Labor can also take comfort from the opposition's failure to win Wills, which has stimulated a parallel debate over the coalition's commitment to a comprehensive package of tariff cuts, tax reforms and labour market changes. Mr John Hewson, the coalition leader, has faced calls for changes to the package from state leaders in Victoria and Queensland, and criticism of his leadership from Mr Malcolm Fraser, a former Liberal prime minister. Mr Hewson, who became leader after the 1990 general election, has rejected Mr Fraser's criticism and called a hasty meeting of federal and state leaders to thrash out a fresh approach to selling the opposition package. However, the coalition's failure in its first big test under his leadership does not augur well for its hopes of ending a decade in the political wilderness.</p>

The Order to Show Cause alleged that revocation of Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration was proper pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 824(a) (1), (2), and (4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In particular, the Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent's continued registration was inconsistent with the public interest in light of his prescribing of controlled substances to individuals in the absence of a legitimate medical purpose, his felony conviction for issuance of a controlled substance prescription in violation of California law, and his material falsification of a new application for registration with the DEA. On that application, Respondent failed to acknowledge that he had been convicted of a crime in connection with controlled substances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 13, 1993, Respondent requested a hearing on the issues raised in the Order to Show Cause. The matter was placed on the docket of Administrative Law Judge Paul A. Tenney. Following prehearing procedures, a hearing was scheduled for June 9, 1994. On June 3, 1994, Government counsel filed a motion for summary disposition alleging that Respondent was without state authority to handle controlled substances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In support of its motion, Government counsel produced a copy of the decision of the Division of Medical Quality, Medical Board of California (Board) dated November 16, 1993. Paragraph two of the decision provides that Respondent shall surrender his DEA Certificate of Registration and not reapply for a new DEA permit ``without prior written consent of the [Board].'' Government counsel also attached to its motion a statement from a Board Probation Officer who indicated that Respondent had not obtained written consent from the Board to reapply for his DEA Certificate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 20, 1994, Respondent filed a letter which was treated by the administrative law judge as a cross-motion for summary disposition. Respondent's submission, however, failed to address the issue of state authorization raised in Government counsel's motion for summary disposition. The submission, rather, addressed the merits of the case. Government counsel filed a response to Respondent's letter on June 23, 1994, again urging the administrative law judge to revoke Respondent's registration and deny his application based on lack of state authorization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 29, 1994, the administrative law judge granted the Government's motion for summary disposition and recommended that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration be revoked and that pending applications be denied. No exceptions were filed and on August 2, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Deputy Administrator. The Deputy Administrator now enters his final order in this matter pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is well established that the Drug Enforcement Administration cannot register a practitioner who is not duly authorized to handle controlled substances in the state in which he does business.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  21 U.S.C. 823(f). DEA has consistently held that practitioners who lack state authorization to handle controlled substances cannot be registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Ramon Pla, M.D. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 51 FR 41168 (1986);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> George S. Heath, M.D. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 51 FR 26610 (1986);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Dale D. Shahan, D.D.S. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 51 FR 23481 (1986). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, the Deputy Administrator adopts the administrative law judge's opinion and decision recommending that Respondent's registration be revoked and his pending applications denied. This decision is appropriate in light of Respondent's lack of authorization to handle controlled substances in the State of California. The Deputy Administrator has determined that due to Respondent's lack of state authorization to handle controlled substances, it is not necessary to address whether Respondent's continued registration is inconsistent with the public interest pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, AR2526171, issued to Jovencio Raneses, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked, and that all pending applications for registration be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective October 31, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 23, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Stephen H.

			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L. RON HUBBARD'S CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY  </P> <P> The Times and staff writers Joel Sappell and Robert Welkos have done a  commendable public service with the series on Hubbard and the Church of  Scientology.  </P> <P> While not as blatantly destructive as the Rev. Jim Jones' Peoples Temple, the  Church of Scientology is nevertheless a threat to American society.  </P> <P> Scientology has tried to justify and protect itself by citing the  constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion. Freedom of religion does not  include the freedom to exploit, deceive or harass others.  </P> <P> JERRY FALLENBERG  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

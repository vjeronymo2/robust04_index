			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TERRORISM / GAVIRIA'S OTHER CHALLENGE;  </P> <P> GUERRILLA ATTACKS CUT OIL REVENUE;  </P> <P> NEW COLOMBIA PRESIDENT MUST FIND WAY TO PACIFY REBEL GROUP  </P> <P> One of the toughest challenges faced by Colombia's new president, Cesar  Gaviria, is how to stop attacks by an armed group whose terrorist tactics have  cost the country millions of dollars. The enemy in this case is not the  Medellin cocaine cartel but a small band of leftist guerrillas, the National  Liberation Army, or ELN.  </P> <P> The Marxist-Leninist group has caused serious damage to both the economy and  environment through an unrelenting sabotage campaign against petroleum  facilities. ELN leaders say they want the government to nationalize the oil  industry.  </P> <P> Gaviria, in his efforts to pacify the country, must give priority to either  coaxing or forcing the ELN's estimated 2,000 armed members to lay down their  weapons, government officials say.  </P> <P> The ELN has inflicted its greatest damage by dynamiting the country's main oil  pipeline, which runs about 500 miles from the rich Cano Limon oil field on the  Venezuelan border to the Caribbean port of Covenas. Since 1986, 125 attacks  have cost the industry nearly $500 million in lost production and repairs, the  state oil company Ecopetrol said.  </P> <P> Future bombings are sure to be more costly. As a result of the Persian Gulf  crisis, the world price of crude has risen, and Colombia, fighting a costly war  with drug traffickers, needs the extra foreign exchange promised by the  increase. The country exports about 200,000 barrels a day, almost all of it  transported through the pipeline.  </P> <P> "Now, if the ELN dynamites it, the delay in exporting will mean much more in  terms of lost income," said Luis Soto, a Bogota petroleum consultant. "Making  peace with the guerrillas is more important than ever."  </P> <P> Many experts say the environment has suffered more than the oil industry at the  hands of the ELN. Ecopetrol just completed a $1.4-million cleanup of what  environmental officials call one of the worst messes ever left by an ELN  attack. A May 12 attack on the pipeline caused 14,200 barrels of oil to spill  into the country's largest body of fresh water, the Zapatosa marsh, which feeds  the Magdalena River in northeastern Colombia.  </P> <P> President Gaviria, who succeeded Virgilio Barco on Aug. 7, says he will try to  stop the ELN violence by continuing his predecessor's peace strategy, which  stressed quick demobilization of guerrillas.  </P> <P> The one guerrilla group to lay down its arms under the plan, the April 19  Movement, or M-19, received several official promises in return. Among them was  a guarantee that the government would work to reform the political system, long  dominated by the Liberal and Conservative parties.  </P> <P> The M-19's first presidential candidate, Antonio Navarro, finished third in the  May 27 elections, and Gaviria, a member of the Liberal Party, appointed him  health minister. The government is negotiating with three other small leftist  guerrilla groups and has guaranteed their participation in a November assembly  to reform the constitution.  </P> <P> ELN leaders dismiss the peace initiative as a farce. Some political scientists  say the government will have to turn up military pressure on the guerrillas if  it wants to persuade them to disarm.  </P> <P> But Gonzalo De Francisco, one of Gaviria's peace advisers, says the  administration's main weapon will be state money invested in regions where the  ELN operates. Barco's Administration spent millions of dollars on public works  projects in the states, including some ELN strongholds. De Francisco said the  program would be expanded under Gaviria.  </P> <P> Spending of another kind played a role in the rise of the ELN. Colombian  officials accuse the German firm that built the Cano Limon pipeline of paying  the ELN a $6-million "oil tax" to let the work proceed in 1983. That payment  whetted the guerrillas' appetite for petroleum dollars and led to a string of  kidnapings of foreign oil executives and other forms of extortion. The tactics  transformed the ragtag band of rebels into a potent economic force in several  rural regions.  </P> <P> Government officials and oil executives say the changes in the Communist world  have removed the ELN's ideological footing. But few here believe the ELN is  ready to stop attacking the pipeline.  </P></p>

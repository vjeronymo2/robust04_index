			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Observer: Fourth attempt Has Jacques Attali finally met his match? Barbara Ann Clay, formerly public affairs director at the US Treasury, is the fourth person to accept what many outsiders regard as a pretty thankless task: handling relations between the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's president and the outside world. Her immediate predecessor Graham Watson walked out after mere months because he couldn't work with Attali, so was she not a little uneasy? The 37-year-old Clay is too shrewd a political cookie to be drawn into that sort of debate. Having run a restaurant on New York's Long Island for five years, she has had more than her fair share of difficult customers. Her political training started when she followed President Reagan into the White House in 1981 as an unpaid intern. Ending up as press secretary to several directors of the Office of Management and Budget, she should know how to deal with intelligent men with big egos. The fact that she was David Mulford's press secretary at the US Treasury inevitably raises a suspicion that the Americans have put in another of their own to keep an eye on Attali's grand ideas. But Clay, whose French is 'not as good as it should be', firmly denies it. Even so, noting that her degree from the State University of New York at Oneonta is in theatre, Observer would love to be backstage when she and her new employer have their first big row.</p>

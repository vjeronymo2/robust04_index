			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: OPERA  </P> <P> Dame Sutherland Rings Down the Curtain: Dame Joan Sutherland says she wants to  be remembered for her voice in its prime, so she has withdrawn from her  December appearances in Covent Garden, which were to have been the last of her  career. The 63-year-old diva had been cast in the role of Rosalinde in "Die  Fledermaus." Instead, her final opera appearance will be in Sydney on Oct. 2 in  "Les Huguenots," Royal Opera House officials said. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EASY TARGETS FOR AN EARTHQUAKE;  </P> <P> PASSAGE OF PROP. 122 WOULD GET STATE BUILDINGS INTO BETTER SHAPE  </P> <P> The state Seismic Safety Commission has been pushing the Legislature for  several years to begin repairing and retrofitting state buildings and local  government buildings that might collapse or suffer serious damage in a moderate  or severe earthquake. The state owns 16,000 structures throughout California,  many of which need to be upgraded to modern earthquake-safety standards.  </P> <P> The commission estimates that there are another 3,000 local government-owned  structures that need retrofitting, including many police and fire stations.  </P> <P> Bringing all the publicly owned buildings in the state up to earthquake-safety  standards will cost $1 billion or more, according to state officials. Prodded  by last October's Loma Prieta earthquake in Northern California, the  Legislature has at least taken the first step toward dealing with the problem  by putting a proposed $300-million bond issue on the June 5 ballot.  </P> <P> The issue comes before California voters as Proposition 122. Statewide bond  issues require a majority vote of the electorate before the money can be raised  and spent.  </P> <P> Over the decades, public schools were rebuilt or reinforced under the Field Act  to make them earthquake-safe. So was the state Capitol in Sacramento. Similar  action for other public buildings is past due.  </P> <P> Thousands of workers, students and consumers of state and local public services  are put at potential risk every day because they must occupy, or do business,  in unsafe public structures, such as old courthouses or Department of Motor  Vehicle offices.  </P> <P> Of the $300 million in general obligation bonds authorized by Proposition 122,  $250 million would be used to rehabilitate or rebuild state buildings. The  other $50 million would be set aside to help local governments do the same for  fire and police stations, hospitals, emergency-operations centers and other  public-safety facilities.  </P> <P> The Times urges California voters to approve this essential bond issue.  </P></p>

In a signed article, Ren Zhongping says that 1994 is an  important year for China to speed up the process of establishing  a socialist market economic system and extend a package of new  reforms.    Fostering a main market, improving a market system and  upgrading a regulatory system are the three aspects that must be  "pushed ahead abreast", the article says, adding that  "breakthroughs" must be made on the micro and macro levels of  the market economy.    The author calls the tasks an uphill battle like "storming  fortifications".    The present is the optimum time to mount such a battle, Ren  says, citing the courage and resolve that are needed to overcome  the difficulties.    Otherwise, a rare historic opportunity will slip by and a  sustained, high-speed and healthy growth of the national economy  can not be maintained. Consequently, the next strategic  objectives of the national economy and social development will  not be able to be realized. Worse still, it would be very  likely that China would be lingering in a predicament of  inflation and low-speed economic growth, warns the lengthy  article.    The transition from the co-existence of a planned economy  and  a market economy to a single-track market economy will deeply  touch the interests pattern formed under the old system.    What is more, the major transformation from the bottom-up  self-initiated reforms and the top-down delegation of power and  giving up of interests to the coordinated and organized  implementation by people at both ends demand new adaptability,  Ren says.    Therefore, the authority of the central government should be  upheld and a concept of overall interests be formed in order to  successfully effect the move from "the advancing of a single  program" to "the advancing of overall programs".    The article says it is necessary to use legal means to guide  the reforms and manage the economy when policy formulation gives  way to laws and regulations.    The author warns against the tendency among some people to  think "reforms are an issue for the government and development  is our business".    The article says, "we are in the same boat and everyone is  involved in the current reforms. We should unite as one to win  the battle."</p>

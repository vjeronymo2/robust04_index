			<p>BFN     [Text] Istanbul, June 2 (A.A.) -- Foreign Ministry  spokesman Ferhat Ataman said today that the straits regulations  which Turkey will implement on July 1st, was under the  authorization of Turkey.    `It is not possible to throw a city of 10 million into  danger,' Ataman said.    Ataman stressed that the regulations were put into force  solely on security and environmental considerations and this  document was not, in any way, conflicting the Montreux  Convention, which regulates passage through the straits.    He added that the issue was elaborately reviewed together  with Russia.    Ataman recalled that the International Maritime Organization  had approved Turkey's regulations.    Greece supported Russia in its oppossition to Turkey's  straits regulations which will become effective July 1st.    Turkey last week adopted a new set of regulations for  maritime passage through the straits in order to prevent  accidents, and to safeguard security and protection of its  citizens as well as the environment along the Bosporus, the  Marmara Sea and the Dardanelles.    According to the new regulations, ships carrying dangerous  material and chemicals will have to warn authorities 24 hours  before their passage, and no other similar ship will be allowed  into the Bosporus before the previous one exits.    Ships will have to sail by following `the report system,  traffic control centers and stations, traffic diversion scheme'  which is one of the main items of the regulations.    Also according to the regulations the straits can be  temporarily closed in case of construction, fire fighting,  sounding, scientific and sports activities, rescue operations  and the prevention of sea pollution.    It is also forbidden to sail the straits with sailboats, row  boats and swimming and hunting are also prohibited.    On March 13, 30 seamen died on the Bosporus when Greek  flagged tanker Nassia collided with another Greek freighter.    The accident also interrupted the traffic on the 18-mile  (30-km) strait and led to environmental hazards.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Namik Akhundov, head of the Supreme Soviet </F> of Azerbaijan Department of International Relations, by  unidentified ASSA-Irad correspondent; place and date not given:  "Cooperation Between the Parliaments of Azerbaijan and Britain"]    [Text]    [Correspondent] Britain has recently been displaying  increased interest in the events in the Transcaucasus and,  particularly, in the development of the Armenia-Azerbaijan  conflict. The visits of British statesmen to our republic have  become more frequent. How do you evaluate Britain's position in  the solution of questions of vital importance to Azerbaijan?    [Akhundov] I would note Britain's objectivity both in  respect  to the events in our region and during discussion of all the  first three resolutions in the UN Security Council. The draft of  the latest, fourth, resolution, which Britain is at this moment  correcting, was submitted for Security Council discussion  recently. It differs from Resolution No. 874, with whose content  Azerbaijan has in principle remained dissatisfied and which it  has regarded as a retreat from the provisions of the preceding  Resolutions 822 and 853.    [Correspondent] You mean that Britain is preparing a draft  new resolution?    [Akhundov] Britain is a member of the UN Security Council.  Usually each country on the Security Council makes its  corrections and submits its observations and revisions during  the elaboration of official documents. At the present time the  draft new resolution is being studied at the British Foreign  Ministry.    [Correspondent] May it be maintained that all these visits,  meetings, and talks will somehow influence the opinion of the  world community, help Azerbaijan find new supporters, and  produce specific results?    [Akhundov] The first British parliamentary delegation came  to  Azerbaijan this April. It consisted of representatives of the  Conservative and Labor parties. It was followed on a visit to  our republic by Dr. Clark, representative of the Labor Party and  shadow defense secretary. And, finally, this month--the latest  visit of representatives of the British parliament. The result  of all these contacts was the joint decision to form a special  group in the British parliament for liaison with the parliament  of Azerbaijan and our republic as a whole. This group will  register with the Interparliamentary Union, which may be seen as  a positive factor in Azerbaijan's favor.    [Correspondent] How are relations with the parliaments of  other countries shaping up?    [Akhundov] There are no further such examples of cooperation  as yet, unfortunately. Relations have been established with  neighboring Turkey, but they have not been seen through to the  end. It is very important today that at this difficult, dramatic  time for Azerbaijan foreign countries and the public obtain  objective information and learn the truth. I believe it to be of  considerable importance that Britain itself and the British  parliament are commenting objectively on the events taking place  here. Interparliamentary contacts--a guarantee of the  development of further cooperation between our states--are  taking shape. I have to mention Mr. James Spicer--a sponsor of  the creation of the interparliamentary group. He is the head in  Britain of the Westminster Democracy Foundation, which,  obviously, will perform an important role in relations between  our states. We outlined in the negotiations the first specific  steps, and Mr. Spicer proposed the formation of a group of 10-15  young politicians which would in the future visit Britain. It is  contemplated that the Azerbaijani politicians will meet with  politicians of Britain, visit the British parliament, and  acquire visual lessons in parliamentarianism and democracy. In  addition, we believe that the foundation will associate itself  actively with the implementation of cultural activities.    [Correspondent] In other words, the foundations of further  mutual relations between Azerbaijan and Britain, between the  parliaments of the two countries, are being laid today, now?    [Akhundov] Yes, and this is in itself a very good beginning.  It implants hope of the possibility of cooperation and the  establishment of stable relations with the parliaments of other  states of Europe and Asia and neighboring Iran and Turkey. I  believe that Azerbaijan could find political partners in the Far  East also.    [Correspondent] I would like to hope that this cooperation  will not be of an episodic nature but will become a system and a  direction of the parliament of Azerbaijan's overseas activity.    [Akhundov] We will aspire to constant interaction with all  parliaments of the world. Relations based on cooperation, mutual  trust, and friendship have stood the test of time and given a  good account of themselves and serve only the interests of peace  and stability.    [Correspondent] Than you for the interview.</p>

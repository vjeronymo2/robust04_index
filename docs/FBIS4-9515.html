			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by "sta" on introductory remarks by and interview </F> with Defense Minister Antonin Baudys at a news conference on 6  January; place not given: "Clear Reports Regarding the Future"]    [Text] Information from the news conference that took  place on 6 January 1994 was published in the last issue. Today,  we are returning to additional important items mentioned in the  second part of the introductory remarks made by the minister of  defense of the Czech Republic, Antonin Baudys.    Without a doubt, everyone is interested in what is  actually facing the Ministry of Defense this year. Certainly, it  will be a time of further progress regarding deep changes of its  entire organism. Toward that end, the minister of defense said  the following at the news conference:  <H5>  In the Army of the Czech Republic </H5>   The decisive phase of transforming the Army of the Czech  Republic [ACR] will be realized with the reorganization of the  Western Military Command and the Central Military Command into  army corps commands, the transfer of the 4th Division into a  brigade-type structure, and the creation of two tactical- and  transport-aviation bases.    The establishment of a rapid-deployment brigade will be  finalized, as will the establishment of additional (a total of  11) territorial defense brigades.    There will be a fundamental melding of the newly organized  staffs and military units, their personnel stabilization, and  improvements in training.    The military railroad components will be eliminated.    Legislative, organizational, and social conditions will be  created to facilitate the essential increase in the number of  professionals, particularly among the group of so-called career  soldiers.    A military strategy for the defense of the Czech Republic  will be worked out and a concept for the development of the ACR  through the year 2000 will be prepared.  <H5>  In the Realm of Personnel Work and Education </H5>   Principal attention will be concentrated on personnel  support  for the transformation of the ACR, accompanied by the assertion  of principles of the concept of personnel and social policy of  the Ministry of Defense.    The personnel policy and social support for military  personnel will be legislatively assured.    There will be a transformation of the military education  system and a gradual realization of the concept of scientific  work within the ACR.    Attention will be focused also on assuring quality training  for the Army sports representatives at the XVII Winter Olympic  Games (ZOH).  <H5>  In Terms of Financing and Logistics and Ministry of Defense </H5> Economics    The following principal tasks evolve from the concept of  transforming the ACR and the method involved in the introduction  of the PPBS [Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System]:     -  Preparation of the budget for 1995 in its program  composition.    -  Definition of decisive acquisition  projects.    -  Transition to double-entry bookkeeping, with a  deadline for realization of 31 December 1994.    -  Creation of  military financial offices and logistics structures, including  appropriate information systems.    -  Consistent adherence to koruna  controls during the transition period.    -  Working out a uniform  materials catalogue, working out standards and financial  standards.    -  Disestablishment of military construction  battalions.    -  Privatization of state enterprises.    -  Transformation  of military spa and recreational facilities.    -  Transformation of  the military-scientific base.  <H5>  In Matters of Civil Defense </H5>   The reorganization of control organs of civil defense, of  civil defense formations, will be finalized, as will the  integration and material support of executive elements of civil  defense into regional and local rescue systems; a civil defense  logistics base will be created.    Principles of a civil defense law will be worked out for  discussion within the government, and appropriate standard  operating procedures for directing civil defense will be worked  out as well.    Cooperation with neighboring countries in resolving civil  defense problems and the elimination of the consequences of  disasters and catastrophes that transcend national borders will  be assured.    The establishment of an information system for civil defense  as a component of the national information system will be  finalized.  <H5>  In the Area of Foreign Relations </H5>   The principal tasks in 1994 will be concentrated on the  following activities in solving tasks in collaboration with the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs:     -  Actively participate in the NATO Partnership Program for  Peace and still further deepen the bilateral contacts between  the ACR and NATO member countries and neighboring countries; set  priorities for ACR collaboration with specific armies.    -  Prepare a  proposal for the concept of ACR participation in peaceful  operations sponsored by the United Nations and the CSCE, to be  submitted for discussion to the government and the parliament of  the Czech Republic.    -  Prepare directives, regulations, and  international ministerial agreements for the realization of  military exercises at the international level, for the  establishment and training of units preordained to participate  in peaceful operations (this stems from the agreement on the  Partnership for Peace and from the establishment of so-called  standby forces of the United Nations).    -  Prepare courses for  military inspectors of verification centers at Komorni Hradek  and an international NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council]  for members of peacekeeping forces at Cesky Krumlov.    -  Prepare to  mount a UN peacekeeping battalion for Yugoslavia and carry out  its rotation in April and November.    -  Support the training of  military observers, their rotation in existing missions, and  their dispatch according to the requirements of the government  (Ministry of Foreign Affairs).    -  Fulfill tasks stemming from the  realization of the KOS [expansion unknown] agreements in Europe  and the treaty on open skies.    -  Improve the quality of language  training and specialized training for members of the ACR.    -  Work  out annual exchange and statistical information according to the  KOS agreements, the VD-92, and the treaty on open skies and the  newly adopted recommendations stemming from the meeting of  foreign ministers of countries that are signatories to the CSCE  in Rome.    -  Continue active participation in negotiations of the  CSCE, the KOS agreements, negotiations regarding open skies, and  in other international security forums.  <H5>  In the Area of Command and Control </H5>   Stabilize the new system of control at the level of the  Ministry of Defense and the ACR, clearly outlining jurisdictions  and personal responsibilities and creation of the necessary room  for initiative solution of tasks at all levels of command.    Deepen the effectiveness of control, focused from the level  of the Ministry of Defense, on the course of the transformation  of the ACR; adherence to basic human rights and freedoms with  respect to soldiers and focused on economic control.    In the legislative area, focus on working out proposals for  laws that were begun in 1993, bringing them to the level of  principles, and focus on reevaluating internal ministerial  standard operating procedures in harmony with the changes that  have occurred within the ministry.    In military counterintelligence, orient activities toward  specifically improving intelligence protection for the ministry  as well as the Army, concentrate on improving the results of  work and on personnel and technical support for this service.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   At the press conference, the minister of defense also  responded to questions by journalists. We present two of them  below:    [Journalist] In recent times, I have noted that not only  journalists, but also professional soldiers are expressing high  criticism with regard to the situation in the Army....    [Baudys] I believe that it is not abnormal for me to be  criticized by professional soldiers. This tends to indicate that  something is beginning to be in order within the Army. The Army  is not such an organization in which a subordinate officer could  not criticize a superior. You obviously have in mind the more  extensive article written by Colonel Stetka in CESKY DENIK; if I  disregard NECENZUROVANE NOVINY, I know of no other public  criticism. A number of the remarks made by Col. Stetka are  relevant, but, as far as criticism of General Nekvasil is  concerned, I am afraid it is not based on objective facts. I do  not reject criticism by soldiers, no matter what rank they may  be--I would be opposed to myself. My effort is to have the Army  be functional, and that is why I must listen to all voices.    [Journalist] A year ago you stated that those officers who  agreed with the occupation by the Soviet military on our  territory had committed treason. Do you still hold that opinion  today? If so, how did that view manifest itself in the  directives governing the extraordinary evaluations, as well as  in their practical implementation?    [Baudys] I have not changed my view. However, the facts are  such that not all dossiers contain supplemental biographic data  that contain this fact. Taken through to its consequences, I  would most likely, or rather certainly, have to say that, as of  5 January 1993, we are dissolving the Army and are beginning to  create it completely anew. Those who did not agree with the  occupation represent a negligible quantity. Your question, which  is put in a highly categorical manner with a great deal of moral  conviction, could thus have only a single consistent answer--the  dissolution of the Army. But it is a question of discussion as  to whether we would be capable of creating a new functional army  within such a historically short period. If someone signed to  indicate he agreed with the occupation, this does not mean that  he is not prepared to defend his country despite the fact that,  from a moral standpoint, I continue to believe that this was  treason. I did not decide to dissolve the Army; after all, it is  not even within my jurisdiction to do so--and, consequently, it  was not even reflected in the appropriate order.</p>

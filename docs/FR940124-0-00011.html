			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 9. PRBRC opposed OSM's decision to process the Wyoming submittals as program amendments under 30 CFR 732.17. The commenter stated that because these submittals pertain to a condition of program approval, the provisions of 30 CFR 732.13(j) apply instead. The Secretary cannot agree with the commenter. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(g) specifically require that all changes to laws and regulations that make up the State program be submitted to OSM as a program amendment. Both the August 18, 1982, and the March 9, 1993, submittals fall into this category. Furthermore, the provisions of 30 CFR 732.13(j) apply only if the State has not initiated action to satisfy the condition of program approval, a situation which does not exist here. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Agency Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and its implementing regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited from various Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Wyoming program. None of these agencies provided any objection to approval of the submittals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), OSM provided the submittals to the SHPO and ACHP for comment No comments were received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Protection Agency Concurrence <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), OSM must obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) before approving any provisions of a proposed State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). On October 25, 1993, the EPA concurred with Wyoming's proposed amendments (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;22&hyph;16). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Secretary's Decision <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the above findings, the Secretary is approving Wyoming's proposed program amendments as submitted on August 18, 1992, and March 9, 1993, with the exception of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(g) (see finding 7) and those provisions of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) set forth in findings 1, 3, 5, and 6. The Secretary also is revising the cost recovery component of the condition of program approval at 30 CFR 950.11(c) to reflect the statutory and regulatory changes made by the proposed amendments consider in this rulemaking. For the reasons discussed in finding 8, the Secretary is removing the intervention component of the condition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 950 codifying decisions concerning the Wyoming program are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal Standards without undue delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary acknowledges that the plaintiff in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Powder River Basin Resource Council <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Babbitt <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (`` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Powder River <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ''), No. 92&hyph;CV&hyph;1021&hyph;B (D.

The Secretary does not find the action requested by the plaintiff to be appropriate in this instance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Observer: Redundancies Good to see Professor Patrick Minford, a leading apostle of free-market economics, practising what he preaches. Two years ago the government's Economic and Social Research Council axed his Pounds 100,000-a-year research funding, so Liverpool University's answer to Lord Keynes has been searching high and low for a new source of venture capital. He has finally persuaded Cardiff Business School, one of the richer bits of the University of Wales, to give him Pounds 50,000 a year for five years, in exchange for a long-term study on the Welsh economy. Cardiff's links with Minford - a member of the Treasury's new panel of outside economic experts, which includes Cardiff's visiting professor, Tim Congdon - should give it a higher profile in the notoriously clubby UK economics community. However, Minford has had to pay a fairly high price to remain in the forecasting business. He has had to cut his team in half since 1991.</p>

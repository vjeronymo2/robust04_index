			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special feature" by reporter Hong Wen (3126 2429)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 10 March (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- A  Hong Kong banker pointed out: As the Chinese mainland speeds up  the pace of financial structural reform, new changes are taking  place in the mainland's overseas lending activities and the  traditional policy loans are increasingly giving way to  commercial loans. Under this tendency, foreign banks'  traditional practice of getting involved in the mainland's  lending activities is expected to face a challenge.    Wu Lien-feng, deputy general manager of the Nanyang  Commercial Bank, informed this reporter: In the past, on the  mainland under the planned economic structure, shortterm  commercial loans from outside the borders were guaranteed by  specialized state banks, and foreign banks also used to accept  loans of this form. Nevertheless, in recent months this  traditional pattern has been gradually broken.    Basing his statements on analysis, he said: China has  increasingly come to realize that financial structural reform is  the "dragon head" of transition to a market economy, and in the  second half of last year, it was determined to carry out reform  as quickly as possible. The most eye-catching move was to  transform the four major specialized banks from policy into  commercial banks. To put in another way, the role of the four  specialized banks in overseas policy loans as a guarantor will  be gradually diluted so as to enable them to concentrate their  resources on businesses as commercial banks.    As a Hong Kong bank which was the earliest to set up a China  internal business department and branches in the mainland's  special economic zones, the Nanyang Commercial Bank has closely  watched the relevant changes and adopted active measures to  participate in the mainland's financial reform, such as  readjusting its China business strategy and expanding the scope  of operations. According to Mr. Wu, his bank took the lead in  organizing a $40-million international syndicated loan with the  China Ocean Shipping Company acting as a guarantor rather than  borrowing from any financial institutions on the mainland.  Moreover, the Nanyang Commercial Bank recently provided  commercial loans worth millions of U.S. dollars to a car parts  manufacturing plant in Guizhou Province. This was the first  batch of commercial loans extended to the province by the Bank  of China Group.    In addition, according to statistics, although China was  active for a while in extending syndicated loans to outside  financial institutions in the second half of last year, the  number of loans with specialized banks acting as a guarantor was  very limited. They were mostly guaranteed by local financial  institutions, such as the Guangdong Development Bank and the  Pudong Development Bank.    However, because the credibility ratings of local banks are  relatively low and their financial strengths are not enough to  cope with the huge market demands, some bankers are worried that  the recent briskness will not last long and the lending  activities of mainland enterprises outside the borders may be  adversely affected.    People in the industry pointed out: Although foreign banks  universally adopt a careful approach toward the changes, many of  them are also seeking a breakthrough and making active  preparations, because from a long-term point of view, China's  financial reform is conducive to absorbing foreign capital.  Therefore, it would be better for them to become actively  involved, promote the changes with good intentions, and expand  their businesses while adapting themselves to the changed  situation rather than looking on with folded arms and letting a  golden opportunity slip by.</p>

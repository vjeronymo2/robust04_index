			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Business pays more in UK for lawyers THE UK's top commercial lawyers are the most expensive in the world, charging Dollars 235 an hour more than their counterparts in the US, according to an annual survey of international law firms. The 1992 figures from the International Financial Law Review 1000 show that the average hourly rate for legal advice from a partner in a top City of London law firm rose 20 per cent over the past 12 months to Dollars 585 an hour. The top rate for a partner in the most expensive Wall Street firms is Dollars 350 an hour and average hourly rates for partners in US firms are Dollars 230. After the UK, Germany has the most expensive law firms, with top commercial lawyers charging Dollars 510 an hour, followed by Switzerland (Dollars 445) and Austria (Dollars 385), Japan (Dollars 350) and Hong Kong (Dollars 325). The figures were dismissed yesterday by City lawyers as misleading. Mr Adam Quarry of City-based solicitors Linklaters &amp; Paines said the survey was 'not comparing like with like' and 'a gross oversimplification' of billing practices. The rates quoted were partner rates whereas the overall hourly rate for a job - the true cost to a client of using the firm's services - would be a blended average of the hourly rates of the different grades of lawyers who worked on it, he said. US law firms bill clients for many more hours per lawyer than UK firms and tend to staff jobs differently. He said he would be 'very surprised' if rates for City partners had risen by 20 per cent over the past year, given the state of the market. Linklaters increased its hourly charge rates 'slightly' in July this year - the first increase since May 1990. Other surveys of international law firms showed that Wall Street firms were in general more profitable than their City counterparts.</p>

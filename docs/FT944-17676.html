			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Finns set to vote to join EU Finland is set to vote decisively in favour of joining the European Union in a referendum on October 16, according to two opinion polls published yesterday. One exit poll taken among voters who had already cast postal ballots showed 67.6 per cent backing EU membership. A second, conventional, opinion poll showed support for EU membership had risen 10 points to 48 per cent in two weeks, while opposition had slipped by three points to 28 per cent. The poll found most of the 24 per cent undecided leaning to the Yes side. A decisive vote for membership in Finland would give a strong boost to the Yes campaigns in neighbouring Sweden and Norway which will hold similar referendums in November. Latest polls in Sweden show a narrow lead for the Yes side while in Norway, the polls continue to show a solid majority against membership.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Radkevich, chairman of the State </F> Committee for Foreign Economic Relations, by Larisa Grigorovich;  place and date not given: "Belarus-United States: Partnership  Across the Ocean"]    [Text] [Radkevich] A package of documents was submitted for  adoption by the U.S. and Belarusian leaders [during President  Clinton's visit to Belarus]. The most important of them was the  Agreement on Promotion and Mutual Protection of Investments.  The drafting of the document demanded maximum efforts on the  part of the two sides and lasted for almost a year.  Representatives of more than 30 ministries and departments  participated in debates over this key document, all the  preliminary drafts were discussed at the sessions of the Supreme  Soviet and Council of Ministers committees.    [Grigorovich] Could you brief us on the legal basis of this  document? Have there been any problems in drafting it?    [Radkevich] The document creates a legal basis for the  involvement and efficient use in Belarus of the vast potential  of U.S. investments. Regardless of the firm and often  uncompromising stance of the U.S. side, we managed to alter the  text of the agreement adjusting it to the real state of affairs  in the economy and to Belarusian laws.    By the way, before signing the agreement with Belarus, the  United States signed bilateral agreements on promotion and  mutual protection of investments with Russia, Armenia,  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Moldova.    [Grigorovich] As is known, according to the Belarusian-U.S.  agreement on trade relations signed in February 1993, the sides  granted each other the status of most favored nation. What  effect did it have on our relations?    [Radkevich] This in particular means that Belarusian  enterprises and companies do not have to pay higher customs duty  for exporting their products to the United States. In addition,  our products enjoy all the privileges granted to other states.    Belarus would receive other privileges had it joined the  U.S.  General System of Preferences, temporarily exempting certain  categories of products from customs duty. Prime Minister V.  Kebich once sent a letter to the United States regarding this  issue. Unfortunately, for some reason, President Clinton made no  declaration concerning Belarusian admission to this system.  Yet, we are continuing to work in that direction.    [Grigorovich] What is your opinion about other agreements  and accords discussed and signed during Clinton's talks with the  Belarusian leadership?    [Radkevich] I want to underline that during the talks the  U.S. side promised to increase financial aid to Belarus within  the framework of the Nunn-Lugar Law to $100 million, although  the agreement signed by the Belarusian defense minister and the  U.S. secretary of defense stipulated $63. 56 million. This  project envisions realigning military technologies and potential  to civilian tracks and establishing an exports control system.  The latter is to prevent the proliferation of mass annihilation  armaments from Belarus to other states and to restore the  environment at former strategic missile facilities. Belarus is  to provide material and technical assistance and services  necessary to establish a communications hot-line with the  Republic. A further increase in assistance will depend on the  progress of economic reform in Belarus, including privatization  and denationalization.    I would like to point out that Belarus will not receive  these  financial means in "monetary" form -- they will be apparatuses  for discovering nuclear substances and narcotics, communication  equipment for customs checkpoints, and the like.    [Grigorovich] Will any joint structures and organs be formed  to step up our economic relations?    [Radkevich] Belarus and the United States have agreed to  form a bilateral committee for promoting business. Its efforts  will be directed at revealing and resolving problems hampering  business activities. The committee will be headed by U.S.  Department of Commerce Adviser Jan Kalicki and S. Atroshchenko,  deputy chairman of the State Committee for Foreign Economic  Relations.    A U.S. business center will be opened in Minsk. The project  has been approved by the United States Agency for International  Development. The opening of the center is scheduled for the  first half of 1994. The U.S. Congress has already earmarked $7  million for establishing business centers in Russia and other  CIS states. The share for Belarus is $1 million.    [Grigorovich] On the eve of President Clinton's visit to  Minsk, the Belarusian Ministry of Finance reportedly signed a  general accord with the U.S. Exports and Imports Bank on  stimulating projects.    [Radkevich] The signing of this agreement was preceded by  strenuous work. We are very grateful to the U.S. Embassy in  Minsk for the assistance they rendered.    All in all, our Republic may receive some $1 billion from  the  credit line opened by the Eximbank for Belarus. Only those  projects will be subsidized whose priority meaning for the  national economy will be confirmed by the Belarusian Ministry of  Finance and the National Bank.    [Grigorovich] How do you assess the general state of  Belarusian-U.S. relations?    [Radkevich] Relations between our states have been  constantly expanding and developing. Preliminary data  demonstrate that the aggregate products turnover between Belarus  and the United States reached $126 million in 1993. The U.S.  credit line has been fully utilized, which gives grounds to hope  that it will be expanded in the future. U.S. business circles  have been manifesting a growing interest in our Republic. As of  today, U.S. companies have invested in 123 Belarusian  enterprises; 18 firms have opened their branches in Belarus.    Belarus feels the U.S. support on the international arena,  especially in such influential economic organizations as the  International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the  IMF, which allocated $226.3 million to Belarus in 1993.</p>

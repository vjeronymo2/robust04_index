			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: Alitalia losses soar to L343bn Losses at Alitalia, Italy's national airline and number four in Europe with more than 20m passengers a year, soared to L343bn (Dollars 214m) in 1993, from L17.6bn in 1992, agencies report from Rome. Revenues in the period rose 9.8 per cent to L5,900bn. The Alitalia airline subsidiary lost L345.6bn, against a deficit of L16.8bn in 1992, the company said. The carrier also noted that results for the first quarter of 1994 show the company lost L190bn. Alitalia said that because losses last year and in the first quarter this year had exceeded one-third of its capital, its shareholders' meeting would have to discuss the company's capital structure. Under Italian law, Alitalia will have to give a special report on the company's capital structure. A recapitalisation will become mandatory if this year's losses do not fall by one-third. Alitalia blamed 1993's results on a number of factors, including a generally depressed international economy; overcapacity in the industry; a strong concentration of demand in business travel; and price wars which were 'without precedent'. Measures the Alitalia board listed as necessary to improve the airline's condition included a 'notable' reduction in staff; improved client service; a strengthening of its activity in northern Italy; an examination of subsidiary assets; a 'decisive' intervention into costs generally; and a re-examination of cockpit work rules. Alitalia registered a 5.3 per cent rise in international passengers in 1993, but a sharp 10 per cent drop in domestic boardings, which reflected the recession in Italy, the company said. The transport of goods rose 4.8 per cent. Gross operating results for 1993 showed a loss of L129.5bn, while operating results swung to a loss of L80bn from a positive L155bn in 1992. Last year, the company made L791bn worth of investments, of which L146bn was in equity interests and L580bn in equipment, the carrier said.</p>

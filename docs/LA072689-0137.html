			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THATCHER'S RESHUFFLING OF CABINET CALLED A SHAMBLES  </P> <P> Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher tried today to limit the political fallout  from a Cabinet reshuffle that the opposition has described as a shambles.  </P> <P> British newspapers said in virtually identical reports that Thatcher offered  Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe a new post as home secretary -- unbeknown  to the man still in the job, Douglas Hurd, who eventually kept it.  </P> <P> After several hours of discussion with family and friends, Howe turned down the  Home Office and reluctantly opted for Thatcher's other offer -- leadership of  the House of Commons. This makes him effectively the ruling Conservative  Party's parliamentary manager.  </P> <P> But he insisted on being given the courtesy title of deputy prime minister and  the chairmanship of several key committees.  </P> <P> Officials, usually quick to knock down inaccurate or unfavorable leaks, refused  to confirm or deny the newspaper reports.  </P> <P> But political analysts said the reshuffle may have strained ties between  Thatcher and her top three officials: Howe, Hurd and Chancellor of the  Exchequer Nigel Lawson.  </P> <P> Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock described the reshuffle, Britain's biggest  Cabinet shake-up since 1962, as a shambles, and opposition members said Hurd's  position had been undermined.  </P> <P> There had been differences between Thatcher and Howe over some issues, such as  full membership of the European Monetary System, which the prime minister has  always said Britain is not ready to join.  </P> <P> By leaving the Foreign Office, Howe, who has no London home of his own, lost  his official residence in the capital and the country mansion that goes with  the post.  </P> <P> As recompense, Thatcher offered him another country mansion she allocated only  last year to Lawson. The officials said Lawson had agreed to vacate this house,  Dorneywood, but only after holidaying there with his family.  </P></p>

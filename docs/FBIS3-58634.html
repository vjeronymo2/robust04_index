Sir Timothy Lankester, permanent secretary of the Overseas  Development Agency [ODA], told the Commons Public Accounts  Committee that not only had Mr Hurd, Foreign Secretary, taken  the unusual step of overruling his rejection of the Pergau power  scheme, but he had done so in consultation with the Prime  Minister.    Both men were involved in the decision to proceed with an  informal offer of assistance made to the Malaysian government by  Lady Thatcher, when she was Prime Minister in 1989.    The money has gone towards the 417 million pounds cost of a  hydro-electric power project, being built by a consortium  including British construction firms Balfour Beatty and  Trafalgar House.    Yet Sir Timothy, responsible for vetting overseas aid, had  repeatedly warned ministers that Pergau was uneconomic and a  waste of the limited overseas aid budget.    He made his views clear right up until February 1991 when  the  final decision to proceed was taken, he said. He sent two  memoranda to ministers arguing against the project, although he  has been barred from providing MPs with copies of the notes.    Despite the size of the project, which has increased in cost  by a third since 1989, ODA officials began a formal on-site  economic appraisal of Pergau only one day before Lady Thatcher  met the Malaysian prime minister and offered assistance. "there  was great concern at the time (about this). It was  well-recognised that a more substantial appraisal was deserved  before an offer of aid.    "But there was resistance to an appraisal from the  consortium  itself, the DTI [Department of Trade and Industry] and the High  Commission in Kuala Lumpur because they thought it would disturb  the negotiations," Sir Timothy said.    He also took the opportunity to read out a new statement on  the affair from Mr Hurd, whose role has already been criticised  by the National Audit Office.    Praising the conduct of his permanent secretary, the Foreign  Secretary said he had taken his decision "from a wider  perspective" and that it was the "right decision for British  interests".    He added: "We needed to take account, not only of the  commitment made at the highest level, but also to the  consequences for the United Kingdom if we failed to honour that  commitment.    "Ministers decided that the Government, despite the increase  in price, were bound by the undertaking given earlier."    Mr Hurd pointed out that British sales to Malaysia rose from  226 million pounds in 1986 to 635 million pounds in 1992. At one  time, Malaysia had conducted a "Buy British Last" campaign, Sir  Timothy added.    Labour MPs sought to establish links between the aid offer  and a simultaneous 1 billion [U.S. trillion] pound defence  contract awarded by Malaysia. It is illegal for ministers to use  aid as a means of securing defence sales but Sir Timothy would  not be drawn on the allegations.</p>

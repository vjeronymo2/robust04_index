Gromov, Russian Federation Navy </F> Commander-in-Chief; this article is published in its entirety in  the first issue of MORSKOY SBORNIK for 1994: "Summarizing the  Results of the Past Year and Looking at Next Year"]    [Text] Owing to fundamental changes in the domestic and  foreign policy of the world's leading countries and expansion of  their political and economic cooperation, the modern  military-political situation is characterized by a decrease in  the probability of nuclear missile war, as well as of a major  armed collision involving conventional weapons. At the same time  the danger of military conflicts remains in certain regions of  the world and on Russia's southern borders, including in  territories of former Soviet republics. This danger has  economic, social, political and religious roots.    With regard for the present trends in the development of the  military-political situation, the leading states of the West and  the East are reexamining their foreign policy goals, their  international obligations and their military doctrine and  strategy. Emphasis is being laid in this case mainly on  providing for regional security and preventing crises in  different regions, with a special role being reserved for naval  forces and deep reexamination of the concepts of their  development and use.    The Russian Navy is fully involved in this process as well.  The missions of the fleets in peace and in war have been  refined, the effective combat strength and numerical strength of  the Navy are being decreased, new forms of manning the fleets  with highly professional personnel are being developed, and a  complex of measures to improve the organizational structure of  large strategic formations and combined units and to create new  elements of their basing in the country's territory are being  implemented. Much work has been done to substantiate the future  development of both the Navy as a whole and its component  services. Views on operational use and training of the fleets  have changed significantly. The extent of the measures, their  succession and their deadlines have been updated. Their actual  implementation will depend to a significant degree on  stabilization of the economy and of budget appropriations for  development of the Navy.    Measures of trust between the navies of Russia and other  countries continue to strengthen. Evidence of this can be found  in reciprocal visits and joint exercises at sea. Last year  detachments of our ships visited ports in the United States,  Canada, Great Britain, China, France, Norway, Germany, Denmark,  Turkey and South Korea. Joint tactical exercises, some involving  combat drills employing practice weapons, were conducted with  the navies of Canada, the United States and Great Britain. Not  only did these cruises have political significance, but they  also promoted further improvement of the naval skills of the  crews of our ships.    The tasks assigned to the Navy for 1993 have generally been  completed. In the complex conditions of the Navy's  reorganization and limited financing, we were able to preserve  the existing combat readiness of the principal large strategic  formations and combined units of the fleets, and their  capability for promptly switching from a peacetime to a wartime  footing in organized fashion, and carrying out their main  operational missions within set time.    Despite the difficulties associated with manning the crews  and maintaining the technical readiness of the ships, the  intensity and effectiveness of their combat service and alert  duty have risen somewhat. Strategic missile submarines patrolled  their designated areas and maintained alert duty at their bases,  ready to carry out their missions. General-purpose forces  supported their ability to stand up in combat and monitored the  reconnaissance activities of foreign navies. Ships of the  Pacific Fleet successfully carried out their missions in  coordination with multinational forces in the Persian Gulf,  demonstrating Russia's support to United Nations sanctions  against Iraq, while part of the Black Sea Fleet forces provided  assistance to Georgia in stabilizing the situation in Poti.    Measures of operational, mobilizational and combat training  were conducted more intensively last year. In them, the  practical skills of the command and staffs in controlling the  forces, and the means of operational use of forces in  combined-arms and strategic operations to repel an aerospace  invasion by an adversary were honed.    Command-and-staff exercises on maps, and joint  command-and-staff and staff training exercises conducted without  the participation of designated forces were the principal forms  of operational and mobilizational training. This made it  possible to maintain and improve the practical skills of  commanders and staffs at the operational level to control the  forces, but at the same time it reduced the number of sea  cruises by ships and flights by aviation, which had a negative  effect on the proficiency of naval and air units.    Combat training in the naval forces went generally according  to plan in 1993--intensively and rhythmically. The best results  were attained by the Northern Fleet, the large strategic  formations and combined units under the command of captains 1st  Rank S. Simenenko, V. Shchegolev, V. Krikunov and N. Temerev,  and submarines under the command of captains 1st Rank V.  Zakharov and A. Yefanov and Captain 2d Rank V. Kvasov.    At the same time we were unable to achieve noticeable  improvement in combat training. Training and exercises were  conducted in certain combined units and units at a low  organizational and methodological level, and they failed to  provide for full, high-quality work on specific functional  responsibilities of maintaining the high combat readiness of  subordinated forces and their effective execution of combat  training missions. Little attention was devoted to finding and  mastering new tactics for the forces. Training was often  dominated by passive forms, without the use of shore-based  trainers and classrooms. The necessary measures to intensify  combat training by improving the procedures of exercises, drills  and training were not implemented.    Given the acute shortage of fuel and reduction of allocated  engine life, stiffer requirements should have been imposed on  the planning of tasks carried out by ships at sea. Every ship  cruise should have been utilized with maximum effectiveness,  with mutual support among different component services in  practicing the missions for which they are intended, and with  integrated use of weapons. But these requirements have not yet  become a mandatory norm in all fleets.    Naval Aviation successfully embarked upon mastering the  Su-27k deck-landing fighter in 1993, completing its tasks of  combat service with high indicators. Air Force units of the  Northern Fleet commanded by colonels I. Bokhonko and N.  Levchenko may be mentioned as having done well. Reasonable  results were attained by ASW [antisubmarine warfare] personnel  of the Air Forces of the Pacific Fleet headed by colonels V.  Udarov and A. Akhmeddyanov, and of the Baltic Fleet Air Forces  commanded by Colonel N. Somov.    The Navy's shore-based forces successfully mastered new  means  of combat and prepared themselves for actions as elements of a  combined air and sea attack echelon of an assault force, and for  defense of important naval objectives and of portions of the  seacoast accessible to assault forces, in coordination with  other naval forces and combined ground troop units.    Despite objective difficulties associated with having the  troops carry out missions atypical of them and the great  shortage of personnel, the combat training plans were basically  fulfilled in all combined units and units. Combat training  proceeded intensively and at a high level of quality in the  combined naval infantry unit under the command of Colonel A.  Smolyak. Good results were attained by gunners under the  leadership of Colonel M. Kumshatskiy and by naval infantry under  the command of Major V. Novikov. Missilemen under the leadership  of colonels A. Zabavin and S. Kazachukhin successfully completed  all combat exercises. Combat training was poorer in the combined  unit under the command of Colonel Ye. Kocheshkov, in which  mistakes in organizational work by officers were the cause of  insufficient preparedness of command and control elements and of  poor fire skills of the personnel.    On the whole, last year the objectives of operational,  mobilizational and combat training were reached with better  quality in the Northern Fleet.    Unsolved problems in ship repair, in the repair of utilities  and communication networks, and in supporting bases with  technical resources, some of which are beyond their useful life,  obsolete and worn out, also had a negative effect on fleet  training progress.    Equipment failure still remains high aboard ships and  vessels  of the fleet. In this case around 60 percent of the total  failures are technical ones having the following as their  principal causes: poor work organization, weak special training  of personnel, and failure to fulfill requirements of the  leadership and operating instructions. The quality of technical  maintenance and preparation of ships for sea cruises remains  low, personnel continue to violate fire and explosion safety  requirements during potentially dangerous work, and inspections  of ship hulls, fittings and systems by permanent ship  commissions are poor in certain combined units.    The role of staff specialists in providing for and  maintaining the technical readiness of ships has been diminished  in the fleets. Requirements on them in carrying out routine  scheduled inspections are relaxed, and measures to eliminate  faults and raise the level of repair training of the personnel  are not being implemented promptly. The internal resources of  combined units and ships for carrying out high quality planned  preventive repairs and inspections are not being utilized fully.    The Pacific Fleet combined unit under the command of Rear  Admiral A. Klimenok was the most unfavorable last year in terms  of equipment failure. The rate of equipment failures associated  with ship control did not decrease. In this case half of the  incidents of this sort occurred in the Black Sea Fleet.    The morale of naval personnel is evaluated as stable. While  the situation aboard ships and in the units is being monitored  and is under control, it remains complex. Despite unfavorable  trends, most military collectives are distinguished by proper  observance of regulations, good organization, and healthy  cohesiveness of all categories of servicemen, which is generally  making it possible to successfully carry out missions and  maintain the fighting capability of fleet forces. This was  promoted in many ways by the personal example set by the  absolute majority of commanders and chiefs in fulfillment of  their official and military duty, by certification of officer  personnel, and by initiation of the transition to contract  service.    A lack of concreteness in efforts to implement measures of  social and legal protection of servicemen is a serious  shortcoming in the organizational and educational activities of  commanders, staffs and elements in work with personnel. This is  having a negative effect on the morale, mood and behavior of  officers, shore-based and seagoing warrant officers, petty  officers and seamen. As a result considerable tension, conflicts  and negative trends that undermine the foundation of military  service--proper organization and maintenance of law and  order--persist in the military collectives, having a deleterious  effect on the overall level of military discipline.    Last year the Navy was unable to create an integrated system  of training and indoctrination of subordinates in which all  elements of military command and control and educational  elements would participate actively. Contacts with local  authorities, veteran and youth organizations, creative unions  and cultural institutions are being restored too slowly.  Training of commanders and chiefs of all levels and of staff and  service specialists in educational work is sporadic, and it is  insufficiently focused on solving particular problems of combat  training and tightening military discipline.    A number of priority measures were planned in order to  provide for social protection in the Navy. Thus, given a total  of around 30,000 persons without housing, 6,945 apartments were  to be built and 344 spaces were to be obtained in dormitories  with assets appropriated for capital construction. In addition  1,254 apartments were to be obtained from local agencies on the  basis of proportionate participation, and 490 apartments ready  for occupancy were to be purchased. We also planned to open a  school with a capacity of 534 pupils, two children's nurseries  with a capacity of 1,300 children, four dining halls with a  capacity of 955 persons, seven boiler plants, three treatment  plants and a number of other facilities. However, insufficient  and irregular financing permitted us to fulfill our plan by only  72 percent. Consequently the Navy has approved the target of  obtaining around 11,500 apartments in 1994 by means of its own  construction efforts and through proportionate participation.    Summarizing the results of the past year, it should be noted  that despite objective and subjective economic, social and legal  causes, the Navy was generally able to successfully reach the  main goal--maintaining the attained level of combat and  mobilizational readiness.    The Russian Navy faces complex and important goals in 1994.    Regarding combat readiness: The main efforts must be  concentrated on maintaining the composition and condition of  naval strategic nuclear forces at a level ensuring guaranteed  fulfillment of assigned missions in any situation.  General-purpose forces need to be kept in a state of readiness  permitting them to repel aggression of local or regional scale  from the oceans and seas.    As before, combat service and alert duty having the purpose  of promptly revealing preparations for an armed invasion or  development of a threatening situation and taking the necessary  steps to raise the combat readiness of the fleets remain the  principle forms of maintaining high combat readiness of the  forces.    All organizational and technical measures must be  implemented  to preclude a surprise attack, and to ensure effective  reconnaissance, prompt augmentation of the readiness of forces  and their deployment, and the capability for cutting off  aggression quickly.    Comprehensive rehearsal in organizing transfer of the fleets  from a peacetime to a wartime footing with regard for different  scenarios should be considered to be the most important  direction of improving combat readiness. In carrying out this  task, we need to attain efficient organization of the work of  command and control elements and coordinated fulfillment of  planned measures at all levels in order to raise the forces to  the highest degree of combat readiness, and we need to correct  the shortcomings revealed on the basis of the results for 1993.  Considering intensive implementation of organizational and  staffing measures and reduction of the numerical and effective  combat strength of the fleets, we need to constantly account for  these changes, and promptly take the appropriate steps to  provide for and maintain the prescribed level of combat  readiness.    Implementing the law of the Russian Federation "On the State  Border of the Russian Federation," the Navy needs to work on a  system for defending Russia's state borders in the underwater  environment with naval forces and resources, and begin its  practical check-out.    We have to carry out a complex of tasks to qualitatively  renew ships, armament and military equipment, reduce their  assortment and improve ship basing conditions and all other  forms of support. The work of accommodating forces of the Baltic  and Black Sea fleets and the Caspian Flotilla at new bases in  the Russian Federation, and efforts to withdraw armament,  ammunition, materials and equipment from Latvia, Estonia and  Belarus will be continued.    Quick mastery of new ships, airplanes, helicopters and  modern  types of armament and military equipment entering the forces is  an important task for the fleets. In order to reach the  objectives of operational training, the basic efforts must be  concentrated on high quality fulfillment of planned measures and  on supporting the readiness of commanders and staffs to control  the forces during preparation and conduct of operations and  combat activities. Special attention should be devoted to  rehearsing organization of coordination of fleet forces with  combined units and large strategic formations of other armed  services, and to studying and analyzing the problems of  operational use of fleet forces in armed conflicts, local wars  and emergencies.    The methods of operational training need to be improved on  the basis of wide introduction and intensive use of computers  and of systems and resources for automation of the command and  control of forces, troops and weapons. We need to actively  develop and introduce computer games into the training of  command and control elements, upgrade the quality with which  exercises, training and lessons are prepared and carried out,  and strive to achieve an integrated approach in conducted all  training measures. Operational-tactical and command-and-staff  exercises need to be conducted simultaneously with several large  strategic formations which would pursue joint missions in  accordance with their operational purpose and which would  operate in a single zone (region). In this case in planning the  measures of operational and combat training we need to account  for the economic and financial aspects of their implementation,  analyze the results, and when necessary, adjust the plans and  guidelines according to established procedure.    In carrying out the tasks of combat training, we need to  continue improving preparation of combined units and units for  combat activities within the composition of groupings of  heterogeneous forces, and we need to seek and master new,  effective tactics of their use. We need to rehearse formation  and deployment of groupings, organization of support to their  combat stability, all forms of defense, and the tactics of naval  combat with the enemy's ship groupings with the support of air  forces, fleet shore-based missile and artillery forces and  fighter aviation of combined air defense units.    Preparation of heterogenous ASW forces should be oriented on  improving the means of seeking, tracking and destroying  submarines, and on integrated use of all forms of ASW weapons  utilizing acoustic and nonacoustic search equipment.    In tactical exercises we need to continually practice the  actions of ship and aviation reconnaissance and strike groups in  conducting reconnaissance and providing targeting information to  strike forces, and rehearse integrated use of electronic  countermeasures, concealment and other forms of support.    Integrated training at sea must become the principal method  of combat training. It must be supported by a clearly developed,  fully equipped and tightly controlled training base. It should  be organized in such a way as to impose a full training load on  shore-based trainers, practice ranges and classrooms, and to  make maximum possible use of command and control systems and  ship weapon and equipment systems in the practical training of  the crews. The organization of basic exercises conducted by  large strategic formations needs to be improved.    All of these measures need to pursue a single goal--keeping  the naval, field and flying skills of the personnel from  deteriorating.    Maintaining ships, airplanes, armament and equipment in  constant readiness and mobilizing all personnel to maintain  equipment entrusted to them in serviceable and combat ready  condition must become a constant concern of commanders and  staffs in the course of combat training.    In organizing government and social training, we need to  concentrate our main efforts on shaping and improving the  professional knowledge of the personnel, moral and psychological  qualities, the readiness to defend the fatherland, faithfulness  to military duty, discipline, and pride in and responsibility  for membership in the Russian Navy, with its 300-year heroic  history.    Fuller use needs to be made of this form of training in  order  to develop psychological, educational and legal knowledge and  skills in regular military personnel. Forms of training that are  most active, democratic and demonstrative, and which have the  greatest emotional impact, should be constantly introduced into  the training process.    Educational work should be oriented in the new training year  on supporting the moral and psychological stability and  discipline of all categories of personnel, on preserving the  cohesiveness of military collectives and on reinforcing an  aggressive attitude in the servicemen in carrying out their  missions. In this case all personnel involved in education must  be required to exhibit maximum sensitivity and efficiency in  their reactions to fluctuations in the mood of servicemen, and  flexibility in their choice of the methods and resources of  influencing them, and they must consider the unique features of  each category of personnel, of every group and of each separate  individual.    The primary military collectives--the ship, the company, the  battery--must be the focus of application of educational efforts.    Ideology oriented chiefly on patriotism and professionalism,  faithfulness to constitutional duty, responsibility for assigned  work, and the merit and honor of a soldier and citizen must be  introduced more boldly into the educational process.    All forms of organizational and educational work must be  used  to attain the highest possible increase in the responsibility of  each official for the state of military discipline, for the  state of affairs aboard ships and in military units and  subunits, and for the effectiveness of measures to prevent  incidents, crimes and losses of human life.    Eradication of jeering and humiliation, of crimes against  chain of command, of evasion of military service, of outrages  against the local population, and of misappropriation of state  and military property, especially small arms, should be  considered to be a priority task, as should preventing death and  injury of servicemen, accidents, and disasters involving  military equipment and armament.    One of the main directions in the activity of the commanders  of staffs and personnel departments, and of all officers, must  be daily concern for the material and personal needs of the  personnel, medical services, cultured leisure time for  servicemen and their families, analysis of urgent problems and  the of the needs and requests of subordinates, and their timely  resolution.    Officers should be selected and placed with regard for  certification results. Personnel issues must be resolved quickly  at all levels, in such a way as to ensure that executive  positions are filled by trained, promising officers, admirals  and generals, and to maintain continuity of leadership. Work  with young officers needs to be improved. Steps must be taken to  eliminate causes and conditions compelling young officers to  submit applications for discharge from active military duty.    This article describes only the most important results of  work in 1993 and the objectives of the new training year.    I am certain that fleet personnel will carry out their tasks  with honor and merit. For this, they will need to work with full  effort, study hard, and attain high end results in their work in  their assigned areas of activity.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PENTAGON SPENDING AND CLOSING BASES  </P> <P> If the shipyard at Long Beach were to be closed, it would be a strategic error.  It will be the Navy and the Defense Department, not the many people who work  there, that will suffer a tremendous loss.  </P> <P> The Navy has not lost money, but rather saved funds that would otherwise have  been spent unnecessarily. Being the only naval shipyard on the West Coast, the  Long Beach shipyard is of key importance to the Navy. If the shipyard were to  be closed, the Navy would be forced to send its ships to civilian yards, thus  adding to the cost of the upkeep of our Navy.  </P> <P> Before conducting such rash actions as the shipyard closure, Secretary Cheney  and Congress must carefully analyze the probable consequences that may result.  </P> <P> HELEN KNIPE  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Fire Loss -- Insurance covered the majority of costs resulting from a 1985 fire  at the Huntington Art Gallery.  </P> <P> A Friday article on conservation of fire-damaged art erroneously reported that  about half of the Huntington's $1-million bill for cleanup and renovation was  paid by government grants and that private donations covered the rest. In fact,  the Huntington received an emergency grant of $30,000 from the National  Endowment for the Humanities and a grant of $17,500 from the National Endowment  for the Arts. Individuals, foundations and corporations contributed an  additional $72,000. Insurance covered damage to the building.  </P></p>

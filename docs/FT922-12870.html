			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK milk board submits plan to become co-op THE MILK Marketing Board for England and Wales yesterday submitted to the government its proposals to become a single voluntary co-operative with pooled prices. The UK Agriculture Ministry late last year began to increase pressure on the MMB to reform itself, and set an Easter deadline for plans to be submitted. Once past the ministry the proposal will go before the European Commission. The MMB plans, originally announced in January, include spinning off Dairy Crest, its wholly-owned subsidiary with a 25 per cent share of the UK's manufactured dairy products market. Shares in Dairy Crest will be transferred to dairy farmers on the basis of milk supplied in the past over a given period. Mr Bob Steven, chairman of the MMB, said: 'Implementation of our proposal is subject to discussion with the Dairy Trade Federation, Maff (the ministry) and UK regulatory bodies and the EC. We will do all we can to avoid unnecessary delays to achieve our objectives'. The DTF, which represents dairies and processors, welcomed 'the end of uncertainty', but said that any changes to the MMB 'must lead to a genuinely free market in raw milk'.</p>

			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / A top-hat tradition in the balance: Winds of change are threatening to topple London's discount houses 300 years after they were founded Some people regard them as the most noble institutions in the City of London. Others think that they should die. The City's discount houses are in the thick of a revolution that may extinguish their activities. For as long as anyone can remember, these money market dealers have played a crucial role in the Bank of England's sterling operations, acting as the valves through which liquidity passes from the Bank to the commercial banks. But now, nearly three centuries after they were founded, voices in the City are saying these dealers have outlived their usefulness. 'They are ancient history, a complete anachronism,' says Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist of Yamaichi International in London and co-author of a book on the sterling money market. Critics charge that London is looking increasingly out of step as the only European financial centre to use such intermediaries as discount houses in its money market operations. 'Given the expansion of the money markets globally, they now have a place only in the history books,' Mr MacKinnon says. The nine members of the London Discount Market Association, with names like King and Shaxson or Gerrard and National, still retain the image of old-fashioned houses which, elsewhere in the City, became an anomaly after its financial markets were deregulated by the Big Bang of 1986. A few still cling to their traditions, wearing top hats when they turn up at Threadneedle Street to borrow money from the Bank in the early afternoon, or holding a ritual meeting with the Bank's governor once a week. Their relationship with the central bank is jealously guarded. If the commercial banks are short of cash, one way they can balance their books is by borrowing money from a discount house. The commercial banks obtain cash by selling an eligible bill, essentially a post-dated cheque, to a discount house which, in turn, sells it to the Bank. The rates at which the Bank lends to the discount houses influence the level of lending rates throughout the banking system. This intermediary role is now under attack from several fronts: British clearing banks - in the past year, the balance of power in the money market has shifted towards the clearers, as the Bank of England has allowed the protection given to the discount market to be eroded. In the 1970s, the Bank ruled that the commercial banks had to place a proportion of assets in the form of secured callable deposits with the discount market. This cash, which averaged around 5 per cent of a bank's eligible liabilities, was known as 'club money' and gave the discount houses an assured source of funding at lower rates than those in the market. In the past year, the 'club money' practice has faded. Commercial banks no longer have to place a minimum level of funds with the discount houses. Instead, they have begun keeping larger stocks of bills on their books. This gives the bigger clearing banks greater leverage over the market. A common practice among clearers is to push short-term rates in the money markets downwards when it suits their books, by passing many bills on to the discount houses at once. They can deploy bills in the quantities they need to, rather than relying on the liquidity services of the discount houses. Another challenge comes from the plans for monetary convergence envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty on European Monetary Union (Emu). The Bank of England's operations are unlike those in the other 11 EC countries. In Germany, for example, the Bundesbank deals directly with the nation's banks rather than through intermediaries. It keeps a tight rein over day-to-day money market developments by obliging banks to place minimum reserves in non-interest-bearing accounts at the central bank and, by way of compensation, operates a limited discount window for the banks at favourable interest rates. The Bundesbank operates only once a week in the open market, rather than every day as the Bank of England does. 'It is a lot simpler on the continent,' says one money market trader in London. 'If there is monetary union, Britain will have to resort to the European way.' Last month, Mr Eddie George, deputy governor of the Bank of England, also hinted that the Bank was less committed to the discount market principle. He said some of the subtlety of national money market techniques, 'tailored to national market circumstances', could be lost in the move to Emu. The discount houses' profits are being eroded by the British government's cautious policy on base rates. When base rates move sharply downward, the discount houses make larger profits because the capital value rises of the bills they hold. But in the past year, the Bank has pursued a policy of infrequent rate cuts. Sterling's membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism has tended to reduce volatilities in the cash market, and in the short sterling futures market where the discount houses are also big players. The discount houses have tried diversifying. Gerrard and National, for example, has gone into financial futures broking and gilt-edged market-making. But another house, Union Discount, was stung when it attempted to go into leasing. Its chief executive stepped down earlier this year after the company reported a 1991 loss of Pounds 21.3m. The discount house dealers are not taking the erosion of their position lightly. They argue that it is harming London's prestige as a financial centre. 'We have the most sophisticated short-term paper market in Europe and the value of our techniques should not be underestimated,' said one discount house trader last week. Another broker says the growing domination of the British clearers makes it harder for foreign banks to invest in the sterling money market. He says a handful of clearing banks can push short-term interest rates to levels far from base rates, by deploying large numbers of bills when it suits their books. In recent weeks, for example, the overnight rate for sterling in the cash market has oscillated between 5 per cent and 20 per cent, even though base rates are at 10 per cent. 'Imagine how the head of treasury in a German bank feels about dealing in the sterling money market under these conditions,' he says. It is unlikely that the Bank of England will desert the discount houses in the immediate future, having had such a close relationship with them over the centuries. But the market is unsure how the Bank will react in the long term, both to the pressures from Britain's clearing banks and the need to conform to continental-style monetary operations in the run-up to Emu.</p>

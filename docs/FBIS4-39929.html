			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Belikov report: "Boeings Replenish Aeroflot"] </F>   [Excerpts] The first Boeing 767 leased by Aeroflot Russian  International Airlines will be handed over in 10 days' time at  the airfield attached to the world's largest aircraft  manufacturing complex near Seattle. The second such aircraft  will be handed over there a week later. [passage omitted]    The details of this unique deal were recounted by A. Brylov,  Aeroflot's deputy executive director:    "The need to take out a five-year lease on the Boeing 767's  was brought about by the fact that the number of transatlantic  flights has increased considerably of late, there will be even  more of them in the very near future, and our route network to  the United States is expanding. We simply do not have the  aircraft to service all these routes. After all, routes to San  Francisco or Chicago have to be flown by modern, highly  comfortable long-haul airliners -- the distances involved are  considerable and the passengers want a nonstop service.  Otherwise they will use another carrier -- all the more so as  the choice of airline on these routes is getting wider and wider.    "The appearance of U.S.-made aircraft in the Aeroflot fleet  will make our airline more competitive. These are reliable  aircraft from the safety angle. They burn far less fuel than  the obsolete Il-62's and the not very suitable Il-86's. It is  also an important factor that American passengers traditionally  place more trust in their own equipment, so this will make them  more willing to fly with a Russian carrier.    "All this," A. Brylov continued, "is going to allow us to  turn flights from the United States from today's loss-makers  into a profitable operation -- provided that the government  authorities meet Aeroflot halfway and allow it to use the  Boeings for five years without having to pay huge customs duties  or import tax. During the five years of the Boeing lease, the  Russian aircraft industry will be able to substantially increase  the number of long-haul Il-96-300's it produces, and the U.S.  airliners will be returned to their owner. For the time being,  they will be beginning regular flights between Moscow and New  York in July."</p>

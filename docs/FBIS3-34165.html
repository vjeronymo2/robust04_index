President  Ilyas al-Hirawi's telephone conversation with Syrian President  Hafiz al-Asad was part of these contacts. Also in this context  is the visit to Damascus last night by Prime Minister Rafiq  al-Hariri and Ministers Muhsin Dallul and Jean 'Ubayd and their  meeting with Syrian Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam and a  number of Syrian officials.    Al-Hariri returned to Beirut this morning and later met with  the visiting World Bank mission to discuss financing of some  projects.</p>

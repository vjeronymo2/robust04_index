			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: How to give children a gift that grows - Scheherazade Daneshkhu looks at presents with long-term benefits Your children tear open their Christmas cards tomorrow to find that some include Pounds 10 notes from godparents while grandmother has written out a cheque for several hundred pounds. You also want to make them a cash gift. Before they get too excited, warn them that you will be taking away most of the money to invest for when they are older. They may not thank you now - but should be grinning eventually when they see the number of noughts added to the original gift. But there are several things you need to watch. The tax position Anthony Fraser, of independent financial adviser Fraser Marr, says that before investing the money 'a sensible precaution is to document the source and who it is for - by means, in the case of a grand-parent, of a simple grand-parent gift letter. This is important to avoid an investment being taxed as the parent's own, rather than taking advantage of the child's tax exemptions and allowances.' The provisions of Section 663 of the Taxes Act 1988 relate only to gifts made by a parent to a child. This results in income derived from the assets being taxed as though the income is the parent's (except where the income is less than Pounds 100 in a tax year). To get around this provision, Barry Stillerman, of accountant Stoy Hayward, suggests a parent should invest in tax-free investments such as some National Savings products and investments which produce no income - say, zero dividend preference shares (see below). 'If you wish to gift money and place the proceeds on deposit, then a simple 'bare trust' could be the answer, provided you are prepared to lock away the money until the child is 18 years of age,' Stillerman adds. Inheritance tax is another consideration for parents wanting to make gifts to their children or other members of the family. Up to Pounds 3,000 a year can be given away without being considered a potentially exempt transfer (a gift is potentially exempt because it will be liable to IHT if the donor dies within seven years of making the gift). You can also make a gift of up to Pounds 250 in any tax year to any number of individuals without liability to pay IHT. The Pounds 3,000 relief can be carried forward for one year only. So, if you have not used up any of last year's exemption, you can give away as much as Pounds 6,000 this tax year without risking IHT. Regular gifts to members of the family may escape IHT altogether; this is a much neglected provision. 'If your income less tax and your normal annual spending leaves you with a surplus, then such gifts may be made out of this surplus,' says Stillerman. 'If, for example, your income is Pounds 100,000 and your income tax bill Pounds 35,000 each year, then you have Pounds 65,000 to spend. If you spend only Pounds 50,000 a year, then there should be a surplus of Pounds 15,000, and so you could make regular gifts out of income up to this figure.' But the money must be given regularly and you should record clearly your intention to make a regular gift. Deposits If you are opening a deposit account for a child, the table (provided by Moneyfacts) shows a selection of those that yield the highest. Many can be opened with Pounds 1. The highest minimum deposit is Norwich &amp; Peterborough's HeadStart savings bond, which pays 6.3 per cent gross on Pounds 250 to a maximum of Pounds 500,000. Despite its name, it operates as an instant access account. Skipton's Young Sovereign account is paying 6.5 per cent gross on a minimum of Pounds 25 (maximum Pounds 3,000) and is also instant access. There is an additional 2 per cent bonus (gross) if no withdrawals are made until December 1 1994. Children are entitled to their own personal allowance of Pounds 3,445, but you need to fill in form R85 (available from banks and building societies) to declare that the child is a non-taxpayer so that the interest is received gross. Investments A low risk investment is the National Savings children's bond, although the rate was lowered last week to 7.35 per cent compound per annum if held for five years. Application forms are not yet in the post offices but you can order one by ringing freephone 0800-868 700. The maximum holding of all previous issues of the bond (up to and including issue E) is Pounds 1,000 but you can, in addition, hold Pounds 1,000 of the new issue F. The children's bond is an investment which is particularly suitable for parents giving to their offspring since it is tax-free (see tax position above). Another idea for parents is to make use of the child's capital gains tax allowance of Pounds 5,800 by investing in zero dividend preference shares, which do not produce income. Zeros are one class of share issued by a split capital investment trust. Since they do not pay a dividend, they have first claim on the trust's capital when it comes to be wound up. Robert Noble Warren, of Murray Noble, says: 'Zeros such as Scottish National and St Davids are generally regarded as safe. Many zeros are on track to produce 6 to 7 per cent per annum, and this should be tax-free in the child's hands up to the child's capital gains tax allowance.' Baby bonds are a long-term savings plan issued by friendly societies. You can invest up to Pounds 18 a month (or Pounds 200 a year) on behalf of the child in a tax-exempt fund, and the lump sum when the bond matures (after at least 10 years) is also tax-free. Tony Shepherd, of independent financial adviser Shepherd Associates, recommends Tunbridge Wells Equitable's with-profits baby bond. 'The past performance has been good despite relatively high charges usually associated with low premium products, but future results may not be so impressive if unit-linked performance is a guide,' he says. Other longer-term investments are unit and investment trusts. According to the Association of Unit Trust and Investment Funds, the easiest way to invest in units for someone under 18 is to establish a designated account: you buy the investment in your own name but add the child's initials to indicate who owns it. The Association of Investment Trust Companies says the most usual way to place money in such trusts is for an adult to act as a 'bare trustee' by registering the shares in his name with the child's name or initials added, to signify that the purchase is not for the beneficial ownership of the adult. If you are a parent and are investing your own money for the child, you might wish to choose a low-yielding fund to minimise your income tax bill. For those wanting capital growth and higher risk, Shepherd suggests such collective funds as F&amp;C Smaller Companies, F&amp;C Emerging Markets, Murray Smaller Markets, and Perpetual International Emerging Companies. His recommendations for balanced growth and medium risk are Foreign &amp; Colonial investment trust, Monks investment trust, and Perpetual International Growth unit trust. Fraser adds that a child might find it fun to have part of his money invested in premiums bonds now that the jackpot has been increased to Pounds 1m.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CHILDREN'S ACCOUNTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                               Notice/                                     Account      Telephone       term  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High Street Selection  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Halifax bs                Little Xtra/Quest    0422 333333    Instant The Leeds bs                    Liquid Gold    0532 438181    Instant National &amp; Provincial bs    Instant Reserve    0274 733444    Instant Norwich &amp; Peterborough bs   Head Start bond    0733 371371    Instant Skipton bs                  Young Sovereign    0756 700511    Instant  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Others  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cambridge bs                         First*    0223 315440    Instant Chorley &amp; District bs      Young Chorleian*    0257 279373    Instant Monmouthshire bs               Young Savers    0633 840454    Instant Scarborough bs            Young Super Saver    0723 368155    Instant Universal bs                      Childrens   091 232 0973    Instant  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     Minimum           Rate        Int.                                     deposit            %          paid  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High Street Selection  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Halifax bs                        Pounds 10           3.75     1/2 Yly The Leeds bs                       Pounds 1           3.75         Yly National &amp; Provincial bs           Pounds 1           3.80         Yly Norwich &amp; Peterborough bs        Pounds 250           6.30     1/2 Yly Skipton bs                        Pounds 25           6.50A        Yly  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Others  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cambridge bs                       Pounds 1           6.50         Yly Chorley &amp; District bs              Pounds 5           7.45         Yly Monmouthshire bs                  Pounds 10           5.00     1/2 Yly Scarborough bs                    Pounds 10           4.75         Yly Universal bs                       Pounds 1           6.00         Yly  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Account     Notice/    Minimum    Rate   Int.                                       term      deposit     %     paid  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- National Savings                       Investment     1 Month  Pounds 20    5.25%   Yly                 Childrens Bond F     5 Year   Pounds 25    7.35%F   OE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All rates subject to change without notice; check before investing.

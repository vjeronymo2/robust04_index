			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: France The perversity of stock markets is a wonderful thing. With the economic news from France worsening by the day, the CAC-40 index last week surged through the 2,000 barrier, adding the gloss to an 8 per cent rise since the start of the year. Yesterday's elections were the proximate cause; the anticipation of interest rate cuts the broader justification. The tide of euphoria surrounding the incoming market-friendly government looks likely to last a while. The CAC's all-time high of 2,129 may yet be breached this year with the conservatives keen to show they can make a better fist of the economy than the Socialists. The government's privatisation programme could raise more than FFr20bn (Pounds 2.5bn) this year to fund a spot of reflation. The commitment to the franc fort should remain solid. Nevertheless, France's fine inflation record could permit interest rates to fall from 11 per cent to 6 per cent by the year-end. Much depends, though, on the speed with which German interest rates drop. If the Bundesbank moves too slowly, high interest rates will inflict real damage on the French economy. Economic growth is stalling. The recent dismal stream of corporate news suggests earnings and dividends will come under severe pressure. The strong franc has thrown grit into France's export machine. The equity market is gambling that, if the Bundesbank proves too grudging, the franc fort policy will face the guillotine.</p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Economic worries hit Venezuela debt ratings Moody's, the international credit rating agency, has lowered the rating for Venezuela's long-term foreign currency bearer bonds to Ba2 from Ba1 and the rating for non-bearer bonds to Ba3 from Ba2. About Dollars 21bn (Pounds 14.3bn) worth of rated debt is affected. The agency said Venezuela faced a period of difficult policy choices regarding its weak domestic economy, the deterioration in public sector finances and rising social pressures. 'The imbalances can only be corrected gradually, which may hurt the long-term creditworthiness of the country.' It added that the decline in oil prices since 1992 had accentuated many of the underlying structural problems of the economy and had highlighted the weaknesses in the composition of fiscal revenues. The country is also still experiencing problems in the banking sector following the failure in January of Banco Latino, the country's second largest bank. Six private banks are believed to be dependent on government financial assistance following heavy withdrawals in the wake of the Latino crisis.</p>

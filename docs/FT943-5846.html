			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: NIE in demand While the rest of the electricity sector paused for breath after the startling post-distribution review, shares in Northern Ireland Electricity forged ahead to match their all-time high as the market responded to news that the IRA had declared a cessation of violence in the province from midnight yesterday. Analysts focused on the potential benefits to NIE from the ceasefire, which include a substantial saving on the cost of intensive security at its installations in the province and expected closer ties with the Republic of Ireland. Analysts estimated that the savings on security costs could come out at Pounds 0.5m and pointed to the good opportunities for NIE to export electricity to the Republic, which suffers from supply shortages. Other bull points for NIE included increased US investment in Northern Ireland which, if involving investment in manufacturing, would flow into NIE's core home market. Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, and a long-time bull of NIE, forecast that NIE's current 3 per cent yield discount would go out to 10 to 15 per cent and said positive sentiment would drive the NIE share price. The broker's fair value estimate for NIE is 450p. The stock ended 21 dearer at 419p, having touched 421p. Internationally traded stocks with a heavy US presence came under pressure as a result of a weak Wall Street. SmithKline Beecham attracted profit-taking following the earlier boost from its acquisition of Sterling Health. There was also talk that one small US broker was taking a negative view of the stock but dealers who arbitrage between the US and London said the main selling came from the UK. The 'A' shares fell 10 1/2 to 455p and the Units slipped 10 to 411p. Zeneca moved back 6 to 839p in spite of getting marketing approval in Italy for one of its products and filing in the UK for approval to sell a cancer treatment. Elsewhere, Reed International retreated 10 to 785p as it announced its plans to take a big stake in computer magazine group Ziff Communications. Banks performed strongly, with the two Scottish banks the sector's outstanding stocks. Royal Bank of Scotland was 10 higher at 426p after further aggressive institutional demand and Bank of Scotland 8 stronger at 208p. TSB was the most heavily traded bank stock, with the market bracing itself for a big buy recommendation. The shares climbed 5 1/2 to a two-month high of 222p. Schroders raced up 48 to a record 1508p ahead of interims due tomorrow. Provident Financial was up 18 at 541p in the wake of excellent half-year numbers. The day's biggest decline in the Footsie stocks was in aero-engines group Rolls-Royce as several brokers took profits ahead of today's interim figures. The shares fell 10 to 188p in trade of 4.9m, with BZW and Credit Lyonnais Laing among the leading sellers. Sentiment was further dampened by vague talk in some quarters that the group would announce provisions for the benefit of its power division. High street retailer Body Shop bounced 11 to 216p, with Robert Fleming said to have turned positive. Kingfisher fell 15 to 539p in reaction to the decision by leading French banks to raise their interest rates. The move was expected to hit the group's French subsidiary Darty. Food retailer Argyll shed 12 to 295p after James Capel advised investors to sell. Brewer Bass gained 10 at best before closing 6 ahead at 593p. James Capel and UBS were both cited as recommending the shares. The two building sectors included a welter of strong performers. In the housebuilders, Persimmon advanced 10 to 262p after better than expected interims. James Capel was said to have been the driving force behind strong performances of Blue Circle, 12 higher at 322p, and Redland, 14 firmer at 562p. BZW was responsible for lifting Pilkington 2 1/2 to 197p. Aran Energy, one of the smaller oil exploration stocks, attracted some aggressive buying amid rumours of drilling success west of the Shetlands. The stock moved forward 1 1/2 to 39 1/2 p.</p>

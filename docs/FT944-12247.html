			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: De Morgan in second half loss De Morgan Group, the property sector advice company, expects to be able to inform shareholders about its refinancing before the end of this month. The proposals are likely to include the raising of new equity and significant cost savings. In July the company said it was considering its finances following the ending of talks about a large acquisition and fund raising, the costs of which were about Pounds 240,000. De Morgan also reported it had fallen into the red for the second half of the year to April 30 and expected losses for the six months to October 31. However, following the summer period activity had increased and the directors thought the results would show a significant improvement in the next few months. For the year pre-tax profits were Pounds 11,000, against losses of Pounds 258,000, following profits of Pounds 24,000 at the halfway stage. Turnover rose 22 per cent to Pounds 2.33m (Pounds 1.91m). Earnings per share were 0.02p (losses 0.54p).</p>

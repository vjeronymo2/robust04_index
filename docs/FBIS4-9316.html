			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 25 (TANJUG) -- U.N. chief for former  Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi has warned the Bosnian Serbs that a  NATO ultimatum to withdraw their heavy weapons near Gorazde and  other U.N.-designated "safe areas" in Bosnia-Herzegovina would  not at all be interpreted in a flexible way. REUTERS quoted  Akashi as giving this warning at a press conference in Zagreb  late on Sunday. The ultimatum, demanding that the Bosnian Serbs  pull out their heavy weapons 20 km from the centre of Gorazde,  Tuzla, Srebrenica, Bihac and Zepa, U.N.-designated "safe areas",  is due to expire on Wednesday at 3 A.M. (0100 GMT).    Akashi said he hoped that the Bosnian Serb military and  political leadership would consistently observe the relevant  terms and stressed that the Bosnian Serbs could expect no  flexibility in complying with the terms set by the ultimatum.  Drawing attention to the fact that, late on Saturday ahead of  the expiry of the NATO's first ultimatum on the withdrawal of  Bosnian Serb forces to 3 km from Gorazde, NATO asked for a  permission to bomb Serb artillery positions near that Moslem  enclave in the east of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which Akashi refused  to issue, REUTERS quoted a Western diplomats as saying that it  was quite obvious that strong pressure had been put on Akashi  and adding that many wanted air strikes.    The United Nations issued a statement early on Sunday  specifying that U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, and  not Akashi, would have the final word in deciding whether air  strikes should be launched or not. NATO circles maintain that  this change has most probably resulted from the pressure by NATO  Secretary-General Manfred Woerner, who spoke sharply on the  phone with Akashi late on Saturday, but, nevertheless, failed to  persuade the Japanese diplomat to change his stand.    Diplomatic sources say that Akashi caused indignation in  NATO  when he refused to approve air strikes on Saturday, explaining  that the Bosnian Serbs were withdrawing in line with the terms,  although they were not completely observing the set deadline.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Major-General Ivan Nikolayevich Vorobyev under </F> "Army and Society" rubric: "War Without a Front or Rear or  Several Lessons in `Non-stereotypical' Tactics"]    [Text] The Russian Army is living through a complex  period. There are a great many problems that are distracting  military people from their professional business. They are  nevertheless trying not to lose their professionalism. Despite  everything, combat and operational training is continuing in the  forces and they are engaged in their studies and command post  and operational exercises.... The letters to the editor are  symptomatic: Again we are seeing letters form officers  requesting that we more often publish articles on the problems  in the training of the forces and on current trends in the  development of operational art and tactics.    In responding to these requests, we are publishing an  article by Major-General of the Reserves Ivan Nikolayevich  Vorobyev. He is a doctor of military sciences, a professor, and  a meritorious scientist of the Russian Federation. He was born  in Tambov Oblast in 1922. He served in the Soviet Army from 1940  until 1987. In the war, he commanded a platoon, a company, and a  rifle battalion. He worked for a long time in the administration  of the Ministry of Defense. He has a number of scientific works  on the problems of operational art and tactics.  <H5>  Current Problems in Military Science </H5>   In reading the second part of the title, someone will  probably ask: Is it really necessary to subdivide tactics into  various versions? He would say that tactics, as the art of  waging war, must be "universal" and "comprehensive" and must  guarantee the successful training and actions of the forces  under all circumstances.    Yes, that is what the theory teaches. But life, as we know,  is richer. Examples? To bring the forces of the 40th Army that  fought in Afghanistan up to strength, we were forced to train  reinforcements in a special center. Despite the fact that the  personnel selected for this were already sufficiently "broken  in," it was simply necessary to retrain the people, because the  "classical" tactics that they assimilated in the forces,  military schools, and academies was not at all suitable for the  conditions of Afghanistan. In that war, nothing happened as  written in the textbooks. There was no clearly defined front and  rear. The enemy could appear from anywhere and strike at any  time. Under these conditions, our forces needed "nonstandard"  tactics. Unfortunately, however, it was often worked out in the  course of the battle.    A no less typical example is that of the combat actions of  the Americans in Vietnam. They fought there for 10 years and  during all of that time they continually searched for tactical  procedures that would meet the local conditions. The theater of  war represented a unique "patchwork" in which the hot spots  arose spontaneously in one place or another....    Unfortunately, it happened that essentially the experience  of  neither the Vietnam nor the Afghan nor other local wars was in  demand by Soviet military art. It was considered random and  untypical; thus for a long time was not used in the training of  the forces. It is now time to correct this unfortunate mistake.  There will likely be a place in the new field manuals for  positions affecting the actions of the forces not only under the  conditions of a large-scale war but also under the conditions of  armed conflicts. By the way, this flows directly out of the  demands of the new military doctrine of the Russian Federation,  where it is noted that today there is an increasing danger of  the rise of armed conflicts.    So, taking this into account, what actions must the forces  be  prepared to undertake? Above all, as was already mentioned  above, the conditions of warfare in armed conflicts are  extremely varied. The means of action that were worked out for a  "large" war cannot be mechanically transfered to this area. In  addition, the opposing sides usually have a different level of  military organization, training, and technical equipment. At the  same time, this does not at all mean that one must be oriented  toward "simplified" tactics. Precisely local wars gave an  impulse to the development of many new and rather effective  means of combat operations. During the time of the Korean War,  for example, the tactic of "tunnel warfare" arose and was widely  used, the tactic of air mobile operations came into being in  Vietnam, and the tactic of remote combat developed in the Middle  East (1967, 1979, and 1982).    A special feature of local wars is that they usually become  a  range for the testing of new tactical concepts and kinds of  military hardware. Thus, in Korea, they first used jet fighters,  guided missiles of the "ship-to-air" class, helicopters, and new  kinds of tanks. In Vietnam, they tested new jet bombers,  supersonic fighters, artillery and missile systems, elements of  the AVACS system, several kinds of aerial cluster bombs,  including "Lazy Dog" bombs, the fragments (10,000) of which  destroy a target over an area of 700 square meters, the "Snake  Eye" bomb (weight 250 kg) equipped with an umbrella stabilizer,  "Armalit" rifles that fire "tumbling" bullets, the "Vulcan"  gun-machinegun with a rate of fire of 6,000-8,000 rounds per  minute, "Strike" air-launched missiles, and antiaircraft  missiles. In the wars in the Middle East, they first used combat  helicopters with antitank guided missiles, "Merkava" tanks, new  types of aircraft and helicopters, self-propelled artillery,  tactical missiles, portable antiaircraft systems, and guided  air-launched missiles. Especially intensive use was made of the  means of radioelectronic warfare. The Americans carried out mass  tests of combat equipment and arms during the war in the zone of  the Persian Gulf: Systems of highly accurate weapons, "SLAM" and  "ATAKMS" missiles, "Patriot" antiaircraft missiles, the heavy  bomber GBU-15, and new models of the means of communication,  radio-electronic warfare, and radio, radioengineering, and space  reconnaissance.    In analyzing the experience in local wars in the 1950's  through the 1990's, it is important to note that maneuvering  forms of combat prevailed in them over position forms. A long  positional confrontation of the sides was noted only during the  time of the war in Korea. In all other wars, if such a  phenomenon occurred it was only for a short time and episodic.  And the possible armed conflicts of the future will hardly be an  exception to this rule. Such is the tendency in the development  of military science: With the increase in the power and speed of  weapons and in the maneuvering capability of the forces, there  is an ever greater displacement from the arsenal of tactics of  such companions of positional confrontation as penetration and  the use of unbroken, trench, and deeply echeloned defense.  Naturally, the application of rigid methods in the operations of  the forces is receding into the past and the "geometry" of the  battlefield is changing fundamentally in that it is becoming  "nonlinear" and "multidimensional."    Operations of forces under the conditions of an "expanded  battlefield", (that is, in individual points of combat, in the  absence of a clearly defined front line and direct contact of  units with their neighbors and with the enemy), apparently will  become new features of contemporary tactics that may be  manifested especially clearly in local armed conflicts. For it  is usually rather limited forces and systems that are involved  in conflicts and their action is concentrated in time and space.  It can be expected that the opposing side will not always strive  to engage in "open" combat. More often he will prefer to avoid a  direct clash with an enemy with superior numerical strength and  will try to "slip away" from the strike. It must be assumed that  under these conditions the basic operational methods will be  surprise attacks like a "swarm of bees" against individual  facilities, especially against unprotected command and control  facilities, rear bases, truck convoys, guard posts and security  detachments, checkpoints, and individual garrisons. It is  possible that extensive use will be made of ambushes, the  setting of traps, the mining of roads, and acts of terrorism.  Nor can one rule out large-scale clashes that under same  conditions may grow into large-scale operations.    But it appears that most characteristic for conflicts will  still be frequent episodic battles. Hence, the commanders and  staffs will have to make use of other methods of work in the  organization and carrying out of combat operations than those  that are being used, let us say, in the penetration of a  prepared defense. Those normative indicators that were developed  in combat and training practice and set forth in the current  field manuals are not applicable here. Most often the grouping  of the "nonstandard" enemy will be quite heterogeneous. It may  include the most diverse formations in terms of combat  qualities. And it is impossible to assess them using generally  accepted methods and operating with "averaged measures." Some  units may be well armed and trained and their combat potential  may conditionally be assigned the value of one. Others will be  less well trained and will be more poorly equipped technically.  Accordingly, the level of their combat capability will be lower.    It is also rather difficult to assess the qualitative  parameters of one's own forces. What are the criteria for  defining the combat possibilities of units and subunits in the  waging of counterguerrilla warfare? How much force and what  systems are needed to counteract ambushes, to prevent acts of  sabotage, to protect and defend communications, and to carry out  reconnaissance and search operations? All of these are questions  that are not easily answered.    Many difficulties in making the decision to engage in combat  will also arise because the commander does not by any means  always see the real enemy before him. It will be very difficult  to carry out reconnaissance, because the forces, as a rule, will  be assigned an extensive zone of responsibility or combat  operations. During the war in Afghanistan, for example, the  divisions were assigned a zone of combat operations along a  front of 400 to 600 km in a depth of 200 to 400 km, regiments  were assigned a sector 100 to 150 km wide along the front and  50-80 km in depth, and for the battalion it was 30-40 km along  the front in a depth of 15-20 km. It is understandable that it  is possible to study such a large region and to investigate  routes extending over several dozen or hundreds of kilomters  only with the help of helicopters. But here is where new  difficulties arise: How in this case can one specify the tasks  of the units and subunits in the terrain, determine the regions  of the artillery firing positions, the order for overcoming  artificial obstacles, etc?    The situation is also complicated by the fact that the means  available to the forces for reconnaissance, command and control,  and support as well as the weapons and in general the  organizational personnel structure of the combined units are not  at all adapted to such conditions. Here it is appropriate to  remember the experience in Afghanistan, in particular the  experience in the decentralized use of forces and weapons. There  were practically no cases in which a division operated at full  strength. And it was infrequent that they made use of the  regiment. As a rule, they established an improvized detachment  for the accomplishment of some particular combat task or other  such as the destruction of a recognized base of the enemy, for  example -- usually on the basis of a reinforced motorized rifle  battalion. Its actions were supported by artillery, combat  helicopters, and aviation. The Americans operated in an  analogous manner in Vietnam.    Thus, combat experience teaches: a unique "detachment"  ("group") system of actions can become typical for armed  conflicts. The combat strength of the established detachments  may differ. The main thing here is to support their fire and  tactical independence and capability of operating for a long  time (two or three days) separately from the main forces of  one's own troops and the rear base. It is expedient to form  detachments under the principle of specific designation, for  example it is necessary to have a reconnaissance and search  detach to determine the combat strength and precise location of  enemy groupings.    It is advisable to have a raiding and assault detachment to  carry out raiding and assault actions for the purpose of  identifying and destroying a particular grouping of the enemy.  Its basis is mobile (armored and motorized rifle) subunits  strengthened with artillery and engineering subunits. To seal  off important facilities at the disposition of the enemy, it is  necessary to have blocking detachments that essentially include  motorized rifle subunits. The support of the actions of  reconnaissance-search, raiding-assault, and blocking detachments  will require strike detachments established primarily on the  basis of artillery subunits and subunits of combat helicopters.    As experience shows, it is not advisable to assign a  strictly  limited zone of action to a detachment, especially a  reconnaissance-search or raiding-assault detachment, for this  will paralyze their maneuver. It is enough for them to determine  the general direction of the actions and the objectives --  immediate, intermediate, and final. If the enemy grouping is  determined insufficiently fully (and this may be the case very  often), then it is expedient to practice "alternative" planning,  that is, to determine not one but two and sometimes even three  possible versions of the action.    It is understandable that the method of "actions by  detachments" can be quite effective only in the event of  thorough organization and comprehensive support. Because it is  by no means always possible to apply active-offensive forms of  combat, the forces must be able to engage in delaying and  stabilizing actions. That is, it will no longer be defense in  its classic form. Delaying actions infer the establishment of  mobile (air mobile) screens and migratory weapons positions and  the setting up of ambushes and killing zones in the path of the  enemy's advance.    In the event of the lack of the necessary number of weapons,  the most acceptable thing here may be the selective-restrictive  method of effecting the enemy, the essence of which is the  selection of the most important facilities in his grouping and  concentration on the suppression of most of the weapons  operating in the given sector. In covering open flanks for the  purpose of counteracting the close and wide envelopments of the  enemy, use can be made of the barrier-blocking method, which  infers the establishment of fire barriers primarily on natural  boundaries in combination with the remote mining of the terrain.    Since combat operations under these conditions are developed  on a broad front but artillery has a limited range of fire,  combat helicopters play a greater role in the fire support of  the forces. Use may also be made of mixed groups of aircraft and  helicopters put together from reconnaissance and combat (strike)  helicopters and ground attack aircraft.    In short, again and again we have been convinced that there  are no "easy" wars and that one must prepare the forces  thoroughly for even what at first glance would seem to be an  insignificant military conflict. Today the experience of local  wars and military conflicts -- and about 200 of them have been  unleashed in the world from 1945 through 1992 -- is especially  valid for us, because, as was recently stated at one of the UN  sessions, "the bell of every regional conflict tolls for all of  us."</p>

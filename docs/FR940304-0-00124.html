			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Section 279.20(b)(2)(ii)_Used Oil Processing by Generators and Transfer Facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the promulgation of the September 10, 1992, Used Oil Management Standards, a number of parties have raised concerns regarding the definition of used oil processor and the types of activities that are covered by that definition. The commenters are concerned that a broad construction of the term processor inappropriately includes a number of very basic on-site generator activities that the Agency did not intend to regulate under the used oil processor standards (e.g. reconditioning/maintenance to extend the life of used oil, separation of used oil from wastewater discharge, etc.). EPA agrees that activities such as these, when performed by the generator, were not intended to be covered under the used oil processor standards because used oil processing is not their primary purpose, as explained below in greater detail. In fact, too broad an interpretation of the processor definition may discourage environmentally beneficial recycling and waste minimization activities by imposing an unwarranted regulatory burden on owners and operators that EPA did not intend to regulate as used oil processors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, today's rule revises the used oil management regulations to clarify the Agency's intent regarding the definition of a used oil processor by specifying those on-site maintenance, filtering, and separation activities that are not, and were not intended to be subject to the used oil processing standards. Under today's rule, generators <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  who only handle used oil in a manner specified under &sect;279.20(b)(2)(ii) are not processors provided that the used oil is generated on-site and is not being sent directly off-site to a burner of on- or off-specification used oil fuel. (Section 279.20(b)(2)(ii) also applies to collection centers and aggregation points since these entities are regulated as generators.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A used oil generator is any person, by site, whose act or process produces used oil or whose act first causes used oil to become subject to regulations. For example, generators include all persons and businesses who produce used oil through commercial or industrial operations and vehicle services, including government agencies, and/or persons and businesses who collect used oil from households and ``do-it-yourself'' oil changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Activities that EPA did not intend to include under the definition of used oil processor are described below. EPA does not believe that the activities identified in &sect;279.20(b)(2)(ii) should be subject to the used oil processor standards because used oil processing is not the primary purpose of these activities i.e., the primary purpose of these activities is not to produce from used oil or to make it more amenable for the production of used oil derived products, and the Agency does not expect these limited activities will pose the same kinds of environmental problems that may occur at processor facilities. Instead, in these cases, the act of mixing, filtering, separating, draining etc., used oil by the generator constitutes a basic step that is incidental or ancillary to a primary activity which is distinct from used oil processing. It is important to note, however, that owners or operators who generate used oil as a result of any of the activities specified in &sect;279.20(b)(2)(ii) are considered used oil generators and are subject to the generator standards in subpart C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is allowing on-site but not off-site burning of used oil generated from designated on-site activities because the Agency believes that this approach best enables EPA to strike a reasonable balance between encouraging beneficial on-site reuse and recycling activities that should pose very limited risks, on one hand, and ensuring that activities undertaken primarily to make used oil more amenable for burning (i.e., used oil processing) are adequately controlled under the more stringent used oil processing standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of a used oil processor is based on the purpose for which used oil is being filtered, separated, or otherwise reconditioned (i.e., whether the activity is designed to produce used oil derived products or to make used oil more amenable for the production of used oil derived products). The Agency is concerned that in situations where used oil is being filtered, separated or otherwise reconditioned and then sent to off-site burners, the purpose of the activity may prove difficult to discern and that consequently, &sect;279.20(b)(2)(ii) provisions may be used as a means to avoid compliance with the used oil processor standards (i.e., by persons who claim not to be used oil processors under the &sect;279.20(b)(2)(ii) provisions but whose primary purpose is to make the used oil more suitable for burning). Therefore, EPA believes it is necessary to adopt an objective measure of the purpose of the activity. The Agency believes that a prohibition against sending used oil generated from specified on-site activities to off-site burners provides the most practical and effective way to ensure that activities undertaken only to make used oil more amenable for burning are subject to the used oil processor standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Definition of Used Oil Processor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (A) Reconditioning used oil before returning it for reuse by the generator.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under today's rule facility owners or operators who clean, separate, or otherwise recondition used oil generated on-site and then reuse it are not considered used oil processors, provided that the reconditioned used oil is being reused by the owner or operator who generated it. Examples of activities covered under this category include filtering of metalworking fluids for reuse, and filtering and then replacing oil from oil-bearing transformers and turbines during routine maintenance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Europe's most respected companies: Benchmark is set by clear winners in product groups - Paul Taylor takes a look at some of the results by sector When Europe's senior executives were asked to nominate the most respected companies in their industries on the basis of seven measures of business performance, clear winners emerged in most business sectors. As a result the first Financial Times/Price Waterhouse survey should provide a valuable tool for corporate executives and others wishing to benchmark their companies against the best in Europe. This is a summary of the some of the results by sector: Automobiles/Auto Trucks &amp; Parts Bayerische Motoren Werke, the German carmaker came top in this sector which had a particularly high response rate. BMW was followed by Robert Bosch, the German components manufacturer, and then Peugeot Citroen, the French motor group. Banks Although Deutsche Bank no longer ranks as Europe's biggest bank - that title is now held by HSBC following its takeover of Midland Bank - the German bank emerged well ahead of its rivals in a large sector. HSBC ranked fifth equal with Germany's BHF-Bank, behind UBS, Lloyds Bank and Spain's Banco de Santander. Beverages &amp; Tobacco In this sector the only two non-British contenders, LVMH Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy, the French luxury goods group, and Heineken, the Dutch brewer which has a substantial international reach, topped the rankings. However, Guinness and Whitbread were well placed and Grand Met scored well. Chemical, Paper &amp; Packaging Ciba-Geigy, of Switzerland, which also has substantial pharmaceuticals interests, took first place in this sector even though L'Air Liquide, the world's biggest industrial gases group, made it into the top 25 list. Ciba did well mostly because of its customer focus, products and financial performance. However, unlike many other sectors, votes were very evenly spread across the industry. L'Air Liquide came second, followed closely by ICI, of the UK, Akzo, of the Netherlands, and Rhone Poulenc, the French chemicals group. Construction, Homebuilding &amp; Building materials German and British companies shared the top honours in this sector. Philipp Holzmann emerged with most votes by a clear majority, followed by Britain's RMC Group, the world's biggest concrete producer, and Pilkington, the UK glassmaker. Dykerhoff, the German cement group which recently acquired a 50.05 per cent stake in Ciments Luxembourgeois, and Wolseley, the UK-based heating and plumbing merchant, also made it into the sector top five. Diversified Holding Companies This was one of the most difficult categories to rank because of the wide range of business activities covered. Nevertheless BTR, the British industrial conglomerate, emerged as clear winner, closely followed by UK-based Rentokil and Hanson. Chargeurs, the French textiles, transport and communications group, and Pinault, which owns the Printemps stores also made the top five. Electricity &amp; Water Germany's largest utility group, RWE, led the electricity and water field, closely followed by Britain's Powergen and then Belgium's Electrabel, National Grid and Sweden's Vattenfall utility. Electronics &amp; Electrical Components Siemens came top by a wide margin, followed by Alcatel-Alsthom, of France, Finland's Nokia, Sweden's Electrolux, Britain's GEC and then Philips of the Netherlands. Engineering Although ABB Asea Brown Boveri dominated this sector, Britain's Rolls-Royce and Linde, the German lift truck maker also rated highly. The top three were followed by Sandvik of Sweden and Williams Holdings of the UK. Food Processors Unilever and Switzerland's Nestle group headed this sector. They ranked fifth and sixth in the overall winners group. They were followed by BSN, the French-based multinational food group, Barilla, Italy's family owned pasta and biscuit group, was ranked number four in the sector. Insurance Germany's Munchener Ruckversicherungs group won the most praise in this category followed by Fortis, the Dutch/Belgium group, Swiss Reinsurance, Zurich Insurance and Allianz, Europe's biggest insurance company. Media, Printing &amp; Advertising Reuters Holdings, the new and financial information group, stood head-and-shoulders above its rivals in this category receiving as many commendations as the next five companies put together. Reed-Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing group, came second, followed by the German Bertelsmann media group, Britain's EMAP and Wolters Kluwer, the Dutch publishing group. Pharmaceuticals &amp; Healthcare Switzerland's Roche claimed the top slot in this sector. Surprisingly however, Roche did not figure in the 25 overall winners. Glaxo, made it into the top 25. But in the sector it ranked third behind its arch ulcer drug competitor Sweden's Astra. SmithKline Beecham ranked fourth. Retail British companies, J Sainsbury and John Lewis took second and third places respectively after Marks &amp; Spencer. Migros, Switzerland's leading food retailer, came fourth followed by the French-owned Carrefour group. Telecoms &amp; Communications British Telecom emerged as the top-rated company, followed by PTT Nederland, the partially privatised Dutch telecommunications and postal company, and Vodafone, the UK cellular network operator. France Telecom, ranked number four followed by Cable &amp; Wireless which owns the Mercury network in the UK.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   REASONS FOR SELECTING COMPANIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Most &amp; Least Important Qualities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            CUSTOMER FOCUS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Most Important   Enjoys high customer loyalty Least Important  Makes good use of technology in its customer services  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 PEOPLE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Most Important   People have the means and facilities to deliver results Least Important  Has demonstrated 'real' equal opportunities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          PRODUCTS AND SERVICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Most Important  Products solve problems and provide benefits Least Important       Invests heavily in R&amp;D  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          BUSINESS PERFORMANCE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Most Important   Has shown consistent growthand long-term profitability Least Important  Is a low-cost producer  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Most Important   Displays positive managementstyle and attractive                  behaviour Least Important  Takes a strong position on social issues  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               STRATEGY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Most Important   Clear policy and objectives Least Important  Focusing on revenue growth rather than cost reduction  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             ENVIRONMENT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Most Important   Invests in pollution reduction measures Least Important  Policy shows in products and packaging  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Financial Times/Price Waterhouse  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

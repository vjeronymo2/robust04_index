			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Sport: Umpires under siege in La Rochelle - Keith Wheatley describes the squall that has disturbed the match-racing world championships / Sailing On-the-water umpiring has been a vital part of sailing's progress into a modern, readily comprehensible sport. From America's Cup to the Olympics, the sight of inflatable chase boats pursuing competing yachts and referees dispensing instant justice has become a familiar sight. La Rochelle, venue for this week's world championship of match-race sailing, has now witnessed the logical next stage of that evolution: abuse of the umpires and the subsequent banning of a leading competitor. It is an uncomfortable new era for a sport that still has an intimate and Corinthian feel to it. Chris Law is the British helmsman who broke through the last taboo. After shouting criticism at an umpire who gave him four penalties in one race, he was summoned before a panel of the International Jury and, according to its published finding, continued his tirade during the hearing. The verdict was 'gross breach of good sportsmanship' and disqualification from the regatta. Law, who has already won two prestigious events, the Congressional Cup and the Royal Lymington Cup, this season, is hurt but largely unrepentant. However, he is sufficiently disillusioned with match-racing to announce his retirement from a sport where he was ranked sixth in the world. 'I obviously have an explosive McEnroe-type approach but none of it is malicious or personal,' he explained in hurt tones the morning after his expulsion. 'In 20 years of competition I don't think I've deliberately done anything with those motives. 'The sport needs personalities, it needs characters. My evocative, passionate way of sailing a boat has been described as exciting often enough.' Nemesis came in a match against Bertrand Pace, towards the end of the dual round-robin part of the regatta. It was extraordinarily close, with the boats only feet apart. This was more remarkable since Law had already collected and executed two penalty turns before the short race was half-over. According to the official report, when the umpire's flag went up to give him a third penalty Law shouted abuse at the official. That in turn led to a fourth penalty, whereupon Law turned to the boat carrying the chief umpire and shouted: 'You lot are wrecking the sport.' This was almost certainly his undoing. The whole concept of on-the-water umpiring is both new and tough to organise. Providing a chase boat (with driver) plus umpires for each pair of yachts in a match-race regatta is expensive and difficult. Even ex-sailors who are accustomed to sitting on protest committees find instant judgments on-the-water hard to make. Many international level sailors would agree that often decisions are hasty and wrong. 'The standard of umpiring is not high at all. It does not come close to what is required,' said Law, who readily admits to a technique of pushing the arcane rules of match-racing to their limit. Where he differs from his peers is being unwilling or unable to accept the rub of the green. 'I have a problem with authority that I don't respect. It got me into trouble at school and it's certainly got me into trouble here,' admitted Law, whose sailing career has had more than its share of setbacks. The final irony is while he was in La Rochelle, Law received an invitation from the Sydney 95 campaign for the 1995 America's Cup to try out as helmsman on their yacht. The Cup has appointed as its chief umpire for the four months of racing off San Diego one John Doerr, the same official in charge this week at La Rochelle. The first challenger races for the America's Cup are less than four months away and it has provided a distinct sub-plot to events at the championship at La Rochelle. Each of the four semi-finalists - Rod Davis, Paul Cayard, Bertrand Pace and Peter Gilmour - has both a role with a leading Cup challenger and experience of the event going back many years. 'There is a definite advantage going to these events with a crew that you are already sailing with regularly and at a high level,' said Cayard. 'There is also an extra motivation among the skippers. You are trying to establish a psychological pecking order that you will take back with you to San Diego.' Cayard's precise role next year is still uncertain. He recently parted company with the French team after financial disagreements. Cayard, who has dual French and American nationality, also has an offer to race aboard Stars &amp; Stripes with Dennis Conner. 'I've also had approaches from the TV companies,' he said. 'It would probably make me more money than sailing on someone else's boat. But once you've been in there, it's hard to stay out of the Cup.' In 1992 Cayard was skipper of the Il Moro campaign, headed and financed by Raul Gardini, the late Italian industrialist. Rod Davis is the skipper who has come out of La Rochelle looking strongest. Rocket Rod has 15 wins out of 18 starts in the round-robin series and looked untouchable. His crew, including three-times laser world champion Glenn Bourke, are all senior members of the One Australia campaign to take the America's Cup back Down Under. Davis is the ultimate mobile professional among professional sailors. He was born in San Diego and raced as skipper for the US in the 1987 America's Cup, for New Zealand in the 1992 event, and now Australia. Conner christened him 'yachting's Benedict Arnold', but Davis is too relaxed about virtually everything to mind too much. Having been undefeated during the first day of the regatta here, Davis was asked how he explained three losses on the second. 'I predicted that no one would go through undefeated,' he explained. 'We just decided to take our beatings now, rather than on finals' day.'</p>

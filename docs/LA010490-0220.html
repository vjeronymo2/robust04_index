			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> 'GIBLOCK' TO CLOSE L.A. FREEWAY  </P> <P> A new traffic headache is in store for Southern Californians -- a Giblock.  </P> <P> That's what happens when state transportation officials close a freeway so a  film crew can shoot a Mel Gibson movie.  </P> <P> Four miles of the Terminal Island Freeway will be closed this weekend for  filming "Air America," an action movie in which Gibson and Robert Downey Jr.  play pilots for the CIA's secret airline.  </P> <P> Motorists won't get a glimpse of the star of the "Mad Max" and "Lethal Weapon"  films in exchange for the inconvenience.  </P> <P> "He's not even going to be there," said California Department of Transportation  spokeswoman Margie Tiritilli. "It's just extraneous shots they're going to  shoot, so we don't want gawkers and that type of thing."  </P></p>

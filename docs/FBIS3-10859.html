			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the Mexican elections  scheduled for 21 August 1994.    On 3 March, Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate for  the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), urged opposition  candidates not to use their campaigns to divide Mexicans.  During a visit to Nayarit, Colosio stated: "I want to be  president of Mexico to lead the change and transformation of  social conditions in our motherland." (Mexico City Canal 13  Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 3 March 94)    Colosio officially has registered his presidential candidacy  with the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE). Commenting on  rumors Peace Commissioner Camacho Solis might run as the PVEM  candidate, he has said: "I have great respect for Manuel  Camacho. We are members of a party committed to democracy. I  have great respect for him, and I support his actions in the  Chiapas peace talks. I believe the pluralistic nature of our  modern political parties is a product of Mexican society."  (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 5 March 94)    Members of the Permanent Indian Council, a group that  comprises almost half of the 56 ethnic groups in Mexico and has  no affiliation with the PRI, visited Luis Colosio on 7 March.  The Indians said their urgent needs and extreme poverty drove  them to seek support from the PRI candidate. (Mexico City Radio  ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 8 Mar 94)    Colosio promised on 7 March if elected he will "establish a  new pact between the state and 56 ethnic communities to  guarantee respect for human dignity, autonomous rights, legal  and social justice, and democracy for 10 million Indians, who  are part of the poorest of the poor." Colosio also said: "It is  time to do justice to our Indians, to grow and share the fruits  of that growth more equitably in our motherland, because  progress makes no sense if it does not imply more income for the  peasants, workers, and the Indian families of all and each one  of our communities." (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 8 Mar  94 pp 48, 52)    Colosio has announced he will recommend to his party women's  participation be doubled in the PRI proposal of congressional  candidates. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430  GMT 9 Mar 94)    Rafael Aguilar Talamantes, presidential candidate for the  Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party, has  officially registered his presidential candidacy. Aguilar has  said he would be willing to decline his candidacy in favor of  Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) Subcommander Marcos.  (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 4 March 94)    Commenting on the peace talks in San Cristobal de las Casas,  National Action Party (PAN) presidential candidate Diego  Fernandez has said: "I hope that efforts by the guerrillas, the  government, the mediators, and society in general truly lead to  a national de jure state and thus to a Mexico free of lies."  (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 4 March 94)    In Campeche, Fernandez has said: "We will never favor  violence. We understand the Chiapas guerrilla movement has  justifiable causes, but violence will never give us the peace,  prosperity, and justice Mexico wants and deserves." He has also  said: "The big challenge this country is facing, the big  project to which all Mexicans should commit is so simple and  deep that it can be expressed in a few words: The challenge  modern-day Mexico faces is to comply with the law." (Mexico  City XEW Television Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 7 Mar 94)    In Quintana Roo, Fernandez has praised the results of the  peace talks in Chiapas, saying: "Other countries have not  achieved over many years what Mexico has now accomplished,  thanks to the government's prudence." (Mexico City XEW  Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 5 Mar 94)    In Hidalgo, Fernandez has said: "If the people, if millions  of Mexicans participate cleanly in these elections, we will  leave behind on 21 August a history of corruption, fraud,  deception, lies, and we can welcome a true democracy." (Mexico  City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 9 Mar 94)    During the weekend of 5 March, the PRD registered officially  before the IFE Cuauhtemoc Cardenas as its presidential  candidate. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 1300  GMT 7 March 94)    Cardenas has said he will propose an end to the import of  farm products, which have harmed Mexican peasants, if he is  elected president. Cardenas has added what farmers need are  credits, participation, and opportunities to produce, as well as  protection against unfair competition from imported low-priced  farm products. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 8 March 94  pp 48, 52)    Cardenas has reiterated his demand of an independent  electoral authority, saying the current electoral law can still  be reformed. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435  GMT 9 March 94)    During a visit to Guadalajara, Alvaro Perez Trevino,  presidential candidate for the Authentic Party of the Mexican  Revolution, has denied he will decline his candidacy in favor of  Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis. Perez Trevino has  said: "We have not talked about this with Mr. Camacho Solis; we  did not even know he was in charge of the peace talks in  Chiapas. It is all a terrible rumor." He added he will register  officially his candidacy on 11 March. (Mexico City XEW  Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 8 March 94)    Labor Party presidential candidate Cecilia Soto has rejected  the presence of international observers during the 21 August  elections. Soto has said Mexicans are able to solve their  internal problems without observers. (Mexico City Canal 13  Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 4 March 94)    Soto has said: "We cannot be frugal with democracy. Social  peace in Mexico will be at stake if these elections are not  satisfactory; therefore, we should do all we can for these  elections to run as smoothly as possible." (Mexico City Radio  ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 9 March 94)    Jorge Gonzalez Torres, presidential candidate for the  Mexican  Green Ecologist Party (PVEM), has met with EZLN peasants and  urged them to work together to solve Chiapas' agricultural  problems. (Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in  Spanish 1300 GMT 4 March 94)    Gonzalez has said there should be bilingual teachers so  residents of areas where Indian dialects are spoken can learn in  their native language. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in  Spanish 0435 GMT 8 March 94)    In Sinaloa, National Opposition Union presidential candidate  Pablo Madero has expressed his satisfaction with the opening of  the congressional special sessions and indicated this is the  only way to achieve truly democratic electoral reform. (Mexico  City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 4  March 94)    Madero has reiterated the need to reform electoral laws. In  Ciudad Obregon, he has said: "It is urgent that electoral  bandits be punished without any right to bail." He has said he  would fight impunity and corruption in the government if elected  president. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435  GMT 8 March 94)    Marcela Lombardo, presidential candidate for the Popular  Socialist Party (PSP), has expressed her discontent with the  decision by the PAN candidate to hold televised debates with  only the PRI and the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD). She  has said conditions should have been established to make debates  all-inclusive. (Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network  in Spanish 1300 GMT 4 March 94)    Five of the nine presidential candidates have registered  officially their candidacies thus far. Lombardo registered her  candidacy on 9 March. Lombardo said strengthening our  institutions and democracy is the only way to resolve the  crisis. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT  9 March 94)    On 6 March, the PRD's fifth plenum voted against holding  internal elections to choose its candidates for deputies,  senators, and assembly people, considering no political  conditions exist "to preclude friction and erosion of members'  unity." The plenum decided to focus on the presidential  campaign. The party's national council decided during a  closed-door meeting the positions in question would first be  decided by state councils and executive committees. If disputes  arise, the national council will have the final word. (Mexico  City LA JORNADA in Spanish 7 March 94 p 11)</p>

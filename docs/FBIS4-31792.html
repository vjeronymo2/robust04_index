			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague June 12 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav  Havel said today that the decrees issued by President Edvard  Benes in 1945 resulted from the dramatic war events and casting  doubt on them was almost unimaginable. In his regular Sunday  radio programme "Talks in Lany," Havel was reacting to a  complaint lodged recently with the Constitutional Court by a  Czech citizen of German origin living in Liberec, North Bohemia.    In it he complained against a verdict reached by the Usti  nad  Labem Regional Court in 1945, whereby the property of his  forebears was confiscated and alleged that the confiscation was  unlawful and in breach of his basic rights. He made an appeal  for the repeal of decrees Nos. 5, 12, 33 and 108. Decree No.  108 laid down the confiscation of property from Germans and  Hungarians. Decrees Nos. 5, 12 and 33 ordered that Germans and  Hungarians be dispossessed of agricultural property and stripped  of state citizenship.    Turning to the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the  Allied landings in Normandy at the beginning of June, Havel  regretted that he could not decorate Czech veterans with state  distinctions just as the other heads of state. There has been  no law on orders and distinctions since the creation of the  independent Czech Republic on January 1, 1993.    Havel said it seemed in the Czech Republic as if the  veterans' experience was recalled only by the veterans  themselves. He stressed that it was just thanks to the  Czechoslovak units abroad that the Czech Republic was perceived  in the West "as a country having a democratic tradition which  was capable of putting up resistance to the mounting evil."  Havel invited the veterans of the Czechoslovak Army living  abroad to come for the celebrations of the end of World War Two  next year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 2 (YONHAP) -- Taiwan relaxed from  Thursday part of the retaliatory economic steps it had taken  against South Korea in the wake of the establishment of  diplomatic ties between Seoul and Beijing, a diplomatic source  reported.    Taiwan took the action following a meeting in Seoul Tuesday  and Wednesday between non-governmental representatives of the  two countries, the source said, requesting anonymity.    The Taiwanese measure covers South Korean exports of apples  and pears, he said.    The source said the two sides are expected to sign a formal  agreement Thursday evening.    Seoul and Taipei will soon hold negotiations on Korean auto  exports to Taiwan and the reopening of civil airline services,  the sources said.    In the case of apple exports, Seoul will increase the amount  slightly from the 3,780 tons it last shipped before the  severance of diplomatic ties. Pear exports will be about 1,040  tons or nearly the same level of 1992.    As for counterpurchase, the two countries will increase the  volume slight from the 1992 level of 3,696 tons. Due to  Taiwan's competitive strength in banana exports, two sides  agreed to include bananas along with onions and garlic in the  counterpurchase category.</p>

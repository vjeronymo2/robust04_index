			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKESBEAUTY SCHOOL  </P> <P> "Roger &amp; Me" gets a special release later this month -- at an "orientation  session" for Miss USA Pageant contestants.  </P> <P> Well, not the entire documentary, which examines the impact of General Motors'  plant closing in Flint, Mich.  </P> <P> Just the section in which film maker Michael Moore catches then-Miss  Michigan/Miss America, Kay Lani Raye Rafko, off guard during a Flint parade. In  the segment, she gives memorably vacuous responses. (When asked how she feels  about Flint's severe unemployment situation, Rafko declares, "I'm all for  employment.")  </P> <P> Sara Meza, p.r. director for Madison Square Garden Television Productions,  which produces the Miss USA Pageant (it airs live from Wichita March 2 on CBS),  included the Rafko segment in a training reel for this year's 51 competitors.  </P> <P> "I like them to be prepared, to know what to expect (from interviewers)," Meza  tells us. "The best way is to show them examples."  </P> <P> The reel will also include clips from "A Current Affair" and "48 Hours," in  which beauty queens from other pageants come off better than Rafko.  </P> <P> "It really hits the nail on the head," Meza says of the "Roger &amp; Me"  footage. "People expect those (lightweight) responses from a beauty queen."  </P> <P> She's grooming this year's Miss USA hopefuls for press questions "that might  require a little more thought."  </P> <P> Will Moore be invited?  </P> <P> "If he's on our mailing list of 1,800 (credentialled) press people and he'd  like to attend, we'd be more than happy to have him."

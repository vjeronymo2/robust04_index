Natal Police Liaison Officer Captain Henry Budhram said  about  20 men armed with AK-47 assault rifles and 12-bore-shotguns had  attacked seven houses just before dawn.    The deceased, which included altogether six children, were:  Sandile Dlamini, 7, Thuleleni Dlamini, 17, Lalani Dlamini, 65,  Nonhanla Madondo, 6, Hlompile Madondo, 16, Kwazi Madondo, 3, his  grandmother Rosaline Madondo, 50, Ester Zaca, 50, her sister  Zenzele Zaca, 63, Fikilephi Zaca, 17, Nceke Mchunu 50 and Petha  Mtolo, 80.    They all died from gunshot wounds, Capt Budhram said. Police  have launched an intensive investigation and have blamed the  ongoing violence between the ANC [African National Congress] and  Inkatha as the motive for the attack. Some of the houses were  looted.    The Masunkazane community has been devastated by violence  since 1990 with an ongoing supremacy battle between the ANC and  Inkatha. Last year alone, 1975 people were killed in the area,  but peace monitors said the area seemed to have quieted down the  past few months.    ANC members, monitored by peace officials, spent the day  campaigning 20-km away in Ixopo, and were unaware of the attack.  However, the ANC media spokesman in the area, Mr Blade Nzimande,  had been informed by shocked residents. He confirmed the area  had been relatively peaceful of late, but said in view of the  Freedom Alliance's [FA] stance towards elections he had been  expecting trouble. "Its an attempt by the FA to destabilise  communities to pressurise the ANC and government to accede to  their constitutional demands," Mr Nzimande said on Sunday night.  "But to kill women and children is particularly barbaric," he  added.</p>

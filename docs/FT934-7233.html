			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar gains on D-Mark, Yen The US dollar made significant headway against the D-Mark yesterday, boosted by talk of Federal Reserve tightening and Bundesbank easing, writes Conner Middelmann. In its annual country report on the US, the OECD called for an increase in the Fed Funds rate to 5 per cent by the end of next year and recommended the Fed should start tightening by Christmas. 'Whether or not the advice is taken, it serves to underline that interest differentials are likely to move sharply further in favour of the US dollar, both in the near term and over the course of 1994,' predict analysts at Bear Stearns in London. The dollar closed in London at DM1.7150, up from DM1.7110 on Thursday, but breached DM1.7180 in late inter-bank dealing. Against the Yen the dollar closed at Y108.30, up from Thursday's Y107.15. According to Chris Turner, a currency strategist at BZW, German and US rates are likely to stand level by the end of 1994, stripping away any lingering short-rate support for the D-Mark and underpinning the dollar, which he expects to rise to around DM1.75 by the end of this year. However, 'as the dollar-bullish bandwaggon gathers pace, we are not inclined to get any more optimistic than that for the near term,' he said. 'The scope for the dollar to continue rallying on the short rate expectations theme is limited. Don't be surprised to see DM1.68, or even DM1.6650, before DM1.75.' Such a correction might be sparked by higher-than-expected German money-supply and inflation data, both of which are due next week. M3 is expected to come in around the top of the Bundesbank's 4.5 to 6.5 per cent target range while inflation is expected to have slowed to around 3.7 per cent year-on-year from 3.9 per cent in October. Sterling rose early in the day on the smaller-than-expected October UK trade gap with non-EC countries, but talk of a large cut in base rates at the November 30 Budget put a lid on sterling's upside and prompted some late profit-taking. Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, expects sterling to trade nervously in a DM2.50-DM2.55 range ahead of Budget day. Following recent encouraging inflation and earnings data, market talk has shifted to a one-point base rate reduction, from previous forecasts of a 1/2 -point cut. 'If they cut the base rate by a point, sterling will dip initially but could gain more ground on prospects for further improvements in the real economy,' said Mr Shepherdson.</p>

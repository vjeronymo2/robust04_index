			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Job quota move sparks violence A strike called in support of lower caste demands for job quotas in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh yesterday passed off with sporadic incidents of violence in which three people were killed and 250 injured. Shops were closed in cities throughout the state and road and rail transport was disrupted. But public offices and banks mostly stayed open, according to reports from Lucknow, the state capital. The strike was called by the Bahujan Samaj party and the Samajwadi party, the state's ruling parties, which represent the lower castes and which came to office last year promising to implement job quotas. Their attempts to put the pledge into effect has provoked inter-caste violence which has threatened to bring down the state government. Violent incidents were reported from at least 10 different districts, including the Hindu holy city of Varanasi (Benares) and the industrial centre of Allahabad, where the police fired on demonstrators who charged court buildings. Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav, the chief minister, told a public meeting near the city of Ghaziabad yesterday that job quotas would be implemented even at the cost of the collapse of his government.</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Investors 'ignorant' RICHARD Youard, the investment ombudsman, has warned that savers still need to be educated about the basic facts of investment life. Writing in his annual report this week, he says: 'Investors often show unrealistic expectations, confusion between different types of investment, and a general lack of understanding of how markets work.' Youard's job is to sort out disputes between clients and members of IMRO, the investment management regulatory organisation, and he has the power to make individual awards of up to Pounds 100,000. He can be contacted at 071-796 3065 or by writing to 6 Frederick's Place, London EC2R 8BT. In his report, Youard also has criticism for the industry. He cites one brochure for a personal equity plan which carried the slogan: 'The Easy Way to Achieve Income and Growth - Free of Tax.' Youard asks: 'Can we blame someone new to investment for thinking this Pep brochure assured him of income and growth, easily? Time and again, we find investors have been more affected by the lead-in than by the mass of fine print which follows.' Youard says there was a 50 per cent increase over the year in complaints referred to him. But he feels this was due less to a deterioration in industry standards than the recession and the extra publicity given by IMRO to the ombudsman scheme. Most complaints were about general investment advice, with Peps coming second. Claims varied in size from Pounds 5 - an investor demanding interest due on cash held within a Pep - to Pounds 350,000, a dispute on which Youard decided he could not adjudicate. The two highest claims paid were for Pounds 10,000. One related to an investor getting wrong information about the number of warrants he could buy and the other concerned the definition of a 'low risk' portfolio. In total, the amount paid out after disputes was Pounds 40,700, down from Pounds 114,000 last year. Many of the complaints concern alleged negligence by advisers but Youard does find some encouraging signs. He says: 'Two years ago, I complained about the number of bad or non-existent fact-finds and of inadequate, if any, contemporaneous notes. These are not simply a protection for the adviser but, more constructively, an aid to efficient business. 'This year, the cases have shown, on the whole, satisfactory fact-finds and useful contemporaneous notes.'</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / World Trade News: House delays votes on Gatt ratification The fate of Gatt in the US Congress is on hold for at least seven more weeks following the decision of the House to copy the Senate and come back into session at the end of next month for the crucial votes. The House Democratic leadership was forced on Wednesday night to postpone the vote scheduled for yesterday after Republican objections to the rules under which the debate would be conducted. These stem from an opposition campaign against a telecommunications provision in the bill. But in a letter sent to President Bill Clinton, leaders of both parties in the House diplomatically chose to blame their decision to call a lame duck session on November 29, after the November 8 mid-term elections, on the Senate delay of the Gatt vote until December 1. 'The Senate decision,' the letter said, 'has quite frankly undermined our ability to guarantee strong bipartisan support for this effort in the House at this time.' But both the Speaker, Mr Tom Foley, and the Republican leader, Mr Bob Michel, predicted it would eventually pass. Mr Mickey Kantor, the trade representative, who had spent much of Wednesday testifying to Congress for the Gatt bill, put the best face on what was nevertheless a setback for the administration. 'There's no reason in the world to take any chances with the world's largest trade agreement,' he said. Mr Clinton weighed in by saying at a press conference that Gatt amounted to the 'biggest world tax cut in history' and a 'huge job gainer' for the US. The Senate delay was brought about last week by Senator Ernest Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat, who exercised his right as a committee chairman to force a 45- day interval before the climactic vote. The chamber will come back into session on November 30 with a vote scheduled for the following day. The new Congress does not take office until next January so the lame duck sessions will feature the existing line-up. That still leans towards approval, as a procedural vote later on Wednesday night seemed to indicate: also more than 100 retiring senators and congressmen may feel free to vote their consciences without fear of retribution at the polls or from party whips. Nevertheless the outcome of the November 8 mid-term elections may have a sizeable influence on the lame duck sessions. If conservative Republicans, increasingly associated with 'America First' positions and complaining that Gatt imperils US sovereignty, make expected gains, opposition to the agreement may grow. Congressman Michel, a long-time supporter of free trade who is retiring this year, conceded that he had been caught unawares by the anti-Gatt campaign waged over the last week by Congressman Newt Gingrich, his almost certain successor as Republican leader.</p>

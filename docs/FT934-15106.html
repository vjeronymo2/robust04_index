			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Market expects EC's Ecu1bn Eurobond launch today THE European Community is expected to launch its widely-expected Ecu1bn offering of seven-year Eurobonds today. The issue is seen as an attempt by the EC to attract institutional investors back to the Ecu bond market. Several borrowers, ranging from the Council of Europe to Sweden, injected just over Ecu1bn of liquidity into the Ecu bond market last month but these issues were mainly targeted at retail investors. The EC's decision to award the mandate jointly to four banks - BNP, CSFB, Dresdner and Goldman Sachs - reflects the importance which the EC has attached to the issue, as well as its desire to achieve the widest distribution. The bonds are expected to be priced to yield 10-12 basis points below the yield on the French government's 9 1/2 per cent Ecu-denominated OAT due April 2000. Yesterday, the international bond market was dominated by two large 10-year offerings from Belgium and Depfa, Germany's largest mortgage bank. Both issues had been well flagged and were sold out by the end of the day. Belgium's issue, which raised Dollars 500m, was seen to be sensibly priced at a spread of 32 basis points over the yield on the 5 3/4 per cent US Treasury due 2003 in view of recent worries about the country's budget deficit and its increasing external borrowings. As a result the spread remained virtually unchanged once the bonds were freed to trade. Lead manager Merrill Lynch said that there was surprisingly strong demand for the bonds from east Asia, where about one-third of the issue was placed. Interest from the UK was also good but demand from Germany was below expectations. Depfa achieved a surprisingly low spread of 25 basis points over UK government bonds for its first Eurosterling issue which raised Pounds 500m. The spread tightened to 22 1/2 basis points soon after the bonds were freed to trade. Syndicate managers said Depfa had done well on pricing, given that it did not have a rating and that it was still relatively unknown outside Germany. However, some felt that the spread left little room for further narrowing in the secondary market. Joint lead manager UBS said that the issue was targeted at investors who were buying Depfa paper for the first time, in accordance with the issuer's aim to broaden its funding base. The issue was also seen as a platform for any future sterling borrowings by Depfa. Mr Frank Ruhland, Depfa's treasurer, said the issue reflected the bank's need to diversify its funding away from the domestic market now that it was increasing its lending business abroad. The proceeds of the issue will be used to fund the bank's growing commercial property mortgage business in the UK. Depfa has also expanded its public sector financing activities outside Germany over the past 18 months and has lent to sovereign borrowers and agencies in Denmark, Belgium, Ireland and Spain. Depfa has raised DM26bn of its 1993 funding programme of close to DM30bn but only around DM4bn has been raised internationally. Mr Ruhland expects a higher proportion of Depfa's funding to be sourced outside Germany in future.</p>

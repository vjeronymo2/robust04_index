			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Bonn talks on Baltic tension: West to push Moscow on withdrawal of ex-Soviet troops The foreign ministers of the three former Soviet Baltic states will meet today in Bonn with Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, amid growing concern in western capitals over Russian-Estonian relations as the deadline for the withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory approaches. Mr Kinkel has called for Russia troops to be withdrawn from Estonia and Latvia on schedule, by August of this year. The German minister said that the Russian side must not link the retention of the military units to the provision of civil or voting rights of the Russian population, as it has earlier threatened to do. Similar calls have come in the past few days from the US and Britain. A US state department spokesman said over the weekend that the US government was 'disturbed' by Russian negotiators raising again issues already agreed in previous talks with Estonian officials. The issue of troop withdrawals from the Baltics will be part of talks planned between Russian foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev and Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, in Vladivostok next Monday. A British government statement said that 'according to the final act of the Conference of Security and Co-operation in Europe meeting in Helsinki in 1992, Russia must withdraw its troops from Estonia quickly and in an orderly manner, completely, and must not tie withdrawal to other issues'. The UK statement continued: 'The international community has repeatedly underscored that the withdrawal must take place without any other conditions. Therefore, the Russian troops must be pulled out by August 31 this year, as announced.' Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian deputy foreign minister in charge of negotiations with the Baltic states, told the newly formed Chamber of Public Affairs, a presidential advisory body, that Russia did not link the rights of Russians to troop withdrawals. However, he said that economic and other agreements with Latvia and Lithuania would be affected by a continued denial of rights. According to the Baltfax news agency, Mr Churkin promised that 'a civilised and respectful attitude' towards Russian language speakers would meet with 'understanding and a response' from Russia. However, other speakers at the chamber denounced the treatment of Russians and demanded redress. Mr Mikhail Zadornov, a well-known actor, said that Russians were being denied access to education and medical care and were being sacked from jobs.</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: TWA proposes new restructuring plan Trans World Airlines, the US airline trying to avert a cash crisis, yesterday said it had a new plan for a financial restructuring which it believed would prove acceptable to its creditors. TWA also said it had Dollars 107m in cash at the end of November. This was slightly down from the Dollars 114m it had at the end of September, but the airline said the figure was rising. TWA, once one of the world's best-known airlines, went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1992. It re-emerged in November last year, with creditors holding 55 per cent of the equity and employees holding 45 per cent. It has not made a profit since. Last October the airline announced a rescue plan under which it would nearly halve its debt by asking creditors to swap Dollars 800m worth of loans for equity. As a result, the creditors' stake would rise to possibly 70 per cent and the employees' stake would fall to about 30 per cent. Some creditors opposed the plan because they wanted a better deal. TWA has now come up with a revised proposal under which creditors will trade less debt for the same amount of equity. Mr Jeffrey Erickson, chief executive, said that although further talks could not be ruled out, he was optimistic that the plan would be approved.</p>

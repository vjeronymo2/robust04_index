			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Jakarta to try 30 East Timorese Indonesia will prosecute 30 East Timorese for alleged involvement in riots and pro-independence protests that swept the troubled territory last week, it said yesterday, Reuter reports from Dili. President Suharto said all East Timorese were welcome to leave for the territory's former colonial ruler Portugal, including 29 youths staging a protest inside the US embassy compound in Jakarta. The 29 East Timorese students who invaded the US embassy prepared to leave for Portugal yesterday, saying they feared for their safety if they remained in Indonesia. Indonesia's hopes of presenting an open image during this month's meeting of regional leaders in Jakarta were dashed by the US embassy sit-in and Dili protests, captured on film by the world's media. 'We have arrested 30 men and they will be brought to trial,' East Timor Police chief Colonel Andreas Sugianto said. The territory's outspoken Bishop Carlos Belo said police were terrifying many East Timorese since last week's protests by conducting house-to-house searches to find anyone suspected of involvement. Col Sugianto said eight of the 30 men had been arrested in Bairo village. Dili has been swept by riots in the past 10 days, some ignited by racial tensions and some by political opposition to Indonesian rule in the territory. Indonesia has accused foreign journalists of stoking the protests and has asked at least four to leave for lacking 'proper accreditation'. Bishop Belo attacked the government for its handling of the protests and said Indonesia, which invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975, lacked a commitment to bring peace to the troubled territory. He deplored the protests which swept through Dili last week, but said the most recent protest at his cathedral may have been instigated by the authorities.</p>

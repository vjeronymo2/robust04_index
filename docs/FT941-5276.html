			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Greek consumer price rises slow: Economic watch The Greek consumer price index was up by just 0.2 per cent in February, from the previous month, bringing the annual inflation rate down to 11 per cent, from 11.1 per cent in January. The slight reduction was due to a fall in the price of clothing, shoes and consumer durables in the winter sales. However, in 1993, the consumer price index rose by 0.3 per cent between January and February. Inflation in Greece fell to 12.1 per cent in 1993 from 14.4 per cent in 1992 and is expected to fall below 10 per cent in this year. Provisional new passenger car registrations in the European Union fell by an estimated 1.8 per cent in February compared with a year earlier. The strongest growth was in Denmark, where registrations rose by 56.5 per cent. The greatest decline was in Greece, where registrations fell by 34.5 per cent. German wholesale sales in January climbed a real 4 per cent from a year earlier and rose a seasonally and calendar-adjusted 1 per cent from December. The European Union issued its first figures on renewable energy production, which was equivalent to 43.6m tonnes of oil in 1992, or 6.7 per cent of EU primary energy production.</p>

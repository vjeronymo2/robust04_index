			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. FREEZES PAKISTAN AID OVER NUCLEAR ISSUE;  </P> <P> ASIA: ASSISTANCE TOTALING $564 MILLION IS SUSPENDED AS WASHINGTON REVIEWS  ISLAMABAD'S SUSPECTED WEAPONS PROGRAM.  </P> <P> About half a billion dollars a year in U.S. military and economic aid to  Pakistan has been frozen and payments cannot be resumed until the Islamabad  government curtails programs that seem to be intended to produce nuclear  weapons, U.S. officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the Bush Administration is  reviewing Pakistan's nuclear program, and Capitol Hill sources said it is  almost inconceivable that Congress would allow the aid to resume unless major  changes occur.  </P> <P> Under U.S. law, no aid can be sent to Pakistan unless the President certifies  each year that Islamabad is not trying to acquire nuclear weapons. For the  first time since the requirement was imposed in 1985, President Bush declined  to make such a certification this year, forcing a suspension of aid with the  start of the new fiscal year Oct. 1.  </P> <P> In previous years, the Reagan and Bush administrations have issued the needed  certification, despite accusations in Congress that Pakistan was trying to  develop and test a nuclear device to match one exploded by India in 1974.  </P> <P> U.S. officials were reluctant to take any action that would damage the  longstanding U.S.-Pakistan relationship, especially at a time when covert  American assistance to anti-government guerrillas in Afghanistan was being  channeled through Pakistan.  </P> <P> The Administration had requested $564 million in combined economic and military  assistance to Pakistan for 1991. For fiscal 1990, which ended Sept. 30, the  combined total was $581 million. The aid program for Pakistan has been the U.S.  government's third-largest, following the packages for Israel and Egypt.  </P> <P> Tutwiler said that Secretary of State James A. Baker III informed Pakistani  Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan that U.S. law will not allow continuation  of the aid programs under current circumstances.  </P> <P> "The secretary reiterated our view of the need for a comprehensive approach to  dealing with nonproliferation issues in the region," Tutwiler said. "The  Pakistani nuclear program remains under review."  </P> <P> Tutwiler, who sat in on the meeting Tuesday between Baker and Yaqub Khan,  provided few details. But she left little doubt that Yaqub Khan provided no  assurances that would allow Bush to lift the suspension.  </P> <P> When Tutwiler was asked why the Administration had not provided more public  evidence of its concern with the Pakistani program, she said: "Well, how about  the evidence that the certification wasn't (made) on Oct. 1?"  </P> <P> The U.S. government is in a better tactical position to deal firmly with  Pakistan than in the past because the withdrawal of Soviet forces from  Afghanistan has reduced the importance of the Islamabad government as a bridge  between the United States and the Afghan rebels.  </P> <P> On a related matter, Tutwiler said the State Department has never received an  application for an export license to sell to Pakistan high-temperature furnaces  needed for the manufacture of nuclear arms. The Washington Post reported  Wednesday that Pakistan had tried, without success, to obtain such equipment  from an American company.  </P></p>

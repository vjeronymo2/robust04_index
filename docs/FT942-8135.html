			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Fashion: Secret ingredients for surviving the Season - As the rites of a summer in society get under way, Brenda Polan offers a guide for those still wondering what to wear There are those who are certain that the as yet undescribed ninth circle of Hell is a day at the races, an endless torture of tedium, tight clothes, forced-feeding, alcoholic poisoning, foul weather and wasted money. Others seem to enjoy it. But whether they enjoy it or endure it, for many people going to Ascot, Cheltenham or Newmarket is a summer rite which it would be unthinkable to duck. The same goes for the rest of the Season, that spring-to-autumn round of entertainments which keeps the upper classes and aspiring other ranks fed, watered and anxious about what to wear for the months of what we like to call summer. It is true that, for the last couple of recession-strapped years, the numbers of those participating have dwindled, but the Season is a resilient social mechanism and there are signs that optimism is overcoming discretion and will swell this year's crowd. Almost as if anticipating an influx of newcomers, a recent issue of Tatler, the society magazine bought by many outside the circles that it writes about, provided a pithy survival guide. For the benefit of those not bred to it, who might be misled by newspaper photographs or bedazzled television coverage, Tatler reveals the secret ingredients which make the Season bearable. These range widely from a stock of safety pins, emergency wellies in the car boot and a supply of blankets to a portable telly, a tow rope and rheumatic hot packs from Boots or, more appropriately, Holland and Holland. Although umbrellas and sturdy flat shoes feature most repetitively, the references to thermal vests are almost as obsessive (Hanro's silk number from Harrods is the vest of choice but, unless the consumption of champagne is truly excessive or one gets altogether too close to the river bank at Henley, no one need ever find out that one has opted for St Michael). Spare pairs of tights are an obvious precaution; lead weights in your hem if you are helicoptering are less so. Taking your passport to polo just in case a dashing Argentine persuades you to run away with him is a provision that may well not occur to you; stuffing a train timetable into your handbag just in case you need to do a solitary runner just might. However, apart from recommending bright and cheerful foul-weather gear for Cowes, suggesting multi-layered, easy-strip outfits for the suffocating tents at the Chelsea Flower Show, and giving a firm reminder that skirts must cover the knee at Henley, Tatler leaves outerwear mostly to the reader's discretion. And, in fact, it is easier to dress for the Season than it used to be. Many of the rules have been relaxed in recent years. Trousers, if they are part of a trouser suit, are permitted in the Royal Enclosure at Ascot, although not yet at Henley. A short cocktail dress will not get its wearer expelled from a ball but she will probably feel uncomfortably different. High-heeled shoes at a polo ground will single one out as a newcomer and exclude one from the uproarious bonding ritual of stamping in the divots. Hats are, of course, still necessary - if not essential - at most daytime events. Although Seasonal lore is full of tales of unprepared unfortunates whose straw hats have drooped and whose flimsy frocks have turned transparent in an Ascot downpour, there is no such thing as a rain-resistant hat - unless it is a thoroughly unromantic purpose-built rain hat. Thus, unless a drought is forecast, a largish handbag, a pack-away plastic cape and an elegant plain-canopied (no logos permitted) umbrella are essential baggage. Many women settle for making their escort tote the umbrella but that does mean they are joined hip and thigh for the day. A collapsible umbrella suspended by a nylon loop from the wrist is less attractive than a long, tapering umbrella with which one can pose fetchingly and with which, as the Princess of Wales once demonstrated, one can prod one's acquaintances into attentiveness. Although a relaxation in the ordinances imposed by society's style police may have made things easier, in some ways fashion has made them harder. Late-1980s style provided uniforms for all occasions. The little tight suit in various fabrications could carry one through the day and through the cocktail hour and out to dinner. Now the confusion of long skirts, short, flared skirts, wide pants and narrow pants make decisions much harder. Last summer, short skirts - which could just about still be worn straight and short - outnumbered long skirts. This summer the long skirt is more powerfully entrenched, especially in pretty layers of chiffon. It will be interesting to see at Ascot next week whether the spirit of Cecil Beaton flits again. Certainly, it is likely that the cocktail dress will have been supplanted, especially among debutantes, by softly cut, fluid, layered separates: chiffon palazzo pants and a cashmere sweater; besashed crinkled silk or satin long skirt and antique lace blouses; layered satin slip dresses, long or very short indeed. The slip dress, the ultimate in cool minimalism, is likely to feature strongly at balls, too, although most leading fashion designers seem to be placing their bets on its sartorial opposite: cleavage-enhancing boned bodices and sculpted crinoline skirts. If they are right, then the brief years of recessional penance and low profile for the Season are over indeed.</p>

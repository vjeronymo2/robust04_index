			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOING ORGANIC  </P> <P> Getting an organic garden started and helping it to flourish is easier than you  might suspect, and it's well worth the effort. In the balmy climate of Southern  California, you won't have many of the disease or insect problems you might in  less hospitable place, which makes gardening organically easier from the word  go.  </P> <P> Organic gardening is more than avoiding the use of chemical pesticides or  fertilizers. It's a cohesive approach to soil health and balance that  encourages lush plant growth and discourages "bad" bugs with natural predators.  </P> <P> Michael Maltas, who runs Fetzer Vineyards' 5-acre experimental farm in Hopland,  Calif., is the envy of any gardener just starting out on organics -- and of  many who have been gardening organically for a while. The Fetzer garden is  immaculate, lush and extremely productive, and you would swear that no aphid  had ever ventured anywhere close.  </P> <P> Maltas has a few tips for budding organic gardeners:  </P> <P> * Don't start too big. You can grow all the vegetables one family could want in  a 20-by-25-foot garden. Even 100 square feet will give you enough space for  almost anything you want to grow.  </P> <P> * Before you touch a shovel or a hoe, sit down with a piece of graph paper and  plan your entire garden. Figure out exactly where the "hardscapes" -- paths and  drip irrigation systems -- should go first.  </P> <P> * Make a list of the vegetables and herbs your family really likes. Why waste  space on radishes if no one is going to eat them? Decide if you want just  enough to eat what's in season or if you want ample quantities for canning. Or  maybe you'll choose to plant only flowers. Regardless, realize that you can't  do it all at first, so aim small.  </P> <P> * If your family is like most, you should probably include two or three tomato  plants (try a couple of different varieties, including a yellow or an Italian).  Plan on planting several dozen lettuce plants, and stagger the planting so that  you'll have fresh salads all summer long. About five pepper plants of different  varieties will give you a good selection, and you'll definitely want several  basil and oregano plants.  </P> <P> * Prepare your soil by cutting out the sod and taking it away -- don't just  turn it under or you'll have a garden full of grass within a month. Dig in as  many bags of compost as you can find or make.  </P> <P> * Tamp the pathways down hard and you'll cut way back on the amount of weeding  you have to do. Many gardeners cover their paths with pea gravel or wood chips  to help choke weeds back. If you can keep the paths weed-free, it will be much  simpler to keep the occasional weed that appears among your vegetables pulled.  Plus, your good planning will ensure that the paths don't get watered; without  water, no weeds.  </P> <P> * Keep your planting plan for next season. You don't want to plant the same  vegetables in the same spots year after year, especially those from the cabbage  family.  </P> <P> * Avoid any chemical fertilizers or pesticides. Many organic gardeners  supplement with fish emulsion -- just follow the directions on the bottle. Pick  off bugs by hand or wash with mildly soapy water if you get an infestation of  leaf hoppers or aphids. Some people swear that tobacco juice works wonders on  the pests, others just spray with clear water a couple of times a day to keep  them washed off.  </P> <P> * Try to think about how each of your actions as a gardener affects the whole,  not just the effect on a specific symptom. This is the critical difference  between organic and conventional gardening.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Eighteen Brazilian prisoners died and eight others were injured after they were  jammed into a tiny cell in a punitive action following an attempted jail break,  authorities said. Several died of asphyxiation, while others were trampled to  death by cellmates when about 50 prisoners were packed into a 3-by-9-foot cell  without a window or ventilation, a Sao Paulo state prison system spokesman  said. The prisoners were confined to the cell after grabbing a guard at the  Parque Sao Lucas jail in Sao Paulo.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] May 12 TASS -- Commander of the  Russian 14th Army, deployed in the Moldovan break-away Dniester  province, Aleksandr Lebed has accused the leadership of the  self-proclaimed republic of attempts to blame Russian military  for the worsening economic situation.    The general rejected accusations by Dniester Bank Chairman  Vyacheslav Zagryadskiy, quoted by local media, that the field  bank of the Russian Army allegedly bought 39 billion of Dniester  roubles (interim currency made from old Soviet banknotes by  sticking a special stamp with a portrait of Russian  Field-Marshal Aleksandr Suvorov). The Army was buying Dniester  roubles in order to undermine the economy, the banker claimed.    "There is not a single Dniester rouble in the money-box of  the Army field bank", the general told ITAR-TASS today adding  that the economic catastrophe of the region had been caused by  its "incompetent and thieving leadership".    This is not the first time that Lebed accused Dniester  leaders of financial embezzlements and corruption.</p>

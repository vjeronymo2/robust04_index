			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (13): New confidence in sports car market Are congestion, environmental legislation and associated factors finally killing off the sports car and romantic notions of the open road? The new product programmes of some of the world's biggest car makers, and the resurgent fortunes of some of the smallest, suggest the very opposite. Porsche, the German luxury sports car maker, itself is now in the middle of a drastic overhaul, with new management, new methods and an impending new product range which, it claims, will return it to comfortable profits and 30,000-a-year output within the next four or five years. If its predictions are borne out, they would reinforce the assertions of industry analysts that the sales slump was a manufacturer, not a market, problem, and that despite road congestion and other adverse environmental and legislative pressures, there will remain enough sports car enthusiasts - or at least people prepared to pay for 'something different' - to justify manufacturers of all sizes investing in products for them. Unlike mainstream sectors such as saloon cars, the 'sports car' market is so multi-faceted as to defy easy categorisation. It embraces individual company production levels from a few dozen a year to approaching 50,000, and prices from under Pounds 10,000 for near-kit cars to the Pounds 400,000-plus 'supercars' of McLaren and Jaguarsport. At one end of the spectrum, UK-based Morgan is earning a modest but steady living from producing around 500 versions a year of a two-seater with its origins in the 1930s. At the other lies Japan's Mazda, which has almost single-handedly filled the vacuum left by MG with its 'cheap' - Pounds 16,000 in the UK - MX-5 roadster. In the US, where MGs were once by far the biggest selling sports car, the MX-5 has achieved peak sales of 36,000 units in a single year. As with Porsche, its fall to around 22,000 in the US last year is believed to reflect more the ageing of the model itself in what is inevitably a fashion-conscious sector of the market than any weakening of the sports car market itself. It is this consumer capriciousness, coupled to the oil crisis and recession of the early 1980s, which for a long time frightened most Western volume producers out of the sports car market. Equally, more manufacturers are taking heart from the belief that there is a worthwhile market and from advances in simultaneous engineering and other technologies that favour smaller production runs. For example, there were the decisions of resurgent Chrysler to put into production its outrageous, eight-litre, V10-engined Viper open two-seater sports car and, in the past few weeks, to add a coupe version of the same model. More than 1,000 Vipers have already been sold, despite a Pounds 55,000 price tag. The same confidence inspired Ford to invest in a new Mustang which harks back to the sports car concept of the original 1960s models. Meanwhile, General Motors' sports car, the Corvette, regularly finds a 20,000-plus market in the US. A two-seater sports car is to enter production next year at BMW's 80,000 cars a year plant in Greenville, South Carolina. Problems of definition blur the size of the sports car market in Europe, because many manufacturers consider coupes like the Opel/Vauxhall Calibra and the new Ford Probe as legitimate successors to some of the traditional open two-seater market. When these are included, industry monitoring group Automotive Industry Data suggests, there is an available west European market of between 250,000 and 300,000 units. Certainly it is big enough to tempt back some large manufacturers who had previously all but abandoned this market. Fiat, which owns Ferrari, Lancia and Alfa Romeo, is launching a two-pronged attack with an all-new Fiat coupe and an equally new open two-seater Alfa, the Spyder. Thanks to new engineering and production technology, financially hard-pressed Fiat has gone ahead with projected volumes of around 20,000 a year. Indeed the Fiat coupe, which uses Tipo hatchback floorpan and mechanicals, is a pet project of Fiat Auto managing director Mr Paolo Cantarella. It may not make much money in itself, but he expects the glamour of the sleek two-seater, now on sale to benefit the group's more mundane but bigger volume models struggling for a bigger share of Europe's mainstream market. Similar calculations are evident in other parts of the industry. All last year General Motors was touting around Europe's motor shows the Tigra, a small two-seater based heavily on GM's small European hatchback, the Spanish-built Opel Corsa. If the public liked it, GM promised, the company would build it. It has now given it the green light. Perhaps the most eagerly-awaited new sports car of all will emerge in the UK next year - the first genuinely 'new' MG since the demise of the MGB more than a decade ago. Rover group, now part of BMW, is taking an unusual route to market with the range of small MG sports cars it intends to launch in Europe and Japan in 1995, some 15 years after killing of the 'B' of which more than 500,000 were produced. The car's body is being designed, developed and manufactured by Motor Panels, the Coventry-based subsidiary of the Mayflower engineering group. Mayflower is investing up to Pounds 24.2m for the initial engineering design, development and tooling work, including the production facilities for the body shells. The two companies expect to share the profits from the project, code-named PR3. The car will use a 1.6 litre version of Rover's avant garde K-series engine, cost around Pounds 15,000 and is envisaged to be produced at a rate of 15,000 to 20,000 a year. Rover has already paved the way for the MG marque's revival with the launch last year of the RV8, an updated, limited production version of the MGB using Rover's V8 engine from the Range Rover.</p>

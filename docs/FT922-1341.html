			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Chemical weapons pact nears completion AN INTERNATIONAL treaty outlawing chemical weapons looks virtually certain to be completed this summer, after negotiations lasting more than 20 years. Mr Adolf von Wagner of Germany, current chairman of the ad hoc committee on chemical weapons of the United Nations Disarmament Conference, yesterday presented the committee with what he expects to be the final treaty draft. If all goes according to plan, the treaty will be endorsed by governments within the next seven weeks and approved by the UN General Assembly in New York this autumn before a signing ceremony in Paris early next year. The chemical weapons convention, the most ambitious multilateral disarmament accord ever attempted, will ban the development, production, stockpiling and use of toxic arms and require destruction of all stockpiles and production facilities within ten years of the treaty coming into force. The chemical weapons ban will be policed by an international inspectorate, to be based in The Hague, with wide-ranging and intrusive powers to enter and search not only highly sensitive military installations, but also civilian chemical plants making chemicals for peaceful uses such as fertilisers that could be diverted for weapons production. The negotiations in the 39-member disarmament conference have been slowed by the difficulties of balancing the need for rigorous checks to beat cheating with countries' desire to protect military and commercial secrets. The US last year backed off its own proposal in 1984 for inspections 'anywhere, anytime'. This followed objections from the Pentagon that open access would allow countries to snoop around military establishments developing, say, Stealth bomber technology.</p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MORE SCRUTINY URGED FOR PANEL CANDIDATES  </P> <P> Los Angeles County supervisors have agreed to explore ways to ensure that  applicants seeking appointments to county commissions submit accurate resumes,  but the panel stopped short of ordering Sheriff's Department background checks.  </P> <P> "I think the sheriff has enough to do to catch criminals," said Supervisor Ed  Edelman. And Supervisor Pete Schabarum called the measure "a waste of time."  </P> <P> Supervisor Deane Dana proposed considering complete background checks on  prospective commission members after one of his appointees was arrested on  forgery charges and traffic warrants. Dana said this week that he recently  received a completely false resume.  </P> <P> Schabarum and Kenneth Hahn pointedly noted that the effort to find people  willing to serve on commissions begins with personal knowledge of their  backgrounds.  </P> <P> The supervisors agreed on a 3-1 vote to instruct the county's chief  administrative officer and the county counsel to explore ways of improving the  application procedure and report their findings within 30 days.  </P></p>

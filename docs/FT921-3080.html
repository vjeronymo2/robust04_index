			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (23): A national treasure plundered - Lack of funds and international dealers are destroying a remarkable cultural heritage SADLY for Nigeria, her remarkable cultural heritage is being traded in the markets of Amsterdam, Paris and New York. A visit to the National Museum in Lagos provides an eye-opener on the treasures Nigeria has to offer. The Nok terracottas from Zaria province, dating back to the period 900BC-200AD, are the oldest pieces so far discovered. The collection of elaborate Igbo-Ukwu bronze artefacts, discovered in Anambra state, come from the 9th-10th centuries and the fine terracotta busts from Ife, the city state of the Yoruba, are from the 11th-15th centuries. Probably the best known pieces are the Benin bronzes, which depict life at the Benin court from the arrival of the Portuguese in the 15th century to 1897, when a British force sacked Benin city. As Professor Ade Obayemi, former director-general of the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM), explains: 'We have to battle against internationally financed speculators and dealers. As soon as you make an announcement of a find, the places are cleaned out.' The thieves often conduct their own digs and, as Professor Obayemi admits, are 'well connected with the police and security systems'. In many ways, the superb quality of Nigerian antiquities is their undoing. In terms of monetary value, a Benin bronze head was sold at auction in London by Christie's in 1989 for Pounds 1.2m. The provenance of pieces, which appear at auction, usually dates back to the colonial period, and auctioneers say they are reluctant to accept pieces which may have more recently been stolen. For the modern-day smuggler, the market is made up of a network of private dealers and collectors whose financial muscle far exceeds that of the NCMM. The smuggler is aided by the failure of some countries, notably the UK, to sign Unesco agreements banning the illegal trade in antiquities. However, the NCMM has scored some successes. In 1987, the museum in the city of Jos was raided and a Benin bronze head, originally taken by the British and returned at independence, was again stolen. In December 1990, it turned up at the Rudolf Mangisch gallery in Switzerland and has since been repatriated to Nigeria. However, the cost of guaranteeing security for the piece in Jos museum is prohibitive and the head was placed in the NCMM vaults, out of public view. Inadequate funding of the NCMM is probably as great a threat to Nigerian cultural heritage as the international dealers. The entrance fee to the Lagos museum is all of one naira - a US nickel (five cents). A look at the exhibits immediately reveals some of the problems to be faced. Litmus humidity indicators are placed in each cabinet with the words 'examine exhibit if pink' - indicating excess humidity. Nearly all the indicators are pink, and have been for some time. The present director of Museum and Monuments, Dr CK Gonyok, is acutely aware of the problem: 'We don't have the laboratories, chemicals, specialised pins and microscopes to take adequate care of these works,' he explained to a Nigerian newspaper which had expressed its concern. While the exhibition at the National Museum is magnificent, it is also permanent. Lack of money keeps more than 100,000 other pieces in the vaults. The worst effects of under-funding can be seen at Nigeria's historic monuments. The ancient city wall of Kano, once 15 metres high, can now be stepped over and the walls of Zaria and Benin are also threatened. While the cost of reconstruction is enormous, the federal budget for maintenance and rehabilitation of national monuments has been derisory - in 1987, just N3,000. More recent buildings, such as the 19th century Brazilian-style houses built in south-west Nigeria by emancipated slaves returning to Nigeria from Brazil, are also being destroyed. Preservation orders are often ignored by the owners of the buildings, who prefer to capitalise on the value of the land for development. The nation's architectural heritage is fast being replaced by western-influenced high-rise steel and glass blocks. The protruding exhaust pipes of electric generators are often the only architectural admission to the Nigerian context. An adequate response from the government is essential, as is public confidence that the government is sincere in its policy towards the nation's heritage. As well as the vast public collection of antiquities, some of the finest examples are those owned privately by Nigerians. Many owners want to open private museums, but are restrained through fear that (in spite of assurances to the contrary) once exhibited the items will be declared public property. They also doubt the security of NCMM vaults. One collector admits that 'the risk is sufficient for me even to keep some pieces abroad. It's a dilemma similar to the Elgin Marbles; under present conditions, where will these precious items be most secure?' Until people trust government policy, funding for the NCMM is improved, and the international community recognises the need to protect Nigeria's cultural heritage, the future will remain bleak. The deterioration and destruction of national monuments will continue. And Nigerian antiquities will continue to become the property of international collectors, their status degraded to that of expensive objets d'art to be displayed in the living-rooms of Europe and America.</p>

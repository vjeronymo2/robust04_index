			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- The Democratic Socialist  Party (DSP), a party in the ruling coalition, on Wednesday [8  June] named Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa as party head,  succeeding Keigo Ouchi, who resigned over a political blunder  that brought about the first minority government in four decades.    Yonezawa was selected on the second day of the party's  convention without a vote since he was uncontested.    The No. 2 post of secretary general was assumed by Kansei  Nakano, a veteran party member of the House of Representatives.    Ouchi, health and welfare minister in the cabinet of Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata, stepped down from the party chairmanship  under pressure from rank-and-file party members and supporters.    They have been disgruntled by his high-handed move to create  a new parliamentary group, "Kaishin," without participation from  the Social Democratic Party (SDP), then the coalition's largest  bloc.    The SDP consequently walked out of the grouping just after  Hata was elected prime minister, depriving the coalition of  majority support.    At the convention, Yonezawa acknowledged the party's growing  distrust of its main coalition partners, Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] and Komeito [Clean Government Party], as well as  ire toward the SDP.    He made clear he wants to keep the DSP within the coalition  to counter the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the largest  opposition force, while suggesting alliance talks with SDP  lawmakers.    "There are also people within the SDP who can be our  friends," he said.    He took critics against Shinseito and Komeito to task,  calling them "emotional."</p>

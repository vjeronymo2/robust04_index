			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 14 Apr (NA) -- Interior Minister  Carlos Ruckauf said today that a professional Army "represents a  mid- or long-term possibility" and ruled out the possibility of  Argentina being able, at this moment, to implement "this type of  project."    Thus, Ruckauf discussed the possibility of replacing the  current compulsory military service system with a professional  Army. He nevertheless refused to make any additional comments  because this issue does not specifically involve his portfolio,  but the Defense Ministry.    The interior minister stressed: "An unrestricted dignity  must  be guaranteed for those drafted." He added that conscripts  "must not be petty soldiers, but qualified soldiers in order to  defend our fatherland."    In remarks to journalists accredited to the Government  House,  the interior minister pointed out: "In my opinion, General  (Martin) Balza's quick handling of such a delicate situation is  very significant."</p>

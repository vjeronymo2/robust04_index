Mr Surin met Minister of State for National Rehabilitation  Keat Chhon and Under-Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs  Ung Sean and Pok Marina shortly after arriving here for a  three-day visit.    Mr Surin did not meet Foreign Minister Norodom Sirivut  yesterday as planned because the prince had left suddenly for  Beijing on Tuesday to brief King Norodom Sihanouk on the  situation in Pailin, a diplomatic source said.    But Prince Sirivut is expected back in Phnom Penh today and  the two may still meet here before the prince pays a visit to  Bangkok next week.    The Khmer Rouge yesterday said Pailin remained under their  control.    Mr Surin stressed to those he did meet here yesterday that  the refugee situation at the Thai-Cambodian border is now under  control.    He maintained there is no need to call for international  help  since Cambodia now has a government that could look after its  own people.    Mr Surin on Tuesday inspected the border village of Ban  Pakkad where an estimated 25,000 Cambodians fleeing from  fighting in nearby Pailin have sought refuge.    Mr Surin reiterated Thailand's readiness to discuss with the  Cambodian Government overlapping claims in the Gulf of Thailand  before launching any joint development projects.    "If they are ready to talk, we're ready. It would be good if  (they) have a delegation to Bangkok as quickly as possibly to  begin the discussion," he said.    "The same message will be given to Prince Sirivut when he  visits Bangkok on Monday," Mr Surin said.    Mr Surin said he noted during yesterday's discussions that  Thailand would like to discuss fishery issues in a separate  forum.    He also requested an extension of the March 31 deadline set  for the transport of felled logs and mining equipment from  Cambodia to Thailand.    "Because of the fighting, the removal is very difficult. We  hope Cambodia will reconsider the deadline and hope the issue  will be discussed when Prince Sirivut comes to Thailand," Mr  Surin said.</p>

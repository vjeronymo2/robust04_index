			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Border Definition Prepared"] </F>   [Text] The Karachay-Cherkesia Land Resources Committee has  prepared a definition of where the line of the state border  between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Georgia runs  on Republic of Karachay-Cherkesia territory for discussion at an  official interstate level.    Karachay-Cherkesia and Georgia are neighbors. For many  decades the border between them has been a symbolic line which  nobody can guard, running along the inaccessible glacier heights  of the Main Caucasian Range. But now, with the worsening crime  threat and the increasing number of refugees and forced  settlers, the problem of the border, which needs equipping, is  being discussed by Karachay-Cherkesia as an especially urgent  one, Oleg Dyba, the head of Karachay-Cherkesia's press  secretary, noted in a conversation with an ITAR-TASS  correspondent.    In order to further discuss and coordinate where and how the  border with Georgia should be equipped, the Karachay-Cherkesia  Council of Ministers has formed a special expert commission,  taking part in whose work will be specialists of the Russian  Federation Federal Border Service's "Cherkessk" First  Independent Border Troops Komendantura and of the Republic of  Karachay-Cherkesia State Committee for Geology and Mineral  Utilization.</p>

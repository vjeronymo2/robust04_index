			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO MORE 'CHICKEN SOUP'  </P> <P> Jackie Mason, star of the canceled "Chicken Soup," continues to claim he is not  a racist. But in the Nov. 10 Morning Report, he is quoted as saying that "black  columnists . . . feel if they don't have anybody to call a racist then they  don't have anything to write about." That is tolerant indeed.  </P> <P> In referring to the criticism of his comments about the New York mayoral  campaign, Mason is quoted as saying that the racism charges against him are  motivated by "sick guilt" and that "any decent person would feel stupid for  calling me a racist." If he doesn't want to be called a racist, I suggest that  he try thinking before he opens his mouth. I am one decent person who has no  sick guilt about loathing a man who, in addition to slandering other groups,  demeans his own by playing a stereotype in a weekly sitcom.  </P> <P> M. MAINIERI  </P> <P> Artesia  </P> <P>  Mason had generated controversy by suggesting that many Jews, out of a sense  of guilt, might vote for David Dinkins, a black, in the New York City mayoral  race.  </P> <P> </P></p>

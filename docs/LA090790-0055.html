			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> LAGOMARSINO IS A NO-SHOW AT FORUM;  </P> <P> POLITICS: THE EVENT'S ORGANIZER AND THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN'S CHIEF RIVAL  CRITICIZE HIS ABSENCE.  </P> <P> Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) declined to meet his two challengers at  a candidates forum in Ventura Thursday night, angering the event's organizer.  </P> <P> Reb Wayne, chairman of Lagomarsino's reelection campaign, said he was not aware  of any commitment to attend the forum. Although Lagomarsino is in Ventura this  week, official duties prevented him from attending the forum, Wayne said.  </P> <P> Wayne said the congressman is not avoiding a face-off with Anita Perez  Ferguson, his Democratic challenger, or Mindy Lorenz, a write-in candidate  representing the fledgling Green Party.  </P> <P> "Bob has always debated his opponents and there will be debates," Wayne said.  He suggested that debates will be held in October.  </P> <P> But Lagomarsino's decision left bruised feelings at the National Council of  Jewish Women, which sponsored the event. Florence Yosnow, legislative  chairwoman of the group, said Lagomarsino's staff had twice assured her that  the congressmen would attend or send a representative.  </P> <P> "Since they told us on two occasions that they would come, I was disappointed  that they pulled out at the last moment," Yosnow said. "Wouldn't you be upset?"  </P> <P> Ferguson thanked the 70 people who congregated at Temple Beth Torah for making  the effort to participate in the candidates' forum, a longtime tradition.  During most of her alloted time, she attacked Lagomarsino for a lack of  leadership in Washington, which she said was made evident Thursday night by his  conspicuous absence.  </P> <P> "If Congressman Lagomarsino was here tonight, I would ask him why he is not  paying more attention to the health-care system," Ferguson told the crowd that  included many elderly residents. "He is not here tonight in large measure  because he has failed, not only on health care, but on a wide range of issues."  </P> <P> Wayne said he only learned of the candidates forum recently and didn't know who  on Lagomarsino's staff would have agreed to send a representative to such a  meeting. "Bob does not allow surrogates to act in his behalf at candidate  forums or debates," he said. "He feels that only Bob Lagomarsino can speak for  Bob Lagomarsino."  </P> <P> Ken Carter, Lagomarsino's top aide in the district, said he is in charge of the  congressman's schedule here and he had never spoken to Yosnow. He said the  congressman never intended to participate in the forum and blamed the Ferguson  campaign for trying to stir up trouble.  </P> <P> "I think it is apparent that they are trying to create a controversy where  there isn't one," Carter said.  </P> <P> In any future debate, Lagomarsino will insist on a wide-ranging discussion that  would draw an audience from across the political spectrum, Wayne said.  </P> <P> "We want to do debates and if we use a sponsor, we want one that is going to  have a broad appeal," Wayne said. He said the Lagomarsino campaign wants to  avoid debates or other campaign meetings sponsored by groups with "their own  agenda."  </P> <P> Sam Rodriguez, Ferguson's campaign manager, said he was not buying Wayne's  explanation for Lagomarsino's absence Thursday and refusal to send a surrogate.  "In 1988, he sent surrogate speakers numerous times to campaign events,"  Rodriguez said.  </P> <P> Ferguson decided to address the group Thursday even though her chief opponent  failed to show. "The issues need to be debated with him or without him,"  Rodriguez said.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dinesh Kumar: "India's Options To Match Pak </F> Threat"]    [Text] New Delhi, April 27--The Indian Air Force is  understood to have submitted several options before the  government to meet threats emerging from Pakistan's likely  acquisition of 38 more multi-role F-16 fighters from the United  States.    Among the options under active consideration is a package  comprising an additional squadron of the Russian Mig-29, a  unirole air superiority fighter, along with up to three more  squadrons of the French Mirage-2000 multi-role aircraft. The IAF  [Indian Air Force] presently has two and three squadrons each of  the Mirage-2000 and Mig-29 aircrafts. However, a proposal to  induct an additional squadron each of the Mirage-2000 and  Mig-29, submitted during the tenure of the former chief of air  staff, Air Chief Marshal N.C. Suri, has been hanging fire for  almost two years now on account of indecision and the prevailing  resource crunch.    Other options projected by the IAF include induction of a  second multi-role fighter variant in addition to the Mirage-2000  and even examining the Russian offer to jointly produce the long  range Su-27 interceptors, which have already been acquired by  China.    Looking beyond the figure of 38 F-16s that the Pakistan Air  Force (PAF) is set to acquire, the IAF requirement projections  are catering for the total 71 more such aircraft that Pakistan  is seeking to obtain from the United States. Taking into account  the 37 F-16s already in the PAF's inventory, the IAF is drawing  up long-term plans to counter the final figure of 108 F-16s or  six squadrons worth of this nuclear weapon delivery capable  aircraft that the PAF hopes to have before the end of this  century.    In principle, the IAF is of the opinion that the multi-role  nuclear weapon delivery capable F-16 has to be met with a  multi-role aircraft. While the IAF is interested in the more  advanced `M' version of the Mig-29 (India presently only has the  Mig-29B version), this aircraft type alone will not be the  answer to the F-16 since the Mig-29 is essentially a unirole  interceptor.    Similarly, defence experts point out that a unirole deep  penetration strike aircraft would again not be viable since a  strike mission would require a package of air defence aircraft  for protection against enemy interception. This would involve  many more aircraft per mission not to mention cost of fuel and  the time involved.    A multi-role aircraft could switch roles from strike to air  defence and vice versa. Till now the two PAF F-16 squadrons  comprising 37 aircraft were matched by IAF's two Mirage-2000  squadrons comprising 45 aircraft (including reserve). Besides,  the two present PAF F-16 squadrons were more likely to be  involved in air defence roles owing to fewer numbers of this  aircraft type available to them and the fact that Pakistan  lacking in geographical depth needed superior aircrafts to  protect high value targets such as its all important nuclear  programme facility at Kakuta, Karachi port, Sargodha and  Chaklala air bases, etc.    But with a total six squadrons of F-16s, defence experts  point out that the balance would be substantially tilted in the  PAF's favour providing it with a phenomenal long arm and  rendering vulnerable many key locations of strategic importance  located deep inside Indian territory. These include Bombay High,  the vast industrial complex stretching from Ahmedabad to Bombay,  the HAL and IAF Mig-27 and Mig-23 assembly and overhauling  facilities at Ozhar not to mention New Delhi, the Mathura  refinery, etc.    Significantly, whlie all variants of three F-16s are capable  of delivering nuclear weapons, the IAF has no such aircraft  which includes the Mirage-2000H that it has. The numerical  strength that the IAF enjoys vis-a-vis the PAF holds no value  owing to two main reasons. Firstly, the IAF has to cater to its  vast borders on both the western and eastern fronts, and  secondly, owing to the old vintage of IAF's aircraft. While the  bulk of the PAF fighter fleet is of medium to state-of-the-art  technology, the bulk of IAF's fleet ranges from medium to low  technology.    In fact a new area of concern is the nine odd squadrons of  the Type 77 and Type 96 variants of the Mig-21 that the IAF will  be phasing out by the end of this century. In any case these  aircraft have already outlives their life and cannot be put to  frontline use. From where will the IAF find a replacement? One  possibility is buying up the Mig-29 assembly line which was  offered to India in the 1980s. Another option is to accept the  Russian offer to jointly produce the Su-27.    But whatever be the final outcome, it is evident that IAF's  answer to the PAF's F-16s will rest on the sole consideration of  resources available to buy matching aircraft. A Mig-29 will not  be less than Rs 50 crores [rupees] a piece while a single  Mirage-2000 will not cost less than Rs 80 crores. An expensive  proposition no doubt, but prosperity has always hinged on  security.</p>

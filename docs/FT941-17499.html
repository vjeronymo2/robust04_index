			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: A programme for Russia's revival Sir, Debate about the appropriate economic policy for Russia will continue in 1994. As an economist and businessman, I spent a large proportion of 1992 and 1993 in Russia and would make several points. First, high and variable inflation is certainly a problem but has not been as instrumental in keeping foreign investors away (including from the privatisation process) as political instability and lack of progress in commercial legislation and administration. Second, there is need for great caution in significantly tightening macro-economic policy in rapid pursuit of very low inflation. The high level of debt leverage and low level of 'marketisation' of the economy increases the risk of further large falls in production. Very tight macro policies also deny producers the financial resources, the market demand, and the time needed to undertake structural change. Third, the experience of other countries offers little support to those who seek to 'shock' Russia into low inflation. Despite its high level of 'marketisation', the New Zealand economy stagnated in the second half of the 1980s while the rest of the world grew because a tight macro-economic policy and the after-effects of excessive debt leverage offset the positive effects of a generally excellent structural reform programme. Poland began its reform programme with a much less market-orientated economy than New Zealand and consequently found it much more difficult. Russia, however, is even further behind, so any eventual successes in Poland will not be easily repeated. As for Ukraine, it may be that very tight monetary and budgetary policies would have made things even worse. That country's problems stem from it being an energy importer at increasing prices, the loss of experience in dealing with itself and the world, which came with its separation from Moscow, and the almost complete lack of micro-economic reform.

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Arts: Jansons and the St Petersburg Philharmonic - Concert The search for hard currency keeps Russian musicians on the road. It is remarkable to think back a decade to a time when the great Russian opera companies of the Bolshoy and the Kirov were virtually unknown in Britain, whereas now their work is the most familiar here of all foreign companies. To see the St. Petersburg Philharmonic again - Russia's single indisputably great orchestra - is like embracing a close friend after a brief absence. Hardly any British musical venue of importance has failed to welcome it at some point over the last few years: the Proms, the Edinburgh Festival, Symphony Hall in Birmingham - they have visited them all. This was the orchestra's second visit to the Barbican this year alone. Further concerts in 1995 are already planned. Overkill, perhaps? No, one never tires of playing at this level and with this individuality of character, the latter always the sign of a aristocrat among orchestras. Such a description might once have seemed incongruous. On record in the 1960s and '70s (those raw Russian Melodiya recordings) the orchestra was recognised by its virtuosity and brassy force, a somewhat brash alloy. Now that we have come to know the orchestra in the flesh, the sound seems quite different. At the Barbican it comes across as unexpectedly cultured. Berlioz's Roman Carnival Overture was sharp and detailed, but also well balanced, no overplaying from the brass. The smoky luxuriousness of divided strings in Rakhmaninov's Symphonic Dances came from the exemplary blend of parts. In all this I assume the players had an influence, as the conductor Mariss Jansons has on occasion allowed other orchestras (notably the Royal Concertgebouw) to be too loud in this hall. In Sibelius's Violin Concerto the interplay between soloist and orchestra was perfectly judged. Maxim Vengerov does not have a particularly big sound (Anne-Sophie Mutter, in this same concerto recently, was prodigious with tone and colour by comparison) but he feels the music from the inside, knows how to shape a phrase, gives character and meaning to everything he plays. It was a performance that kept eyes and ears on alert. From Jansons himself one expects nothing less. For decisiveness there is no conductor today to touch him. Every rhythm in the Rakhmaninov was absolutely exact, clipped into place or punched out, as the occasion demanded. The athletic leap in the air that he does on the last chord of each piece only added to the dance-like quality of the playing - a thrilling, dynamic performance that would be difficult to beat. Electricity sizzles from the tips of this man's fingers.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: API swings back into the black with Pounds 3.85m API GROUP, the packaging concern, swung back from losses to pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.85m on turnover flat at Pounds 62m in the year to October 3. Last time's losses of Pounds 470,000 were restated from profits of Pounds 703,000 because defence costs against the failed takeover offer from NMC, a rival packager, previously debited as extraordinary costs, have been taken above the line as exceptionals. Gross profit margins improved from 23.5 to 26.3 per cent, a rise of 11 per cent. A proposed final dividend of 4.45p lifts the full-year pay-out 11 per cent to 7.5p, which was forecast at the time of the NMC bid. It is payable from earnings of 12.8p (restated losses 2.4p), 'the first time in three years we've had such cover', according to Mr Dennis Holt, finance director. Mr Moger Woolley, chairman since February, said the profits turnround was due to operating profits up Pounds 2.01m at Pounds 3.71m, interest charges down at Pounds 179,000 (Pounds 427,000) and a swing in exceptionals from a debit of Pounds 1.74m to a credit of Pounds 321,000. In the image enhancement division, operating profits more than doubled to Pounds 2.52m (Pounds 1.11m), while profits from converted film and paper products grew to Pounds 2.03m (Pounds 1.1m). The only fly in the ointment was the heating and ventilating systems division which was affected by the weak property market. Profits fell to Pounds 230,000 (Pounds 499,000).</p>

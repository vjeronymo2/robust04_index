Sinaisky, the only Soviet conductor to  win the First Prize Gold Medal at the Von Karajan Competition in Berlin,  replaces Valery Gergiev, who has been hospitalized, the symphony announced this  week. Sinaisky, who is a conductor at the Bolshoi Opera Theatre, will conduct  an all-Russian program featuring San Diego Symphony concertmaster Igor Gruppman  in Glazunov's Concerto in A Minor. Gruppman was announced as a substitute  earlier this month for Russian virtuoso, Ilya Grubert, who also had to cancel.  </P></p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / UK Company News: Marlowe to propose new B&amp;F equity Marlowe Holdings, whose offer for Bennett &amp; Fountain, the wholesaler and retailer of electrical goods, went unconditional in November, said yesterday it would propose that B&amp;F should seek 'a very substantial amount of new equity from its shareholders which would dramatically dilute the existing share capital'. A letter to shareholders on February 11 said Marlowe believed a financial reconstruction was necessary to reduce borrowings of more than Pounds 20m, against shareholders' funds restated at Pounds 1.1m as at June 30. Shares in B&amp;F were suspended at 2 3/4 p on February 28. They are expected to resume trading today following yesterday's announcement of the interim results. For the six months to December 31 B&amp;F incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 4.73m (Pounds 1.58m) on turnover of Pounds 28.9m (Pounds 32.5m). Marlowe's offer of 2p cash for each B&amp;F ordinary share will close on May 9.</p>

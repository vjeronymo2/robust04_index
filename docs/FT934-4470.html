			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Royal Bank of Scotland surges to Pounds 265m for year Royal Bank of Scotland yesterday reported transformed pre-tax profits of Pounds 265.2m, up from 12.6m, helped by a 26 per cent fall in bad debt provisions, a recovery from losses in branch banking and a sharp rise in income from foreign exchange and derivatives. Its shares rose 33p to 428p yesterday, completing a 21 per cent advance since the Pounds 50.2m pre-tax profits of its Direct Line insurance subsidiary were announced last week. The results for the year to September 30 raised expectations that other clearing banks will report much improved profits for the year as income is boosted by trading activities, and charges for bad and doubtful debts are cut. Royal Bank raised its total dividend 25 per cent to 11p, against 8.8p. Mr George Mathewson, chief executive, said it had reduced the volatility of its earnings and could now 'deliver a stable and growing dividend stream'. Earnings per share increased from 0.7p to 17.7p and the dividend was covered 1.6 times, against 0.1 times. It kept a strong 6.9 per cent ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in spite of raising assets to Pounds 36.3bn, against Pounds 34.6bn. Total income rose 17 per cent to Pounds 1.43bn, while expenses rose 10 per cent to Pounds 837.2m, against Pounds 764.3m. Bad debt provisions fell from Pounds 396.2m to Pounds 293.2m, with Pounds 182.3m of the provisions falling in the first half. Mr Peter Wood, Direct Line chief executive, bought nearly Pounds 8m of shares yesterday morning, raising his stake to the level agreed with Royal Bank. The bank's UK staff will receive a 5.1 per cent profit-related pay bonus. The branch banking division turned from a Pounds 16.1m loss to a Pounds 69.7m profit after higher sales of mortgages and life products. The division gained Pounds 26m from a restructuring programme which is expected to add Pounds 200m a year to profits by 1997. The corporate and institutional banking division increased profits 92 per cent to Pounds 129.7m, and expanded its customer base by 20 per cent. Related foreign exchange and derivative activities contributed Pounds 107.5m, against Pounds 63.2m. Citizens, the US retail banking subsidiary, raised profits 84 per cent to Pounds 36.3m, with net interest income rising 23 per cent from acquisitions and growth. Loan loss provisions rose Pounds 4m to Pounds 19.7m because of exchange rate movements. Lex, Page 16; Markets, Page 42</p>

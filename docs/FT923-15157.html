			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Japanese slump leads to European job losses JAPAN'S leading securities houses, hurt by the domestic stock market slump and the sharp decline in underwriting business, have been discreetly reducing personnel at their European operations. In the latest of the moves, Daiwa Securities is considering local staff cuts at its Swiss subsidiary and a reorganisation of its warrant trading desk in London. This follows personnel reductions at European operations of other three leading brokers, Nomura Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities. The sharp fall in overseas underwriting by Japanese companies, together with the fall of the Tokyo market, has prompted Japanese houses to refocus on their domestic operations. Over the past few months, Nomura has cut some 20 of its local staff at its Swiss operations, Yamaichi and Nikko have reduced Japanese staff at their London subsidiaries. Cost-cutting at the Japanese brokers' European operations has been prompted by the plunge in overseas equity-linked financing by Japanese companies. Due to the sharp falls in the Tokyo stock market, overseas equity-linked bonds issued the year ended last March fell 56 per cent from two years ago, to Y4,215.7bn (Dollars 33.7bn) Nikko said its overseas Japanese personnel had been reduced since its domestic operations needed to be strengthened. Nomura said a further 10 per cent in costs would be cut at its Swiss subsidiaries, including rationalisation of back office operations at its Geneva, Basle and Zurich operations. Japan Securities Dealers Association has ordered Daiwa Securities and Cosmo Securities to pay penalties for illegal tobashi deals (the shuffling of stocks from account to account to avoid the booking of losses), Reuter reports. Daiwa is to pay Y10m and Cosmo Y5m by July 10.</p>

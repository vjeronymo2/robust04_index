			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Wednesday evening [13 April],  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel received the leader of the Iraqi  Kurds, Jalal Talabani, for talks during which the situation of  the Kurds in this Arab country and their struggle for autonomy  were focused on. Talabani, who is the secretary general of the  "Patriotic Union of Kurdistan" (PUK), which is opposed by  Baghdad, is currently trying to get more support by traveling  through severla countries. Since the Gulf War in 1991 Germany  has provided the Kurds in Iraq mainly with humanitarian aid,  worth 400 million German marks.    German state bodies and private organizations are operating  a  common coordination office for German aid in the town of Irbil.  Recently, German journalist Lissy Schmidt was killed in this  region; media have cited the Iraqi Government as the one that  "ordered" the killing. On Tuesday, Talabani confirmed in Bonn  that his PUK has apprehended two of the suspected killers.</p>

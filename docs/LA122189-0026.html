			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORAY FOR PANAMA'S DEMOCRACY WOUNDS CONSTITUTION HERE;  </P> <P> PANAMA: ONLY CONGRESS HAS THE POWER 'TO DECLARE WAR.' BUT MOST MEMBERS WEREN'T  EVEN INFORMED UNTIL THE ACTION HAD BEGUN.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration's invasion of Panama on Wednesday morning was illegal,  unwarranted and cynical.  </P> <P> Despite the applause from Democrats and Republicans alike, some basic facts  need to be remembered.  </P> <P> The United States has a Constitution, and that Constitution gives Congress the  sole power "to declare war" and "make rules concerning captures on land and  water." Congress did not declare war against Panama -- most members weren't  even informed until after the invasion had begun.  </P> <P> As a justification for the invasion, Bush cited Gen. Manuel A. Noriega's  declaration that "a state of war" exists between Panama and the United States.  But Bush himself declined to ask Congress to declare war; he just went ahead  and invaded on his own. This is not how our constitutional system was designed  to work.  </P> <P> Bush said another reason for the invasion -- and it was an invasion, despite  the euphemisms floating around Washington -- was the "imminent danger to 35,000  American citizens" in Panama. This was hardly demonstrated by the facts. A U.S.  Marine was killed over the weekend by Panamanian forces, but the official U.S.  version of the incident is dubious. The Marine, the Administration said, was  unarmed and somehow got lost near Panamanian military headquarters. The  Panamanians said the Marine, with three other American officers, was armed and  had opened fire.  </P> <P> In any event, that particular incident does not demonstrate that 35,000  Americans are in "imminent danger." But it gave the Administration a pretext  for an invasion that had been planned for at least three months, as CIA  Director William H. Webster acknowledged in a conversation with Rep. Henry J.  Hyde (R-Ill.). (Eager to come up with a better rationale, Bush later added that  the Administration had received an unidentified and unconfirmed intelligence  report alleging that Noriega was considering launching an urban commando  assault on American citizens in Panama.)  </P> <P> Bush also claimed that he wanted to "protect the integrity of the Panama Canal  Treaty" when, in fact, he wanted to subvert it. Under the treaty, Panama is to  appoint the canal commissioner, but the appointment has previously been made by  Washington. Bush clearly did not want Noriega to be able to install someone  hostile to the United States, so he circumvented the problem by getting rid of  Noriega. You can bet the new president of Panama will appoint a commissioner  more to Washington's liking.  </P> <P> Hypocrisy rules the Bush Administration. While it condemns Noriega's  dictatorship, it cozies up to the dictators in China who killed thousand of  students in Beijing's Tian An Men Square in June. Why the double standard?  </P> <P> Noriega is no saint. But there is no lack of unsavory governments in the world.  Does the United States have a right to invade them all? Who conferred that  right on our government?  </P> <P> The obsession with Noriega is particularly ironic, because he carried  Washington's water for 30 years. He was paid by the CIA -- during the time that  George Bush was its director -- to finger leftists in Central America. One U.S.  Administration after another winked at his excesses. But when Noriega was no  longer needed, it became politically expedient for the U.S. government to  overthrow him.  </P> <P> For Bush, as for Ronald Reagan before him, Noriega represented an easy target,  a foreign devil to oppose forcefully and thus score domestic political points.  Bush's political need for a foreign-policy triumph has been especially acute  because critics have branded him timid. The invasion was his answer, a handy  way to flex his muscles.  </P> <P> While this is Bush's blunder, it is also the Democrats'. They allowed the  Administration to dilute the ban against assassinating foreign leaders, they  banged the drums for intervention, they permitted Bush to bypass constitutional  channels and they supported him after the fact. Within hours of the invasion,  Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) was on television pledging Democratic support  for the President.  </P> <P> Most Democrats share the blame for this illegal invasion, which has needlessly  cost the lives of American soldiers and Panamanian civilians. And it has  exacted a greater toll, for it has struck another blow against democratic,  constitutional government in the United States.  </P></p>

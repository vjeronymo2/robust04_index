			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (8): Combined heat and politics  -Cogeneration industry seeks a boost in Brussels Energy efficiency and environmental cleanliness would make a strong combined argument for any kind of power generation system, but few, if any, can score so highly on both counts as combined heat and power. Unlike most conventional power generating systems, CHP recaptures the waste heat released during combustion and uses it to make steam for hot water or heating - as well as electricity. This can produce total efficiency ratings of up to 90 per cent, compared with 35 per cent thermal efficiency for the average coal fired power station or 56-58 per cent for the latest combined cycle systems. As for emissions, every 1MW of CHP reduces UK carbon emissions by 1,250 tonnes a year. It might seem odd, therefore, that the popularity of CHP varies so widely across the European Union, where CHP overall accounts for 6 per cent of electricity generated. In Holland and Denmark, the figure is 30 per cent, whereas in France it is only 2 per cent. In fact, there is a very close link between government policy that promotes CHP - or at least creates favourable conditions for it to flourish - and its success in the market place. Where governments are indifferent or allow uncertainty to develop, CHP finds it harder to prosper. The UK is a case in point. It is at the low end of the scale compared with the big European users, with only 4 per cent of its electricity coming from CHP. But the UK Government has at least set a target - of 5,000MW of CHP by the end of the century. Already, the UK has 3,000MW of CHP at work, on more than 700 sites, and until a few months ago, it looked to be coasting comfortably towards achieving the 5,000MW target. Over the past three to four years, 1,000MW of capacity has been added and the country's largest CHP scheme, a 157MW joint venture between Scottish Hydro-Electric and British Nuclear Fuels at Sellafield, Cumbria, came on stream earlier this year. The problem, however, is that the UK does not have a strategy to implement the target, according to Mr David Green, director of the Combined Heat and Power Association. In the past three or four months, few new schemes have been announced because potential CHP operators feel squeezed between rising gas prices - one of the main fuels for CHP - and regulated electricity prices. There is a 'fundamental uncertainty,' he says, over the course of UK energy policy, which makes it difficult to invest in CHP with confidence. As a consequence, Mr Green is now less certain that the 5,000MW target will be reached. Before the recent lull, the market had been growing steadily, with a strong surge of activity in the hotel industry, and a good showing in the paper and board sector. Relatively unexploited sectors include the chemicals and steel industry - where companies have held back making investments, perhaps because of lack of confidence in their own future survival. According to a report* in July by Marketing Strategies for Industry, the UK market for industrial CHP generation plant, excluding plants below 100KW, was Pounds 97.7m last year, up from Pounds 87.2m in 1992 and just Pounds 51.1m in 1989. The biggest segment last year, based on gas turbines with waste heat recovery boilers, accounted for Pounds 63.9m of the spending, followed by combined-cycle CHP with Pounds 25.5m. Use of both types has grown strongly over the past four years. The remaining Pounds 8.3m was spent on systems based around reciprocating engines. The CHPA believes the UK could have 20,000MW of CHP by 2020, but Mr Green says there will have to be changes in government policy to achieve this. To turn the widespread support for CHP into reality, it wants new and fair prices for the electricity from CHP plant, effective investment by the private and public sectors in community heating, incentives to stimulate investment by companies in CHP, and action to remove what it calls 'the distortion and inertia' which limits the wider use of CHP and community heating. In contrast, CHP has 'steamed ahead' in Denmark and the Netherlands because it has been a policy priority, says Mr Michael Brown, the CHPA's assistant director (Europe). The Netherlands, with its more industrialised economy, uses CHP both in industry and in district heating, while Denmark's CHP is much more focused on district heating. In Italy, the one EU country where electricity supply shortages are an issue, there has been considerable growth in CHP use, almost entirely in the industrial sector. Here, and also in Spain, electricity tariff changes have been an important stimulus. In Spain, however, a review is now under way after strong growth over the past three to four years, and a number of projects are on hold. Mr Brown believes the amount of electricity generated by CHP in the EU can rise to 8 or 9 per cent by the end of the decade, helped by the planned entry to the EU of Sweden and Finland. He believes the EU should set an ambitious target for the average percentage figure, much as has happened in the UK. The CHPA, and the recently-formed organisation Cogen Europe which groups it and six other similar associations in Europe, is hoping it can influence a number of Brussels initiatives in favour of CHP. These include the slow-moving plans for the liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets, and the controversial suggestion for an EU-wide energy tax to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The CHP industry is also trying to make headway on the European energy policy green paper now being drawn up by the Commission. An initial document was fairly thin on environmental issues, says Mr Brown. 'We would like to see that beefed up.' A further lobbying front involves the EU's Save programme to promote energy efficiency. Save I, now drawing to a close, was hamstrung by lack of support from member States, says Mr Brown. Save 2 is under discussion, and whatever emerges ought to have legislative teeth, says Mr Brown. Lobbying at national level, meanwhile, continues. *Power Generation Plant: UK.

			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ILLEGAL-ALIEN ARRESTS AT 30-MONTH HIGH  </P> <P> The number of illegal immigrants arrested in August was the highest in 30  months in the San Diego area, and overall arrests of aliens have increased 30%  this year, a U.S. Border Patrol spokesman said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The 52,440 arrests in August kept pace with a dramatic increase in the number  of alien arrests along the U.S.-Mexican border -- after a three-year decrease  -- first reported in April. On Tuesday, Border Patrol Agent Ted Swofford said  more than 98% of the immigrants arrested in August were Mexicans.  </P> <P> The last time more arrests were made in a month was in February, 1988, when  54,527 arrests were reported.  </P> <P> In April, Border Patrol officials reported a 50% increase in the number of  arrests between October, 1989, and March, 1990, for the San Diego area,  contrasted with the corresponding period for 1988-89. Nationwide, the increase  was slightly more than 30% for the same period.  </P> <P> Swofford blamed the increase in illegal immigrants on the deteriorating Mexican  economy and the easy availability of forged documents in the United States that  enable many aliens to get jobs.  </P> <P> He said a forged visa and Social Security card, both needed to prove to an  employer that a job seeker is in the United States legally, can be purchased  for $50 to $150. Under the 1986 law, employers can be fined and jailed for  knowingly hiring illegal immigrants.  </P> <P> "The word has gotten back to Mexico that counterfeit documents are relatively  inexpensive to get. For a few bucks, you can buy a counterfeit immigration  document and Social Security card, which will enable you to get a job. The  deterrent factor of the law has been diminished," he said.  </P> <P> Critics of the immigration law have said it won't put a dent in illegal  immigration until Congress recognizes the economic, social and political  reasons that force many Mexicans to leave their country -- legally or illegally  -- for greater opportunities in the United States.  </P> <P> Border Patrol agents are also arresting more families these days, Swofford  said.  </P> <P> "Our apprehensions are now about 20% women and kids. Five years ago, they were  probably no more than 10%," he said.  </P> <P> In August, agents also seized 653 vehicles allegedly used by alien smugglers,  and 112 of the seized cars were reported stolen. Both figures represent record  highs.  </P> <P> Another factor in the growing number of apprehensions of vehicles and illegal  immigrants was an increase by 80 in the number of agents assigned to the San  Diego area, Swofford said.  </P></p>

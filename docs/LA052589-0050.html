			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROBBINS TESTIMONY CALLED FACTOR IN MONTOYA PROSECUTION  </P> <P> Sen. Alan Robbins, whose name has surfaced as a possible target in a federal  investigation of political corruption, has been cooperating with prosecutors  and testified before a grand jury about fellow Democratic Sen. Joseph B.  Montoya, according to a legislative source familiar with the probe.  </P> <P> Robbins (D-Tarzana), who was secretly tape-recorded during the FBI's Capitol  sting operation, was questioned before the grand jury about statements he made  to an informant suggesting that Montoya's vote could be influenced by giving  the Whittier Democrat an honorarium of $2,500 to $3,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Records Subpoenaed  </P> <P> Robbins' testimony about Montoya's willingness to accept money from special  interest groups could be used in the prosecution of Montoya, who was indicted  last week on 10 counts of racketeering, extortion and money laundering.  </P> <P> After Montoya's indictment, federal investigators subpoenaed a vast array of  records involving Robbins and four public officials previously identified as  subjects of the investigation.  </P> <P> Among the documents sought by the grand jury were Robbins' campaign and  personal financial records, extensive legislative files connected with the  senator and the records of two special interest groups that have given him more  than $48,000 in campaign contributions since 1985.  </P> <P> U.S. Atty. David F. Levi, who is heading the investigation, refused to say  whether Robbins is a target of the probe.  </P> <P> "We don't discuss that kind of thing one way or another," Levi said.  </P> <P> But sources close to Robbins said the senator believes that he is not a subject  of the investigation and that federal officials will not uncover any evidence  linking him to wrongdoing. Robbins is said to be turning over records and  cooperating with investigators in the belief that the FBI is trying to  determine his credibility prior to the Montoya trial.  </P> <P> Federal officials say the investigation of political corruption, which began in  1985, could go on for years. With each major development in the case -- such as  the Montoya indictment -- investigators expect members of the public to come  forward with new allegations of extortion and corruption, perhaps involving  lawmakers who are not now targets.  </P> <P> One source familiar with the investigation said that scrutiny of the  Legislature could continue "until the well runs dry -- and if it doesn't, until  the end of time."  </P> <P> So far, federal investigators appear to have served nearly 300 subpoenas in the  case, seeking financial and legislative records involving a wide range of  issues and lawmakers.  </P> <P> Since Montoya's indictment, investigators have also stepped up interviews of  legislative staff members who formerly worked for State Board of Equalization  member Paul Carpenter, a former Democratic senator from Cypress and a target of  the investigation.  </P> <P> The other known legislative targets of the probe are Assembly members Pat Nolan  (R-Glendale), Frank Hill (R-Whittier) and Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles).  </P> <P> Montoya was indicted along with a former aide, Amiel Jaramillo, who was charged  on three counts. Three of the counts against Montoya stemmed from the  undercover sting operation, but the others are based on evidence obtained later  from legislative staff members, lobbyists and special interest groups.  </P> <P> Robbins, chairman of the Senate Insurance, Claims and Corporations Committee,  was one of several legislators tape-recorded by the FBI when he spoke with  undercover informant John Shahabian, a Senate aide who worked at one point for  Carpenter.  </P> <P> According to one legislative source familiar with the probe, Robbins agreed in  a taped conversation to Shahabian's request that he support a bill sponsored by  a "company" set up by the FBI as part of its sting operation. However, when  Shahabian offered Robbins money in exchange for his vote, the senator refused  to accept any payment, a source close to Robbins said.  </P> <P> This apparently sets Robbins apart from the known legislative targets of the  probe, all of whom have reported accepting money at one point or another from  the FBI's undercover operatives.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Public Comment  </P> <P> Robbins has repeatedly refused to discuss the case, saying: "I follow a policy  of not commenting on any of these issues. I will be consistent in that regard.  I made the comment long ago that I was the legislator who was offered money and  declined it."  </P> <P> When Robbins testified before the grand jury in April, he was asked to explain  statements he had made in one taped conversation with Shahabian that Montoya  would be likely to accept money in exchange for his vote on a bill, one  legislative source said. In particular, prosecutors wanted to know what  evidence Robbins had to indicate that Montoya could be influenced by  honorariums.  </P> <P> Robbins, however, testified that he had no specific knowledge of Montoya  trading votes for money and said that he had been talking simply about  Montoya's reputation at the Capitol.  </P> <P> In one tape-recorded conversation with Shahabian, the undercover informant told  Robbins that he wanted to become more influential in the Capitol and asked for  suggestions about directing payments from outside interests to legislators,  according to the source. Specifically, Shahabian asked how much money it would  take to obtain the vote of Montoya, chairman of the Senate Business and  Professions Committee.  </P> <P> During the conversation, Robbins suggested that Shahabian could give Montoya  honorariums as high as $2,500 to $3,000 without attracting much attention  outside the Capitol, the source said.  </P> <P> FBI undercover agents later gave Montoya an honorarium of $3,000 during a  meeting over breakfast.  </P> <P> Before Robbins' grand jury testimony, prosecutors let him review transcripts of  two taped conversations he had with Shahabian, according to the legislative  source.  </P></p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Survey of Mobile Communications (3): Drive for the mass market - Personal communications networks to be launched in the UK next year - are gambling on being able to persuade consumers to trade in their hard wired home telephone for the latest in pocket-sized hand sets. Although analogue cellular services have proved highly popular with business users wherever they have been introduced, they are expensive and have not generally succeeded in penetrating the individual or residential markets. But those building the new personal communications networks (PCNs) know that, to justify their huge investments in digital technology, they must reach the mass consumer markets by delivering attractively priced and feature-rich alternatives to the plain old telephone service. Mr Richard Goswell, managing director of Mercury Personal Communications, one of the two remaining licensed PCN operators in the UK, says PCN will 'give you a new type of telephone service released from the umbilical cord of BT' and provide the first real alternative to wired telephones since their invention more than a century ago. He believes that PCN will broaden the mobile telephony market and will not only provide a telephone which is available at all times, but also give users much more control over their personal telecommunications services. But he also acknowledges that 'people will be reluctant to separate from BT' and that, in spite of its functional benefits, PCN will win customers away from BT only if it is 'the economically rational thing to do'. MPC, a joint venture between Cable and Wireless and US West, is promising a PCN service that will offer pricing options which it says are an 'attractive alternative to the existing cellular and fixed wire operators for both business and residential customers'. But elsewhere, much of the initial enthusiasm for the PCN concept appears to have evaporated and the original PCN launch target of autumn this year has been slipping. I n 1989, w h e n the U K government asked companies to apply for PCN licences, international consortia rushed to compete, encouraged by predictions of 10m to 15m customers by the end of the century. Since then, the UK economy has sunk into recession, forecasts of the number of cellular subscribers by the end of the century have been scaled down and the need for heavy investment - estimated by some as up to Pounds 1bn for a nationwide PCN network - has scared many of the original PCN shareholders. Outside Britain, the US and most other European countries remain cautious abut PCN-style services. In Europe, only Germany has followed Britain's lead and announced plans to license a national PCN-style operator with the licence due to be awarded in December. A recent report on western Europe's telecoms markets by London-based analysts, CIT Research, said that 'the massive investment required to install a national (PCN) network, with no guarantee of a return on investment in the medium or even longer term, may deter many countries from licensing PCN', thus preserving the dominance of the public telephone operators. It now seems highly unlikely that PCN systems will be widespread in Europe before the late 1990s, by which time other digital cellular services such as the Pan-European GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) networks will be fully operational. In the UK, the two existing cellular network operators, Vodafone and Cellnet, are building GSM systems; both have already announced competitive responses to PCN. PCN technology is similar to that for GSM although PCN phones, which are covered by the European DCS1800 standard, will operate at the higher 1800MHz (MegaHertz) frequency where there is more spare capacity than the 900MHz used by GSM. However, this means that the cost of building a PCN network will be roughly double that of a GSM network because using high frequency signals with a relatively short range requires more transmitters. One advantage of using small digital cells is that PCN handsets will be able to operate at lower power and so should eventually be lighter, smaller and cheaper than GSM phones as well as offering secure, interference-free communications. Nevertheless, the uncertainties have led to a growing perception that PCN technology is a more risky investment than at first appreciated and help explain the game of musical chairs played by shareholders in the three consortia originally licensed to offer PCN services in the UK. This began with abortive merger talks between Microtel and Unitel, two of the licensees, at the end of 1990. Subsequently Pacific Telesis, Matra and Milicom pulled out of Microtel leaving it controlled by British Aerospace. In July last year BAe sold Microtel to Hutchison Telecommunications (UK), part of the Hong-Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa group, in exchange for a minority stake in the group's UK subsidiary. Meanwhile Cable and Wireless took sole control of Mercury PCN, the third licensee, by acquiring Motorola's stake, and announced plans to build a single shared network with Unitel, jointly owned by Thorn-EMI of the UK, Northern Telecom of Canada and US West. In March this year Mercury PCN merged with Unitel to form Mercury Personal Communications, leaving just two players left in the PCN race. Mr Richard Goswell of Mercury Personal Communications acknowledges that there has been 'a certain amount of settlement' among PCN shareholders, but says three PCN licences was always one too many. 'The number of operators now is right,' he says. However, some market analysts, such as UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, have suggested that Hutchison Whampoa is carefully monitoring the performance of its UK telecommunications subsidiary's other new but lower-cost UK activities - such as paging, telepoint and mobile data - before finally deciding whether to back the heavy investment needed to launch the PCN service. The PCN operators also face other competitive challenges. Vodafone, which is already testing its GSM network in the UK, has announced plans to launch its own version of a digital personal communications service in the first half of 1993, extending it to all urban areas by the end of 1995. Vodafone's Micro Cellular Network (MCN) will begin testing early next year and will be launched 'no later than July', according to Mr Chris Gent, Vodafone's managing director. MCN will be a low-cost urban-based service to be launched in south-east England in mid-1983, aimed at domestic customers and run on the back of Vodafone's GSM service operating at the same 900MHz frequency but involving the building of 3,000 micro-cells to meet the expected higher capacity requirements. Call charges are expected to range from only 10p a minute within a user's home town, to 20p a minute for national calls, putting the service in direct competition with fixed telephone networks. MCN subscribers who travel outside their home area will also be able to access the nationwide and Pan-European GSM services, but at premium rates. Like the PCN operators, Mr Gent believes MCN will help make mobile telephony available to many more people and believes that, in spite of the recession and other setbacks, there could be 7m or 8m mobile phone subscribers by the end of the century, with the as yet untapped domestic market accounting for half of this. Additional competition, at least in the business and corporate markets, could come from low cost regional varieties of GSM itself. Cellnet has put back the commercial launch of its nationwide GSM service in the UK until at least 1994, but says its research has shown demand for a regional digital service initially in areas such as London, southern England, Greater Manchester and Birmingham. Accordingly, Cellnet plans to introduce what it calls Local System for Mobile communications (LSM) regional services ahead of the launch of a national GSM network. LSM will probably be introduced first in London and is likely to be launched at the same time or even before the launch of PCN and MCN services next year. Cellnet has said its LSM services will have low usage costs to offset the expected high price of GSM handsets. Cellnet also sees LSM as one way to help manage the transition from analogue to digital cellular systems and to test customer response to GSM. For the moment 'no one is banging on our door saying we must have a digital phone', says Mr William Ostrom of Cellnet. Whether PCNs and other new digital mobile services aimed at mass markets can succeed in making inroads into domestic and traditional office environments will soon be tested. There is, however, little doubt that the old distinctions between fixed and mobile networks are already beginning to become blurred.</p>

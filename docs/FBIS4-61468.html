			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article under the heading "Panorama": "The </F> Azerbaijani Opposition Has Become More Reasonable"]    [Text] As Leyla Yunusova, chairman of the Independent  Democratic Party of Azerbaijan (NDPA), stated to the ANS-PRESS  agency, compared to the previous periods the Azerbaijan  opposition has sufficiently matured and become more civilized  and restrained. In the words of Leyla Yunusova, no attempts to  destabilize the situation in the Republic are being made by the  opposition. On the contrary, the opposition is trying to engage  in political struggle by more civilized and democratic methods.  According to the NDPA chairman, three main political blocs have  emerged in Azerbaijan: two oppositional blocs -- the Democratic  Congress and the Centrist Parties Bloc -- and the third bloc --  the leadership of the country. As Leyla Yunusova stressed, there  are also parties which for one reason or another do not  subscribe to the points of view of these three associations.</p>

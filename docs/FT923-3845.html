			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Test for public services' resolve: The perceived threat of the Citizen's Charter WHEN the prime minister launched his Citizen's Charter last year it seemed to some public-sector unions that they had at last found a sympathetic ear in government. Since 1979 the public services had faced privatisation, pay restraints and cuts in staffing. Union protests that such measures led to a deterioration in the quality of services had cut no ice. Mr John Major's desire to raise the quality of public services so that they stood comparison with the best in the private sector seemed a welcome step forward. Yesterday's TUC debate on the public services showed that any honeymoon period with Mr Major has been brief. The unions have found much that is attractive in setting service standards, giving more information to customers and making services user-friendly. But Mr Major's agenda contains much more than that. He wants to link pay much more closely to performance in ways that would fragment national pay bargaining, and his programme to expose the public services to competitive pressures threatens to undermine union organisation, which has remained relatively intact in spite of the ravages of Thatcherism. Within days of the launch of the charter it became clear that it involved much more than just name badges and complaints procedures. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced that he wanted to renegotiate Civil Service pay agreements to increase performance pay and allow departments and agencies to negotiate their own pay scales. Both measures, he said, would encourage better service for the public. For the unions, the desire to renegotiate pay agreements that had been running for only three years came as an unpleasant shock. The objective of increasing payment by results was hardly more acceptable. That is anathema to union leaders, not least because it places more emphasis on individual performance than on collective bargaining. The plan to devolve pay responsibilities to the 30 departments and 70 executive agencies also posed a threat. Instead of half a dozen national agreements covering most of the 550,000 civil servants, pay negotiations would now fragment into more than 100 separate settlements, each needing time and support from union head offices. As one general secretary put it: 'We will be very stretched by that.' Much more subversive for the unions, however, was the government's white paper on market testing, Competing for Quality, published last year. That proposed putting a large segment of government services out to tender, promising cost savings of up to 20 per cent that could be used to improve service quality. Ministers gave assurances that market testing would not inevitably lead to contracting-out. Staff would be invited to put in bids for their own work. However, the experience of local government, where compulsory competitive tendering is well established, is that the process leads to a loss of members and a weakening of union strength. Nalgo, the public-sector white-collar union, has members working in local-government sport and recreation departments that are now subject to competitive tender. While the union remains opposed to tendering, it is prepared to offer members advice on preparing a bid. That can, however, lead branches to ask if they can make concessions on nationally agreed terms and conditions to make their bid more competitive. Ms Christina McAnea, a local government negotiator for Nalgo, said: 'We're against that, naturally, but we have to be pragmatic if the branch wants to go ahead. Guaranteed hours-of-work agreements and unsocial-hours payments are most vulnerable.' If the contract goes to an outside bidder, the chances are slight that the new employer will recognise Nalgo - still less concede negotiating rights. But the union tries to keep staff who transfer to the contractor in membership, pointing out that it can still offer some protection and services even if there are no negotiating rights. There is always the chance that the contractor will lose the contract and the work will again be internal. Most of the Civil Service unions are adopting a three-pronged strategy against market testing: Campaigning against contracting-out particular jobs. The Inland Revenue Staff Federation is making much of the threat to taxpayer confidentiality in plans to contract out tax office typing. Helping members to prepare winning bids if jobs are put out to tender. Two Civil Service unions are talking to consultants about this. Recruiting staff and securing negotiating rights if the work goes to outside contractors. The last tactic will be easier for those unions whose members have already faced the process of privatisation - such as IPMS, which represents specialist civil servants. Mr Bill Brett, IPMS general secretary, said: 'My membership - 100 per cent Civil Service 20 years ago - is now one-third private sector. We have members in GEC, Babcock &amp; Wilcox and British Aerospace and none of them has ever left the union to join another.' However bullish the unions are, contracting-out threatens to erode their membership base at the same time as the fragmentation of pay negotiations requires additional resources in time and staffing. The public services remain almost 70 per cent unionised in spite of the unfavourable climate for unions in the 1980s. They will do well to emerge from the 1990s with their strength intact.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The problem of the Vietnamese war refugees at Chrey  Thom [Kandal Province] has become an issue worth considering.  According to the refugees, the Vietnamese who fled from the  Khmer Rouge's massacre around Boeng Tonle Sap Lake last year and  who have gathered in Chrey Thom at the Cambodian-Vietnamese  border with more than 1,000 boats, now number about 10,000.  Nevertheless, according to the figure of the Kandal Provincial  Research Commission, when the UN High Commissioner for Refugees  toured the area on 20 April 1994, the number of those refugees  remained only 5,000. So where were almost half of other ethnic  Vietnamese?    Answering this question, the Vietnamese displaced persons  said: It is not difficult for those wanting to leave Chrey Thom.  The easiest way for them is to sell their boats, then leave the  area. According to local informed sources, those leaving this  place have returned to their birthplace around Boeng Tonle Sap  Lake; they claim that they were born in Cambodia.    The cause of the Vietnamese refugees' continued departure  from Chrey Thom without permission from the Cambodian  authorities is that they can no longer live in hardship there.  A great many ethnic Vietnamese in the area said: The remaining  Vietnamese refugees will leave in next three months if there is  no solution to their problem from the Cambodian Government .    Their departure implies that they demand to return to their  old places. According to this argument, there are two problems  worth being considered:    1. The departure from the Chrey Thom area without law  supporting those refugees: The departure appears to be  evidence of the government's incapability to administer  foreigners living in Cambodia. This sufficiently shows that the  government's immigration law to be promulgated in the near  future will encounter difficulties in their implementation.  Because the ethnic Vietnamese continue to insist that their  real birthplace is in Cambodia and because some of them even  have identity cards as proof.    2. When the government's immigration law has not yet been  issued, the Vietnamese war refugees should not be allowed to  come, leave, or act at will. It is reported that they can  travel wherever as they please and that their presence in the  area is just for receiving meager assistance from humanitarian  organizations. Now and then they go about doing their business  in Vietnam or in Phnom Penh. There is another group of  Vietnamese who do not yet have proof that they were born in  Cambodia have looked for ways to establish that their real  birthplace is in Cambodia. Besides, in light of the event, it  can be concluded that the area has not been under the control of  the Cambodian authorities. If it is the case, this issue should  be up for review.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Li Yongsheng (2621 3057 0581) and Jiang Jun </F> (1203 6511)]    [Text] Wuhan, 8 Apr (XINHUA) -- At a national meeting of  directors of commodity price bureaus which ended today, Chen  Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning Commission,  pointed out: It is necessary for commodity price departments at  all levels to make their efforts in drawing up measures revolve  around residents' daily necessities, basic service items, and  important means of production; to resolutely stabilize the  prices of residents' "rice bag," "vegetable basket," and  "stove"; and to achieve success in the near future.    Chen Jinhua pointed out: While various important reforms of  the economic structure are taking big strides forward, the  national economy has kept up satisfactory operations since early  this year. A conspicuous problem in our current economic life is  the further escalation of inflation and the excessively rapid  increase of commodity prices on the market. The retail price  index of commodities posted a monthly growth rate in excess of 3  percent this January and February; it is a phenomenon rarely  seen since our implementation of reform. In particular, the  prices of basic daily necessities, basic service items, and  basic means of production which most greatly affect the masses'  livelihood and national economic development have increased too  much. All trades and professions have found it hard to bear the  price increases. Stabilizing commodity prices on the market and  bringing inflation under control have become a crucial link in  our current endeavor to properly handle the relationships  between reform, development, and stability and have become the  most urgent task of our economic work.    Chen Jinhua said: The issue of the increase in commodity  prices has caught the close attention of the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council. The State Council recently  adopted a series of measures to stabilize commodity prices.  They are mainly: 1) Strictly exercising "two controls,"  namely, bringing under control the excessive growth of the scale  of investment in fixed assets and the excessive expansion of  funds for consumption; 2) successfully promoting in real earnest  agricultural production as well as the implementation of the  "vegetable basket" project to increase the supply of essential  goods; 3) strengthening governments' regulation, control, and  management of commodity prices on the market, including the  establishment of a fund to cover the risks of the prices of  grain and nonstaple foods; stepping up supervision over the  prices of 20 categories of basic daily necessities and service  items, implementing the marking of prices for commodities and  services, and conducting general inspections of commodity prices  nationwide; and 4) resolutely taking a number of economic  measures to stabilize commodity prices and to improve the  allocation, redistribution, and transportation of goods and  materials so as to guarantee market supply. The people's  governments and commodity price departments at all levels have  adopted a series of measures to stabilize commodity prices, too.    He stated the requirement that commodity price departments  at  all levels resolutely implement the relevant measures drawn up  by the State Council; that they focus attention on stabilizing  the prices of grain, edible oil, nonstaple food, important means  of production, and particularly means of agricultural production  as well as the fees collected for basic services; and that they  persist in conducting inspections and making corrections while  propagandizing and handling the task. In particular, he  required them to tackle typical cases among the hot issues of  concern to the masses, to make timely corrections, and to  sternly investigate and deal with them so as to bring into full  play the deterrent role of commodity price inspections.    Chen Jinhua pointed out: Governments must exercise  regulation, control, and management of commodity prices on the  market under the conditions of a socialist market economy. This  is a common experience gained by the countries that adopt a  market economy. The decontrol of prices does not mean the  fulfillment of reform tasks. We cannot let market prices go up  and down unchecked or let enterprises set prices without  standardization. As the prices of the overwhelming majority of  commodities have taken shape on the market, the establishment of  a perfect system for the regulation and control of prices has  become an urgent task for us in our endeavor to deepen reform  under the circumstances. However, we must meanwhile pay  attention to adopting new thinking and methods for exercising  regulation, control, and management in light of the requirements  of a market economy. We must standardize the market, bring the  excessive increase in commodity prices under control, and  prevent drastic price fluctuations; meanwhile, we must avoid  rigid controls over prices and a slip back into the old rut of  planned prices.    Chen Jinhua stressed: At present, the work of [stabilizing]  commodity prices is very great and difficult. The establishment  of a new price mechanism is an important integral part of the  framework for the building of a socialist market economic  system; price regulation and control constitute an important  link of the state's macroeconomic regulation and control; and  the work of [stabilizing] commodity prices is an indispensable,  important task facing governments at all levels in exercising  economic management. In compliance with the requirements set by  the State Council, we must maintain the stability of the  organizations of commodity price departments as well as the  contingents of their personnel, and we must beef up the  necessary forces for inspections. Commodity price departments  at all levels must be bold in exploring, must carry out their  tasks in a down-to-earth manner, must give full play to their  functions, must stabilize the overall situation, and must  promote sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic  development [cu jin guo min jing ji chi xu kuai su jian kang di  fa zhan 0191 6651 0948 3046 4842 3444 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256  1660 0966 4099 1455].</p>

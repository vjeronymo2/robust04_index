			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by unidentified ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow 30 April TASS -- Latvian President Guntis  Ulmanis arrived in Moscow today to meet Russian President Boris  Yeltsin.    The visit of the Latvian president has materialised due to  the agreement reached at the Russo-Latvian negotiations to  coordinate an additional protocol to the earlier initialled  document -- on social protection for military pensioners living  in Latvia. The package of bilateral agreements will be  discussed at negotiations of the two presidents in the Kremlin.    The visit of Guntis Ulmanis to Moscow planned for an earlier  timeframe was put off because of the stance of the Latvian Sejm.  Deputies did not want the package of agreements to include the  above-mentioned document on social guarantees for retired  military. The Russian side insisted on the discussion of all the  four agreements, including Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia,  the status of the radar in Skrunda, social protection for the  military during the troop withdrawal and guarantees for military  pensioners. President Yeltsin succeeded in clearing the obstacle  to the summit.</p>

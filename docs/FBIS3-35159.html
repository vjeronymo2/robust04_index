As time goes by  frustration and despondency grow ever deeper, 'Abbas observed.    In remarks published in Manama today, he said the  Palestinian-Israeli peace accord must be based on clear  guidelines rather than on theory. He blamed the delay in  implementing the agreement on all kinds of details raised by  Israel. Such tactics, he said, call the final results into  question.    He indicated that once agreement is reached on the broad  outlines, it will be easy to tackle problems on the ground.    Asked about Israel's position on the Palestinian state,  Abu-Mazin said the Palestinian state is a certainty. He called  on Israel to honor the 13 April deadline for Israel's pullout  from Gaza and Jericho. Unless the deadline is met, the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement is likely to come to nothing, he  stressed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Pei Jianfeng: "Importers Dominate Domestic Tool Mart"] </F>   [Text] More than half of China's machine tool market has  been captured by overseas manufacturers.    China imported $1.94 billion worth of machine tools last  year, almost doubling the 1992 figure of $912 million.    Now the country has become the world's second largest  machine  tools importer, after the United States, said Liang Xunxuan,  president of the China Machine Tool &amp; Tool Builders'  Association  (CMTBA).    The domestic machine tool market has been expanding at over  18 per cent per annum in the past decade Liang said.    Total market consumption reached $3.58 billion last year,  making the mainland the third largest market in the world.    Imported products dominated about 54 per cent of the  country's machine tool market.    During the first quarter of this year, imports amounted to  $479 million, up 80.6 per cent over the same period last year.    Taiwan surpassed Japan and Germany last year to become the  largest exporter to the mainland.    Meanwhile, China has become a major machine tools producer.  CMTBA now has more than 1,500 member enterprises.    The total output value of the industry reached $1.86 billion  last year, making China the world's fifth largest machine tool  producer.    China's exports during the first quarter of the year reached  $42 million, up 24 per cent over the same period of last year.    Liang said that China's market will continue to expand since  the government is making efforts to develop the transport,  energy and telecommunications sectors.    To strengthen exchanges with other countries, Liang led a  delegation to Britain last month and will visit Italy in  September.    The 4th China International Machine Tool Show (CIMT'95) is  scheduled to be held next year in Beijing to promote  Sino-foreign co-operations in the machine tool industry.</p>

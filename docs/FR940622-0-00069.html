A notice will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  when approval is obtained. Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the burden estimates, the usefulness of central logs for enforcement purposes, the possibility of any unintended effects in connection with the use of such logs, or other aspects of the information collection and recordkeeping requirements in &sect;&sect;488.18, 489.20, and 489.24 should direct them to the OMB official whose name appears in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section of this preamble. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IX. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requires us to publish general notice of proposed rulemaking in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and afford prior public comment on proposed rules. Such notice includes a statement of the time, place and nature of the rulemaking proceeding, reference to the legal authority under which the rule is proposed, and the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved. However, this requirement does not apply when an agency finds good cause that prior notice and comment are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, and incorporates a statement of the finding and its reasons in the rules instead. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim final rule with comment period includes a number of revisions to our regulations that implement revisions to the Act under OBRA 89 and OBRA 90 and for which we did not propose rulemaking. These particular regulation revisions implement the statute without interpretation; the statutory changes are self-implementing. Most of the revisions are technical; some substantive ones (such as the notice hospitals are required to post concerning Medicaid) have already been implemented; others are changes that would respond to public comments we have already received. Affording a proposed rulemaking process under these circumstances is not in the public interest as it would delay the promulgation of regulations that correspond to the current statute; because the statutory revisions are self-implementing, we do not anticipate that public comment would substantively modify regulations. Therefore, we find good cause to waive proposed rulemaking for those regulatory provisions necessary to implement OBRA 89 and OBRA 90. However, we are providing a 60-day period for public comment, as indicated at the beginning of this rule, on changes to the regulations resulting from the provisions of OBRA 89 and OBRA 90. After considering comments that are received timely, we will respond to the comments, include any changes in the rule that might be necessitated in light of those comments, and publish a final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> X. Response to Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the large number of items of correspondence we receive on a rulemaking document, we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, we will consider all comments that we receive by the date and time specified in the ``Dates'' section of this preamble, and, we will respond to the comments in the preamble of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

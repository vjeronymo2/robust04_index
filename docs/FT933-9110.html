			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Izetbegovic gives Serbs two days to withdraw BOSNIA'S President Alija Izetbegovic yesterday gave his Serb adversaries two days to withdraw from key high ground overlooking Sarajevo, the besieged capital, before he abandoned peace talks. 'I will stay here for two more days, then we will return to our Bosnia,' he said after his delegation met international mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg. The mediators held separate meetings with Mr Izetbegovic and his Serb enemy, Mr Radovan Karadzic. The talks concentrated on the military situation on mounts Bjelasnica and Igman, south of Sarajevo. But Mr Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, last night said: 'We hope to move our troops out by 8am GMT and save the conference.' Earlier he dismissed as a 'shameful lie' reports that Serbs were being re-deployed on Bjelasnica. Before entering talks he said the troops were replacing 'wet and cold' soldiers. The two peace envoys appeared frustrated by the delay and confusion over whether Serb forces intended to honour their promise to withdraw. Mr John Mills, their spokesman, admitted: 'There is evidence of a Serb withdrawal. . . What we are having trouble ascertaining is the extent of the withdrawal and how genuine a withdrawal might be.' He said Mr Karadzic had been told by the co-chairmen in very clear terms that 'all his troops should leave Igman'. Mount Igman is of greater importance to the mainly Moslem Bosnian army because it includes a military supply route which leads to Sarajevo. Mr Mills yesterday dismissed reports that the co-chairmen were exerting pressure on the Bosnian government to accept the Serb plan to divide the Bosnian capital. He said they did not favour any solution and cited a weekend report to the UN Security Council suggesting 'it may not be possible to negotiate a permanent solution in Sarajevo for some time'. Mr Karadzic has endorsed the 'temporary solution', raising Moslem fears that it amounted to approval for the ethnic division of the Bosnian capital. According to the 1991 census, Moslems comprised a majority in each of the six districts of Sarajevo where more than a third of marriages crossed ethnic lines. Geneva conference officials yesterday welcomed the ratification of another military paper aimed at ending the war. The commanders of the Bosnian, Serb and Croat armies agreed to halt any offensives and freeze their troops in current positions.</p>

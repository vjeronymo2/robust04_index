			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEL MAR;  </P> <P> MAJORITY OF RIDERS NO STRANGERS TO COMEBACKS AFTER MAJOR INJURIES  </P> <P> Barely half an hour after the dust had settled on Chris McCarron's comeback  Thursday, Laffit Pincay took a nose-dive at the start of the sixth race.  </P> <P> For maybe 10 seconds, Pincay lay in a ball, an automatic reaction for riders  whenever they fall. Then, the 43-year-old Hall of Famer got slowly to his feet  and walked with help to a waiting ambulance. He was OK -- this time.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, Pincay and several of his colleagues had talked about the  perils of their job. Specifically, they were asked to recall comebacks from  injuries, how they felt mentally and physically when they returned to the  saddle after a significant layoff.  </P> <P> Pincay, who broke ribs and suffered internal injuries in a spill here two years  ago, said that the key to coming back strong was to deal with the pain.  </P> <P> "The first time I broke my collarbone, it hurt so bad I was afraid to move,"  Pincay said. "Every little twinge scared me.  </P> <P> "Because of that, it took me two months to get back when it should have only  been about a month. You can't let it bother you."  </P> <P> One never has to look far to find evidence of the dangers of race riding. A  sweep with a metal detector around the cubicles in the Del Mar jockeys' room  would red-line the needle. Besides the long pins holding McCarron's left thigh  and right forearm together, several other riders are toting serious iron.  </P> <P> Rafael Meza smashed his right hand in a spill last February at Santa Anita.  When he learned the extent of the damage, his first words to his doctor were:  "Will I be able to use it again?"  </P> <P> "That's the worst thing in the world," said Meza, who has only recently picked  up the momentum lost to his injury. "You wonder just how bad it's going to be."  </P> <P> Meza's hand healed, with the help of two screws. He was back in action about  two months after his spill. But he is far from 100%.  </P> <P> "There's been a lot of calcification around the screws and they've shifted,"  said Meza, indicating an obvious bump on the back of his hand between the thumb  and index finger.  </P> <P> "It's tender to touch, and I have to ice it all the time," he added. "I can't  really use it for much of anything -- except riding. That's the only thing that  doesn't bother me."  </P> <P> Meza said he will have the screws removed the day after the Del Mar meeting  ends in mid-September.  </P> <P> Soon after that, Frank Olivares will undergo minor surgery to have screws taken  out of his right ankle.  </P> <P> Olivares, 40, suffered the worst injury of his career at the Fairplex Park  meeting in September 1989 when he went down on the clubhouse turn. His right  leg was broken below the knee, the ankle was broken in two places and the  ligaments were badly torn.  </P> <P> "You can see a hole in one of the bones where they tried using a screw but it  wouldn't take," Olivares said.  </P> <P> "The day I came back it felt great, though," he added. "I was surprised. It was  like I was never away. But you prepare yourself mentally for that. It's part of  the job."  </P> <P> Gary Stevens, who has had three major comebacks in the last five years, said  that the biggest challenge to a comeback was self-control.  </P> <P> "You take for granted that you're ready to go physically," he said. "But the  adrenaline is flowing pretty good when you ride that first day, and that's  something you don't really need. You have to be in control out there."  </P> <P> Eddie Delahoussaye thought his career could have ended seven years ago at Del  Mar when he was kicked in the walking ring before a race. He suffered a broken  hip and extensive muscle damage to the right side of his abdomen.  </P> <P> "I was worried if I was going to be the same rider again," said Delahoussaye,  who had won consecutive Kentucky Derbies at the time.  </P> <P> "Then, after I convinced myself I could ride, I had to worry if I would be  accepted. Even when your doing good, if you're away, hurt or whatever, you have  to prove yourself all over again. Especially here in California. There's plenty  of talented riders that people will use in a second if they have any doubts in  you at all."  </P> <P> Darrel McHargue, former national champion and now a racing official, echoed  Delahoussaye's pragmatic sentiments. McHargue suggested that McCarron needed to  make a smart, successful return to retain his healthy share of the top mounts  in rich races.  </P> <P> "Timing is very important," McHargue said. "It's up to McCarron's agent to have  winning mounts waiting for him now that he's back. He's got to get that  momentum back right away."  </P> <P> Nothing, however, is more important than desire, said Alex Solis, who spoiled  McCarron's comeback by winning the fifth. Desire to heal quickly and regain a  winning rhythm, no matter how serious the injury, he advised.  </P> <P> "It makes no difference how bad you are hurt," Solis said. "It's how strong you  are right here."  </P> <P> Solis pounded his chest, right over his heart, grabbed his helmet and went out  to ride the sixth.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Alex Solis won the feature race aboard the 34-1 surprise, Justoneofthegirls,  for trainer Lewis Cenicola. . . . Gary Jones said that San Diego Handicap  winner Quiet American will leave for New York Wednesday to run in the Woodward  Stakes against Criminal Type on Sept. 15.  </P></p>

Two developments I found out about support this view.    At a brief meeting with leaders of the provinces and  municipalities yesterday [8 March] morning, General Secretary  Jiang Zemin repeatedly stressed the importance today of properly  handling the relationship between reform, development, and  stability. Reform and economic development should be carried  out under the precondition of stability. Meanwhile, it is  necessary to develop the economy by constantly advancing reforms  to bring about long-term stability.    On the other hand, the Standing Committee of the Political  Bureau of the CPC Central Committee adopted a 10-character  policy -- democracy, realism, unity, stability, and motivational  atmosphere -- after examining a plan on the coverage of the NPC  and CPPCC sessions, adding two characters for stability to last  year's eight-character policy. Meanwhile, the Central Committee  also called for the two democratic sessions to be permeated with  an atmosphere promoting the free discussion of views. [passage  omitted]</p>

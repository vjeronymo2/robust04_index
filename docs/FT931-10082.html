			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Cash call fears return to haunt shares A LONDON stock market badly unsettled by weakness in sterling and a host of corporate deals suffered a further setback in late trading yesterday on renewed fears that a large rights issue was about to hit the trading desks. Several of Britain's biggest companies, all due to report profits shortly, were named as possible raisers of equity in the Pounds 1bn-plus range. Confidence in prospects for a further cut in UK base rates at Budget time were challenged by the continued weakness in sterling. Fears that the pound's fall implies renewed inflationary pressure were fuelled by the announcement yesterday that UK producer input prices had jumped by 1.5 per cent in the month to January, significantly more than predicted in the market. A firm opening in equities was reversed when two UK investment houses began to sell the FT-SE March futures contract heavily. At worst the stock market showed a loss of 47 points on the Footsie scale. The Dow Average fell 13 Dow points in UK hours and any benefits for UK equities from a very modest rally in sterling were blotted out by the rights issue rumours. The FT-SE 100 Index closed 38.7 points down at 2,831.3 with selling pressure increasing at the end of the day. The FT-SE Mid 250 lost 31.6 to 3,019.8. Seaq volume increased smartly to 694.9m shares from the 545.7m of the previous session, when retail business remained brisk at a worth of Pounds 1.03bn. Non-Footsie business made up 61 per cent of Seaq trading yesterday. Fund managers' caution on rights issue fears was heightened by the prospect of trading statements from virtually all the big Footsie names over the next few weeks. Yesterday brought further calls on institutional cash holdings in the shape of a placing of Johnson Matthey shares following sale of part of the stake held by Charter Consolidated, and a Pounds 155m Euro convertible issue from Sun Alliance; European institutions faced a French franc convertible from Axa, the insurance group. Taking in rights issues already announced, some Pounds 1.2bn has now been taken out of the equity market since Christmas, and managers fear that impending rights issues alone could mean a drain of Pounds 5bn to Pounds 6bn. Only the oils and the water stocks stood out against the general rout in share prices. Oil shares benefited from hopes that the Opec countries will agree on production cuts, while water stocks responded to hints of favourable regulatory developments. But across the rest of the market, there were few safe havens from the profit-takers. Property, building construction and stores shares, all boosted recently on interest rate hopes, turned down smartly. The banking sector, which opens its reporting season this week, shied away from rights issue worries. Food retailers suffered yet further selling on taxation concern and brewery stocks ran into sellers. The outlook for this morning's opening appeared unfavourable, with the only comfort coming from the stock index futures market, where the March contract on the Footsie bounced in late trading. Much will depend on whether the stock market is spared a rights issue announcement in the first half of the trading session.</p>

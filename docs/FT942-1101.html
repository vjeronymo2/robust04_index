			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Keeping it in the family To reduce the plethora of paperwork created by privatisation, I wish to rationalise my family's portfolios. Specifically, I wish to arrange a variety of transfers to consolidate holdings within my family. Where do I find information regarding any implications for income and, more specifically, capital gains tax? Inland Revenue literature seems unforthcoming. The Revenue does produce a booklet concerning lifetime gifts which deals with the inheritance tax implication of such transfers, and it also produces a booklet (CGT 14) which touches on CGT matters arising from gifts. The latest edition of the Allied Dunbar Tax Guide contains several references to the income and CGT implications of gifting, particularly to children. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

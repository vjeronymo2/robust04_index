			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Keyboard configured by design not chance Sir, The true moral of the QWERTY keyboard is rather different from that supposed by Michael Prowse (Book Review, June 9). The QWERTY keyboard and its equivalents in other languages were carefully contrived to minimise key-jamming on early mechanical typewriters, both by slowing typists down and by avoiding the need to use neighbouring keys consecutively. The QWERTY keyboard did not therefore arise by chance. It is an example of the way solutions tend to outlive problems they were devised to overcome, thereby becoming problems themselves.

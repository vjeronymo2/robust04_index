This was announced by  the committee's Chairman, Konstantin Zatulin at the State Duma's  session on Thursday [17 February].    Zatulin informed deputies on the closed parliamentary  meeting  on Russian-Georgian relations which had taken place on February  10. According to Zatulin, Georgian, Abkhazian and South Ossetian  representatives were invited to the meeting.    Zatulin refuted the allegations by media that this treaty  was  unilaterally beneficial for Russia. He stressed that the  Russian military contingency in Georgia was, in fact, being  reduced since the divisions earlier stationed there were to be  withdrawn. Regiments are to be stationed on the military bases  instead of the divisions.    Zatulin announced that many telegrams and appeals were  coming  to the State Duma from North Caucasian people, saying that the  treaty with Georgia was a threat to peace in the region.    Zatulin emphasized that the committee led by him would back  peacemaking efforts put by the Russian president and aimed at  political settlement in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Zatulin  expressed his concern over the fact that the treaty could be  implemented de facto before its ratification. Proceeding from  this, he recommended that a law on international treaties which  would mention which treaties were a subject to ratification by  the parliament be urgently adopted.</p>

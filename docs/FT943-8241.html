			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Right Mitford, but wrong satire Sir, Simon Davies made a deadly error in his ar-ticle on the UK funeral industry ('Loved ones to exit the American way', August 17). The American Way of Death was written by Jessica Mitford, not Nancy Mitford, and was not a satire. He is probably thinking of The Loved One by Evelyn Waugh (not Auberon Waugh) which was dedicated to Nancy Mitford (and not Jessica Mitford). Martin Durkin, 95 Balls Pond Road, Islington, London N1</p>

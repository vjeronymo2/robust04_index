			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Equity Markets: US job figures will be focus of attention - London It might be a good idea to stand well clear of the trading screens this morning. Europe went home for the Easter holidays in a highly nervous condition and developments on Wall Street and Asia Pacific since last Thursday evening have done little to help. Talk of '1987 re-visited' from Mr Nicholas Knight of Nomura Research set the mood for a gloomy weekend which has brought sharp falls in US Federal bonds, shivers in some Asian markets, a plunge in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 futures and a general fear that Wall Street could face trouble today. Setting aside the ugly lines on Mr Knight's charts, the markets will focus on the sharp rise in US employment levels in March, announced after European markets had closed for the Easter weekend. The reaction from US bonds made it clear that fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten credit policy sooner and more fiercely than anticipated have returned in force; and will it be the discount rate this time? Some decoupling of gilts from US Federal securities has been seen but UK bonds are still highly volatile and capable of throwing UK equities into a spin. The stock market seems unlikely to escape unscathed if gilts come under pressure again. And tremors in sterling have provided another challenge to those still convinced that base rates will be cut soon by a UK government facing a sea of political troubles as higher tax rates are phased in. These arguments may not be entirely new, but their sting has been drawn for the past month by technical factors which are now changing. Fund managers have been very unwilling to sell stock ahead of the closing of investment books on the first quarter of the year, which coincides with the end of the UK tax year and the financial year-end for many companies and financial institutions. Those inhibitions, including the fiscal year-end in Japan, will disappear this week. Fund managers can be expected to make longer-term investment decisions and that could be painful in a stock market which has shown that it can move 50 points on the Footsie scale in the blink of an eye. No sector has paid more dearly for the stock market's repeated attempts to show faith in the recovery of the UK economy than the retail stocks. Consumers have stubbornly refused to lead the way out of recession and even the most efficient store groups have had to fight hard to hold profit margins. Now, 'mistakes do not go unpunished,' and, to succeed, a retailer must have a strong brand franchise and the ability to refine costs so that low gross margins do not become lower operating margins. Marks and Spencer remains at the top of BZW's recommendations, with its capacity for high dividend growth and a relatively low p/e. Argos is regarded as having the same strength in its own highly competitive sector; Argos has only 2.53 per cent of its sector while Marks has nearly 29 per cent, with GUS its nearest rival with 15 per cent of their area.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / International Company News: Henry Birks may seek protection HENRY BIRKS, Canada's oldest jewellery and giftware chain, is expected to seek protection from creditors while it works out a financial restructuring with outside investors, writes Robert Gibbens from Montreal. Birks, with 120 retail outlets across Canada and a manufacturing operation, has already pulled out of the US and closed many Canadian stores. The company is understood to have nearly CDollars 100m (Dollars 78m) of borrowings. The recession is mainly responsible for Birks's problems.</p>

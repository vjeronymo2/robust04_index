			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Sprecher holds loss to SFr9m SPRECHER and Schuh, the Swiss electrical engineering group, reported a loss of SFr9m (Dollars 6m) for 1992 compared with a loss of SFr9.5m in 1991. The loss was mainly due to the weakness of the group's low-voltage electromechanical controls business, which has since been sold to Rockwell International of the US. As a result of the cash proceeds from the disposal, the company proposes increased dividends of SFr50 per registered share and SFr250 per bearer share. Dividends in future will be similar to 1990's SFr16 and SFr80 respectively.</p>

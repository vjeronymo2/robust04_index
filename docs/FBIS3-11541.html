			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu is furthering a  new and aggressive foreign policy that advocates the development  of border areas. Within this new framework, the foreign  minister made headway in settling integration and  complementation problems on the border with Brazil, including  the serious pollution problem affecting common rivers,  sanitation, and pasteurization of Brazilian milk at Conaprole  [National Cooperative of Milk Producers] factories. With regard  to Argentina, progress was made regarding the navigation of the  upper reaches of the Uruguay River and the construction of  sluice gates.    The intense tour that Abreu and his main aides made included  meetings with experts from the Salto Grande Joint Commission,  Rio Grande do Sul Governor Alceu Collares, Rubens Ricupero, the  Brazilian minister of environment and legal Amazon Region, and  mayors from the main border areas.    At the international press headquarters, the CTM  [Argentine-Uruguayan Joint Technical Commission of Salto Grande]  presented Abreu with the final plan to build a sluice gate --  which started some years ago -- to raise the Uruguay River's  water level to the reservoir's level and thus enable upstream  navigation. This work will facilitate the transportation of  more than 45 million metric tons of cargo up to Argentine and  Uruguayan ports at a considerably lower price.    CTM members and Abreu himself were of one mind about the  importance of this project since it will be instrumental in  transforming the Uruguay River in the great cargo waterway of  the subregion -- including Brazil -- and in fostering the  comprehensive development of a vast area of the three countries  with the resultant improvement of its inhabitants' quality of  life. [passage omitted]    The most salient aspects of the foreign minister's tour of  the interior were perhaps his agenda in Melo, Rio Branco, and  [the Brazilian city of] Jaguarao together with his meeting with  Collares and Ricupero.    Both countries' official delegations shared the same views  as  the mayors, aldermen from [the Uruguayan cities of] Rivera,  Artigas, Cerro Largo, Tacuarembo, [and the Brazilian cities of]  Jaguarao, Bage, and Santa Vitoria. During an official ceremony  in Rio Branco, two devices for "monitoring the environment" were  presented to Uruguay, which will have them on loan for a year.  These machines are to be used to "measure air particles, rain  elements, and atmospheric changes" to reliably determine whether  the acid rain that affects crops and vegetation in border  departments is caused by the Candiota power plant [in Brazil].    Brazilian and Uruguayan authorities were in total agreement  about the urgent need to deepen integration along the entire  border in order to "improve citizens' standard of living." They  also noted that the objective that will characterize the "new  joint policy" is to situate development centers in border areas,  where people have always lived in brotherhood striving to  overcome shortages caused by the centralization of power."  [quotation marks as published]    Collares took pains to underscore that the governments have  adopted a new personal and political attitude. The open and  sincere talks, at which LA MANANA was present, serve to overcome  some longstanding diplomatic problems and bureaucratic hurdles.  Abreu said: "The way was paved for sincere understanding  through direct dialogue between rulers." Collares shared  Abreu's views and openly expressed his intention of encouraging  the development of border areas to improve the standard of  living and overcome "red tape" problems.    The delegations decided to hold a meeting in Canela during  the second fortnight of May to finalize arrangements for common  projects in the border areas.    These include: Sanitation for sister cities like Artigas-  Quarahi, Rivera-Santa Ana do Livramento, Bella-Union, and  Chuy-Chuy; and the cleaning up of common rivers and streams.  With regard to the latter, both countries agreed to expedite  the drafting of concrete projects since the IDB [Inter-American  Development Bank] suspended the financing planned some time ago  due to the fact that the systems in both banks do not have the  same technical or maintenance levels.    A project to be implemented by Rivera and Livramento  provides  for the pasteurization of Brazilian milk at Conaprole's No. 14  factory and its subsequent transportation to Brazil for local  consumption. Both countries are making efforts so border towns  will have common transportation and health care services.  [passage omitted]    Another important subject in which both countries'  delegations were of one mind pertains to the old bridge across  the Jaguarao River -- a crucial point in the freeway to link Sao  Pablo, Montevideo, and Buenos Aires -- and the development of  the Laguna Merin basin.    Collares stated: "It will be impossible to foster the area's  comprehensive development unless we have a modern bridge that  joins both countries." A binational commission made up by  authorities from Jaguarao and Rio Branco raised this issue and  submitted a project for building a new bridge. This is one of  the central issues to be thoroughly analyzed at the Canela  meeting since, in the words of the Rio Grande do Sul governor,  "we are determined to promote the building of a road network."

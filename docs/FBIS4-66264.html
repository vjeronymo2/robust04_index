			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Naiyimu Yasheng (0035 0181 2606 3660 3932), </F> Xinjiang CPPCC member: "Conscientiously Protect the Rights of  the Young"]    [Text] CYL organizations at all levels in the Xinjiang  Autonomous Region have done much solid work to represent and  protect the legal rights of young people and to promote the  healthy development of the juveniles, but there are still many  problems in these area, and in particular, things that  jeopardize the physical and mental well-being of the young are  still happening frequently.    On the matter of infringement of the juvenile's legal rights  in marriage and family life, it is our opinion that the public  security organs and the judicial departments should put more  force on cracking down quickly and severely on the criminal  activities that seriously harm the young people. Party and  government departments throughout the region and the mass  organizations should emphasize educating the parents of underage  children about the law, so that they are more aware of the laws.  Legal, administrative, and economic measures should be applied  in accordance to the law when parents fail to fulfill their  responsibilities. This is to make sure that the legal rights of  the young are not violated. Families, schools, and society  should work together to take up the responsibility and form a  multi-channel, multi-level, all-encompassing protective network.    On the questions of child-labor and using children to peddle  goods, it is our opinion that to solve those problems we must  first focus on family protection. CLY organizations at all  levels and the education department must work very closely  together to continue to "persuade the middle and elementary  students to go back to school" and actively implement "Project  Hope" to bring many school children back to the school grounds.  We suggest that Xinjiang's People's Congress take the lead and  work with the education and judicial and relevant departments to  conduct a special study once a year on the issues of child-labor  and child-merchants.    On the issue of juvenile crimes, first, we must comply with  the autonomous region's "Juvenile Protection Act" and other  appropriate laws and regulations to give the young more  protection. Second, we must focus on the young people's moral  education and strengthen the school's political ideology work.  Families, schools, and society should show concern for the young  people and share the responsibility of nurturing and educating  the next generation. Third, we must do a good comprehensive job  with regard to maintaining public security and active prevention  of juvenile crimes. Lastly, we suggest that the autonomous  region build a youth convalescence center or drug rehabilitation  center.    On the issue of the cultural market, first, the building of  youth activities centers should be included in the social  development plans. Second, the public security, industrial and  commercial, cultural, and CYL and other departments should join  together to sort out the cultural markets and implement regular  administration. Third, "wipe out pornography" and "crack down on  crimes" should continue, but more important is that we should  encourage the young people and children's cultural creativity.  Fourth, we should continue to work on prohibiting children from  entering certain premises by posting signs.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by by Stefan Hedlund, professor of East European </F> studies; from the "Focus" column: "Few Care About the Baltic  Region's Cry for Help"]    [Text] The cinemas are currently showing a film that is  particularly frightening in its topicality. It is called "The  Remains of the Day." Its subject is policy toward Germany in  the run-up to World War II and its "hero" an English lord who  has taken it upon himself to counter what he sees as anti-German  and warmongering sentiments chiefly in England and France. To  achieve this aim he makes his home available for secret talks  between delegates from a number of different countries,  including Germany. Many fine sounding words about peace and  security are spoken, and about the need to help rather than  further humiliate Germany.    At one particular secret night meeting the noble lord brings  together his own country's political leadership and a  high-ranking German delegation. On the subject of the  Sudetenland the British foreign secretary pronounces the classic  sentence about "a distant country about which we know nothing."  Naturally the leaders of the Western powers must be persuaded  to accept Germany's just demands: all in the interests of peace  and security. That was how the Czechs were sacrificed, and what  was to ensue is history.    People in the countries which feel vulnerable to an  increasingly aggressive Russian nationalism are talking more and  more about this history. However, as in 1938, there are very  few who care about their cry for help. We have to think about  the major outlines, about peace and security.    Not so long ago we were informed as a result of the work of  SVENSKA DAGBLADET's excellent investigative journalist, Mikael  Holmstrom, that for some time now there has been a secret group  consisting of representatives of a number of Western countries  which, under the leadership of Prime Minister Carl Bildt, is  trying to find a solution to the problem of Russia's demands on  the Baltic republics, chiefly Estonia and Latvia. Last week  this secret group succeeded in pressuring the Latvian Government  into signing an agreement which -- as in 1938 -- will guarantee  peace and stability.    The agreement, which is currently being scrutinized by the  Latvian parliament, means that Russia undertakes to withdraw all  its remaining troops by 31 August at the latest, in return for  being allowed to make use of the Skrunda radar installation  until the end of the century, and that 35,000 retired officers  and their families are granted the right to remain in Latvia, at  the expense of the impoverished Latvian Government.    This may seem like a major diplomatic victory which  demonstrates the superiority of silent diplomacy in sensitive  situations. However, this would be to forget two important facts.    First, the Skrunda radar installation has none of the  strategic value it is claimed to have. The United States,  however, has every interest in Russia's not being forced to  leave the base. For this could lead to calls for the United  States to leave forward bases elsewhere in the world.    The Latvian side must, of course, be made to "understand"  this and Russia accepts with thanks.    Second, the pension issue is hardly a case of humanitarian  care for Russian officers who have served their time and who  will be able to enjoy the autumn of their lives in Latvia. Many  of them are elite soldiers, reserve officers in the  35-40-years-old range who are both armed and have their places  of mobilization in the event of war. Their mission is clear.  Last spring all the Russian forces in the Baltic held a staff  coordination exercise the aim of which was clearly expressed:  "to take strategic targets and hold them until the main force  arrives."    The significance of the agreement the Swedish Government is  now seeking to force the Latvian side into signing is thus that  an armed fifth column of 35,000 men with arms and a well defined  mission to carry out in the event of war is to be allowed to  remain in Latvia, and that a major military base there will not  be closed for several years yet, perhaps never. It is most  understandable that the Latvian side wants to defend itself  against such a stab in the back.    However, what is totally incomprehensible is that the  Swedish  Government can be involved in sacrificing Latvia this way to  placate Russia. Perhaps our ministers ought to go together to  see "The Remains of the Day," perhaps they should recall what  happened once Hitler had been appeased with Sudetenland.    You do not need to listen to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's threats  to realize how precarious the situation is for our Baltic  neighbors. On 5 April in Moscow, President Yeltsin signed an  "Instruction" with the following wording:    ``Concur with a proposal from Russia's Defense Ministry  which  has reached agreement with Russia's Foreign Ministry; on the  establishment on the territory of all member states of the CIS  and the Latvian Republic of military bases for the Russian  Federation's Armed Forces, with the aim of ensuring the security  of the Russian Federation and the above-mentioned states, and of  testing new weapons systems and military technology.    ``Instruct Russia's Foreign Ministry together with Russia's  Defense Ministry and the other ministries and authorities  affected to hold talks on this question with the member states  of the CIS and the Latvian Republic, and to draft the necessary  documents.''    This document is being taken very seriously indeed in Riga.  In a reaction Deputy Speaker Andrejs Krastins has spoken of an  "escalation," and said that Russia has now begun to "speak out  clearly" about its intentions. The Russian side immediately  retracted [the instructions] and said that Latvia was included  "by mistake." This cat-and-mouse game is typical of Russian  policy toward the Baltic states. There have been many similar  maneuvers in the past.    The game being played by Moscow is as distasteful as it is  dangerous. It is late in the day. Sweden must now once and for  all make it clear what we think about Russia's ever more  aggressive policy toward our Baltic neighbors. Tomorrow it  could be too late.</p>

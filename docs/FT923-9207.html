			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Call for banks to act on CIS debt CREDITOR banks to the former Soviet Union should strive to head off a government-to-government solution to the debt crisis which would work against the commercial interests of private sector banks, Germany's second biggest bank said yesterday. Mr Ernst-Moritz Lipp, chief economist of Dresdner Bank, said the 600 or so private sector creditor banks should negotiate a complete rescheduling of the debts owed by Russia and other former Soviet republics, rather than settle for a government-to-government deal that might force creditor banks to accept substantial write-offs. Total ex-Soviet debt, including capitalised interest, is believed to be around Dollars 80bn, mostly owed to governments or international institutions. The former Soviet Union is believed to owe only DM10bn-DM12bn to commercial banks, which have been steadily reducing their exposure over the last three years. Governments and banks announced a 90-day rollover of the debt at the end of June after receiving interest payments of only Dollars 170m out of a total of Dollars 1.2bn due in the first five months of the year. The call, which amplified comments by Mr Wolfgang Roller, the bank's chief executive, in Hamburg on Tuesday, comes ahead of next month's meeting of the Paris Club of government creditors. Dresdner fears the Paris Club may do a direct deal with the former Soviet Union involving a reduction of total debt payable. A better solution, according to Dresdner, would be formal rescheduling of the debt over 2-3 years, avoiding a repetition of a government debt deal with Poland in 1990. Under government pressure at the time, banks were obliged to accept a 50 per cent write-down of their debt, although on their own the banks had been able able to negotiate better terms. The International Monetary Fund yesterday formally announced it had approved a Dollars 1.04bn loan for Russia to help it modernise and open up its economy, Reuter reports from Washington. The loan is expected to pave the way for further western assistance for Russia, including World Bank credits and a rescheduling of debts.</p>

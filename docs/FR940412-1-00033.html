			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The sum of non-pilot operating costs per hour and pilot compensation costs per hour (for designated and undesignated waters separately) is the total cost per hour to be charged for pilotage services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Target Pilot Compensation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Coast Guard and Department policy is to maintain income comparability between pilots providing international regulated pilot services and private masters and first mates operating domestic vessels on the Great Lakes with similar responsibilities. This NPRM proposes to continue the current income comparability policy of using as target compensation for pilots in undesignated waters the compensation of first mates on U.S. Great Lakes vessels. Target compensation for pilots providing service in designated waters would continue to be comparable to masters on Great Lakes vessels, but this NPRM proposes to set the target at 150% of the compensation of first mates, rather than attempting to determine the actual average compensation of Great Lakes masters. While the Coast Guard would periodically review this estimate, available data indicate that this average premium has remained reasonably stable, is relatively simple to administer, and avoids costly sampling of individual master's contracts, which are not publicly available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This NPRM lists below those items proposed to be included as part of the pilot compensation portion of the rate schedule. Line items here included would be removed from the cost pools included in direct operating expenses to preclude double counting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=4 --> Target Pilot Compensation Designated and Undesignated Waters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Undesignated Waters_First Mate Compensation Component  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=4 --> 1. Contractual daily rate @ 260 days:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medical allowance, Pension allowance, Holiday pay, Overtime pay,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Winter close-down allowance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Additions to compensation: F.I.C.A.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Workmen's compensation allowance, Total.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Designated Waters_150 Percent of First Mate Compensation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> This NPRM proposes to exclude profit sharing as a component of pilot compensation expense, since this is a voluntary contribution by the employer paid from profits, similar in form to the return element proposed to be paid the pilot organizations (which may be distributed as a bonus). Profit sharing expense, which may have been included in past rate-setting as an expense item in the pilot associations expense accounts, would be disallowed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This NPRM proposes to add a F.I.C.A. allowance and a workmen's compensation allowance to pilot compensation to ensure comparability between pilot groups, and to properly reflect the allocated cost of pilot services. Allowances listed here would be transferred from general pilot association costs (if included there), or added to the cost pools (if not currently included in general association costs). This NPRM proposes to require these costs to be separately identified and reported in either the financial statement or by special report (See Part B).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Number of Required Pilots  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Coast Guard and Department policies have set the minimum number of pilots needed by establishing specific minimum annual pilot hours for designated and undesignated waters (1,000 and 1,800 hours per pilot, respectively) for a pilot to receive comparable compensation discussed above. The required number of pilots for any succeeding navigation season was determined by dividing a projection of the number of pilot hours required in designated and undesignated waters, by District, by the minimum standard annual pilot hours. This required number of pilots, for both designated and undesignated services and individually rounded upward, was then multiplied by the target income per pilot (above) to determine the revenue necessary under the rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This NPRM proposes to continue this policy and methodology in determining the number of pilots and the necessary pilot comparability income to be included in the rate schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Pilot Compensation Charges Per Hour  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The target pilot compensation, by District and by designated (Master) and undesignated (First Mate) compensation, would then be divided by the estimated pilotage hours in designated or undesignated waters to construct an average hourly cost per hour for pilot compensation in designated or undesignated waters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Total Pilotage Charges Per Hour  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Pilot compensation charges per hour, for designated and undesignated waters separately, would be added to the average cost for non-pilot compensation expenses per hour. The sum of these average costs, for designated and undesignated waters separately, would be the average cost per pilotage hour to be recovered under the rate, subject to the adjustment for vessel size, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> Part A.5. Adjustment of Pilotage Charges for Vessel Size  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> It is accepted belief and practice that pilotage of larger vessels deserves a higher level of compensation than that for smaller vessels. The current rate schedule uses a vessel size multiplier to increase the charge for larger vessels, and, presumably, the pilot compensation. (46 CFR 401.400) Also, maintaining shipping in the Great Lakes is a public benefit and goal, and is supported by government agencies. As smaller ships carry less cargo and are more affected by pilotage cost on a per-ton basis, a differential in cost (or lesser increase) is likely to encourage the continuation of their service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

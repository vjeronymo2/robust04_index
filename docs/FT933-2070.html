			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Arts: Grant Lee Buffalo - Pop concert Grant Lee Buffalo is the type of band that gets record companies interested. Its lyrics are interesting (or pretentious, depending on your point of view), its musical style, distinctive but knowingly anchored in mainstream rock, is marketable but not overtly commercial. This week the trio played at the ICA in the Mall. They are hardly pin-ups, looking more like thirtysomething escapees from a David Lynch film about American lowlife. As Grant Lee Phillips, lead-singer, guitarist and songwriter, bounced on stage one young woman behind me turned to another and declared disappointed: 'He's ugly.' 'Really ugly,' replied her friend. Pudgy, sweaty, bashing on his 12-string electro-acoustic guitar, twitching awkwardly as he briefly addressed the audience between songs, Phillips dominates the stage and laps up the applause. He comes from the high-strung, wild-eyed school of north American singers, somewhere between Henry Rollins and Neil Young - they finished with a high-speed version of Young's 'For The Turnstiles'. He instantly raised worries about how efficiently he had been searched for guns at Heathrow. Paul Kimble, the bassist, his ratty dyed hair hanging across his face, is a poor man's Nicholas Cage, Joey Peters, the drummer, pulling faces, grinning encouragement to no-one in particular, is the sort of man who has animated conversations with himself on trains. They can all play. They started like a train, roaring through 'Shining Hour', the strongest number from what is, hype aside, a strong album. It was rockabilly on steroids, driven forward by Phillips beefy, pounding drums. They followed with 'Jupiter and Teardrop' a crunching ballad of ill-starred love. The opening chord, a shameless steal from Bowie's Moonage Daydream, has provoked an orgy of spot-the-influence among critics. Could 'Jupiter' be Bowie himself? Could doomed 'Teardrop' be John Lennon, whose singing some say Phillips apes? Live he sounded eeriely like Elton John (quite the wrong market) and the much-examined words like the more endearingly overblown work of Bernie Taupin, John's lyricist. On the album Kimble's production gives the songs variety. Live, GLB showed an astute, though wearisome, mastery of rock's dynamics. Time and again crashing verse was followed by whispered chorus, rousing chorus by delicate verse. They finished in rousing style with 'America Snoring'. If Phillips has not used up all his songs on Fuzzy, it will sound excellent when GLB starts playing football stadiums in three or four years.</p>

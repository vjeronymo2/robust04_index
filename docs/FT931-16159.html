			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Observer: Over-shallowed Burton shares have been wonderful performers these past three months, but there must be a danger that in the efforts to purge the ancien regime, the new management may be overdoing the boardroom cleansing. The latest shake-out leaves the average length of service of the executive directors - including the chief executive who has been on the board since 1987 - at under three years. Of the two executives resigning, one had been on the board seven months and the other 18 months. Contrast this with Marks &amp; Spencer, where the latest annual report puts the average board experience of the 15 executive directors at nearly nine years.</p>

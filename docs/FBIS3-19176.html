			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A French soldier was killed this morning in the  Bihac area, in the western part of Bosnia. It is still not  known who fired the shot. This is the 19th French soldier  killed in former Yugoslavia. Francois Leotard heard the news  while in Israel and the defense minister expressed his anger to  Pierre Veil:    [Begin Leotard recording] As you can understand, my reaction  is one of great sadness and anger. France is making sacrifices  for peace. The soldiers who are targeted in this cowardly way  are soldiers of peace. They are there to accomplish  humanitarian missions. They escort food supplies and protect  civilian populations. They are Blue Helmets, therefore they are  not engaged in a war situation. War is often waged on them in a  cowardly way. I express with great vigor my indignation at this  kind of behavior. I hope that our mission there is understood  despite all the difficulties encountered. Despite these  victims, our mission is to bring peace to a war-torn region,  which could pose a threat in the future. The French people  should be aware of this. [end recording]</p>

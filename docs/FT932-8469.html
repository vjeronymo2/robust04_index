			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Race bias case settled for Pounds 25,000 AN ASIAN accountant who claimed he was demoted, victimised and forced to take early retirement has accepted what is believed to be the largest race-case settlement made by a local authority. Mr Lakshman Pardhanani, 56, accepted Pounds 25,000 in an out-of-court settlement from the Labour-controlled London Borough of Camden after taking the council to an industrial tribunal, where he claimed racial discrimination. Mr Pardhanani joined Camden council's works department as finance and data manager in 1986. He said that on the first day he was informed by the assistant director that he would not be responsible for the full range of duties and staff as advertised. The following year his department was restructured and his post was abolished. The Commission for Racial Equality, which backed his case at the industrial tribunal, said two further posts, one created for him, and another at a lower level, were also abolished. Mr Pardhanani said after the settlement: 'With its declared commitment to equal opportunities, Camden council appears to be an ideal organisation to work for but my experience shows otherwise. It was traumatically different from its promise. I suffered racial harassment during my time there.' The CRE said the settlement was the largest race-case settlement by a local authority. Camden council, which has shed about 2,000 workers over the past two years, decided to offer an out-of-court settlement after spending three weeks at the industrial tribunal. It denied yesterday that any discrimination or victimisation took place. It said the settlement was reached outside the industrial tribunal with no admission of liability on its part.</p>

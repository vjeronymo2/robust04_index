			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- A general meeting of the  Wiener-Neustadt branch of the society for the promotion of the  relations between Austria and the Democratic People's Republic  of Korea was held on May 5.    At the meeting the chairman of the branch reviewed the  achievements and experience the branch has made in its  activities over the past 15 years.    Referring to the vicious anti-DPRK campaign launched by the  United States and its followers with a row over nuclear  suspicion to stifle the DPRK, a socialist state, he said they  always stand on the side of the Korean people.    "We will fully support the Korean people in the just  struggle  for national reunification and strive to further expand and  develop the many-sided friendly and cooperative relations  between the peoples of Austria and Korea," he declared.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Italy to boost pensions sector Two Italian banks and the country's state pensions institute yesterday announced a joint venture to encourage the underdeveloped Italian pension fund sector. Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the Treasury-controlled bank, IMI, the recently privatised financial services group, and INPS, the state pensions institute, have agreed to offer fund management and administrative services to company schemes or open funds. Pensions reform is at the centre of the Italian government's efforts to cut spending for the 1995 budget, but the country's 200 or so pension funds account for only a small part of retirement provision in Italy. The Treasury has already said it wants to reform existing legislation to encourage pension funds, by reducing taxes and other charges. Mr Clemente Mastella, the labour minister, yesterday reassured Italians that funds based on investment would complement rather than replace the existing system.</p>

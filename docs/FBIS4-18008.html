			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Svitlana Synyakova: "Levko Lukyanenko: `Neither </F> I Nor Chornovil Have a Chance'"]    [Text] This is the conclusion made by the chairman of the  Ukraine Democratic Association at the news conference held on 21  April. According to Lukyanenko, the current alignment of forces  in Ukraine provides no grounds for illusions. The nine years of  national democrats' activities did not change much -- the people  are scared by the nomenklatura. Some time ago, there was hope  that the democrats would unite during the presidential elections  and nominate one candidate, namely [former Defense Minister]  Kostyantyn Morozov. However this time Levko Lukyanenko voiced  his reservations against General Morozov. He believes that the  nomenklatura throughout Ukraine will rise as one man against  this candidate, as it happened in the Artemivskyy constituency  No.1 during the spring legislative elections.    Incidentally, Kostyantyn Morozov himself does not believe  that he had irrevocably lost the legislative elections. Both he  and his team demand that the results of the elections in that  constituency be declared invalid. They have handed over to the  Central Electoral Committee an appropriate motion and a number  of documents testifying to numerous violations of the electoral  law. However, the general is waging the war for the restoration  of justice without any party's assistance. He tends to  underline this because, according to him, it is still unclear  what political forces fought against him in the electoral  district. General Morozov pointed out that he would treat the  proposal to take part in presidential elections only provided  that it is backed by all democratic forces. This would be an  important step toward consolidation of democrats, while the  election itself would either bring about a victory or the  forming of a powerful opposition.    Thus far, democrats have only demonstrated unity in ignoring  presidential elections. According to Levko Lukyanenko, the  democrats will launch a campaign against Leonid Kuchma,  Oleksandr Morozov, and Petro Symonenko, rather than back any one  candidate. Worldwide Coordinating Council Chairman Ivan Drach  does not rule out that we will have to choose between Moroz and  Kuchma. It should be pointed out that Drach did not take part  in either legislative or any other elections this time, and is  not going to do this. He explains that he has enough  possibilities to be heard, while preference should be given to  young politicians. This is just: New times demand new people.    Meanwhile, higher echelons demonstrate a wish to preserve  the  status quo. Perhaps this is why Oles Shevchenko, Ukrainian  Republican Party [URP] deputy chairman, asked the reporters to  be patient, refrain from discussing the presidential election  and wait until 25 April.    Other symptomatic news: We were not invited to attend the  URP congress scheduled to start on 23 April. Rumors have it  that the congress will be held behind closed doors and not all  the members of the URP leadership know where. This is hard to  believe. It will be even harder to believe in what will be said  at the news conference on the results of the congress.</p>

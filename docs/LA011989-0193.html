			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NOTES  </P> <P> Aerojet Ordnance said the prospect of federal budget cuts has prompted a  decision by the defense contractor to close its headquarters in Tustin and  transfer all 108 employees to Downey by summer. "In light of the defense  picture, this is a really good business move for us. We are just maximizing our  resources," Aerojet spokesman Timothy Doyle said. The company, which makes  ammunition, cluster bombs, and warheads, already operates a manufacturing plant  in Downey. Aerojet's Tustin operation was limited to administration and  research. Late last year, Aerojet, a subsidiary of Ohio-based GenCorp Inc.,  transferred more than 90 Orange County workers to a newly formed division in  Azusa. GenCorp had sales of $1.6 billion and earned $155 million in fiscal  1987.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The English-speaking minority of French-dominated Quebec, who have watched  their education and language rights erode, are looking to use upcoming  provincial elections to force the government to treat their concerns more  seriously. The main contenders in the Sept. 25 election are the Liberal Party,  which was supported by 50% of the voters in a recent opinion poll, and Parti  Quebecois, with 39% backing. But the upstart Equality Party, promising cultural  guarantees for the Anglophone minority in the Canadian province, has the  backing of about 5% of the voters and could win two or three seats in the  National Assembly.  </P></p>

According to the ministry, an in-depth review must be made  of  the situation which takes into account the various aspects of  the question. "We are, in fact, even with the individual limits  for the so-called protected markets, in a situation of a single  market which allows free circulation among all European  countries."    "Furthermore" the note continued, "the agreement to limit  `yellow' car imports does not take into account the sale of  transplants, which account for a significant share of the market  held by Japanese makes and represents another element of serious  concern for Italy."    The effective performance of the new car market, the  ministry  argued, is "in the end influenced by the competitiveness of  prices, which determined, in 1993, only a partial use of the  Japanese quota."    The statement from the Ministry for Foreign Trade went on to  underscore how "it is still not clear whether, as in 1993, the  possibility exists to verify and re-examine, in the course of  the year, that adjustments which the evolution of the market  would dictate."</p>

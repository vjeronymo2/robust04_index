			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UC IRVINE KEEPS THE VOLUME HIGH  </P> <P> They call this the Freedom Bowl Classic, and now you know why: Players are free  to fire at will.  </P> <P> UC Irvine didn't shoot well in its first-round game against Idaho State Friday  night, but the Anteaters compensated for not shooting well by shooting often in  a 96-82 victory at the Bren Center.  </P> <P> Irvine will play Bradley for the tournament title tonight at 8. Loyola  Marymount, which lost to Bradley, will play Idaho State in the consolation  game.  </P> <P> After shooting 38% in the first half and being tied at 42-42, Irvine pulled  together in the second half and pulled away in the final five minutes, partly  with the help of its defense.  </P> <P> Irvine has devoted an extraordinary amount of practice time to shooting. To  Coach Bill Mulligan's consternation, the results have been poor. The Anteaters  averaged 102 points in their first three games, but they did it while making  only 41% of their shots.  </P> <P> The only reason they have been able to reach 100 points shooting at that rate  is because they are averaging 86 shots, and 37 of them on the average are  three-pointers.  </P> <P> "We're not shooting well," Mulligan said. "That's really hurting us."  </P> <P> Ricky Butler, who scored 23 points, left with five minutes to play and Irvine  leading, 78-72.  </P></p>

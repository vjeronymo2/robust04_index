			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Ben Johnson's physician has arrived in Canada and is ready to testify before a  federal inquiry -- possibly next week, his lawyer said.  </P> <P> Jamie Astaphan and lawyer David Sookram met for several hours with counsel  representing the federal commission investigating the scandal surrounding  Johnson's positive drug test at the Seoul Olympics.  </P> <P> The inquiry is currently in recess and is scheduled to resume next Wednesday.  </P> <P> Astaphan has remained at his home on St. Kitts since Johnson failed a drug test  and was stripped of the 100-meter world record and Olympic gold medal last  September.  </P> <P> Testimony indicates that Astaphan, under investigation by the Ontario College  of Physicians and Surgeons, holds the key to more than just the mystery of why  Johnson failed his urine test after his race.  </P> <P> He is also believed to have intimate knowledge of widespread drug use among the  world's top athletes. He has said he is still treating many of them at his  clinic on St. Kitts.  </P></p>

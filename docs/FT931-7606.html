			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / British Coal criticised on pits plan BRITISH COAL failed to follow its own guidelines in selecting two of 10 pits earmarked for immediate closure last October, according to a confidential report commissioned by the government. The findings in the draft report, by John T. Boyd, the US mining consultancy, provide the latest in a series of blows to British Coal over its programme to close up to 31 pits. The report said Grimethorpe in South Yorkshire and Taff Merthyr in Mid Glamorgan were closed even though they did not meet the two closure criteria of being unviable in the foreseeable future and lossmaking. Boyd said Grimethorpe was profitable historically and could remain so 'providing a market is available'. It said Taff Merthyr in Mid Glamorgan was closed even though it was viable in the immediate future. However, Boyd does not recommend reopening it because of its limited reserves. British Coal is already embroiled in a legal battle with unions over the future of the 10. In December, High Court judges ruled illegal the decision by British Coal and the government to close the 10, which have already ceased production, and the other 21 which are under threat. The government wants to use the Boyd report as the basis for an independent assessment of the prospects for the 10 pits ordered by the court. Unions have rejected the idea that Boyd is independent, but will point to the report for what they see as evidence of wrong decisions. British Coal will, however, take comfort from the report's conclusion, disputed by unions, that the fabric of all 10 pits is being maintained in accordance with assurances given by British Coal to the High Court. This means that in theory any of the 10 pits could be reopened, although this seems remote for all but Grimethorpe and Betws, South Wales. The report believes Betws could thrive in the private sector, although all the economically recoverable coal, using British Coal's mining procedures, is depleted. 'This is not to discount the ability of a private mining company successfully to operate a salvageable . . . system,' the report says. British Coal made no comment on the report yesterday but is likely to dispute the finding. It will argue Grimethorpe is not viable because it shares facilities with Houghton Main, another of the 10. In addition, British Coal will argue that, even if Grimethorpe is potentially viable, the market constraints will work against it having a future. The government is struggling to find a market even for the 21 pits which British Coal considers more viable. Boyd says: 'If there is not a market. . . a colliery is not viable regardless of cost of production.' Littlechild warning, Page 7</p>

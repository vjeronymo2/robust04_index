He reminded that, according to the resolution, all cases  related to the August 19-21, 1991, May 1, September 21-October  4, 1993, in Moscow "should be immediately stopped."    In the opinion of Isakov, "the State Duma should issue a  separate resolution or explain the mechanism of the  implementation of the amnesty resolution in one of its  provisions." In this connection, he believes that all persons  involved in the the State of Emergency Committee, the May and  October events of 1993, "should be released, as it is indicated  in the State Duma resolution, immediately after its official  publication."    In the meantime, the deputy chairman of the State Duma  committee on security Vikor Mirnov claims that the State Duma  resolution on political and economic amnesty "does not have any  judicial consequences."    In his opinion, the amnesty resolution was adopted in  violation of the procedural rules, because it was not put on  vote twice, first for the basics and then for the whole  document, as required.    Mironov thinks that the amnesty resolution will not be  carried out, "the Communists and Zhirinovskiy supporters will  not achieve their goals, and Rutskoy, Khasbulatov and other  people involved in the October events will not be released."    The deputy pointed out that he had voted against that  document because he did not want "a civil war to be unleashed."  In his opinion, "there are people interested in the release of  Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, Anpilov, Terekhov, so that after the  release they like dogs gnaw through a road for them to power."</p>

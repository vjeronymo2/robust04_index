			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>   [Text] Brussels, Feb 3 (AFP) -- Estonia became the fourth  country of the former Soviet bloc to sign up here Thursday [3  February] to NATO's Partnership for Peace, and used the event to  complain of the continuing presence of Russian troops on its  soil.    Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik expressed disappointment  that Russia had not given a fixed timetable for withdrawing its  3,750 troops from the Baltic republic during talks between the  two sides in Moscow that ended on Wednesday.    "The round was not very successful," he said, because Moscow  had gone back on its promise to submit a withdrawal calendar.  But he added the hope that Moscow would stick to its August 31  deadline for pulling all its troops out.    Luik said he saw the Partnership for Peace -- a blueprint  for  military cooperation between the North Atlantc Treaty  Organisation and its former Cold War adversaries -- as a step  towards full NATO membership for Estonia.    "We consider it of the utmost importance that the three  Baltic countries (Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia) start the  process of integrating into NATO together with our neighbours  from East Europe," he said.    The U.S.-sponsored Partnership was formally announced at a  NATO summit here on January 10. Poland, Lithuania and Romania  have already signed up, and virtually all other countries of  East Europe have expressed their intention to do so.    Most have said their ultimate aim is full membership of  NATO.  But the trans-Atlantic Alliance has ruled out any immediate  intention to take in new members from East Europe for fear of  angering Russia.    The Estonian minister stressed that his country wanted good  relations with "a democratic Russia," but added: "Only  countries that are sure of their security can be equal and  relaxed partners to Russia."    Luik said NATO security guarantees were essential for the  stability of East Europe. He expressed alarm at statements of  Russian leaders that they have a right of intervention in  neighbouring countries -- "the near abroad."    The minister said this doctrine was impeding the  normalisation of Estonia's relations with Russia which has  withdrawn all its troops from Lithuania but still has 20,000 in  Latvia.    Luik noted that Estonia had already made progress in  aligning  with NATO standards. The commander of the Estonian Defence  Force, General Aleksander Einseln, is a retired colonel from the  U.S. Army.    Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have announced plans to form a  Baltic peacekeeping battalion for taking part in United Nations  operations and NATO exercises.    Partnership for Peace involves bringing countries of the  former Soviet bloc into NATO military and political activities,  but without giving them the security guarantees which would come  with full NATO membership.    The Partnership involves a menu of cooperation possibilities  from which each candidate can choose, depending on its needs,  capability and what it can afford.    The options include joint military manoeuvres, peacekeeping,  disaster relief, search-and-rescue, military communications,  defence planning, training for democratic control of the miliary  and the clean-up of old Soviet bases.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At Victoria Palace today Prime Minister Nicolae  Vacaroiu and other representatives of the executive held a  meeting with seven leaders of the CNSLR [National Confederation  of Romania's Free Trade Unions]-Fratia Trade Union Confederation  intended to further discuss the 14 union demands.    After the conclusion of the talks Prime Minister Nicolae  Vacaroiu made a statement to the press in which he reviewed  yesterday's and today's meetings with the trade union  confederations, saying that each of those demands has been  examined separately. The premier said that many of them refer  to issues for which there are no financial resources, whereas  others are in connection with the problems of the economic  reform and the 1993-1994 program for economic restructuring and  privatization, whereas other demands lack realism. Some of the  demands have nothing to do with the unions' activity, the  Romanian prime minister assessed adding that those claims pursue  other goals.    Vacaroiu also mentioned the fact that issues related to  social protection were also approached, especially the ensuring  from the state budget of the necessary funds to improve the  standard of living of employees working in the public sector.  In that context the premier expressed his hope that by the end  of this year the standard of living will increase to a certain  extent, but the essential prerequisite of that is the increase  of production.    The prime minister concluded his statement by saying that  interruptions of work lead to considerable losses in the  national economy.    In turn, the chairman of CNSLR-Fratia, Mr. Victor Ciorbea,  stated that the majority of their claims date back four to 13  months, and they have still not been settled, whereas in the  case of certain demands the solutions that were found have not  been applied. During today's meeting they agreed that  negotiations should be continued between CNSLR--Fratia and the  government intended to settle the 14 demands forwarded to the  government by the union confederation.    Ciorbea also pointed out that none of the claims was settled  during today's meeting, and, as a consequence of this, the  general strike on 28 February will take place as scheduled.    Today we were sent via fax the decision adopted by the  National Council of the National Trade Union Bloc [BNS] in  connection with the continuation of their labor actions. The  text outlines the fact that BNS continued its efforts to  conclude an economic-social pact, provided the signatory partner  is a credible and generally accepted executive. The document  also says that after taking note of the state power's refusal to  cooperate with BNS in order to extinguish the current conflict,  as well as of its refusal to answer the suggestions forwarded to  it by that union confederation, the BNS National Council decided  to continue the labor conflict against the government that was  begun on 10 January last year.    The document also points out that in order to avoid making  the same mistakes that were previously made by Romania's trade  unions, the BNS National Council decided to commence ample  actions to mobilize basic union structures and to organize a  national referendum intended to establish the opportunity,  viability, and the concrete schedule of the continuation and  implementation of the labor actions that were begun on 29  November 1993.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By M.Y. Sung in Beijing] </F>   [Text] Britain yesterday accused China of leaking the  contents of the Sino-British talks on electoral arrangements.  The British said the Chinese leak had led to the decision to  reveal the contents of the 17 rounds of talks. British  Ambassador to China, Sir Robin McLaren said Britain was aware  that much of the talks' contents had been leaked by the Chinese  side.    Governor Chris Patten is to release a White Paper today,  setting out the British side's account of the failed  negotiations. "This is, of course, against the background of a  great deal of leaking of the contents of talks from the other  side," Sir Robin said. "It was necessary to make the contents  of the talks available before the second stage of Mr Patten's  reform bill was tabled," he said.    He refused to confirm whether a copy of the White Paper had  been sent to China, but he said he was in regular touch with the  Chinese side. He did not agree that the disclosure would lead  to a total termination of Sino-British cooperation. "For our  part, we are very concerned cooperation should be maintained to  the maximum extent possible. Concerning the new airport, all  details and technical matters being discussed in the JLG (Joint  Liaison Group) need cooperation."    Meanwhile, members of a Chinese think-tank expected that  China would reveal its own version of the contents of the talks.  Member of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) Tsang  Yok-sing said the Chinese side would have no obligation to keep  the promise of confidentiality if the British side unilaterally  revealed the contents of the talks. He believed the Chinese  side would also soon reveal their view of the talks as it now  made no sense to withhold the facts.    Former senior Executive Councillor, Sir Sze-yuen Chung  opposed unilateral disclosure. He said there should be joint  disclosure, as it was likely the two sides would give two  different versions. "I do not agree that Britain and China  should each separately reveal their own version," Sir Sze-yuen  said. A new battle between the two sides could arise if there  were two different versions. The people of Hong Kong would be  puzzled about which version was true, he said.    Former Basic Law drafter Simon Li said a unilateral  disclosure could be misleading. It could polarise the views of  the Hong Kong public. "Some people will take the British side's  version if they have more confidence in the British, while other  people will take the Chinese side," Mr Li said. "But this is  the way politics is."</p>

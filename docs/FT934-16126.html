			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Bosnian Moslem split widens: How Serbs and Croats are managing to drive a wedge between Moslem regional bosses and the Sarajevo presidency CONVINCED that fighting between Moslems in north-western Bosnia will finalise the republic's two-way partition, Serb and Croat leaders observe the escalating violence with barely concealed delight. They see the first intra-Moslem clashes as proof that the process of fragmentation is unstoppable. There is slim chance, they believe, for Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic to build his own mostly Moslem state on the ashes of multi-ethnic Bosnia. Fighting erupted after Mr Fikret Abdic, the undisputed leader in the north-west region, declared autonomy for this densely populated Moslem heartland. The proclamation prompted Mr Izetbegovic to order Bosnian army troops to stop the rebellion. In an attempt to stop his would-be mini-state further disintegrating, Mr Izetbegovic addressed the United Nations General Assembly in New York yesterday where he protested that Bosnia was being subjected to 'political vivisection'. Mr Abdic's declaration of autonomy in the Bihac pocket was the outcome of 18 months of war. It was encouraged by Serb and Croat nationalists. Mr Abdic also was keenly aware of tactical backing from the international community. Mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, frustrated by the intransigence of Mr Izetbegovic, have made no secret of their admiration for Mr Abdic as a leader ready to make a deal on the republic's partition and buy peace at any price. The envoys re-invented Bosnia's collective presidency. At the Geneva talks they used Mr Abdic to weaken Mr Izetbegovic. On points where Mr Izetbegovic was particularly vulnerable, Mr Abdic proved ready to accept Serbian and, especially, Croat demands. Croatia over the past few months has boldly promoted Mr Abdic. Soon after Croatian state media launched his propaganda assault on Mr Izetbegovic, Mr Abdic announced his break with Sarajevo in the apparent first step towards joining Croatia. Even before the war, the region, because of its geographical proximity to Zagreb, had closer economic ties with the Croatian capital than with Sarajevo. In the shattered Bosnian capital, Mr Abdic counts for little. However, he is a hero in his fiefdom, surrounded by Serb rebels in Bosnia and neighbouring Croatia. He is credited by his admirers for using his political cunning to ensure the survival of his enclave, which has escaped the devastation wrought on the rest of Moslem-held Bosnia. But his detractors say calculating Serbs and Croats are waiting to gobble up the region, intact, later. In the Bihac area, named after the biggest town, Mr Abdic is revered for enriching this poor region by building up Agrokomerc, an agro-industrial plant. His popularity soared after a stint in jail in 1987 for issuing Dollars 300m (Pounds 198.6m) in unbacked promissory notes. His opponents call him a white-collar crook while fervent supporters claim he was framed. While fighting between the Bosnian army and troops loyal to Mr Abdic continues, he boasts, according to the Belgrade daily newspaper Politika, that 'Izetbegovic's state is defeated in western Bosnia and it will be defeated in Tuzla and in other parts of Bosnia.' Bosnian Serb leaders over the past month have leaked reports of talks with Mr Selim Beslagic, mayor of Tuzla, the largest Bosnian stronghold in the north. They gloat about 'signals' from Tuzla that the Moslem region is also preparing to break away but to join Greater Serbia. The international mediators appear to have taken an interest in Mr Beslagic, stepping up their contacts with him over the summer. Bosnian Serb chieftain Radovan Karadzic repeatedly claims he has messages from European capitals expressing opposition to a Moslem state in Europe. If Tuzla, too, under pressure of the war and the Serb stranglehold, declares autonomy from Sarajevo, Bosnia will be divided between Serbia and Croatia, with nothing left for the Moslems but assimilation or migration.</p>

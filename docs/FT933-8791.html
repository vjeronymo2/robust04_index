			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Bosnia talks expected to restart: Serbs accept UN arbitration but air strike preparations continue INTERNATIONAL mediators expect the Bosnian peace talks to resume today after the Serbs agreed to accept United Nations arbitration in a dispute over the extent of Serb withdrawal from a strategic peak near Sarajevo. The more hopeful signs came as Nato countries pressed on with military preparations for possible air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. A United Nations spokesman in Geneva said that the mediators, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, expected a resumption this afternoon of the talks between leaders of the three warring factions in Bosnia. But Bosnia's Moslem president Alija Izetbegovic, who has boycotted talks for 12 days, gave no confirmation that he was ready yet to change his stand. He reiterated earlier that he would not return to the Geneva talks with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and the Bosnian Croat leader Mate Boban until the Serbs completed their withdrawal from Mount Igman overlooking Sarajevo. However, UN arbitration in that dispute might end the impasse. The UN spokesman in Geneva confirmed last night that Bosnian Serb forces remain deployed in 'areas of Igman Mountain', but added that the troops 'did appear to have left the centre of the area from which they agreed to withdraw'. Mr Karadzic claims that Serb forces can remain on parts of the peak seized before a ceasefire agreement reached July 30. But after intensive sessions with the international mediators, he agreed last night to accept UN arbitration as 'binding' on a disputed line beyond which Serbs should withdraw. With Nato preparations mounting, General Francis Briquemont, commander of UN forces in Bosnia, flew to a Nato air base in Italy yesterday to discuss the logistics of air strikes with Admiral Jeremy Boorda, Nato's commander of Allied Forces Southern Europe. Italy later announced that it was sending more troops to reinforce its border with former Yugoslavia to protect against possible reprisals in the event of Nato bombing raids. In a further escalation of tensions, Mr Karadzic was reported to have told an Austrian newspaper that he would try to acquire nuclear weapons to carry out attacks if the west pressed ahead with military action. The comments were due to be published in Austria today. But a spokesman for Mr Karadzic last night denied he made the threat.</p>

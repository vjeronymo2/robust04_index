			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Xenova to seek first listing in the US Xenova, a pharmaceutical research company, is planning to go public in the US rather than join the growing number of biotechnology companies listed in London. It is hoping to raise about Dollars 45m (Pounds 31m) from a public offering of American Depositary Shares, valuing its enlarged equity at up to Dollars 175m, and is applying for a quotation on the Nasdaq market. The company declined to comment on the move, citing US Securities and Exchange Commission rules, but it has previously said that it was likely to float first in the US. It already has a strong base of shareholders in the US after a Dollars 30m private placement of equity a year ago. Xenova has filed with the SEC a registration statement covering an initial public offering representing 3m ordinary shares at an expected price range of Dollars 13 to Dollars 15. Of these, 1m will be offered internationally. Following the relaxation of the London Stock Exchange's listing requirements for research-based companies there have been a series of biotechnology flotations in the UK.</p>

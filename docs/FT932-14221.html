			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Lafarge Coppee Having paid through the nose in 1989 for its position in Spanish cement, Lafarge Coppee is making amends. While it is offering minority shareholders in Asland a 20 per cent premium to the market price, it is still paying a discount to net assets. That will reduce the amount of goodwill being charged against profits from the original purchase. It is also buying unencumbered access to Pta 15bn of cash tucked away in Asland's balance sheet. Since the all-paper offer increases Lafarge's share capital by 8 per cent, the deal looks not unlike a substitute rights issue. Even so, the timing is curious. The Spanish construction downturn shows every sign of deepening. Cheap cement imports are adding to the cyclical pain. Following Cemex's acquisition of a 30 per cent market share last year, Lafarge may be hoping to force further consolidation. Prices might then stabilise even if volume remains poor. With the likes of Holderbank present, there may be a chance to establish the price discipline existing elsewhere in Europe. Other shareholders in Asland might feel unenthusiastic about an offer paid in shares by a company which has underperformed the French market by 30 per cent in three years. With Lafarge already in control and the industrial outlook so bleak, though, the minority has scant chance of forcing better terms.</p>

			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / AT&amp;T given boost in fight for UK market OFTEL, the telecommunications regulator, has given the strongest signal yet that American Telephone &amp; Telegraph will be allowed to compete with BT in the Pounds 15bn-a-year UK telecommunications market. Oftel has invited AT&amp;T to a seminar next month called to discuss the terms on which competitors should be allowed access to BT's network. The regulator said AT&amp;T had been invited 'purely for the wealth of its experience in the US' on the way rival telephone companies reimburse one another for using their networks. However, the invitation will be seen as a boost for AT&amp;T in its campaign to win government approval to compete in the UK. The Department of Trade and Industry is considering an application from AT&amp;T for a public operator licence. The DTI set a precedent for AT&amp;T's entry by recently granting draft licences to three foreign groups to compete with BT, which has applied to the US Federal Communications Commission for a licence to allow it to buy and sell services in the US. The costs of installing a new telecommunications network are huge. So to compete effectively with BT, rival operators require access to its national telephone network to carry their services. The Oftel seminar will examine the terms on which BT should allow rivals access. AT&amp;T is the only operator without a UK licence to be invited to the Oftel seminar, at which BT will give further details of its proposal to publish tariffs to competitors for connection to its network. Several regional US operators - all making substantial investments in the UK's growing cable telephone industry - have made representations on BT's outline proposal. They will have to make do with a few of the five places at the seminar allocated to the Cable Television Association. In its submission to Oftel, AT&amp;T called for BT to be obliged not only to publish standard connection tariffs, but also to disclose the relevant costs behind them. Oftel's draft proposals favoured 'accounting separation' between BT's retail and network businesses. Most operators favour specific regulation of terms of access to the local network.</p>

"Our objectives are simple -- to open markets and to promote  global economic growth," he told Japanese business leaders. "To  advance these objectives, Japan needs to take credible actions,  and to take them now."    As in comments the day before, Christopher laced a speech to  the Japan Association of Corporate Executives with criticism of  Japan for failing to keep its trade commitments, as well as  optimism that both sides will meet "our responsibility to  change."    In prepared remarks, he described Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton's decision "not to paper  over our differences" when bilateral trade "framework" talks  collapsed February 11 as a "welcome sign of new candor."    But, Christopher said, "agreeing to disagree is not good  enough. Acknowledging economic differences must be a starting  point for finally resolving them."    He said last month's 15 trillion yen economic stimulus  measures "are insufficient to produce sustained, demand-led  growth," which Washington demands to help curb Japan's huge  trade surplus.    "Japan has been unwilling to reach agreements on specific  steps to open markets in the priority sectors of insurance,  government procurement and autos and auto parts," Christopher  said.    Despite agreeing last July to use "objective criteria" to  gauge the opening of its markets, "Japan has declined to provide  realistic ways to measure progress to ensure that any such  agreements are working," Christopher charged.</p>

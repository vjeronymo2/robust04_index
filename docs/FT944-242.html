			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / The end of the sales: As the Treuhand winds up, Judy Dempsey looks at its record Four years ago, the Treuhand, Germany's privatisation agency, vowed to complete its operations by the end of 1994. Mrs Birgit Breuel, the agency's combative head, is proud that the organisation, the world's largest holding company, will keep its promise and cease operations tomorrow. 'We stuck to our mandate. There was no other alternative,' she says. Mrs Breuel, who joined the Treuhand in October 1990, succeeded Mr Detlef Karsten Rohwedder in April 1991, after the agency's first president was murdered by unknown assassins. The agency had been set up in March 1990 to privatise the state-run economy of former communist east Germany. The Treuhand's small staff of west German industrial managers had no idea of the scale or cost of the task. The agency had no reliable accounts or balance sheets for the Kombinate, the giant state-owned enterprises that it started dismantling in late 1990. Once figures were available, the magnitude of the problems became apparent. The Treuhand had 13,781 industrial enterprises on its books, plus 10,652 small shops and other retail businesses. It employed about 4m people, 3.5m of them industrial workers. In the past 56 months, the Treuhand has quickly privatised the retail outlets. Of the industrial enterprises, 3,527 have been closed. Almost all the rest have been sold, 2,679 to management buy-outs, 855 to foreign investors and the rest to west German investors. In all, the Treuhand has attracted investment commitments of about DM206bn (Pounds 85bn) and earned DM64.9bn from sales. The remaining 100 companies will be placed under so-called Management KGs run by west German managers with the aim of preparing them for privatisation. Impressive though this record is, the Treuhand has been the subject of acute criticism in both parts of Germany. One cause is its cost. Instead of realising a positive balance for the German exchequer from the sale - once casually estimated by Mr Rohwedder at 'around DM600bn' - it will leave a debt burden to the federal government of at least DM275bn. When the Treuhand decided to save some sections of the industrial/manufacturing base, it did so at enormous expense to the taxpayer. In the east German shipbuilding sector, for instance, 7,000 of the original 40,000 jobs have been saved at a cost of more than DM700,000 for each job. The subsidies for saving jobs at Eko Stahl, east Germany's loss-making steel company, will cost even more. 'These industries will become competitive,' says Mrs Breuel. Treuhand officials admit, however, they were trapped between privatising quickly and saving jobs through what amounted to transitional subsidies. The agency's record in preserving jobs has also been criticised. Six out of 10 employees at Treuhand enterprises lost their jobs. The Treuhand has secured job guarantees for just 1.5m workers, only 700,000 in the manufacturing sector. IG Metall, the steel and engineering trade union, and the governments of the five east German states believe the way the Treuhand closed large sections of industry hindered the growth of the Mittelstand, small and medium-sized enterprises. 'The Treuhand's policies virtually destroyed the region's industrial base,' says Mr Karl Rohring, an official of the union's Berlin/Brandenburg branch. 'The Mittelstand depends on an industrial base. East Germany cannot live off services alone. It will never become a self-sustaining economy without industry.' IG Metall also attacks what it describes as the absence of an economic strategy to help the newly privatised companies survive. 'That was up to the politicians,' says Mrs Breuel. 'That had nothing to do with our mandate.' And Mr Otto Schily, head of the parliamentary investigation committee set up to scrutinise the Treuhand, has accused the agency of making decisions behind closed doors, in particular of selling companies too cheaply to managers who wanted only to pick up the subsidies or the property. 'We were open at all times,' says Mrs Breuel, adding that negotiations are never carried out in the public domain. There has also been criticism of the agency's methods from foreign investors. 'We were often passed from one Treuhand official to the other. We never knew the rules of the game,' a UK investor complains. But Mrs Breuel rebuts any notion that the Treuhand tried to keep foreign investors out. 'About 10 per cent of our portfolio has been sold to foreigners,' she says. 'All along, we applied the same philosophy to each sale. We wanted to buy management, buy knowhow, buy expertise, buy technology - even more importantly, buy marketing skills.' As the Treuhand prepares to end its operations, however, its pace and methods continue to evoke as much admiration as criticism. 'I have spoken to people who have done mergers and acquisitions, and they said you needed about 10 years for this kind of work. They are truly surprised at what the Treuhand achieved,' says Mr Horst Siebert, head of the Institute for World Economy at Kiel University. The agency has had to cope with obstruction from east German factory managers, many of them former communists opposed to privatisation. They were often loath to co-operate, fearing for their jobs if the true financial condition of their enterprises were discovered. 'I remember when I was carrying out an inventory of the enterprise, one of the department heads, a former member of the Stasi (east Germany's secret police), simply refused to hand over some records,' says one US consultant. 'In the end, he locked me into a small room and allowed me to look at the books. I was not allowed to take them away.' More fundamentally, there was no precedent for privatising an entire economy, particularly when monetary union between the two Germanys had made the east's exports uncompetitive in its core markets of eastern Europe. Mrs Breuel recalls the early days as 'truly extraordinary times. After starting from virtually nothing, we built up a network of experts and a financial picture of the enterprises.' And despite the criticisms, few economists believe there was an alternative to the way the Treuhand operated. 'I looked at how some of the east European countries were introducing the voucher system in which ordinary people could trade in their coupons for shares,' says Mr Siebert. 'But in the case of east Germany, this system would not have had the effect of bringing in capital very quickly, as well as bringing in new management. These two aspects were the most promising ingredients of the Treuhand's methods.' The benefits of the Treuhand approach can now be seen in the investment record: some DM140bn of private investment has been used to modernise the capital stock of east Germany's enterprises and to improve the quality of distribution. For the first time last year, investment per capita in the east exceeded that in the west. The true worth of the Treuhand's work will be measured by the performance of the east German economy in coming years. It is now showing real signs of recovery, with growth expected to be 9 per cent this year and a further 10 per cent in 1995 (though this follows a fall of 30 per cent in 1991-1992). Much of this growth is fuelled by the non-tradeable goods sector, including the construction and food-processing industry. Exports by privatised companies remain miserable, partly because of high labour costs and low productivity. Gross domestic product per employee in eastern Germany last year was 46 per cent of the level in the west, while per capita wages and salaries rose to 70 per cent of the western level, making eastern German unit wage costs 44 per cent above those in western Germany. Despite these more optimistic signs of growth, Mrs Breuel declines to speculate what the east German economy will look like in 10 years. 'I am no Delphi. But I have no doubt that the kind of management skills we have bought and investment decisions we have made will bear fruit.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sales by Treuhand to foreign investors (up to September 1994)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                Number of    Investment    Number of job    Proceeds              enterprises   commitments     guarantees       (DM m)                               (DM m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Denmark           26            545           3,196           338 France            88          5,454          25,422         1,447 UK               124          2,825          18,866         1,183 Italy             38            702           4,897           328 Canada            10          1,849          16,955            35 Luxembourg        12            406           2,208           276 Netherlands       96          1,191          10,577           394 Austria          100          1,016          16,323           289 Switzerland      139          1,191          19,474           456 US                77          3,685          13,273         1,078 Others           145          2,935          21,196           390 Total            855         21,799         152,387         6,214  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Treuhand  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

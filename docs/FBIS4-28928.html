			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["The United States Does Not Know How Bold and Decisive </F> Supreme Commander Kim Chong-il Is; Radio Voice of America" --  KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- Radio Voice of America  said on June 5 that there is a heated discussion on what phase  would be created by "sanctions" against North Korea in the U.S.  Congress, academic and public circles and even in the U.S.  military.    The radio said that the dove camp, especially former U.S.  high-ranking officials and former U.S. generals who were  involved in the policy toward North Korea for a rather long  period and who, staying in South Korea, frequently contacted  North Korea repeatedly advised Washington to ponder over the  matter, saying it is a mistake if it thought "sanctions" or  "military response" against North Korea would be effective.    The radio quoted them as saying the United States does not  know North Korea yet and, particularly, how bold and decisive  supreme commander Kim Chong-il is. Suffice it to recall the  situation on the Korean peninsula which abruptly took a critical  turn in March last year, they said.    The radio quoted them as stressing that the U.S. must know  well the preparedness of the North Korean Army equipped with  modern weapons and well trained for action.    Not a few figures in the United States hold that, no matter  how important the "nuclear issue" may be, the United States must  open the door for dialogue to North Korea once again before  taking "sanctions" and "military countermeasure", the radio said.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: N Brown advances 12% to Pounds 15.7m N BROWN, the Manchester- based mail order group which specialises in womenswear, lifted annual pre-tax profits by 12 per cent as it began to benefit from a Pounds 20m investment in central warehousing. However, Sir David Alliance, chairman, said the past year had been the most challenging he could remember during his business career. Although cautious about prospects for the current year, he said sales were running ahead of the previous 12 months. In the year to February 29, pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 14m to Pounds 15.7m, struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 939,000 relating to the closure of old warehouse sites and retraining of staff. Sales increased by 9 per cent to Pounds 152.6m (Pounds 140.2m). The three catalogues launched last year contributed Pounds 5m to turnover. A further Pounds 3.3m in sales was added through the creation of Langley House, which sells speciality products through newspaper advertisements. Odhams, the video and CD mail order group bought from the receivers, contributed Pounds 1.2m to sales in the three months it was included. Directors said they were aiming to make similar in-fill acquisitions as opportunities arose. The operating margin fell from 14.9 per cent to 14.4 per cent as the company absorbed higher marketing costs but is expected to firm again with the improved efficiencies from the new warehouse. Dunlop Heywood, the poorly-performing consultant property surveyors, opened an additional office during the year and helped improve the profit contribution from the financial and property services division from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 400,000. Following the inflow of Pounds 16.5m cash from last May's rights issue, interest charges were reduced from Pounds 5.65m to Pounds 4.05m. Brown's shareholding in Coats Viyella earned Pounds 166,000 (Pounds 205,000). Earnings fell from 15.67p to 15.1p as the dilutive effects of a one-off issue of shares to an Employee Share-Ownership Trust (Esot) took their toll. A recommended final dividend of 4.25p brings the total to 6p (5.65p). COMMENT A pygmy in a world of mail order giants, N Brown is able to eke out a profitable existence by providing niche catalogues to narrow groups of shoppers. This is a hard task to get right but the company appears to have developed the concept to a fine art. Although it only accounts for 4 per cent of the total home shopping market it commands an impressive 21 per cent of the direct order sector and can now expect to benefit from further operational efficiencies from substantial investments in distribution and information systems. Pre-tax profits are expected to rise to about Pounds 19m this year putting the company on a prospective multiple of 16. Some analysts used the strength of this performance to return the company to their buy lists. That suggests the shares may be in for a bit of a run and are certainly worth tucking away when opportunities arise.</p>

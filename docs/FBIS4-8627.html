			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Szilvia Zimber: "Unfounded Scare Tactics"] </F>   [Text] "As the minister vested with powers to authorize the  use of secret service devices and as a member of the cabinet, I  categorically label as unfounded any statements that generate an  atmosphere of fear or hint that certain political parties or  their headquarters are under surveillance and their telephones  are being tapped," declared Justice Minister Istvan Balsai  yesterday in Dombovar at a news conference that preceded a local  political rally.    Yesterday afternoon the justice minister dedicated the  renovated building of the Dombovar Municipal Court, which has  been functioning for 80 years. Istvan Balsai rated as  spectacular the achievements of the government's four years in  office, the judiciary's elevation to a position worthy of a  rule-of-law state, the increase in judges' salaries, and the  improvement of their working conditions. "I am confident that we  will be able to continue this trend in the future. After all,  there is much left to be done in the coming period as well," the  minister said. Incidentally, the development of the security  system absorbed nearly half of the Dombovar Municipal Court  building's renovation cost.    In the evening Istvan Balsai, member of the MDF [Hungarian  Democratic Forum] executive committee, and attorney Dr. Marianna  Monostori, MDF candidate for Parliament in Tolna County's fourth  electoral district, attended a local political rally.    According to Istvan Balsai, the statements made by prominent  politicians of more than one political party following the start  of the election campaign were without foundation. They claimed  that the handing in of nomination forms and the elections  themselves were shrouded in an atmosphere of fear. He  categorically denied the accusations made by the president of  the Hungarian Socialist Party that the vicinity of his party's  headquarters was under surveillance and the party's telephones  were being tapped. The purpose of this completely unfounded  accusation might be to confuse the citizens and to question the  country's democratic functioning. Istvan Balsai rejected also  the political statements that questioned freedom of the press,  citing the situation of Hungarian Radio's public employees.</p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT BUSH BANS BROCCOLI  </P> <P> News that President Bush has taken a tough stand on broccoli has me confused. I  can't understand why growers sent him 10 tons of the stuff when he clearly  expressed his personal aversion to it.  </P> <P> This tasteless episode is a chilling reminder that agricultural interests in  America are so pampered and deluded by subsidies for plowing, subsidies for not  plowing, parities, cheap water, caves full of cheese, price supports and tax  breaks that could make any working stiff with a good CPA wealthy, that they  judge a man's personal preference for broccoli as an attack and retaliate by  sending him 10 tons of it!  </P> <P> The drug cartel has better manners than these rowdies. No one sent the  President a truckload of crack as he denounced the use and production of this  vile drug with similar, though less newsworthy, vehemence.  </P> <P> TOM LAURIE  </P> <P> Cayucos, Calif.  </P></p>

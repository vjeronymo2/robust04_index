The Dialogue Committee had come a long way when it resumed  its meetings in Aden last Sunday but representatives of the  opposition parties felt that there was what they called  "procrastination, dithering, and time-wasting" by the Yemeni  Socialist Party and the General People's Congress at the  meetings held the day before yesterday.    The withdrawn parties include the opposition's National Bloc  parties, Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier General Mujahid  Abu-Shawarib, the Patriotic Forces Union, the Ba'th Party,  representatives of the "Yemeni Revolution's Fighters," and the  September Party representative Brigadier General Ahmad Qarhash.  These parties decided to hold a meeting this evening to take a  clear and decisive stance on the issues under discussion and on  the dialogue itself.    Some partisan sources have accused some members of the  coalition, whom they declined to name, of using the time factor  to foil the dialogue and carry out previous designs.    The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the withdrawing  parties and figures would announce a resolution to the effect  that "there should either be a dialogue aimed at achieving good  and tangible results or no dialogue at all, in which case the  coalition parties obstructing the dialogue will be held fully  responsible."

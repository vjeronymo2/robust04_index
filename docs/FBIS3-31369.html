			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The visit paid to Romania by Croatian President  Franjo Tudjman concluded today. [passage omitted] A joint news  conference was held by the two chiefs of state after the signing  of the official Romanian-Croatian documents. The news  conference was opened with a statement by President Ion Iliescu,  who said that the bilateral relations have already experienced a  positive evolution, despite the tensions prevailing in the  former Yugoslav space, and that the current talks in Bucharest  have shown that there is a real interest in developing these  relations, as proven by the agreements and the Romanian-Croatian  treaty signed on this occasion. President Ion Iliescu also  hailed the agreement on normalizing the Serbian-Croatian  relations and the latest developments in Bosnia. He said that a  military solution to the conflict has no chance of success.    Croatian President Franjo Tudjman said in his statement that  his visit to Romania will give an impetus to the economic,  political, cultural, and sports cooperation between the two  countries and that the treaty signed in Bucharest will lead to a  very good development of the Romanian-Croatian relations.  Pointing out that Romania is the largest country in the region,  the Croatian president said that it can play a major role in  solving the conflicts in former Yugoslavia and in the Balkans in  general. The guest said that if NATO resorts to air attacks,  this might lead to an extension of the conflict. Consequently,  negotiations to solve the situation in Bosnia are to be  preferred.    Both in his introductory statement and in the answers to the  questions of the journalists, President Tudjman referred to the  Yugoslav crisis, which he characterized as extremely  complicated. He described NATO's ultimatum as having a possible  positive aspect, but he also expressed doubts over its  implementation. The Croatian head of state recalled his  country's initial desire to maintain the unity of former  Yugoslavia in a federation that can ensure the equal rights of  the nations. That wish could not materialize, Mr. Tudjman said,  because the proclamation of the independence of Slovenia,  Croatia, Macedonia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina was followed by the  Serbian aggression against Croatia and Bosnia, with ended in the  occupation of a third of Croatia's territory. In this respect,  Mr. Franjo Tudjman emphasized the contribution that Romania can  make, as element of stability in the area, to resolving the  Yugoslav crisis.</p>

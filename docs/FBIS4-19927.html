			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPEAN REPORT: </F> "EU/Russia: Moscow Offers Compromise on Trade in Nuclear Fuel"]    [Text] In a surprise move, the Russian Government on 18  April put some urgency behind the 17-month-old talks with the EU  over a Partnership Cooperation Agreement. Moscow urged  compromise in the crucial area of trade in nuclear materials and  announced it would send one of the Government's heaviest-hitters  to Brussels on 27 April with the aim of bringing the talks to an  end.    Alexandr Shokin, the minister responsible for the economy  and  foreign trade, wrote to the EU foreign affairs ministers,  meeting in Council in Luxembourg on 18 April, calling for their  "cooperation" in bringing the talks to "an early and successful  conclusion." Although there are officially three issues standing  in the way of the Treaty -- nuclear materials, rights for EU  ships flying non-EU flags, and the establishment of foreign  banks in Russia -- the stakes have now in reality boiled down to  the issue of cheap uranium imports into the Union. In his  letter, Mr. Shokin referred to the nuclear fuel trade problem as  the "principal outstanding obstacle" in the way of an Agreement  that would regularise EU-Russian political and economic  relations and get Russia on the same footing as Ukraine, which  penned a similar Partnership Agreement with the EU in March.    Russia wants trade in nuclear materials to be incorporated  into the Agreement along with other related issues such as  investment, nuclear nonproliferation, conversion of defence  industries, nuclear safeguards and environmental policy. The  EU's official stance has been until now that a separate  Agreement is needed to regulate Russian uranium exports to the  EU while France has taken a harder line in seeking a quota. The  Eurodif plant in Tricastin, France, produces 40 percent of  world's requirements of enriched uranium, and the Paris  Government is concerned this industry would be threatened by  Russia's enormous capacity to make the same product at much  lower prices.    Mr. Shokin acknowledged this fear in his letter, and said  Russia is "prepared to provide assurances that its exports of  natural and enriched uranium to the Community will be  nondisruptive, avoiding sudden surges." However, in return,  Russia would want assurances that the EU would avoid unilateral  measures "disrupting mutual trade" and would consult with  Russian Government if problems arose over time. Mr. Shokin  enclosed a draft exchange of letters between Russia and the EU,  including all his proposals.    In a statement at the end of the Council meeting, the  foreign  ministers said the Russian proposals "merit careful study," and  called on the Commission to look into them with the intention of  seeking a joint response from the Council. Ministers confirmed  the "great importance" they attached to completing the  Partnership Agreement negotiations.</p>

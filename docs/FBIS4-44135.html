			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--Acutely aware of Turkey's growing need for  natural gas, President Suleyman Demirel declared on Monday [20  June] that he would personally hold talks with his Iranian  counterpart regarding building of a pipeline that would  transport Turkmen gas to Europe via Turkey and Iran.    Demirel's announcement of Turco-Iranian talks on the  pipeline  followed his request to Turkmenistan President Saparmurat  Niyazov to "start the natural gas pipeline project as soon as  possible."    Receiving Turkmenistan's Saparmurat Niyazov, who changed his  name to Turkmenbasi--meaning the Head of the Turkmens--Demirel  said that Ankara and Ashgabat had reiterated the mutual will to  build this natural gas pipeline via Turkey. The bilateral talks  mainly concentrated on economic cooperation in general and  possible joint projects to develop and operate Turkmen natural  gas reserves and construction of the pipeline in particular.    Turkmenistan recently agreed to the transfer of its natural  gas to Italy and France through Iran and Turkey with a 5,000  kilometer (3,000-mile) pipeline. The 9 billion dollar project  also calls for another, 1,800-kilometer (1,125-mile) pipeline to  provide Turkey's and Iran's natural gas needs.    "We will be the transit point and the buyer at the same  time," Hayrettin Uzun, the chief of Turkish state pipeline  company Botas, said before the official talks.    But he complained about the slow progress on the  multi-billion dollar project.    A final decision on the pipeline is expected at a meeting  between Turkey, Russia, Turkmenistan and Iran, chaired by  Niyazov himself, which will take place on August 15 in Tehran.  But Demirel said he would take up the issue with his Iranian  counterpart 'Ali Akbar Velayati [as published] when he paid a  visit to Iran on July 25.    "We want the project to be realized as soon as possible,"  Demirel told Niyazov, after signing a memorandum of  understanding. "It should be completed within two years...  Turkey needs natural gas and so does Europe. What must be done  is to find financing for it."    Botas' chief Uzun said last week that Turkey's economic  difficulties, coupled by the strict austerity measures imposed  on Botas by the government jeopardized all megaprojects on the  agenda.    In the economic section of the talks, the two presidents  have  discussed a number of projects from a Turkish carpet factory in  Turkmenistan to a "Turkmenbasi port" on the Caspian Sea.  Turkmenistan has the third largest number of Turkish contractors  and the volume of trade in 1993 was 160 million dollars. Other  projects include selling Turkish electricity to Turkmenistan and  construction of roads and railways for this Central Asian  republic.    "The two countries have given each other most favored nation  status," President Demirel said.    On the political platform, the two presidents have discussed  the venues of two upcoming international conferences. Niyazov  said his country would be happy to host the next summit of  Economic Cooperation Organization--a group founded by Turkey,  Iran and Pakistan and later joined by Afghanistan, Turkic  republics and Tajikistan.    "The summit was originally scheduled to take place in  Pakistan but, if Pakistan agrees, the next venue can be  Ashgabat," Demirel said.    He also said that they have decided to have Istanbul,  instead  of Baku, as the next venue of a Turkic Summit.    This was interpreted as a way to overcome the reluctance of  Turkic leaders to hold the summit in the capital of Azerbaijan  which is involved in fighting with another CIS member, Armenia.    The Baku meeting, which was scheduled for last December, was  not realized partly due to tensions between Azerbaijan and  Turkmenistan, which had provided natural gas to Armenia. Both  countries have taken pains to stress that their cooperation was  "not against any third party."    "We have a firm relationship based on mutual interest,"  Demirel said. 'No country should feel threatened by this."</p>

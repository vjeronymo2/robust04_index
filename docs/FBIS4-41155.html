			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and Aleksandr </F> Mineyev]    [Text] Brussels June 22 TASS -- "Russia and NATO have taken  the first step towards building up their relations, searching  for new formulas of ensuring European stability and security,"  said Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. He addressed a  session of the NATO Council devoted to the adoption of documents  regulating relations between Russia and the North Atlantic  alliance.    Kozyrev pointed out that the preparation of a programme of  broad cooperation between NATO and Russia has begun on the basis  of proposals earlier submitted by Russia. A special protocol  says that this will be a programme, meeting the dimensions and  significance of Russia's potential. "An agreement has been  reached on a broad, deep dialogue and cooperation in areas where  Russia is capable of making a unique and important contribution  which conforms to Russia's prestige and responsibility as the  biggest European, world and nuclear state," Kozyrev said.    Accepting NATO's proposals, Russia is officially joining the  Partnership for Peace initiative. Taking part in its  realisation as equal partners are both states which were  adversaries in the period of cold war, or neutral countries  balancing between the two blocs. Such broad participation  creates prerequisites for further evolution of the European  situation in the direction of strengthening mutual understanding  and ensuring an equal level of security for all countries. For  all its importance, "the Partnership for Peace" is only one  direction for establishing military-political interaction,  Kozyrev said.    Another direction includes activities along the lines of the  Council for North Atlantic Cooperation (NACC), whose potential,  in Russia's opinion, should be more actively used, in  particular, in its peace-keeping activities.    The third direction is the development of a system of  bilateral contacts between Russia, NATO and NACC, which will  include peace- keeping activities, joint maneuvers, cooperation  in conversion. These directions "fit the framework of the common  choice in favour of cooperation and the formation of a really  single space of security from Vancouver to Vladivostok," Kozyrev  said. In conclusion, the Russian foreign minister pointed out  that all efforts should pursue a priority goal -- the creation  of single Europe. "The key role on the continent is being played  and will be played by the Conference on Security and Cooperation  in Europe (CSCE). This is where Russia's opinion and the  alliance' assessments coincide," Kozyrev said.</p>

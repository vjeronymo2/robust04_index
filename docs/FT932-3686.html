			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead KENWOOD Appliances, the domestic appliances company that floated last June - and made a profits warning three months later - is expected to report preliminary pre-tax profits of about Pounds 9.5m on Monday, up from Pounds 9.3m. Despite a better second half and the acquisition of Tricom in Hong Kong last November, earnings per share are unlikely to be ahead as significantly as expected by some at the time of the float. The City will be keen to have an update on the restructuring programme at FKI when the electrical engineering group reports annual results on Tuesday. Bob Beeston, chief executive, has seen FKI's share price nearly treble in value since he was brought in from BTR at the beginning of last year. Analysts, who expect pre-tax profits to have risen from Pounds 31m to about Pounds 37m, will also be interested in the state of the group's large US automotive market. Granada, the leisure, television and computer services group, is expected on Wednesday to announce healthy pre-tax profits of about Pounds 67m for the 26 weeks to March 27. This will compare with Pounds 57m last time, although that was for a 28-week period. Modest progress is expected in both rental and television with about Pounds 5m profit, against Pounds 4.3m, expected for computer services. Noting that investors were showing greater interest in the leisure sector, Bruce Jones, leisure analyst at stockbroker Smith New Court, said they felt 'comfortable' with Gerry Robinson, the chief executive. NFC, the transport and logistics company, is set to report interim profits on Wednesday of about Pounds 40m, virtually unchanged from a year ago. Analysts will be watching for further signs of growth from its US logistics business. They will also want to see the effects of the sale in January of the company's waste management division. The sale will depress the transport division's profits, but reduce significantly group interest costs over the year. Dawson International is due to report its results for the year to March 31 on Thursday. One of Britain's biggest clothing manufacturers, Dawson is expected to double its profits to Pounds 32.5m. Earnings will grow to 13p (10.4p) per share.</p>

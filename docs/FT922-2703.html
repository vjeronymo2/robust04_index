			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Arts: Old and new at Aldeburgh The opening weekend of the 45th Aldeburgh Festival showed that the artistic uncertainties of the post-Britten and post-Pears years are now safely in the past. Old and new themes are being examined, old and new heroes celebrated, side by side, freshly, interestingly, boldly: place, performance, style and content combine to make each event, and each juxtaposition, a properly and unrepeatably festive one. Inevitably, Aldeburgh audiences have still to be persuaded that the new is as much worth the ticket price as the old. Friday's London Sinfonietta concert of new or new-ish music conducted by Oliver Knussen (one of the festival's two current artistic directors) was sparsely attended, whereas Saturday's concert performance of The Beggar's Opera in Britten's 1948 re-working was a sell-out. The festive excitement of the two seemed to me in inverse proportion to their popular success. Britten's Beggar's Opera is no mere orchestral enlargement of Gay but a thoroughgoing re-invention. The scoring for small ensemble, full of echt-Britten sound-devices such as trickling harp, keening oboe and ironically portentous timpani, is only the start. Though almost all of the original numbers are included, their settings are refracted through Britten's strongly personal compositional glass. The artful complexities of added counterpoint ('I must stop myself 'canonising' too much', Britten is quoted in the programme as advising himself - an instruction he then proceeded to ignore) and the enrichments for chorus take the version far from its ballad-opera origins. Separated by time from the performing exigencies that gave Britten's labours their special slant and purpose, the revival served most usefully as a reminder of Britten the immensely practical theatre-musician, whose knack of pace and timing, of getting the most out of a particular group of singers and players was unrivalled in the 20th century. As in the parallel cases of Wagner's re-working of Gluck's Iphigenie en Aulide and Strauss's of Idomeneo, the end-product tells us, finally, more about Britten than Gay. As a Beggar's Opera in its own right I found this sadly lacking in earthy simplicity and scabrous slanginess. The salt and sweat of the play, the uproarious mixture of vulgarity and social criticism, are smoothed away in the very abundance of Britten's compositional felicities; the result, though by no means as touristy a Beggar's Opera as Frederick Austin's edition, or Guy Woolfenden's for Scottish Opera a decade ago, is worryingly coy. Or so it seemed in a jolly but unfocused (insufficiently rehearsed?) concert performance conducted by Steuart Bedford, and given by a glamorous cast - Philip Langridge as Macheath, Ann Murray, Yvonne Kenny, Robert Lloyd, John Rawnsley, Nuala Willis - who sang with glamorous tone but who tended to put across the words with far too little punch and point. The use of the actor Declan Mulholland as Beggar-Narrator was undermined by memory-lapses; in character and delivery, though, he alone appeared to stray in from the 'real world' of the piece. The Knussen-Sinfonietta concert - it was the conductor's 40th birthday, and began with a hilarious unannounced re-scoring of Stravinsky's Happy Birthday  -was a dazzling affair. Knussen's own Songs without Words for eight instruments were receiving their first European hearing: four small, magically lyrical ruminations in each of which a single instrumental voice (most notably the english horn of the fourth) sings out above its economically picturesque accompaniment. The influence of Ravel's Mallarme settings is clear, and fertile. Colin Matthews's bracing, boundingly inventive Suns Dance and Poul Ruders's over-ambitious but wildly exhilarating Four Compositions (1980) were the other highlights. Sviatoslav Richter, an Aldeburgh hero, returned to the Maltings after a long absence to give the opening piano recital. His introspective Haydn in the first half showed faint signs of un-Richter-like physical caution; thereafter, Chopin, Skryabin and an incomparably luxuriant, spacious, deeply resonant Debussy Ile joyeuse banished them with magnificent ease. The choice of Sunday-afternoon pianist proved the adventurousness of Aldeburgh's programme-planning. Pedja Muzijevic, a young Yugoslavian resident in America, is a virtuoso with formidable fingers and a musician with fiercely original ideas about the music he plays. At present he cannot resist underlining his insights - Haydn G major sonata (H XVI: 6) in the first part and Schubert's A major Sonata (D959) in the second were particularly subjected to affectionate pushes and pulls of phrasing. But a pianist with too many ideas is always infinitely preferable to one with too few.</p>

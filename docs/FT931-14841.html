			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber suppliers threaten restrictions to lift prices RUBBER producing countries are threatening to restrict supplies if consumer nations are unable to agree on a new international rubber pact. They may be forced to impose restictions in an effort to lift prices, the Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries said at the end of a meeting in Hatyai, Thailand. The ANRPC groups Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, India, Papua New Guinea and Singapore, which together account for about 80 per cent of the world's natural rubber output. It accuses the consumer countries of delaying attempts to negotiate a new international rubber agreement (INRA). The current pact expires at the end of this year, though it can be extended, by agreement, by up to two years. Mr Sucharit Promdej, the ANRPC's secretary general, said the ANRPC was preparing to revive a 1976 price stabilisation agreement between the main producer countries. This would impose production and export restraints and provide financial resources for the operations of the producers' own buffer stock. Mr Sucharit said producers would meet in Sri Lanka next month to update the rules of the 1976 agreement. 'An extension of INRA is unacceptable, at least not without a prior commitment from consumer countries to renegotiate,' said Mr Sucharit. At present most of the world's natural rubber industry is overseen by the International Natural Rubber Organisation (INRO), which groups both producers and consumers. The INRO buffer stock manager has stockpiled more than 160,000 tonnes of natural rubber over the past three years in an attempt to stabilise prices. At the end of the month INRO is due to decide whether to cut its buffer stock reference price because of low prices.</p>

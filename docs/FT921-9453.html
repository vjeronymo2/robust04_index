			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: West Trust moves to diversify WEST TRUST is taking the first step of its planned diversification into the food industry and is at the same time reducing its exposure to textiles. It is buying Bart Spices, a high added-value herb and spice packing business which supplies most of the leading UK supermarket chains, for Pounds 2.5m, and selling Indo African Exports, an importer and merchant of grey cotton and polycotton cloth, to its management for Pounds 2.9m cash. The group also announced interim figures, showing a reduction in profits from Pounds 191,000 to Pounds 36,000 for the six months to September 30. There is no interim dividend but the board intends to pay a final of 0.25p; last year the interim was 0.25p but there was no final. Earnings per share were 0.06p (0.35p). Margins were eroded because of the economic climate and Indo African had to provide an estimated Pounds 136,000, of which Pounds 54,000 is included in the half year, for a doubtful debt. Indo African requires a high level of working capital and its borrowings represent about 80 per cent of total group indebtedness. The consideration for Bart will be satisfied as to Pounds 250,000 cash and the issue of 54.4m shares. The vendors will retain 16.9m shares and the balance, plus a further 33.43m shares raising Pounds 1.3m, will be offered to shareholders on a 13-for-10 rights basis at 4p each. The total of up to 87.8m shares being issued represents 61.69 per cent of the enlarged capital. Vendors have guaranteed Bart's pre-tax profit at not less than Pounds 212,000 for the nine months to September 30 1991. All proposals are subject to shareholders' approval at an extraordinary meeting on February 27.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (13): Orimulsion gets a toehold in Europe - Oil stays on the sidelines but a sticky newcomer is knocking at the door THE SHARE of oil used for electricity generation in Europe has been increasing recently because of low oil prices, but this follows a wave of shutdowns across Europe with many oil-fired power stations lying idle for much of the year. Orimulsion - the bitumen-based fuel - is trying to make inroads into the European power market but has yet to make much of an impact outside the UK. The high oil prices of the early 1980s forced a massive shutdown of oil-fired power stations across Europe. Governments are wary of becoming too dependent on oil-fired power because they could be held to ransom by Middle East producers over oil prices. As a result of these trends, much oil plant is held in reserve to cope with peaks in demand or to replace nuclear or hydroelectric power plants when they are not available. Power generators in western Europe used some 80m tonnes of heavy fuel oil a year in 1980. By 1991 the use of oil for producing electricity had halved to 44m tonnes a year - with most closures being made by 1985. Recent falls in oil prices have driven some countries to increase their use of fuel oil in power stations. According to the International Energy Agency, the OECD energy monitoring group, a large proportion of the power plants in Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands can be switched from gas or coal to oil and vice versa at short notice. Few countries are actually building new oil plant although some are looking at the use of orimulsion - a bitumen-in-water emulsion fuel produced in Venezuela. Italy accounts for almost half of the oil that is burned in power stations in western Europe. It remained committed to oil-fired electricity long after many of its European neighbours had closed much of their plant, partly because oil had been the traditional choice of power station fuel in the country. It has no indigenous coal and Rome had imposed its own moratorium on building nuclear plant. Italian power stations currently burn around 800,000 barrels a day of oil to produce 28 per cent of overall electricity supply. This compares with 70,000 b/d in the UK, where oil plants make up 19 per cent of electricity capacity, and Portugal, which gets 25 per cent of its electric power from oil. Spain and France turn to fuel oil when they cannot obtain enough hydro-electricity, but have no plans to increase their exposure to oil. France has capacity to take 6 per cent of its permanent electricity supply from oil and, in Spain, oil accounts for 15 per cent. The oil-fired generating capacity that remains in Europe is there more by chance than planning and few countries are looking to build new oil-fired stations. However, existing plants are cheap to run as oil prices have declined - crude oil is currently at its lowest level in real terms for 20 years - and they are less polluting because of a switch to low-sulphur fuel oil by generators. About five years ago, Italian oil plants were using 90 per cent high-sulphur fuel oil, but the increasing cost competitiveness of low-sulphur oil and tougher environmental restrictions have prompted a move into the low-sulphur variety. The Italian electricity industry now uses around 80 per cent low-sulphur fuel oil and only 20 per cent high-sulphur. The cost advantages of low-sulphur fuel oil means it will compete very strongly with the advent of orimulsion which is trying to break into the European market. So far, orimulsion has made an inroad only into the UK where two orimulsion-burning plants have been opened by PowerGen: Ince on Merseyside and Richborough in Kent. The UK currently burns about 1.3m to 1.5m tonnes of orimulsion a year. However, National Power, the other UK generator, is considering a large development at Pembroke in Wales which would burn between 3m and 4m tonnes of orimulsion. Spain has also signed a contract for the use of 1m tonnes of orimulsion a year in its Fenosa Sabon station which has a capacity of 440 MW. But planning permits for the construction of the station have delayed its go-ahead. The viscous fuel came under heavy attack as a dirty fuel in the recent debate about coal in the UK, but BP Bitor, its importer into Europe, argues that its environmental properties are no worse than those of any other fuel. The company points out that the fuel emits less dust, nitrous oxides and carbon dioxide than most British coal, but admits that it emits more sulphur than coal. BP Bitor is hoping to import between about 20m into Europe by 2000 using the UK as a bridgehead. The company is hoping to increase this to 30m tonnes by 2005. and expects to see at least one more power station burning orimulsion in Europe by the end of next year. Demand is expected primarily from Portugal, Denmark or Italy. Mr Simon Jacques, industry analyst at Caminus Energy, the consultancy group, believes the development of orimulsion will be a political issue: 'It will depend on whether European governments will allow the utilities to sign contracts for the fuel.' Orimulsion is priced to be competitive with international coal prices which means that companies using the fuel would avoid exposure to highly volatile oil prices. Coal prices are expected to remain flat in the foreseeable future, but oil prices are also flat at the moment. If oil prices were to go through a volatile period of rapid increases, orimulsion could prove an attractive competitor. BP Bitor points to the difficulties in getting agreement in Europe for any kind of power plant and believes it could take a lot longer for orimulsion to catch on than was originally thought. 'It's frustrating for us, having made the investments, that it takes a little longer for the market to consume it, but it's not going to kill the thing,' it said.</p>

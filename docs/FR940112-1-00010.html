Midwest ATC Service, Inc., operates a control tower at Friedman Memorial Airport with an associated airport traffic area. Airspace Reclassification, which became effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic area'' and eliminated those ATA's not already designated to become Class D airspace. As a result, the requirement for two-way radio communication with the control tower at Friedman Memorial Airport lapsed. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class D airspace to contain instrument flight rules (IFR) operations and continue the two-way radio communication requirement at Friedman Memorial Airport. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before February 18, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Send comments on the proposal in triplicate to: Manager, System Management Branch, ANM&hyph;530, Federal Aviation Administration, Docket No. 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;35, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful in developing reasoned regulatory decisions on the proposal. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy related aspects of the proposal. Communications should identify the airspace docket and be submitted in triplicate to the address listed above. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments on this notice must submit with those comments a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;35.'' The postcard will be date/time stamped and returned to the commenter. All communications received on or before the specified closing date for comments will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposal contained in this notice may be changed in the light of comments received. All comments submitted will be available for examination at the address listed above both before and after the closing date for comments. A report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA personnel concerned with this rulemaking will be filed in the docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Availability of NPRM's <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Any person may obtain a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation Administration, System Management Branch, ANM&hyph;530, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Cummunications must identify the notice number of this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on mailing list for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory Circular No. 11&hyph;2A, which describes the application procedure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> The Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class D airspace at Friedman Memorial Airport, Hailey, Idaho. Midwest ATC Service, Inc., operates a control tower at Friedman Memorial Airport with an associated airport traffic area (ATA). Airspace reclassification, which became effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic area'' and, for control zones with operating control towers, replaced it with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' Only ATA's already designated to become Class D airspace continued to exist; Friedman Memorial Airport was not so designated. As a result, the requirement for two-way radio communication with the control tower at Friedman Memorial Airport lapsed. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class D airspace to contain IFR operations and continue the two-way communication requirement at Friedman Memorial Airport. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace is published in paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 as of September 16, 1993 (58 FR 36398; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace listed in the document would be published subsequently in the Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> List of Subjects In 14 CFR Part 71 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Aviation, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

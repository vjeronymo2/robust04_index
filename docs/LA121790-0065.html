			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON INSIGHT  </P> <P> QUITTING TIME: An empty chair at the Cabinet table and the opening for the top  job at the Republican National Committee are not the only major vacancies  President Bush is facing as his Administration reaches the traditional midterm  exit point.  </P> <P> Within the White House, for example, James Cicconi, a top Bush aide and a  protege of Secretary of State James A. Baker III, is leaving to return to the  Washington law office headed by power-broker Robert Strauss. And Constance B.  Newman, who heads the Office of Personnel Management, the government's  personnel department, also plans to resign, officials say.  </P> <P> Their departures could have notable impact on policy, particularly in the area  of civil rights. Newman, who is black, and Cicconi played key roles in efforts  to avoid a veto of civil rights legislation successfully opposed by  Administration conservatives.  </P> <P> The open Cabinet position is secretary of education.  </P> <P> QUITTING COLD TURKEY: Counselors who help people stop smoking say that  motivation is always one of the biggest factors in success at kicking the  habit. Alixe Glen, a deputy White House press secretary, has found a powerful  motivation tool.  </P> <P> She was all set to take a job as assistant secretary for public affairs at the  Department of Health and Human Services. Then a reporter called an HHS official  to ask whether Glen planned to quit her pack-a-day habit. Secretary Louis W.  Sullivan, who has made opposition to cigarette smoking a major crusade,  promptly called Glen at the White House. "This is a serious problem," he told  her.  </P> <P> "My last day at the White House I smoked my last cigarette" the now smoke-free  Glen reports.  </P> <P> CONFUSION REIGNS: Five weeks of hearings into the "Keating Five" scandal have  brought members of the Senate Ethics Committee no closer to a consensus on the  guilt or innocence of the five senators charged with improperly assisting  former Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr.  </P> <P> In fact, the hearings appear to have deepened the partisan division of the  six-member committee.  </P> <P> The panel's three Democrats are said to find no fault with the conduct of any  of the five senators, with the possible exception of Sen. Alan Cranston  (D-Calif.).  </P> <P> The three Republican members, however, are understood to be much less willing  to dismiss the allegations against the other four.  </P> <P> When the hearings end next month, according to sources, the committee is likely  to go along with special counsel Robert S. Bennett's recommendation that the  charges against John McCain (R-Ariz.) and John Glenn (R-Ohio) be dismissed, but  no one involved in the investigation has the vaguest idea how the panel will  resolve its differences over the conduct of Cranston, Dennis DeConcini  (D-Ariz.) or Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.).  </P> <P> COP SUMMIT: Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, seeking to gain control of runaway  violent crime, will convene a law enforcement summit in early February,  inviting more than 300 police chiefs, sheriffs, prosecutors, academic experts  and top federal cops to Washington. In addition to sharing information on  crime-busting techniques, the law officers. will be asked to support some of  the Bush Administration's favorite get-tough remedies that were stripped at the  last minute from a comprehensive crime bill passed by Congress this year. The  hard-line measures include a proposal to expand use of the federal death  penalty.  </P></p>

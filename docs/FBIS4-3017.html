			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, April 15 (XINHUA) -- The UN Security  Council today demanded that Bosnian Muslims and Serbs refrain  from any action which might worsen the situation in and around  the UN- designated safe area of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia.    The council was concerned over the situation in the Muslim  enclave and regretted that a UN military observer died of  injuries suffered in the Serb onslaught there, according to  council president Colin Keating of New Zealand.    The council "condemned this blatant violation of council's  resolutions," he said.    He added that the council supported the efforts made by the  UN protection force in Bosnia to improve the situation there,  and welcomed diplomatic initiatives to the same end, including  those of Russia.    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will visit the  region  early next week.</p>

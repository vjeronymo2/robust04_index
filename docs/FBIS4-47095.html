			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mert Kabu: "Russian Officers in Estonia Uneasy </F> about the Future"    [Excerpt] Few of the former-Soviet officers in Estonia are  interested in leaving the country. An entire 87 percent say they  are deeply worried about how they should go about getting a  residence permit. A third of them are relying on Russian  President Boris Yeltsin to help them. Significantly fewer are  depending on Alexander Rutskoy (15 percent) and Vladimir  Zhironovskiy (16 percent.)    This is some of the information which Estonian academics  found out from a sociological study financed by the Olof Palme  International Center of Stockholm. The report was made public on  Tuesday [7 June] at a press conference held by the Estonia  Academy of Sciences in Tallinn.    According to a law adopted in 1993 by the Estonian  parliament, permanent permission to remain in Estonia will be  given only to those retired officers from the old occupation  force who have reached age 60, or whose wife or children are  Estonian citizens. Those who worked for the KGB or the military  intelligence organization (the GRU) will not be allowed to stay.    In Estonia there are currently 10,500 retired officers,  according to Russian military authorities. But according to  Estonian officials these number "at least 11,500," in addition  to an unknown number of family members. Russian officials have  so far refused to hand over name lists, so no one knows for  sure. This has also meant that the opinion sampling is  uncertain, and that the results of the study may be open to  question.    Of the 10,500 officers, around half are believed to fulfill  the criteria for having their individual applications approved.  Half are under 60 years old, many under 50. Of those interviewed  for the study, only 31 percent believe they can get a residence  permit. Thirty-five percent do not think they will get one.  Thirty-four percent say they don't know or refuse to answer.  <H5>  78 Percent of Estonians Say Russians No Danger </H5>   Estonians assert that many of the retired Russian officers  may become a dangerous "fifth column." Seventy-eight percent of  those queried deny that the Russians could become "dangerous"  for Estonia. Only eight percent say they are interested in  possessing personal firearms. Estonians have confidence in the  UN, US, Germany and Sweden regarding helping solve problems of  the retired officers.    How many of the former-Soviet officers should be able to  stay  in Estonia? All, demands Moscow. Only those who the law permits,  say Estonians. (Thusly, more than half.) The Estonians are not  willing to compromise on this point. This would require amending  the law. Neither President Lennart Meri or Prime Minister Maar  Laar can promise this, nor is there currently any majority at  all for this in the Estonian parliament.[passage omitted]</p>

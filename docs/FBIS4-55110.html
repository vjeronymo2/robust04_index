			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 9 May (MTI) -- The Independent  Smallholders' Party (FKGP) has emerged from the elections  stronger and legitimised, party chairman Jozsef Torgyan told a  press conference on Monday.    While the FKGP is gravely concerned by the socialist-liberal  victory in the elections, they see the results as the sovereign  choice of the Hungarian people, and are preparing for a  contructive opposition role. Torgyan believes the Smallholders  will lead the national Christian grouping in the new Parliament.  On their results so far, 8.8 per cent of the votes, the FKGP  think they might win 40-45 mandates out of the 386.</p>

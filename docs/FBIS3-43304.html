UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye, who is  also the main mediator of the Lusaka talks, has said that the  aforementioned meeting will have as its main point of agenda the  cease-fire agreement which has already been discussed in the  Zambian capital. Alioune Beye has also said that this meeting  will depend on the agenda of the Lusaka talks, which, as we have  just said, will begin on 5 January. The UN official revealed  this at the end of his visit to Sao Tome and Principe, where he  has met with President Miguel Trovoada, who is the current  chairman of African Lusophone countries.    Trovoada has been concerned with the Angolan situation, and  has on a number of occasions offered to mediate in the talks  between UNITA and the MPLA-PT.</p>

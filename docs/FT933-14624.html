			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Money Markets: French rates jumpy FRENCH money market rates were jittery yesterday, reflecting uncertainty about the immediate outlook for the franc, writes Stephanie Flanders. The nature of the pressure facing the franc makes it difficult for traders to know which way to jump. The market still feels that the French authorities are desperate to cut interest rates for the sake of the domestic economy. But there is a realisation, too, that the selling of the French currency is exerting upward pressure on market rates. Three-month French money market rates moved slowly upwards through the course of the day, closing at around 7.87 per cent, compared with their opening level of 7.75 per cent. A dealer suggested that this was more for lack of anything better to do than any clear sense of direction. French interest rate futures markets were even more subdued. The September Pibor contract rose 2 basis points, ending at around 93.02, although the bid-ask spread was narrow enough for this to amount to no change from this morning's opening. The Bank of England fore-cast a small shortage of Pounds 850m in the morning, which was later revised to Pounds 900m. This was dispatched by early afternoon in discount market dealing. Overnight rates fell to 4 per cent. Further out, rates were mostly unchanged. The three-month interbank rate contin-ued to reflect a very slight easing of monetary policy by the autumn. Generally, UK money markets were quiet, with dealers distracted by events on the Continent. They were also awaiting a string of official data due this week. The first of these, May's producer prices index, failed to move the markets in any way. One trader said that traders were preparing for a long, dull summer. German call money traded in a relatively broad span of 7.35/50 per cent yesterday as the market weighed up the chances of a cut in key Bundesbank interest rates to allay tensions in the EMS currency grid. At the end of last week, call money had been at 7.40/45 per cent. Dealers speculated that the central bank might alleviate pressure from the D-Mark's regained strength on other European currencies through a token cut in its repo rate, or even a reduction of the 8.25 per cent Lombard rate.</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Bakyrchik Gold falls Dollars 67,000 into red Bakyrchik Gold, which was floated in August to exploit a gold mine in Kazakhstan, reported a loss of Dollars 67,000 (Pounds 45,000) for the period since its incorporation in April to the end of September. The balance sheet shows cash of Dollars 12.5m, which is expected to be committed to the Bakyrchik Joint Venture with the Kazakhstan government by the end of the financial year in March. The Bakyrchik mine, in which BK Gold has 40 per cent and management control, has one of the world's biggest gold deposits with 28.1m tonnes of ore containing 9.1 grams of gold a tonne. The first gold to be delivered under the venture is expected next summer. Mr David Hooker, chairman, said yesterday that the company was upgrading the capacity of its plant for the first stage of the project from 100,000 tonnes per year of ore to 150,000 tonnes per year while remaining within the same budget. However, the average grade from the first ore to be processed would be 7.2 grams of gold per tonne - lower than the ore body average. A feasibility study for stage two of the project, under which 1m tonnes of ore a year would be processed, was well under way and was scheduled for completion in May. Stage two would be underpinned by the first stage, but shareholders would be asked for about Pounds 70m some time next year. Bakyrchik's share price yesterday closed 6p higher at 213p. The placing in August of 7.5m shares was priced at 120p, valuing the company at about Pounds 18m. Only five days later Chilewich, a New York-based trading organisation and joint owner, sold most of its 25 per cent stake. Minproc, the Australian resources and engineering group which was BK Gold's other joint owner, owns 23.7 per cent.</p>

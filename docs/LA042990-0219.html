			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STUDENTS PUT THROUGH WRINGER IN CITIZEN BEE;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: TOUGH QUESTIONS ON POLITICS AND GEOGRAPHY GIVE TEEN-AGERS A CHANCE  TO FLAUNT AN IN-DEPTH KNOWLEDGE THAT WOULD SILENCE MOST CRITICS.  </P> <P> It should have been a day of celebration for Tung Phan. Saturday marked his  10th year in the United States after fleeing the communists of his native  Vietnam. Saturday was also his 17th birthday.  </P> <P> And on Saturday, Tung participated in a nerve-racking competition against 20  other California high school students, answering tough questions about politics  and geography while seeking to win scholarship money and the chance to compete  in the nationwide Citizen Bee.  </P> <P> But Tung, who had endured 10 rounds of mind-probing questions, faltered on his  11th: Name the organization, founded in 1912, that is the largest national  organization for businesses, representing about 4.5 million members.  </P> <P> Tung, concentrating with his head bowed as if in prayer while the judges  awaited his answer, guessed, "The Kiwanis." The correct answer is the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce. As he stepped down from the stage, crestfallen, Tung  became the last of five students from Orange County to be eliminated from the  contest.  </P> <P> "Another chance next year," the junior from Kennedy High shrugged.  </P> <P> He finished in 10th place. First place in the state Citizen Bee was earned by  Everett Chun, a San Gabriel High student, who said he was "an average student  who believes in commitment" to studying. Everett won a $3,000 scholarship. The  top three winners will face students from all over the country in June in the  national Citizen Bee for even more scholarship money.  </P> <P> With education leaders complaining that high school students know more about  singer George Michael than they do about George Washington, the Citizen Bee  gave these students a chance to flaunt an in-depth knowledge that would silence  most education critics.  </P> <P> For each contestant, it meant hundreds of grueling hours of studying history,  economics, geography, government and current events. With the encouragement of  parents and the guidance of teachers, these 20 students emerged from 900  competitors throughout California in regional competitions in late March and  early April.  </P> <P> And after mastering everything from the French Revolution to the geographical  location of the Hawaiian Island, the 20 students put their intelligence to the  test. Seated on a stage in the Harry Chandler Auditorium in the downtown Los  Angeles Times building, they approached a microphone, lights shining in their  faces, and responded to questions. One by one, they were picked off by a single  tricky question or unfamiliar topic.  </P> <P> "It blasted my ego," said Mayumi Negishi , a senior at El Toro High. "At your  school, you think you're the best student. But the contest kind of put things  in perspective, seeing so many people who know so much. It's a little bit  humbling."  </P> <P> Mayumi floundered in the sixth round. The troubling question: What did Adam  Smith mean by the "invisible hand" that operates in market economies? The right  answer: Individuals who act out of self-interest.  </P> <P> Huell Howser, producer of KCET's "Videolog," asked students the questions from  the podium.  </P> <P> "I was a history major in college," Howser said. "And I knew about 70% of the  answers. The rest -- I didn't have a clue. It's amazing the depth of knowledge  that these students have."  </P> <P> The students were given special books to help them master the mounds of  historical and cultural tidbits asked in the contest. But many of the whiz  kids, refuting critics who complain about the quality of high school education,  said they learned almost all they know from their teachers.  </P> <P> "The background information from all my classes helped more than the book,"  Mayumi said.  </P> <P> For Tung, studying began in earnest when he was in the fourth grade. Of course,  he said, he didn't know then that he would one day test his knowledge against  some of the smartest students from throughout the state. He studied out of  personal interest. As a refugee who fled as a 7-year-old by boat from Vietnam,  Tung read five books in different languages about the Vietnam war. That, in  turn, sparked an interest in the history of his new country.  </P> <P> "Then I realized the contributions of our early fathers -- George Washington  and Abraham Lincoln," he said. "And I read more."  </P> <P> Dennis Ulrich and Mark Goldrup, both seniors from Mission Viejo High, stayed up  past midnight Friday with their teacher in a Los Angeles hotel, cramming for  Saturday's battery of questions. Unfortunately, they were asked about material  they hadn't studied in the early rounds.  </P> <P> Dennis was asked to name the author of "The Good Earth." The answer is Pearl  Buck. Mark was asked about the subject matter of Rachel Carson's book "Silent  Spring." He guess the answer was global warming, but the correct response was  the dangers of pesticides.  </P></p>

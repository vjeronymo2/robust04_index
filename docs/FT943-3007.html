			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Wilder quits US Senate race: Decision may hit Oliver North's hopes and let Democrat in Mr Douglas Wilder yesterday abruptly dropped out of the US senate race in Virginia, thus probably reducing the chances of victory for Mr Oliver North, the Republican candidate. The former Democratic governor, who was running as an independent, declined to endorse Senator Charles Robb, his long-time rival, in the November 8 election. But his departure from the race leaves Virginia's Democrats with the alternative of voting for Mr Robb or not at all. Had Mr Wilder stayed in, recent polls have suggested that Democratic divisions might have been enough to hand the race to Mr North, in spite of the presence of a second independent candidate, Mr Marshall Coleman, a former Republican state office holder. Mr Wilder's decision will come as an enormous relief to the White House and the national Democratic party, which is threatened with loss of control of the Senate. Virginia was among the 8 to 10 endangered seats that have threatened its 56-44 majority. Senior Republicans, including Senator Robert Dole, have begun to rally behind Mr North, setting aside reservations about his criminal conviction, overturned on a legal technicality, in the Iran-Contra affair while serving on President Ronald Reagan's national security council. Mr Wilder's statement, quoting a well known song, said: 'I know when to hold 'em and I know when to fold 'em.' It said, in effect, that he had concluded he could not win and that his low standing in the polls made it difficult to generate finances for his campaign. Two local polls this week underlined his problem. The first gave Mr Robb 33 per cent, Mr North 28 per cent, Mr Coleman 15 per cent and Mr Wilder 12 per cent, with the balance undecided. The second had Mr North in the lead with 34 per cent, followed by Mr Robb at 31 per cent, Mr Wilder 13 per cent and Mr Coleman 10 per cent. There may now be some pressure on Mr Coleman to withdraw to clear the field for the two main candidates. But his principal sponsor is Mr John Warner, Virginia's Republican senator, whose contempt for Mr North and his right-wing supporters is such that he persuaded Mr Coleman to run. The Robb-Wilder feud, a feature of Virginia politics for years, was behind Mr Wilder's decision to enter the Senate race shortly after his term as governor expired in January. It reached fever pitch two years ago when it was disclosed that the senator's aides had been bugging the governor's car telephone. Subsequent admissions by Mr Robb of sexual indiscretion did little to help his image.</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHERIFF'S SPENDING  </P> <P> It's about time that the Shirley Grindles of the world stop their whining  ("Gadfly Buzzing Gates Over His Political Funds," April 22). These people are  just political rabble-rousers with no understanding of what it takes to get  things done in Orange County, and I'm tired of reading about them.  </P> <P> Yes, Brad Gates spends lots of money on political meetings. But look what he's  gotten out of them: support is growing for a new jail, his advisory council has  donated almost a million dollars worth of new equipment and facilities to law  enforcement, and George Bush himself came to Orange County to get our sheriff's  advice on how to fight the drug war. And yes, Gates' wife is a hard-working  businesswoman, and they do have rich friends. So what? His friends are the  biggest employers in the county. We need the sheriff to enlist their support.  </P> <P> And yes, Brad Gates spent $9,000 over three or four years on his car phone.  That's next to nothing for a corporate CEO, many of whom manage companies that  are smaller than the Sheriff's Department. What is he supposed to do? Waste the  time he spends in his car? I've donated to Brad Gates for years; and as far as  I'm concerned, I would much rather have him making calls to win support for a  new jail, the narcotics training center at Rancho del Rio and other law  enforcement projects.  </P> <P> BILL WARMINGTON  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Shake-up comes as little surprise BRITISH COAL'S restructuring came as no surprise yesterday to most of the groups that have expressed an interest in acquiring the state-owned company. Most pointed out that the shape of the industry proposed was little different from that in a leaked report prepared last year by NM Rothschild, the merchant banker that is advising the government on the privatisation. East Midlands Electricity said: 'What is now required is an explanation of the government's intentions for the privatisation of the industry.' The company is part of a consortium that includes the Union of Democratic Mineworkers; Sir David White, the deputy chairman of NFC; and Mr George Guise, a former director of Consolidated Gold Fields. It is advised by Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank. RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, said it was a sad day for the mining communities, but potential purchasers now had a clearer idea of the future shape of the industry. Other groups that have expressed interest in acquiring some or all of British Coal also include Hanson, Anglo-United, the chemicals company that owns Coalite smokeless fuel, and the private coal companies Young Group, Ryan Group and Budge Mining. The consortium involving East Midlands Electricity said it was negotiating with both UK and foreign mining groups to find two and possibly three additional partners. It is proposing that Brit-ish Coal should be split into two groups. The southern one would include all fields up to and including South Yorkshire. The northern group would comprise the remaining pits. East Midlands Electricity said if a split proved impossible it was interested in the entire company.</p>

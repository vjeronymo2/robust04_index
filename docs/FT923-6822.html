			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Ferromet accounts qualified THE 1991 accounts of Ferromet Group, the USM-quoted metals trader, have been heavily qualified by Touche Ross, the group's auditor. The company's shares have been languishing at  1/2 p since July 17. In its report TR said: 'We are unable to form an opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the affairs of the company and the group at December 31 1991 . . . and whether the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.' The qualification hinged on uncertainty over Ferromet Resources Inc, the group's principal operating subsidiary in the US which was placed into Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings on March 17. This followed Ferromet Resources Inc's sale at the end of 1991 of Ferromet Resources (UK) and Ferromet Alloys, its two UK subsidiaries, to Ferromet Group, a transaction which, in view of the Chapter 11 proceedings, may be reversed. TR stated that it could 'express no opinion as to whether the going concern basis (of the group) is appropriate in these circumstances'. Following the problems at Ferromet Resources Inc, the group's profit and loss account for 1991 showed retained losses of Pounds 12.2m (profit Pounds 642,000) and its consolidated balance sheet showed negative shareholders' funds of Pounds 6.39m, a turnround of Pounds 12.8m. However, Mr David Hillel, finance director, pointed to the pro forma consolidated balance sheet in the accounts for the 'comparatively clean' rump of the group - Portsmouth Metals, the Bermuda-based metals trader, and Clogau (Nevada), a gold mine. Net assets here were Pounds 1.8m. Mr Roger Wain, who moved up from non-executive to executive chairman on August 10, said he was still seeking a partner to invest cash and/or businesses into the rump. Portsmouth had been profitable in the first half of 1992, and he was looking for a joint venture partner for Clogau. To sever ties between this rump and the Chapter 11 companies, provisions of Pounds 4.68m were taken. Mr Wain said that creditors' claims on the Chapter 11 companies could not be demanded of the parent group. Mr Larry Whyte, the chief executive, who brought Ferromet Resources Inc into the group and attempted a management buy-out in March 1991, is now to leave the group. He and the board have agreed that the group's claims on him and his on the group will be dropped, subject to shareholders' approval.</p>

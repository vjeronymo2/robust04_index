			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Italians protest against state TV changes A chorus of protest has greeted the reorganisation of the editorial management of the RAI, Italy's state broadcasting organisation, carried out by the appointees of the government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi. A group of prominent intellectuals and broadcasters have petitioned President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to intervene over what they claim are curbs on the freedom of expression. The opposition, headed by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), has protested that the government has tightened its hold on information; and unions working at the RAI have threatened to take court action against the management. One of the new board members, Mr Alfio Marchini, personally endorsed by the speaker of the chamber of deputies in the Italian parliament, has also resigned in protest. The reorganisation, completed on Tuesday, came almost 45 days after the first editorial changes were introduced and involved the removal of some personnel only recently appointed. Government supporters have justified the appointments and the overt political interference on the grounds that the RAI has always been politically controlled. The appointments involve programme controllers and channel director generals for the RAI's three TV channels. The populist Northern League, usually an opponent of its coalition colleagues on media matters, has been noticeably silent over the past 24 hours, not least because some of its appointees have gained a foothold and the third television channel will have a federal/regional framework. The complaints follow three main lines. The first is that the right-wing coalition government has deliberately placed its own sympathisers in the key positions, regardless of individual professional qualifications. The neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance has done well in securing a substantial foothold; but at the same time a number of persons once identified with Socialist leader Bettino Craxi and recycled as Forza Italia are back in power. A second line of complaint is that the financially troubled RAI risks being seriously weakened by the changes so aiding the competition - the three television channels of prime minister Berlusconi's Fininvest. This in turn raises the running sore of Mr Berlusconi's conflict of interest. The third issue concerns the absence of any independent control over state-run television. The management board is headed by Mrs Letizia Moratti, a prominent stockbroker brought in by the government. The board in turn is monitored by the parliamentary media committee that is dominated by the governing coalition.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News feature written by Reporter (Zhang Xingang): </F> "Applause and Hope"]    [Text] On the morning of 8 June, applause rang out  continuously at the auditorium of Jinan Prison when it was  announced at the third provincial congress of the  sentence-serving persons active in undergoing labor reform that  200 persons who rendered meritorious service would be awarded  citations for merit, and 72 persons would be released on parole,  be set free, or have their penalty reduced, the 250  representatives of sentence-serving persons active in undergoing  labor reform who were participating in this congress, responded  to the announcement with prolonged and warm applause. The  applause was filled with repentance for their past crimes and  with hope for their future.    (Jiang Lusheng), who was awarded a citation for merit at the  congress, clapped until his hands turned red, and his eyes were  moist with tears. Having been given a life sentence in 1983 on  the charge of larceny, today he truly experienced the value of  turning over a new leaf. When he was sent to jail, he was just  a graduate of a primary school. Over the past 11 years, at the  prison's school for training offenders, he assiduously accrued  knowledge and skills and was even invited to serve as senior  technician. During production and labor, he accomplished scores  of innovation achievements one after another, saved hundreds of  thousands in funds for the state, and created a miracle even  praised by foreign specialists. Hence, his term of imprisonment  has changed from life imprisonment to a set term of imprisonment.    (Liu Zhengxing), deputy director of the provincial judicial  department and political commissar of the provincial labor  reform bureau, said: There are many other activists like (Jiang  Lusheng). Since 1985, a total of 27,511 offenders in the  province have extricated themselves from the bounds of  illiteracy in prison, and 72,761 offenders have obtained the  certificates of technology of various grades issued by labor  departments.    A prodigal who returns is more precious than gold. As said  by (Li Fengde), head of the provincial labor reform bureau, some  of the many offenders who were released after serving the  sentence have been employed as state cadres and plant directors  and managers, and some of them have been elected people's  congress deputies and members of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference. (Wang Zenglin), former offender at the  no. 3 provincial prison, has seized 27 law violators and  criminals after leaving the prison and has become rich through  hard work, thus being elected as the advanced laborer of the  state and commended in Beijing.    Wang Yuxi, vice governor of the province, said excitedly at  the congress: In providing employment, the party and the  government have treated the persons released after serving the  sentence without discrimination. So long as these persons are  reformed satisfactorily and are furnished with appropriate  knowledge and proficient skills, they will be well received by  society after serving the sentence. On hearing this, the  audience burst into prolonged and warm applause once more again.</p>

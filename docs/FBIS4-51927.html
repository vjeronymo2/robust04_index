			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Koichi Hamade, professor of Yale University: </F> "What Should Japan Do After Saying, `No'?"]    [Excerpts] Japan-U.S. Trade negotiation broke down  with Prime Minister Hosokawa saying "No." The United States has  now begun to make clear their policy to promote national  interests, implying their plan to execute some "retaliatory  measures." How can the two nations escape from playing a poker  game?  <H5>  Potential Problem of Voluntary Increase of Imports </H5>   [passage omitted] While trade negotiation is a economic  phenomenon, it is also a complex phenomenon in which politics  and economics are entwined when we consider the fact that it is  an international political negotiation, and that it concerns  each participating country's domestic political balance.    First, let's look at the economic aspect. The United States  has been asking that Japan should open up its market,  specifically the product and the service markets, in order to  solve Japan-U.S. trade imbalance which has reached $60 billion.  Despite Japanese Government's repeated promises to open up its  market, Japanese import of U.S. products had not increased. The  United States demanded Japan to set an import target (or quota).  This concerned mainly the automobile, auto parts, medical  equipment, communications, and the insurance fields.    In regards to this request, Japan's position was that  setting  a quota would create a managed trade and did not agree with the  principle of free trade. The Hosokawa dministration was working  toward easing the governmental control, and they could not agree  to setting an import quota which would necessitate reinforcement  of governmental control.    Viewed in the light of trade theory, Japanese Government's  argument is correct. In order for the principle of market to  work effectively, it is necessary for buyers to be able to  consider the quality, price, delivery, after-sale service, and  choose the most advantageous products or services. It is totally  against the principle of free trade, which promotes effective  production using prices as a type of signal, to set a import  target of how many percent of auto parts should be imported from  the United States.    If regulations of the central or regional governments, or a  collusion of industrial organizations or corporate groups are  preventing Japanese consumers from purchasing economical and  diverse consumer goods and services, or if corporations are  kept from importing products that are advantageous for them,  such regulations and collusion must be removed. The tariff and  non-tariff barriers must be removed. However, voluntry export  controls which limit the amount of export from Japan, and the  voluntary import-boosting program which sets a quota on Japan's  import, completely oppose the principle of free trade which  helps worldwide distribution of resources by encouraging each  country to make effort in providing products and services  efficiently.    Furthermore, voluntary import-boosting program could create  more problems than voluntary export controls. In the case of  voluntary export controls, manufacturers put restraint on  production by themselves. This is not desirable, considering the  nation's distribution of resources; however, at least the  production is done by efficient combination of production  factors to produce a certain quantity. But, when there is a  quota to fulfill in the quantity of imported parts to be used,  they may have to use inferior parts also, thus the efficiency of  production itself is hindered.    In addition, there is no principle found anywhere in the  world trade which consists of many countries that equilibrium of  the balance of trade between two countries should be maintained.  It is not strange that a country, such as Japan, which has  little natural resources, has a deficit in the trade with a  country rich with national resources, such as Australia, and has  a surplus in the trade with an advanced country, such as the  United States. Lester Thoreaw, in the interview with THE NEW  YORK TIMES said that he had a trade deficit with his barber and  stationary stores.    It is based on such understanding on economics, that a group  of U.S. economists, including Jagdish Bhagwati, Hugh Patrick,  and Gary Saxonhouse, sent an autograph letter (the author of  this article also signed it) to Japanese Government to warn them  not to agree to the U.S. Government's request for voluntary  import-boosting program easily, and that a group of Japanese  economists (representative: Kazuo Ueda, professor of Tokyo  University) also issued a similar statement.    The U.S. reaction was as follows: They understood Japan's  position based on the principle of free trade. Under the  Republican administration, the United States had demanded Japan  remove tariff and non-tariff barriers. Notwithstanding that  Japanese Government had promised cooperation in this matter, in  reality, however, there were no visible results concerning  opening of the market. As an intimidatory strategy, the United  States has decided to demand Japan to set a quota--according to  President Clinton, to make Japan agree to quantitative and  qualitative standard (indicator or criterion). Since their  regular tactics did not work, they are hoping that Japan's  closed door may open with imposition of quota.  <H5>  The Structure of "Double-Layer Game" </H5>   The trade negotiation must also be looked at from  politicoeconomic point of views. Trade negotiation is generally  understood as an attempt by representatives from two countries  to solve a conflict of interests between the two countries, each  trying to make it more advantageous for his own country.  However, it does not mean that the nations concerned have  definite national interests. There are complex interests, such  as the interests of export industry, the interests of import  industry, and interests of consumers. For this reason, when we  look at a trade negotiation as a game, the game between two  governments are played on the ground of domestic games of  conflict of interests. In this sense a trade negotiation has a  structure of "double-layer game."    Naturally, domestic political situations put limits on how  far the government can compromise with the other government. On  the other hand, international negotiations can influence the  domestic political balance in a subtle way. The recent breakdown  of Japan-U.S. negotiation must be understood in the light of  domestic political balance in the two countries.    As mentioned in the beginning of this article, although  President Clinton has many problems both domestically and  internationally, the U.S. economy has been recovering smoothly.  However, the rate of economic recovery varies regionally, and  recovery of California and New England is slow. Also in this  recovery, the production and the consumption may be increasing,  but unemployment rate is still high due to rationalization by  reduction of labor force. President Clinton hoped to score  points by succeeding in Japan-U.S. trade negotiation, but this  did not happen. The opposition party, Republicans, did not  opposed to Clinton's policy to demand Japan to open the market,  though they did not agree to managed trade, Clinton's position  would not have been any easier domestically even if the  Japan-U.S. talks reached a compromise.    Prime Minister Hosokawa is backed by a very shaky coalition  government. In any country, the interests of manufacturers are  more likely to become a political pressure than the interests of  consumers. However, this tendency is especially strong in Japan.  (Refer to the author's book From My Study Room at Yale  University published from NTT Press in 1993.) The customs  tariff is low; however, the Japanese manufacturers have been  cordially protected in various ways, such as import restriction  of agricultural products symbolized by the rice issue,  overprotection on financial and securities, and insurance  industries, the closedness of construction industry seen in the  `dango' [bid-rigging by collusion], the recession cartel, and  regulation of air, rail road, and bus fares.    There is International Finance Bureau in both the Ministry  of  Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of  International Trade and Industry has International Policy  Bureau, and the Economic Planning Agency has Economic Welfare  Bureau. These bureaus reflect both directly and indirectly the  pressures from outside, as well as the consumers' position.  However, the traditional Japanese Government has reflected the  manufacturers' interests of certain industries more strongly, as  indicated in the term "genkyoku" [principle bureaus]. The  Hosokawa administration set out a policy to ease bureaucratic  regulations and to reflect consumer interests. The  administration has begun to take action favorable for consumers  in handling the issue of importing rice, which had been a  difficult political problem.    In addition to the conflict between consumers and  manufacturers in Japan, the United States is watching the power  relationship between Japanese politicians and the bureaucracy.  Some (for example UCLA's Dr. Rosenberg say that politicians are  more powerful in Japan also, citing the MOF's banking and  securities agreement as an example. Others (for example Junko  Kato of Tokyo University) say that the introduction of consumer  tax, which was unpopular among the people as well as  politicians, was possible because the bureaucrats were able to  manipulate politicians, using their expert knowledge and skills.  In this sense, the intricacies of the current economic policy  are interesting. In collaboration with Prime Minister Hosokawa's  income tax reduction policy, it was the MOF that suggested to  raise the consumption tax to 7 percent in 1997. However, the  Social Democratic Party of Japan, the main party of the  coalition, opposed to this plan and the tax raise did not come  through. This gave the impression that politicians may have  influence. However, upon discovering that the tax reduction is  only for one year, I realized just how strong the bureaucrats'  power is.    What we must pay attention is that voluntary export controls  and voluntary import-boosting program have different domestic  interests structures. First, let me explain the voluntary export  controls. Politically, it is easier for exporting companies to  approve voluntary export controls. Unlike being imposed a custom  duty on by a foreign government or meeting a minimum import  quota, the exporters can expect to monopolize profits by  restricting production. Consumers abroad will suffer, but their  voice is weak. The reason many countries often agree to  voluntary export controls is that the incentive mechanism  described above is at work.    On the other hand, in the case of voluntary import-boosting  program, it is difficult to find a group that benefits from  voluntary import-boosting program, no matter how strongly  foreign exporters demand it. When imports increase, the price of  imported products declines. This is beneficial for the Japanese  consumers. However, the logic of imposing an import quota, that  regardless of how effective or ineffective the products are, it  will be beneficial for the consumers, is quite indirect. A  simple and specific request for deregulation, such as "Remove  the trade restrictions" is more effective in appealing to the  consumers. Just as voluntary export controls, voluntary  import-boosting program requires intervention of the supervisory  office as well. However, they probably do not like to intervene,  knowing that it will not be profitable for the industry, even  though they are used to controlling and giving governmental  guidance. One of the causes of the trade negotiation breakdown  was that there were no incentives in voluntary import-boosting  program as in voluntary export controls.  <H5>  The Process Toward "Adult Relationship" </H5>   People in the United States tend to exercise what they  insisted regardless of the other party's situation. Now that the  trade negotiation has ruptured, they will try to impose some  kind of sanctions on Japan. We can see this in the custom duty  on Japanese car phones. This action was taken as a measure  responding to Motorola's appeal to restrict Japanese car phones  export. In addition, there have been other sanctions reported,  such as import restriction on several Japanese products by means  of custom duty, and restriction on Japanese corporations'  investment in the export bonded processing area. Furthermore,  they have named dozens of Japanese corporations as their target  of sanction. Upon returning to Japan, Prime Minister Hosokawa  and those close to him clearly stated that if the United States  should take sanction against Japan, Japan would retaliate, or  appeal to GATT.    As U.S. newspapers report, the Clinton administration wants  to open up Japanese market by strongly pressuring Japan.  However, they are racking their brains as to how to avoid a  trade war between the two countries and to keep both countries  from falling into the undesirable protected trade situation  ("Prisoner's dilemma"--Refer to the Note). Prime Minister  Hosokawa must share the feeling.    Note: "Prisoner's dilemma" means that if  each of the two prisoners, who had been confined separately,  cooperated and did not confess their crime, both of them will be  cleared of the charge. However, if one confessed and the other  did not, the one who confessed will be pardoned, and the one who  did not will be convicted. This situation is a dilemma for both  of the prisoners. Since they are both afraid that the other may  confess, they both may end up confessing their crime.    The battle between Japan and the United States resembles a  poker game. Both countries are trying to threaten each other  with retaliatory measures in case of betrayal, waiting for the  other to give up, each trying to reach a solution which is  advantageous to its national interests. However, this game is in  vain if trade negotiation come to a breakdown. For the United  States, which dealt with international relationship as if  playing a game, the recent trade negotiations have been like  walking on a tight rope. It is also a very difficult situation  for Japan, which has been like a brother to the United States  and has been used to cooperating with the United States.    However, what is fortunate for both countries is that trade  will continue, and the trade negotiation will also take place  again. If it were a one time game, it will be highly possible  that both countries to be in the "prisoner's dilemma" because  their distrust in each other may make them betray each other.  But since the game will continue, they may try to cooperate,  fearing each others retaliatory measures in the future. These  strategic reasons and the trust relationship between the leaders  of the two nations bring a ray of hope in the future of  Japan-U.S. economy.    As the prime minister himself has said, the last summit  meeting can be understood as a process in which Japan-U.S.  relationship is changing from the "big brother - little brother  relationship" to "equal adults relationship." The United States  was irritated that the obedient little brother would not do what  he promised while saying "We understand" concerning the U.S.  request to open up its market. Now Japan has begun to say, "We  have grown up now. We would like to negotiate as equals. We  cannot give away to the United States concerning the free trade  principle." The United States told Japan to speak up clearly as  they themselves do, but when Japan did just that, they did not  like it.    The growing pain is necessary for Japanese economic  diplomacy. When we see fast speaking Clinton in a press  conference or watch a discussion between Mr. Buchanan and Mr.  Saxonhouse, (ex-presidential candidates), on CNN (Cross Fire),  we come to realize that Japanese politicians must improve their  communications skill in order to share the world leadership.  However, though he did not use many words, Prime Minister  Hosokawa clearly declaraed his intention and that seemed to have  given a favorable impression on people in the United States. He  was especially persuasive when he said, "I am fighting with the  bureaucratic restrictions in Japan. I cannot agree to the  quantitative quota which would require industrial restrictions."  President Clinton sounded rather defensive when he said, "The  United States is not demanding a quantitative quota. We are  merely requesting establishment of objective quantitative and  qualitative criteria which can indicate the degree of openness  of the market."    As the idea of Japan that can say "No" takes roots, a  meaningful and clear communications style will be understood  more and more.  <H5>  Unpredictable Future Situations </H5>   Changing the subject, let's discuss the balance between the  exchange rate and the macroeconomics.    The news of collapse of Japan-U.S. trade negotiation created  a stir in the world financial market, and stock prices in Japan  fell sharply. Especially, the yen rate soared by as much as 4  percent in a day. Because they failed to set a quantitative  quota, high yen rate is the only way to diminish the trade  imbalance. Therefore, the market reacted on the prediction that  the U.S. Government will take measures to approve or promote a  high exchange rate of the yen. When cheap dollar was expected,  there was the fear that the number of purchasers of treasury  bills will decrease. Thus the short-term interest rate also rose  in the United States.    However, it is doubtful whether intervention in the exchange  market by Japanese or the U.S. Governments will be able to  control the yen rate. But, the reaction of the exchange market  is understandable because now that Japan must expand its economy  even more after the collapse of trade talks in order to reduce  their trade surplus, and this will lead to higher interest rates  and bring about the yen's higher exchange rate.    We should also pay attention that under the floating  exchange  rate system, the effect of financial and monetary policies is  different from that of the fixed exchange rate system. Under the  fixed exchange rate system, both an expansive monetary policy  and an expansive financial policy would stimulate the domestic  economy and reduce the surplus balance of current revenue and  expenditure, (and where movement of the capital is allowed, a  financial policy would work more effectively). On the contrary,  under the floating exchange rate system, while an expansionary  monetary policy may help expand the domestic economy, it may  also increase the surplus because of the lowered interest rates  and the cheap yen.    On the other hand, an expansionary financial policy may help  reduce the surplus through higher interest rate and the yen's  high exchange rate, but it may not help the economic recovery.  Japan needs to expand its fiscal policy in order to reduce the  surplus balance of current revenue and expenditure, and it needs  easing of monetary and financial policies for economic recovery.    Incidentally, it was interesting to watch the progress of  their tax reduction proposal in the light of macroeconomic  effect. The income tax reduction would increase consumers'  disposable income and is effective for stimulating the economy.  However, if the consumtion tax raise is planned for three years  later, the constant income, which indicates the consumers'  average income toward the future, would not rise very much and  the stimulant effect would not be very strong.    However, those who predict that prices will go up in three  years may try to buy up durable consumer goods. If this bill had  passed, it would have been an interesting experiment to see how  well this type of stimulating effect might have worked. This  bill turned out to be only a one-year tax reduction bill. The  constant income will change little, and the stimulant effect on  the economy will be very weak.    Acting as an adult means that there are some  responsibilities  to fulfill. Now that Japan has refused the quantitative quota,  it must strongly declare that it will increase access to  Japanese market from outside in some other ways. This should  lead to the welfare of Japanese consumers. At present, it is  unpredictable as to what kind of sanctions and retaliatory  measures will be repeated between Japan and the United States.  Will their action result in going against the world's free trade  trend? There is no knowing whether the two adults will come to  an agreement and escape the "prisoner's dilemma."  <H5>  The Policy Japan Should Take </H5>   Thinking about the matter calmly, it is hard to believe that  there is an impossible gap to overcome between the interests of  the two nations.    First, let's look at the industries at issue. Since Prime  Minister Hosokawa's policy is to ease restrictions, he must  theoretically be for reducing the interests of the government  agencies, (Ministry of Health and Welfare, Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications, and Ministry of Finance), that oversee  medical equipment, communications, insurance industries, and  their supporting industries. Internationally insisting on free  trade, Mr. Hosokawa must make serious efforts to remove the  non-tariff barrier created by government restrictions. It is a  good opportunity for him to take advantage of the collapse of  the international negotiation, which is a semi-emergency  situation, to overcome the domestic conflict of interests.    Second, since Japan has been troubled by a recession for a  long time, its attempt to solve the imbalance of current revenue  and expenditure will not create a zerosome situation for the two  countries. This is because recovery of Japanese economy through  macroeconomic policy will at the same time help reduce Japan's  trade surplus with the United States.    As I mentioned earlier, financial expenditure and tax  reduction are effective in reducing the surplus of the current  revenue and expenditure balance. However, these would cause the  yen's exchange rate to rise and might turn into be a recession  creating pressure. An easy-money policy may help stimulate the  economy but may cause the yen to become cheap and increase the  surplus of current balance. A desirable "policy mix" of macro  policy is to reduce tax--not just one year--and if this begins  to cause a high interest rates and high yen rates, to ease  monetary policy, (of course, if cheap yen situation should  progress, or if the available employment competition rate  exceeds one, Bank of Japan is responsible to enforce monetary  restraint and avoid reviving the "bubble economy").    Of course, the cause of the current account deficit of the  United States is its financial deficit and the low savings rate  of the public. Japanese Government needs to continue to point  this out to the United States. Some say that the government  deficit and the current account deficit have not been linked  together in the past few years. Even if this was true, the  deficit should be blamed on the low savings rate of the public,  the tax system which should promote saving, and the economic  policy.    It is a good news that Japan is growing to be able to say  "No" in the international society. However, it is not easy to be  responsible for what has been clearly said. This is evident in  the fact that the United States is strongly demanding Japan to  meet the "reasonable criteria" which Prime Minister Miyazawa  vaguely agreed to. Japanese economic diplomacy needs to gain  strength which is both firm and flexible--sometimes being angry  and sometimes using humor to dodge the other's attack--so that  avoid simply submitting to foreign countries' (traditionally the  United States) will, and at the same time, avoid upsetting the  other party and causing a breakdown of negotiation.</p>

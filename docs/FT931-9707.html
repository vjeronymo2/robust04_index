			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Delhi bans rally by BJP to avoid clashes THE Indian government, which is struggling to restore political calm after the recent inter-religious violence, yesterday banned a planned mass rally by the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party. The BJP, whose supporters sparked the unrest after they stormed the Ayodhya mosque, replied by pledging to go ahead with the gathering on February 25. The party claims the rally could attract 1m people. The government's decision and the BJP's defiant response could raise political tensions and undermine ministers' efforts to get over the Ayodhya crisis. Mr S B Chavan, home minister, said the BJP's demand for a rally was 'dangerous' and 'provocative' at a time of inter-religious tensions. The party's failure to prevent the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque 'inspired little confidence that the rally would be peaceful'. The BJP retorted by condemning the government's 'fascist tendencies'. It said party leaders would meet today to plan ways to continue with the rally. Party leaders may go on hunger strike to gather public sympathy. Later yesterday Mr Chavan extended the ban to all political rallies in the capital for a few months. The BJP's aim is to force the government to hold elections in the four northern states where BJP governments were sacked, after the mosque was stormed on December 6, and central rule was imposed.</p>

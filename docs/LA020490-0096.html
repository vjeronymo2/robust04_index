			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE SEVEN LAMPS OF ARCHITECTURE BY JOHN RUSKIN (DOVER:  $8.95, ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> Originally planned as a study of the Gothic style, "The Seven Lamps of  Architecture" (1849) emerged as a treatise combining religion, economics,  morality and aesthetics.  </P> <P> (The "Lamps" in the title represent principles that Ruskin believed were  essential to good architecture.) Although his convoluted, Victorian prose may  put off modern readers, Ruskin's arguments remain cogent. Los Angeles circa  1990 would undoubtedly move him to despair. What other city so carelessly  violates the tenet of the Lamp of Memory, "There are two duties respecting  national architecture whose importance it is impossible to overstate: the  first, to render the architecture of the day historical; and, the second, to  preserve, as the most precious of inheritances, that of past ages"?  </P></p>

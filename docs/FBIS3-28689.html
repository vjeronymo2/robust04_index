			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 9 KYODO -- Japan plans to issue a  record 36.53 trillion yen in government bonds in the coming  fiscal year, up 6.61 trillion yen from its plan in the initial  fiscal 1993 budget, the Finance Ministry said Wednesday [9  February]. That will break the record 29.92 trillion yen  initially planned for the current fiscal year ending March 31,  said a ministry official.    The government boosted its bond issuance plan for fiscal  1993  to 37.79 trillion yen through two sets of extra budgets and is  to increase it further with a third one slated for release  Thursday. The fiscal 1994 forecast includes deficit-covering  bonds but their amount will not be officially decided until a  cabinet meeting Thursday morning, the official said.    Government bond issuance in the private sector is expected  to  rise 7.56 trillion yen in fiscal 1994 from this fiscal year's  initial plan to 28.76 trillion yen, but the total amount  digested by the public sector will likely dip by 95 billion yen  to 7.77 trillion yen, the report said. It forecast the amount  of government bonds placed in public auction will climb by 4.36  trillion yen to 16.56 trillion yen, with big increases in both  four and six-year issues for which the official cited strong  demand.    But despite the inflated supply of bonds in the market, the  ministry official said there was "no big concern" over rising  rates as the economy remains stagnant and credit policy remains  loose.    The dip in public-sector handling of bonds will result from  a  1.70 trillion yen drop to 3.69 trillion yen by the ministry's  trust fund bureau, as its ability to buy bonds is restricted by  tight budgets, the official said. But he said the ministry has  sought the help of underwriting syndicates to pick up the slack,  with the report saying their purchases will rise 3.20 trillion  yen to 12.20 trillion yen.    Purchases by the Bank of Japan should rise 2.62 trillion yen  to 2.82 trillion yen as it rolls over expiring issues in its  holdings.</p>

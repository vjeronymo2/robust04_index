			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Banks may 'net' liquidation debts Banks and other financial institutions may 'net' their debts to each other for calculating how much is owed to creditors when one goes into liquidation, the Financial Law Panel said yesterday. There had been concerns that insolvency practitioners would try to recover in full the sums outstanding under swaps contracts but would refuse to honour countervailing swaps owing to the same counterparty. The guidance note issued by the FLP says sums owed and borrowed may be netted against each other in calculating total exposure.</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCIETY: SAN DIEGO OPERA ASSN. ENDS SEASON ON A VIENNESE NOTE  </P> <P> Iris Strauss said she designed the dinner preceding Saturday's opening night  performance of "The Magic Flute" to capture some of the surrealistic nuances of  the sets and costumes designed by artist Maurice Sendak.  </P> <P> In fact, the sense of anticipation among the 220 guests assembled in the  Versailles Room at the Westgate Hotel rose to such a pitch that, had she chosen  to pursue a line of Mozartian mischief, dinner chairman Strauss could have  followed the opera's story line and served water and stone rather than wine and  salmon without provoking too much of a commotion.  </P> <P> As it was, the poached salmon with cucumbers and the apple strudel, both nods  to the German overtones of the piece, went over well. Because of the 7 p.m.  curtain at the Civic Theatre, guests were forced to sit down at 5:30 p.m., a  dinner hour that many of them found sufficiently surrealistic in itself.  </P> <P> In the midst of the sedate glee that pervaded the ballroom and foyer, San Diego  Opera Assn. President Esther Burnham, nearing retirement after three years in  the post, said she felt a touch of melancholy -- not that she blamed it on  Mozart.  </P> <P> "I'm always sad at the end of a season, and especially this year since it's the  end of our 25th anniversary season," she said. "But Ian (opera general director  Ian Campbell) planned very well for the occasion by scheduling an opera that  would send all of us home happy."  </P> <P> For his part, Campbell expressed utter satisfaction with the close of his  seventh season as general director.  </P> <P> "Tonight's opera is a superb way for us to close," said Campbell. "It's been  our most successful season ever, and the San Diego Opera is on a roll, there's  no doubt about that. The 25th anniversary season was given a great boost by  opening with "Boris Godunov" and the Soviet Arts Festival, and tonight is a  great finish. I couldn't be more pleased."  </P> <P> Campbell spoke to the crowd during dinner and exhorted it not to behave too  well at the performance. "We had 2,000 schoolchildren at the final dress  rehearsal the other night," he said, adding, "They raised the roof, and I want  you to do the same."  </P> <P> The evening was a long one for some of the guests (many of whom observed  Campbell's prohibition of inhibitions and loudly exhibited their pleasure with  the performance), since a number were invited to a post-opera cast party at a  Banker's Hill home. Among those invited to join "Magic Flute" stars Hei-Kyung  Hong and Denes Gulyas for an hour of Viennese gemutlichkeit were weight-loss  magnate Jenny Craig and her husband, Sid; Opera Assn. President-elect Steven  Wall with Franne Ficara; Wendy McBride with Dennis Muckerman; Arlene and Newt  Pollock; Dorene and John Whitney; Trude and Hermann Zillgens; Lee and Frank  Goldberg, Irene Allis, Mary and James Hickey, and Marion Bateson.  </P> <P> The guest list at the Westgate dinner included Joan and Irwin Jacobs, Patty and  Dan Evatts, Matt Strauss, Barbara and Neil Kjos, Allison and Robert Price,  Shelia Davis with Larry Lawrence, Sophie and Arthur Brody, Sandra and Douglas  Pay, Lee and P. J. Maturo, Charmaine and Maury Kaplan, and Athena and Charles  May.  </P> <P> The calendar has been a little slow of late, and one reason may be that many  are catching a bit of breath before plunging into the planned social maelstrom  that, if it goes according to schedule, will make the last 10 days of April  seem like one endless party. Just why this decade of days should be so crowded  with events is unclear, but it is a schedule that offers something for anyone  who wants to go out to support a cause, or simply to share a dance floor with a  crowd of like-minded souls.  </P> <P> This miniature social season starts April 21 with the 1990 University Ball, the  first-ever gala fund-raiser to be given for the newly founded California State  University, San Marcos. University President Bill Stacy will serve as honorary  chair, and the evening will honor Carol Cox, chairman of the sponsoring  President's Advisory Council. The reception in the ballroom at the Rancho  Bernardo Inn will begin at 6:30 p.m. and will be followed by dinner and  dancing. Tickets to the black tie event cost $125 per person; for further  information, telephone the university.  </P> <P> Four men have been invited to break the gender barrier that excluded men from  participation in the first 15 annual "Spirit of San Diego" fashion luncheons  given by La Jolla's All Hallows Women's Guild. The 16th such event, titled "The  Way We Are!" will be given April 26 in the Aventine Ballroom at the Hyatt  Regency and will honor 42 community volunteers from as many organizations,  including Mercy Hospital Foundation President James Mulvaney and San Diego Boys  and Girls Clubs President Michael Alessio. The luncheon will open with an 11  a.m. reception, to be followed by lunch and a fashion show to be coordinated by  Neiman Marcus West Coast fashion director David Cardoza. Tickets to the event  cost $45 per person; for further information, call the All Hallows Catholic  Church office.  </P> <P> Also on April 26, the first annual "Tradition of Caring" award dinner will be  held in the Marina Ballroom at the San Diego Marriott under the sponsorship of  the Central Advisory Board of the Salvation Army in San Diego County. Banker  Robert Adelizzi and his wife, Tommi, will receive the first "Tradition of  Caring" award in recognition of their community service, and guests at the  black tie-optional dinner will be entertained by the San Diego Master Chorale.  The evening will commence with a reception at 6:30 p.m. Tickets cost $125 per  person; for further information, call the Salvation Army.  </P> <P> The week will draw to a frantic close Saturday, April 28, when three major  galas and several dinner dances will compete to draw the largest attendance.  </P> <P> The longest-running of these, the annual "Celebrities Cook for the UCSD Cancer  Center," will present its ninth version as "A Feast of Flowers" and will open  with an elaborate presentation of hors d'oeuvres prepared by seven professional  women chefs and as many amateurs, all also women.  </P> <P> Among the professionals will be Evan Kleiman of the Angeli Caffe in Los  Angeles, Anne Rosenzweig of Arcadia in New York and Joyce Goldstein of San  Francisco's Square One. Dinner and dancing will follow the tasting. Tickets to  the black tie event, which will begin with a 7 p.m. reception and will be given  in the Champagne Ballroom at the Sheraton Harbor Island, cost $200, $350 and  $500 per person; for further information, call the UCSD Cancer Center.  </P> <P> The San Diego Regional Board of the National Kidney Foundation of Southern  California will present the eighth annual "Orient Express Gala" on April 28th  in the Grand Ballroom of the U.S. Grant hotel.  </P> <P> As always, this formal event will take a fantasy excursion aboard the "The King  of Trains and Train of Kings" as its theme, and the program and dinner will  suggest a journey from London to Istanbul. Tickets cost $250, $500 and $1,000  per person, and guests are invited to substitute 1920s attire for black tie.  The gala will begin at 7 p.m.; for further information, call the Kidney  Foundation.  </P> <P> Also on April 28, the University of San Diego will stage its annual USD Deans'  Ball at the San Diego Hilton.  </P></p>

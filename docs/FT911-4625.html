			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / EBRD: Reconstruction bank takes off into a fog - The EBRD is launched but what its business will be is something of a mystery THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the London-based international institution charged with helping the economic and political regeneration of eastern Europe, is now officially open for business. But quite what will be its business is still something of a mystery even after the three-day inaugural meeting which ended in London yesterday. The issue may be clarified later this week once the bank's board of directors - charged with the hands-on running of the bank - ends the meeting it is due to start today. It will begin the task of establishing the bank's operating and lending criteria. The picture will become even clearer when the position of vice-president in charge of the bank's all-important merchant banking division has been filled. Without this individual (who must be American) in place, the shape of the division responsible for 60 per cent of the bank's activities will not be apparent. Despite this, the bank has aroused strong feelings for such a youthful institution and many appear already to have written it off. Hostility was initially stirred by what appeared to outsiders to be an Anglo-French conspiracy which gave the bank a French president and settled it in London. Many question whether its president, Mr Jacques Attali, is the man for the job. A man of ideas and an attractive figure to some, but regarded by others as arrogant, he is emphatically not a banker, and freely admits it. He says he can hire bankers - although the senior people so far hired are overwhelmingly from the public sector in west and east Europe. Mr Attali's high-flown vision of the bank seems in conflict with the more prosaic view of its role outlined by some of its 41 shareholders - 39 governments together with the European Community and the European Investment Bank. Mr Attali and his mentor, President Francois Mitterrand, speak of the bank as the first pan-European organisation: the seed corn of a greater Europe stretching from Dublin to Moscow. The US and others would prefer it to concentrate on a narrower role of encouraging the development of the market economy and bolstering democracies in the region. Mr Attali yesterday denied any conflict of views about the institution. He said its role was defined by the articles of association, of which he was the chief architect. There was, he neglected to say, a battle-royal last year over these articles as shareholders, led by the US, impressed on the bank their desire not to let Mr Attali have a free hand. These negotiations gave the shareholders, as represented by the board of directors, a strong role in the day-to-day running of the bank. They also resulted in the bank having a 60-40 split between lending to the private and the public sector sectors. More precisely, the bank must devote 60 per cent of its resources in the early years to the commercial sector - that is, private businesses and those still in the state sector but are being privatised. Forty per cent will be devoted to infrastructure. Both decisions, taken against Mr Attali's wishes, give rise themselves to potential difficulties. An active board means a large part of the running costs of the bank will be devoted to keeping the 23-strong board - larger than the World Bank's - in permanent place in London. In addition, the strictures of the bank will limit its infrastructure lending, the area in which, according to some observers, eastern Europe's needs are greatest. Shareholders have also expressed concern that the bank should not interfere with the operations of other multilateral institutions in east Europe. The International Monetary Fund is providing balance of payments support, the World Bank project finance and help for economic sector reform, while its sister institution, the International Finance Corporation, is helping with the private sector. The European Investment Bank is also providing project finance, while private financial advisers from the City of London and elsewhere are in evidence all over the region. Mr Attali speaks of the importance of technical assistance, but there is little technical experience in the bank and that would involve hiring consultants. He also stresses the bank's individuality in its lending rules: conditions for lending will depend on political as well as economic criteria. He speaks of a 'hierarchy of deterrence' against countries who regress in either political or economic terms. The bank is also the one multilateral organisation to be able to lend to the Soviet Union - although in a strictly limited fashion to start with. But the political and economic disintegration of the Soviet state makes this seem like a less attractive prospect than it did even a year ago.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Carlo Rossella: "Keep Your Mouth Shut; the Enemy </F> Is Watching You!"]    [Text] Is everyone against Italy? Not exactly:  Clinton and Kohl have adopted a wait-and-see attitude; Mitterand  is putting his thoughts in writing; Israel is divided on the  subject; and Lady Thatcher offers advice. Following the  controversial vote in Strasbourg, here is an analysis of some of  the expressions of hostility, praise, and fear emanating from  our allies.    In the diplomatic jargon of Washington it is called a  "one-man memo" [preceding two words in English]--a report  drafted by one person. The title of the approximately 50-page  document is quite unambiguous: "The Neofascist Peril in Italy  and in Europe." It was written by an official of the State  Department shortly before the 27 March elections. The pamphlet  never reached the top levels of the U.S. foreign policy  establishment--i.e., the offices of Secretary of State Warren  Christopher and his deputy Strobe Talbott--but it was read and  reread by many government officials. The aforementioned analyst  maintained that although Gianfranco Fini's party has changed its  name it is still in the mainstream of the European far Right,  which is revanchist, neopopulist, and hostile to the values of  the democratic west.    The analyst's report was presumably compiled from  information  obtained in Rome and in Washington based on CIA intelligence or  on some of the numerous essays published in the United States  following Vladimir Zhirinovsky's victory in the Russian  elections. It is quite possible that the report will reach Bill  Clinton's desk before Clinton's two trips to Italy. The American  president will visit Rome on 2 and 3 June to celebrate the  allied landings at Anzio, and he will be in Italy again from 8  to 10 July for the G-7 summit in Naples. In only three  weeks--when Clinton makes his first visit--Silvio Berlusconi  will learn whether the campaign of the hostile press--and the  pressures from liberal circles and diplomats abroad--have had an  effect on the president of the United States. Neither the White  House--nor, for that matter, the U.S. embassy in Rome, headed by  the able Reginald Bartholomew--has subscribed to the fears and  denunciations expressed by representatives of other allied  countries at the inclusion, in the cabinet, of members of the  National Alliance. Bartholomew has, however, told a high-ranking  official of the Italian Government that it would be very  embarrassing for Clinton to commemorate the bloody battle of  Anzio--which the Americans fought against the Nazi troops in  January 1944--in the presence of the heirs of Il Duce.    Aside from this problem, however, the United States is  waiting to assess the new government on the basis of the facts.  It expects that none of the National Alliance ministers will  prove to be someone who has avowed Fascist sympathies. It  predicts that Italy will continue to be a loyal friend within  NATO. It hopes that all the international commitments--including  the Osimo Treaty with the former Yugoslavia--will be kept. "To  be sure," Angelo Codevilla, one of the gurus from the Hoover  Institution acknowledges, "the stories filed by the American  reporters from Rome and the newspaper headlines--such as the one  in THE NEW YORK TIMES, which proclaimed the return of the  fascists [preceding word in English] to the government--are a  matter of concern to the public, but Americans are not getting  shivers down their spine the way some Europeans are. Perhaps  Fini is truly taking the far Right toward the center. Perhaps he  will succeed in getting his followers to remove their black  shirts and put on business suits. Let's give him a trial period  of a few months."    In Strasbourg--where the election campaign for the new  European Parliament is already heating up--the climate is quite  different from Washington's somewhat detached wait-and-see  attitude. As the politicians who meet in Rome with the  ambassadors from the European Union [EU] point out, there are  those who perceive "the danger of a resurgence of the far Right  in Europe" and make little distinction between fascists,  neofascists, and the postfascists of the National Alliance. A  substantial lobbying [preceding word in English] operation by  Achille Occhetto and associates led--on the night of Wednesday 4  May-Thursday 5 May--to a motion of censure (189 votes to 188)  directed against the inclusion of Fini's people in the Italian  Government.    While some were recalling that a similar blitz [preceding  word in English] waged by the European Left had led to approval  of the rules concerning the adoption of children by gay  [preceding word in English] couples--and while the Palazzo  Quirinale [office of the president of Italy] was issuing a  speedy reply opposing any interference (President Oscar Luigi  Scalfaro wrote: "Italy does not need either warnings or  teachers")--Occhetto was toasting his victory. The PDS  [Democratic Party of the Left] leader (who is no longer a  prophet in his own country) is happy to have found--on the  international scene--a new legitimation. The European election  campaign in Italy, France, Germany, Spain, and Great Britain  will be waged by the parties of the Left on the issue of the  qualunquista [man-in-the-street] threat, and Gianfranco Fini is  saying the same thing. "The first to open fire," he told  PANORAMA, "was Michel Rocard, secretary of the French Socialist  Party, and precisely for internal party reasons, inasmuch as he  fears Bernard Tapie. Then all the others chimed in."    Major European newspapers have likewise taken very hard-line  positions with regard to Italian neofascism, which has the  potential of replicating or reinforcing similar phenomena  elsewhere on the continent. Alain Minc began the process with an  article in LE MONDE and was followed by many commentators, from  the Italianist Michael Sheridan--writing in the London  INDEPENDENT--to Miguel A. Bastenier in PAIS of Madrid and the  scholarly history lessons in DIE ZEIT of Hamburg. Although some  correspondents in Rome may perhaps be influenced by the "Red  salons," as Fini says, or by the "outbursts of REPUBBLICA or  other similar newspapers," as the secretary of the National  Alliance also claims, the analysts are capturing the moods of  the various foreign ministries and economic potentates. The  parties of the left are shouting, while government officials are  voicing their opinions in more subdued tones.    The Germans, for example--as Helmut Kohl told some friends  during his visit to Rome on Tuesday 3 May--fear not only the  Fini effect on the Republikaner in the coming elections but also  the possibility that Italy might play a bad joke on the  economy--for example, by making agreements with Alcatel  concerning STET [Turin Telephone Finance Company] while ignoring  Siemens. Bonn is preparing to preside over the EC for six months  and will keep close watch on Rome--on Rome's observance of its  European commitments and on its compliance with the rules of  economic and moral austerity that are necessary in order to  solve Italy's serious problems. Slovenes and Croats have turned  not only to Washington but also to Bonn to obtain protection  from any revision of the Osimo Treaty ("which," Fini told  PANORAMA, "must be revised as it pertains to the protection of  the rights of the Italian minorities."    London--where Italy is represented by an ambassador of great  prestige, Giacomo Attolico--is not monitoring the handful of  National Alliance ministers as attentively as it is  "Berlusconi's performance." It is up to him, the newspapers  explain--and the Foreign Office chimes in--to keep "the  postneofascists" at bay. The British ambassador in Rome, Sir  Patrick Fairweather, met privately with Fini precisely in an  effort to understand him. On Monday 2 May, at the Italian  Cultural Institute in London, a crowded meeting of political  scientists and analysts heard a lecture on the new Italy given  by Professor Carlo Maria Santoro of the ISPI [Foreign Policy  Studies Institute] of Milan. At the meeting, attention was  centered on the new electoral system and on the new government  coalition. PANORAMA has learned that Prince Charles will invite  Berlusconi to visit him at his private country estate,  Highgrove, outside London, and Prime Minister John Major has  sent a message to Berlusconi expressing "best wishes for the  formation of your ministerial team."    Whereas London is merely smiling, the face that Paris and  Brussels (where the Frenchman Jacques Delors reigns) have turned  toward this "black-garbed" Italy is wearing a frown. The  transalpine press--except for LE FIGARO--is decidedly hostile.  Even some conservative politicians such as the mayor of Paris,  Jacques Chirac, are unusually cautious (on his recent visit to  Rome, Chirac did not want to meet with any National Alliance  representative). Francois Mitterrand sent Berlusconi a telegram  of congratulations, and his foreign minister, Alain Juppe,  displayed a measure of realpolitik toward the new Italian  Government. The Socialists, however, have gone wild. Jean-Pierre  Cot, group leader of the Socialists in the European Parliament,  led the anti-Fini campaign. Former cabinet minister Bernard  Kouchner headed a drive to collect signatures in opposition to  "Italian neofascism." In the intellectual salons of the Left,  Italy--which had just held normal democratic elections--was in  fact likened to the Greece of the colonels and the Chile of  Augusto Pinochet.    Even the Jewish communities reacted strongly to the "Fini  threat." Jean Kahn, president of the European Jewish Congress,  said: "The European Community was created on the basis of the  European Human Rights Convention, and it would be unacceptable  for the fascists to be part of a government of the EU." Like a  chain reaction, the alarm sounded by the French Jews unleashed  the powerful lobby [preceding word in English] in America.  "These events concern and disturb me very greatly," Fini told  PANORAMA. "I have already had a heart-to-heart talk with many  Jewish friends, and will do the same with the Italian, American,  and French communities. If it can be arranged, I will even go to  Israel. I say to everyone that we are not anti-Semites and that  we love freedom and democracy."    The conservative Israeli daily JERUSALEM POST indicates that  it believes Fini is acting in good faith. In an editorial of 31  March it wrote: "He is a courteous person, who became the center  of attention after combating the extremist fringe of his party.  He is certainly no Zhirinovskiy." Shimon Peres, who met  Berlusconi in 1985, is monitoring the Italian situation with  Biblical realism and is awaiting [Foreign Minister] Martino's  visit to Israel. Italy has been scrutinized attentively in  Jerusalem as well as in Washington. The Western foreign  ministries--more so than the newspapers--have concentrated on  reality rather than on their imagination. They are waiting for  the names of the ministers and the program of the government to  be announced.    As Margaret Thatcher has informed PANORAMA, the following  will be of great importance for the world and also for Italy:  the actions that Berlusconi takes during the first 100 days, the  first promises that are carried out, and the day-to-day  performance of the ministers of the coalition regardless of  their political affiliation. And if the Iron Lady--who governed  for 11 and one-half years--says so, it is indeed good advice.</p>

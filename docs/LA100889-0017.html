			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: DATELINE SOWETO TRAVELS WITH BLACK SOUTH AFRICAN REPORTERS  BY WILLIAM FINNEGAN (HARPER &amp; ROW: $8.95)  </P> <P> In 1986, William Finnegan visited South Africa to profile the black journalists  working there. His terse account of his travels through the black ghettos and  sham homelands conveys the reality of life in that strife-ridden country with  an immediacy that "A Dry White Season" lacks.  </P> <P> The most interesting chapters in "Dateline" focus on the paradox of liberal  South African papers that hire black writers and support the idea of a more  equitable society, but have no black editors. Finnegan's descriptions of the  struggle to report the news despite governmental decrees (like Humpty-Dumpty,  the security forces assert that "subversive" means whatever they choose) and  the murderous factional struggles within the black community fostered by the  government, stand as a powerful indictment of the South African regime.  </P> <P> </P></p>

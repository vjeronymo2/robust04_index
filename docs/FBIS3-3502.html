Last year saw the province cancel the mandatory production  and marketing plan for most products, and lift the price  ceilings from 92 percent of local products, including grain,  oil-bearing seeds, cotton and silkworm cocoons.    "This has paved the way for more successful market  operations  and revitalized the province's economy," said Deputy Governor Ji  Yunshi, who is in charge of economic matters.    "The province has adapted itself quickly to the  macro-environment change in the economy," he noted.    The deputy governor explained that Jiangsu, which is short  of  raw materials and energy resources, has focused on the  processing industry.    With thousands of small enterprises, the province used to be  affected and limited by market changes.    One manifestation was fluctuation in provincial economic  growth during the 1986-90 period.    Jiangsu's economy grew at a fast and abnormal speed in the  first half of last year, and the speed slowed down in the later  part of the year as a result of the central government's  tightening of macro-control of the economy.    As the enterprises' adaptability was enhanced, they quickly  adjusted the orientation of investment and their product mix in  line with needs of markets at home and abroad.    The rural industrial enterprises, for example, raised more  than 2.1 billion yuan by developing the partnership system last  year.    A survey shows that Jiangsu's gross domestic product still  increased at a rate of 18.5 percent last year.    Its industrial output value in the first two months of this  year rose by at least 20 percent over the same period of last  year.    Economists here agree that the market economy has helped  push  Jiangsu's economy ahead.    According to statistics, Jiangsu's gross retail sales volume  reached 107.42 billion yuan last year, an increase of 33.9  percent over the previous year, and its exports also registered  a big increase.    The economists noted that Jiangsu's economic growth is based  on market needs and is now developing in a healthy way.    In particular, the province has made rapid progress in  infrastructural facilities and basic industry.    The province spent 6.773 billion yuan on improving  transportation and telecommunications facilities last year, up  59.3 percent over the previous year and 33.7 percentage points  higher over the investment in industry.    In addition, the province invested more than four billion  yuan in the development of the raw materials industry last year,  up 23 percent.    The deputy governor attributed the economic progress partly  to the service trades and the establishment of foreign-funded  enterprises.    According to statistics, the added value of the service  trades last year amounted to 62.3 billion yuan, an increase of  20.3 percent over the previous year, and its output accounted  for 24.4 percent of the province's total.    So far, the province has approved the establishment of more  than 20,000 foreign-funded enterprises, of which over 7,000 have  gone into operation. Many of their products are for export.    The ten state economic development zones in Jiangsu and a  number of provincial development zones are in smooth operation,  and some have already begun to make profits.</p>

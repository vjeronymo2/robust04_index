			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Western European Union Defense Commission </F> President Jacques Baumel: "Bosnia"]    [Text] Ten days to take war away from Sarajevo. At last,  the reaction for which we had been awaiting for months! It took  the unbearable images of the dead and wounded lying on the white  snow of Sarajevo to crack the monument of hypocrisy and  cowardice which concealed the murder of a nation in the midst of  heedless Europe. Of course, there had to be a few UN Tartuffes  [hypocrites] questioning who was ultimately responsible for the  massacres! As if we had not known for two years exactly who has  been shelling Sarajevo and murdering women and children! Future  historians will wonder how -- after the end of the Cold War --  so many powerful nations and their diplomats could let 200,000  people be slaughtered and 2 million refugees be deported by  thinly disguised killers whom they respectfully welcomed in  Geneva for farcical and shameful conferences.    All it took was -- thanks to France's persistence -- a long  overdue warning issued by NATO, and what was deemed impossible  materialized: a cease-fire agreement complete with the Serbs  vowing to withdraw their cannons. Is this a last-ditch maneuver  or a newfound wisdom born of fear?    Without allowing ourselves to be fooled once more, we now  must maintain the pressure and the threat of action in case of  deception. Seldom has a 10-day ultimatum been so important. Of  course, one must not be content with a vague cease-fire  agreement in Sarajevo, which can always be canceled. The West  must demand that fighting stop everywhere in Bosnia, so that  real negotiations can resume and Serb armed gangs are made to  leave regions they should not be in.    There can be no question of the aggressors obtaining in  peace  what they could not grab through war and bloodshed. But can  peoples who have suffered so much violence be made to agree to  peaceful coexistence?    If -- should the ultimatum be rejected -- air strikes become  necessary, the allies must know how far they are ready to go.  They must agree on this from the outset, as we must no longer  say things we do not intend to put into practice.    Right now, two lessons can be drawn from this atrocious and  interminable carnage. First, the United Nations does not have  the wherewithal to plan and manage peacekeeping missions, as  shown by its actions in Somalia and Bosnia. The United Nations  -- which lacks means and experience as well as a competent  military staff, money, and a real chain of command -- cannot  even enforce its own resolutions!    Which country will want to contribute its soldiers if the  outcome is certain to be a failure? Humanitarian action must no  longer hinder the restoration of peace.    Faced with the lessened interest for Europe demonstrated by  the Americans as well as Russia's new hardline stance, and in  the perspective of future "Yugoslavias," Europe must urgently  create a purely European defense structure. By embracing for the  first time the concept of a European defense identity, NATO's  latest summit in Brussels provided Europe with a historic  opportunity. Can Europe seize it? If it does not, the worst  will surely come!    In front of expiring Bosnia -- just like yesterday before  Munich -- Europe must choose between dishonor and courage. Its  whole fate hinges on this alternative. Otherwise, what would be  the point of holding, in three months' time, a European election  which over half of the French population will boycott?    More than the Serbs' vague commitment, NATO's resolve is a  historic turning point for security in Europe.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Bratislava SMENA in Slovak on 1 June  and Bratislava SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 2 June both  publish commentaries on waning support for Miklos Duray,  chairman of the Coexistence Movement, among the Hungarian  minority in Slovakia.    Bratislava SMENA in Slovak on 1 June on page 4 carries a  500-word Milan Stanislav commentary entitled "A New Leader?"  The commentator observes that, besides bringing a victory for  the left, the Hungarian elections showed that Hungarian voters  had rejected the "gaining of political capital out of  nationalism." In Stanislav's opinion, this "signal" from  Hungary is also likely to influence ethnic Hungarian voters in  southern Slovakia. He continues: "Miklos Duray, in particular,  has found himself in a difficult situation. In public opinion  polls on trust in politicians, Duray has suffered the greatest  loss of support, and Vojtech Bugar, who, by his moderate and  realistic policy, has become the natural leader of the Hungarian  ethnic minority, ranks above him by a wide margin. Miklos Duray  also had to swallow a bitter pill at a meeting of the  Coexistence Council when he had to agree to the idea of a  three-member coalition that was advocated by Vojtech Bugar. Why  did Mr. Duray oppose this idea? Most likely, he saw in the  alliance of the moderate Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement  [MKDH] with the liberal and level-headed Hungarian Civic Party  [MOS] a strong competition for his own policy, which is marked  by extremism. By trying to include the de facto nonexistent  Hungarian People's Party in the contemplated `union of four  [ethnic Hungarian] parties,' he tried to eliminate the influence  of the MOS within this grouping. Because the idea of a union,  based on the circumvention of the electoral law, did not meet  with support, Coexistence sounded the retreat. Given the  current distribution of electoral preferences within the  Hungarian community, Coexistence would be risking a duel with a  possible MKDH-MOS two-member coalition and would not have to get  into parliament. Moreover, it also had to reckon with the  Social Democratic bloc's campaign for the votes of Hungarian  voters, who are influenced by the Socialists' victory in the  neighboring country."    In conclusion, the commentator observes that Duray's  "radical" statements "jeopardize dialogue between the minority  and the government," which could threaten the passage of  legislative norms benefiting the minority and strengthen the  position of Slovak nationalist parties.    Bratislava SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 2 June on page 3  carries a 600-word Emil Lopasovsky commentary entitled "Is Duray  Losing Ground Under His Feet?" The commentator considers two  recent incidents that, in his opinion, document a loss of  support for the Coexistence chairman within the Hungarian  minority.    First, Lopasovsky gives an account of a rally held in the  overwhelmingly Hungarian community of Velka nad Iplom "late last  week," which was attended by Miklos Duray. According to  Lopasovsky, "Duray suffered a debacle" at Velka nad Iplom when  the community's residents "ignored" his presence. According to  the commentator, the company awaiting Duray consisted of his  brother-in-law, his sister, the mayor of the community, and two  journalists, who were subsequently joined by "a few elderly  locals who had quickly emptied their mugs of beer in the pub  across the street." The subsequent discussion reportedly  demonstrated that Duray's "political steps and escalating  demands are out of tune with the views of people about whom he  pretends to be concerned." Particularly Duray's campaign  against the so-called alternative education, whose aim is to  improve ethnic Hungarians' command of the Slovak language,  reportedly met with criticism.    The second indication of waning support for Duray, according  to Lopasovsky, was the meeting of the Coexistence Council at  Lucenec on 28 May, which advocated a coalition of ethnic  Hungarian parties, in defiance of Duray's preference for the  project of a union. Lopasovsky claims that "it was even rumored  at Lucenec that Duray's chair in Coexistence is not quite  stable."</p>

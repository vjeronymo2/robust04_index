			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS;  </P> <P> 2 PARCELS DROPPED FROM CITYHOOD PLAN  </P> <P> Leaders of a drive to form a city of Laguna Hills have bowed to requests from  the Mission Viejo Co. and Leisure World to drop two parcels of land from the  plans.  </P> <P> The surprise decision to pare down the size of the proposed eight-square-mile  city came hours after cityhood leaders met Wednesday with the county's Local  Agency Formation Commission.  </P> <P> "It's official," said Ellen Martin, chairwoman of the pro-cityhood group,  Citizens to Save Laguna Hills. "We're going to change the map."  </P> <P> The Mission Viejo Co., which designed the Aliso Viejo Planned Community, has  opposed the bid to include six Aliso Viejo neighborhoods near the Laguna Hills  High School in the proposed Laguna Hills city map.  </P> <P> And Leisure World officials said that they opposed inclusion of a shopping  center and non-residential Leisure World property near Moulton Parkway and El  Toro Road because they planned to include that property in their own  incorporation effort.  </P> <P> The two groups had vowed to campaign actively against the incorporation effort  if the county approves a ballot measure for the November election.  </P> <P> Cityhood leaders, saying that they were sensitive to any strong opposition to  incorporation, decided to sidestep the growing controversy by asking LAFCO to  exclude the disputed properties.  </P> <P> The map change also will mean that the proposed city will lose the largely  undeveloped Forbes Ranch and New World neighborhood, located west of Leisure  World.  </P> <P> That area, which made up about one-tenth of the city, could be reached only by  the triangular section of Aliso Viejo bounded by Moulton Parkway on the west,  Via Lomas and Alicia Parkway on the south, Paseo de Valencia on the east and  Laguna Hills Road and Leisure World on the north.  </P> <P> A recent poll taken by the Aliso Viejo Community Assn. indicated that 75% of  the 630 households preferred to remain a part of Aliso Viejo, said Don Swift,  association director.  </P> <P> "The majority of our people are very pleased with the decision and commend the  (cityhood) committee for realizing that there was considerable opposition,"  Swift said.

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Currency gains and strong demand help De La Rue STRONG demand for bank-notes and currency gains helped De La Rue, the security printer and cash-handling machine group, increase pre-tax profits by 44 per cent to Pounds 66.1m in the six months to September 30. De La Rue's shares rose by 18p to 772p after the group said it would pay a higher proportion of its dividend at the interim stage and lifted the payment by 56 per cent to 6p (3.85p). Although the second half was unlikely to benefit from a similar move in exchange rates, the group said it was confident that profits before exceptional items would be not less than in the same period last year. Mr Jeremy Marshall, chief executive, said: 'The improved profitability of our security printing operations, the resilience of our payment systems sector - despite the slowdown in Germany - and the strong result from our associated companies have all contributed to this excellent result.' The group said security printing continued to benefit from strong demand for their products, with banknote production at record levels. Operating profits rose from Pounds 19.8m to Pounds 25.9m. The substantial improvement in margins on continuing operations from 17.8 per cent in the first half of last year to 24.8 per cent this year arose from an increase in the proportion of more profitable banknote business. The company expected margins for the full year would exceed those of last year, but were unlikely to be maintained at the level achieved in the first half. Order books remained strong, and in the key businesses extended well into the next financial year. Payment systems increased operating profits from Pounds 16.9m to Pounds 17.7m. The group said order books were also strong, although trading conditions in Germany remained difficult. Group turnover was flat at Pounds 273.4m. Cashflow from operations of Pounds 45.6m (Pounds 37m) helped increase net cash to Pounds 201m, up from Pounds 171m at the year-end. Mr Les Cullen, finance director, said De La Rue was less well placed to hand back cash to shareholders than Reuters, the international business information group, which had considerable unrelieved advance corporation tax. However, gross funds could still benefit from an ACT credit on any cash distribution and if this were to be time-limited by the budget, the group would examine the position. Under FRS 3, which includes gains from the sale of discontinued operations, earnings per share rose by 46 per cent to 24.8p (17p). Using the definition of earnings suggested by the Institute of Investment Management and Research, which strips out certain non-recurring items, earnings grew by 30 per cent to 21p (16.2p).

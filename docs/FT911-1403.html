			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Parallel turns on the Essex coast: An alternative to the crowded pistes of ski resorts THE QUESTION was: can one enjoy the annual skiing holiday without the inconvenience of crowded airports, lift queues, uncertain snow, and the contagion of the package tour - in short, without actually going skiing? High hotels and helicopters allow the rich to get away from us all; but even serious money is subject to air traffic control and the greenhouse effect. So I tried a different solution: the Essex coast in April. It may be objected that one does not ski in Essex during April. But the choice was based on more subtle reasoning. Discard for a moment the image of pine trees dusted with new snow, the squeak and thump of lift cables on their wheels, and the mingled aromas of sun lotion, french fries and socks in Alpine huts. Consider instead the essential character of the sport, which draws people year after year with the eagerness of escaping prisoners. The awesome power of the mountains and the high romance of their inaccessible beauty? Perhaps. But these pleasures can be enjoyed more easily and with more variety in summer. No, the appeal of skiing is different, and in some ways inimical to the contemplation of Europe's grandest spectacle. It depends on speed, balance and a perpetual frisson of danger. Skiing has gained popularity because the technology of plastics, resins and fibre made it easier and safer for the unfit, the overweight and the semi-skilled ; but the excitement of controlling gravity and the swing of the skis with a ripple of the body, is the same as it was in the days of leather and wood. On the Essex coast, one cannot try ones skill against gravity, but there is plenty of wind and, instead of snow, miles of unspoiled virgin water. The action is surprisingly similar. One stands on a board rather longer and about three times as wide as a pair of skis, with the back straight and the rear knee bent, while hanging on to a wishbone which supports the sail. In a good breeze, the effect is between skiing and hang-gliding. The sail leans towards the horizontal, with the sailor hanging like Icarus below a wing. The force of the wind lifts him until the board skims over the waves with a roar of spray. It can go as fast as a speedboat. But is it the real thing? Can the sailboard offer that afterglow of satisfaction which captured the imagination of generations of skiers? Is it not wet, cold and, frankly, unsmart? After a week of spring sunshine and fine breezes, I do not think I would have traded the Colne and Stour estuaries for Davos or La Plagne. Skiing and board-sailing offer variations on a common theme: speed surging from an elemental force but controlled by muscular skill; the wild impulse to go a little too fast; the exultation of getting it together and then the inevitable collapse. A bit like Don Giovanni, but quite respectable and nobody hurt. Board sailing, also, has been transformed in recent years by synthetic materials. So, just as the skier debates whether to pit himself against a slope marked in blue, red or black (in order of difficulty), board sailors stare out to sea asking apprehensively whether they dare try the '7' or will play safe with the '5.5' - the size of the sail in square metres. The biggest modern sails keep a perfect aerodynamic shape and drive the board at speed even on days when the sea is a gently dappled green and blue. In blustery weather the newer small rigs improve the board sailor's ability to negotiate the waves, just as plastic boots and sharp edges hold the skier firmly on an icy piste. So also, neoprene wet suits (and helmets for us bald men) make driving spray a mere flourish of the seascape, certainly no worse than snow on the mountain. Nor need board sailing be a solitary pursuit. No-one would do it for the apres surf, of course. Yet on a fine Saturday morning, the municipal greensward on Mersea Island's shore is packed with people standing, like penguins facing the sea, all wondering who will go in first. As in the mountains, groups form to enjoy the luxury of tired limbs, beer and exaggeration. Why then, do not skiers desert the overcrowded alps for the pleasures of the shore? Partly, no doubt, because the skiing industry has catered so cleverly for those who dislike the sport, but go for pasteurised Gemutlichkeit and noise. By contrast, the vigil of the board-widow guarding the Thermos in the car park is bleak. Then the initial cost can be quite high - perhaps Pounds 1,500 for a complete new set of gear (but less second hand). And a board sailor capsized half a mile offshore, may admit his sport is rugged. Whatever the reason, board sailors enjoy one advantage: they escape the modern skiers' hectic search for new terrain with all the apparatus of multiple lift passes and linked resorts and ski busses. Unlike the face of a piste, the sea never looks the same. Its expression is constantly varying under the influence of wind, tide and clouds. The board sailor close to the surface feels its subtlest variations. And so it was that on a fine English morning, with harness hooked on and aft knee flexed, outward bound from Brightlingsea, I joined the bustling craft at the mouth of the Colne, squared off for the low shoreline of Mersea Island, glanced at the sky and thought: 'Gluwein, who needs it.'</p>

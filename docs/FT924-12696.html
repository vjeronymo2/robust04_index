			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Pound falls sharply in nervous market THE POUND fell sharply against the D-Mark yesterday as the government's decision to postpone the pit closure programme failed to quell nervousness among investors about the UK's political and economic outlook. A rally after the announcement by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, was shortlived. It closed more than 2 1/2 pfennigs lower at DM2.4200 and also fell against the dollar, finishing in London at Dollars 1.6320 compared with Friday's close of Dollars 1.6570. In New York, sterling finished at DM2.43325 and Dollars 1.625. In early Far East trade today it was quoted at DM2.4405 and Dollars 1.6225. The government's action gave a slight boost to share prices. The FT-SE 100 share index rose 20 points from its low of the day to close just 1.7 lower at 2,562.2. But the announcement failed to restore confidence in the government's handling of the economy, already damaged by the hasty nature of Friday's 1 percentage point cut in base rates. The market is also worried that Mr John Major will not be able to fend off a backbench rebellion in tomorrow's coal debate. Fears about inflation and the pound pushed prices of longer-dated government bonds downwards as investors chose the relative safety of shorter-dated and index-linked bonds. A Pounds 100m tranche of index-linked stock issued by the Bank of England was exhausted by lunchtime. Lex, Page 26 Currencies, Page 41 London shares, Page 50</p>

Use of improved technology._Improved information technology may be used by the grantee; however, each grantee may be relatively small and high technology information transfer is not considered economically justifiable by FmHA or the grantees. The collection of information required by this regulation is minimal and is more a synopsis of grantee activities than original data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Efforts to identify duplication._The Agency has reviewed all grant programs it administers to determine which programs may be similar in intent and purpose. The Agency has several grant programs that are similar. It is doubtful that an applicant would apply for funding under the RTDG program at the same time and for the same purpose as an application under another program. However, if there were simultaneous participation in more than one grant program, the Agency would make every effort to accommodate the requests within the same set of applications and processing forms. This effort is presently facilitated by assignment of management of these programs to the same program area of responsibility. If a grantee is applying for, or receiving, a grant from another Federal agency, the forms and documents furnished to the other agency would be utilized to the extent possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Why available information cannot be used or modified._As stated in 4, if similar information is available within RDA or another agency, every effort would be made to utilize that information as is or in an appropriately modified form for this program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Methods to minimize burden of small businesses or entities._The information to be collected is in a format designed to minimize the paperwork burden on small businesses and other small entities. The information collected is the minimum needed by the Agency to approve grants and monitor the grantee performance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Consequence if information collection were less frequent._If the collection of information were conducted less frequently, it could have an adverse effect on the Agency's ability to administer the grant program. The Agency must determine that the grant funds are to be used by the eligible applicants for authorized purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Inconsistency with guidelines in 5 CFR 1320.6._There are no special circumstances that require the collection to be conducted in a manner inconsistent with the guidelines in 7 CFR 1320.6, except for SF&hyph;270. The SF&hyph;270 is submitted voluntarily during the disbursement period; requests are limited to one every 30 days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

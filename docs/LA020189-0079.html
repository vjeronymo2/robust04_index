			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CRESPI SETTLES INTO SECOND AFTER SURVIVING RALLY, 68-65  </P> <P> Allen Freemon can heat up faster than an electric blanket.  </P> <P> And when the St. Francis High guard catches fire, as he did in the fourth  quarter Tuesday night against Crespi, he can burn you.  </P> <P> But he is no Superman.  </P> <P> Freemon's desperation 3-point shot with 1 second remaining was blocked by Pat  Brady, preserving the Celts' 68-65 Del Rey League victory at St. Francis.  </P> <P> Only the finishing touches were lacking on a furious rally engineered by  Freemon, who made 5 consecutive shots, including 2 3-point baskets, to bring  the Golden Knights back from a 13-point deficit in the fourth quarter. Freemon  finished with a game-high 25 points -- 13 in the final period.  </P> <P> "It used to be coming down here was fun, a sure win," Crespi Coach Paul Muff  said. "But no lead is comfortable against them."  </P> <P> Crespi (10-9, 5-2 in league play) clinched second place with the victory. St.  Francis (12-9, 3-4) must defeat St. John Bosco on Friday to clinch the league's  third and final playoff berth.  </P> <P> "We can't do anything about this game," St. Francis Coach John Jordan said. "We  just have to get ready for St. John Bosco."  </P> <P> The Golden Knights had little success against Crespi in the first half. Matt  Luderer scored 16 first-half points as the Celts took leads of 20-5 after the  first quarter and 34-25 at halftime.  </P> <P> Freemon, hounded by Chris McGee, scored only 7 points in the first half on  2-of-8 shooting.  </P> <P> Crespi, led by center Ken Lynch (16 points, 20 rebounds, 2 blocked shots),  still led comfortably, 49-37, after three periods. But the St. Francis press  forced 6 fourth-quarter turnovers and Freemon led the Golden Knights'  resurgence.  </P> <P> Crespi missed 7 of 9 free throws in the final 1:12 and St. Francis drew to  within 68-65 on a basket by Jeff Dyrek with 26 seconds to play. After Crespi's  Rasaan Hall missed the front end of a 1-and-1 with 22 seconds left, the Golden  Knights missed 3 shots before calling time out with 1 second remaining. But  Brady blocked Freemon's 3-point attempt at the buzzer to preserve the Crespi  victory.  </P> <P> "I'm glad the game didn't have a few more minutes," Muff said.  </P></p>

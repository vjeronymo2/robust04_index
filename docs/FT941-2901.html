			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Reed Elsevier For the market to shave 3 per cent from Reed's share price on the day when the company demonstrated that the merger with Elsevier was working is a predictable meanness. The shares have all but doubled since the merger was announced, and a 40 per cent premium rating to the market is difficult to sustain without comparable earnings prospects. Those overly besotted with multimedia hype have also received a refreshing bucket of cold water as the sector's shorter term earnings prospects have become clearer. Yet to dwell on the negative influences is to miss the point about Reed Elsevier. The company has an enviable mix of high margin steady growth businesses and lower margin consumer titles which are about to benefit from the upswing. Even with that spread, the portfolio is sensibly concentrated in specific publishing areas. The management's clear strategic view is a force to be reckoned with. Strong cash flow and high interest cover mean the group has plenty of fire power ready to use as and when attractive acquisition opportunities emerge. The purchase of Official Airline Guides for Dollars 415m and its subsequent rationalisation reassures that the company may resist overpaying. In the absence of a hot-headed aggressive bid, large-scale acquisitions may take longer than the market would ideally like. But then, shareholders have long kept faith with Reed, despite its humdrum earnings record. It is worth hanging on a little longer, since all that remains is for the management fully to exploit the opportunity it has created for itself.</p>

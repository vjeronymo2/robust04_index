			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with President of Ukraine L.M. Kravchuk by </F> UKRAYINSKA HAZETA Editor in Chief Valeriy Zholdak, in the office  of the president of Ukraine on 9 December 1993; published under  the rubric "UKRAYINSKA HAZETA Projects: Realistic Contenders for  the Office of President of Ukraine, Elections to Which Have Been  Scheduled for 26 June 1994": "`Ukraine Will Be Great and  Strong.' UKRAYINSKA HAZETA Editor in Chief Has a Conversation  With President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk About the Most Burning  Problems in Domestic and Foreign Policy of Ukraine, the Leading  Cadres of the State, the Family, Rumors, and the Woes of the  People"--for first two installments see Ukrainian National  Affairs Section of Central Eurasia Daily Report of 28 Dec 93 p  30, 11 Jan 94 p 52, for parts III and IV see Ukraine Political  Affairs Section of the FBIS Report: Central Eurasia of 3 Mar 94  pp 7-15]    [Text]  <H5>  Will There Be Communism in a Separate Oblast? </H5>   [Zholdak] ...So, who is tearing our state apart?    [Kravchuk] Let us determine first what separatism is.  Transcarpathia, the Crimea, and Odessa cannot be accused all  together; I am against this. This is ignorance! Believe me, it  is ignorance!    [Zholdak] Why?    [Kravchuk] When, let us say, a region wants to have the  right  to invest, wants to have more economic rights in order to use  its internal reserves which are specific to this region,  undertakes to pay taxes, and does not raise issues concerning a  change in its status, this is not separatism. If the point at  issue is taking advantage of economic opportunities, it is not  separatism; this is normal. There are two paths to choose:  Either the state assumes responsibility for everything and says:  I will provide for you, I will help you, and you will work in  peace; if the state is not able to do so, it says: You take  advantage of your own opportunities yourselves, work, and  provide everything necessary for yourselves; pay your taxes  yourselves. Tell me please what kind of separatism is this  anyway?    [Zholdak] Is it not separatism if they refuse to execute the  laws of Ukraine and your edicts?    [Kravchuk] Who is refusing?    [Zholdak] There are such people. We will be publishing items  about this, in particular, an article by an adviser to the  representative of the president, your representative in Odessa  Oblast, one might say, your eyes and ears.    [Kravchuk] However, you will find cases in which edicts of  the president and laws of the Supreme Council are not complied  with not only in Odessa Oblast but in all oblasts of Ukraine.  This is a complicated time.    [Zholdak] Correct.    [Kravchuk] For your part, you wish to apply a certain  formula  of separatism to individual regions.    [Zholdak] However, we cannot remain silent. The Crimea also  started out with this until it came to the presidency, to being  a state.    [Kravchuk] This is not terrible, either. We interpret the  presidency in the Crimea as a form of local executive power.    [Zholdak] It is terrible.    [Kravchuk] I am explaining to you that it is not.    [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, pardon me, but is it a normal  phenomenon to see that your representative and the head of an  oblast council cannot find a common language--one pulls one way,  and the other the other way. I mentioned this abnormality to  Ivan Stepanovych Plyushch. He said that such dual power is a bad  phenomenon.    [Kravchuk] It is bad.    [Zholdak] One person should lead and be personally  responsible for everything.    [Kravchuk] This is precisely what we set forth in the draft  of the new Constitution. We know, and it is our mentality, that  if, say, two angels are ensconced and each has his power, they  will begin to fight after a while.    [Zholdak] Correct.    [Kravchuk] This is why for our mentality, for our society,  the determining factor is for power to be held in the same hands.    [Zholdak] So, what did you write in the draft Constitution?    [Kravchuk] The head of power is elected by the people  locally. That is it! One individual resolves all issues....  Well, not one individual personally.... Incidentally, the  Supreme Council passed a law on this issue.    [Zholdak] Correct, correct! Everything should come under  this  person; there will be order then, and there will be someone to  be held accountable.    [Kravchuk] Yes, and there will not be the tug-of-war that  you  mentioned.    [Zholdak] Will this head of, say, the oblast be subordinated  to the president or, once again, to the Supreme Council? The  Supreme Council is a legislative organ; it should not be the  leading and guiding force of society.    [Kravchuk] This will now be a mechanism set forth in the  law.  The law will set forth everything: how the chairman is elected,  what powers he has, and what obligations he has to the  president, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the Supreme Council. It  cannot be that I say so and you do it. This is a dangerous  thing: I have said so! If this word comes to your mind, and you  begin saying once again: "I have said--ban it!", "I have  said--do not go!", it will be no good. The entire state power  should be built on the law.    [Zholdak] This is clear. Leonid Makarovych, you "omitted" my  previous question.... So, what do you think: Mr. Bodelan and  other oblast leaders, former Communist figures, for example in  Donetsk--are they acting properly in demanding that free  economic zones be legalized?    [Kravchuk] This is a normal phenomenon. Free economic zones  should be "within the law."    [Zholdak] Is this not urging by some kind of forces to  secede  within, and subsequently without? Such as, for example, the  Hungarians urging Transcarpathia....    [Kravchuk] What is a free economic zone and its status? It  is  a so-called "point" zone, an administrative zone. All this  already exists in the world, and nobody is scared of it. We have  not suddenly chosen or discovered this....    [Zholdak] However, they also want their own borders and to  establish their own customs. Do you understand?    [Kravchuk] Listen, if it is a free economic zone, it has its  own laws of life.    [Zholdak] All these laws of "their own" should not  counteract  those of the state.    [Kravchuk] Specifics are at work here. If, say, you cut  through a free economic zone, you plug yourself into a different  system of economic relations. You cannot go there with your own  "statute." You should meet the conditions of the zone. For  example, I have been to these zones in China, where the  situation is similar.    [Zholdak] Is each zone over there a "monastery" with its own  statute?    [Kravchuk] Yes.    [Zholdak] So, is there one set of requirements when you  enter  one zone, and another one when you enter another?    [Kravchuk] Of course. Other laws are in effect.    [Zholdak] But is the state one?    [Kravchuk] It is economic laws that are in effect, not  political! The state does not mean the economy. The state means  the system. Within the state there may be special situations in  various regions. I am saying that this should not be feared.  <H5>  This Is Something Alien in Our State </H5>   [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, do you know what people are now  afraid of? Of the "democrats" who have run Ukraine into the  ground. Who are such democrats at present? I mean democrats who  are in power. You, Mr. President, one of the former leaders of  the Communists of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Mr.  Chairman of the Supreme Council--likewise a former member of the  party nomenklatura. A majority of local leaders are from the  glorious host of Lenin....    [Kravchuk] You know, we live in a world of cliches. Are  there  many people who are capable of governing in a new way? They  tried, they thought it was easy, that devotion alone would  suffice....    [Zholdak] I am telling you about real facts.    [Kravchuk] I am also telling you about real facts. For  example, they elected the Supreme Council. It immediately split  into two groups--the democrats and the partocrats. Instead of  proceeding to cooperate, they began to battle each other. Some  condemned others, others abused the party, the leaders, and so  on. What did it bring about? What did the People's Council begin  with in the Supreme Council? They did not vote. Correct? How  have they ended now? They will not vote again. Then Ihor  Rafayilovych spoke and stated: "We refuse to vote." Four years  have gone by. Now, Mr. Zayets speaks, and also states: "We  refuse to vote." All of us have built our lives on struggle, on  confrontation. I have proclaimed constantly: Do not look for  enemies within the country. If you look for them, you will find  them and embroil everybody, embroil Ukraine, and divide Ukraine  into east and west, and there will be an eternal struggle. I  say: Good people, find grounds for living here. The people are  what they are, you will not change them. Yuriy Khotlubey, the  chairman of the Mariupol City Council, a people's deputy from  among the partocrats whom you have mentioned, introduced a  proposal in the Supreme Council: Set us free, set the  enterprises free, open the way to a market economy. People  cannot be judged on the slogans they proclaim, but should be  judged on what they do.    [Zholdak] Correct.    [Kravchuk] If you set us free, he said, we will make money  and sell things ourselves. This is already a market economy.  Look, life has brought this "partocrat" (in the parlance of the  democrats) to a market economy. Every thinking man would  understand that continuous political struggle will not take the  country out of an economic crisis. Everybody proclaimed: We have  severed relations with Russia. Now they are already stating at a  congress of entrepreneurs: The process is underway, Russia  abandoned Ukraine, pushed Kazakhstan out of the ruble zone, and  is pushing others out because such is the situation. Russia  cannot do otherwise. It is protecting its own interests. We  should not take offense at it. We should unite in work rather  than quarrel. Meanwhile, the democrats began by drawing cards  and not voting, and have arrived at the same.... We do not have  an opposition because normal opposition is always constructive.  Our so-called opposition is geared toward destruction,  rejection, and the denunciation of "anybody and anything." This  opposition was born for struggle rather than for creation.    [Zholdak] However, Leonid Makarovych, I did not bring to  your  attention the democrats who vote or fail to vote in the chamber  of the Supreme Council. Who specifically rules the state,  regions, oblasts, and rayons at present? Who rules locally? The  former party leaders rule. They have become democrats.    [Kravchuk] Who has ruled in certain oblasts, say, western  oblasts?    [Zholdak] Those were mere individuals.    [Kravchuk] No. We had 3.5 million Communists here, in  Ukraine. All positions--from team leader to the chairman of the  Council of Ministers--were held by members of the CPSU. Do you  really think that things would have moved had people filled  leadership positions who did not have any skills in management  work? And that had we promoted someone, say, from the People's  Council in Donetsk, all these Communists, directors, and others  with a certain psychological party charge would have reacted to  him properly right away? This is an illusion. Experienced cadres  and proper conditions are needed. People change, they gradually  begin to understand the new conditions and their  irreversibility. They should not be viewed as enemies. So, I  take a newspaper and read it, and all kinds of labels are pinned  in it....    [Zholdak] UKRAYINSKA HAZETA does not attach labels....    [Kravchuk] No, you do not have that. Although yours is a  trenchant newspaper, it displays a culture of respectable  relations with the readers and those who, as you wrote, lead us  at present. Believe me, there are publications that one hates to  pick up.    [Zholdak] Do not pick them up.    [Kravchuk] I do not.    [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, to complete the "party" topic I  would ask you, as a citizen of the new Ukrainian state and at  the same time a former prominent party leader, to sincerely  voice your personal thoughts about the Communist Party, its past  and present, its credits and defeats, its crimes against the  people (I feel, I am convinced that we are holding this  conversion sincerely). I am not concerned with rank-and-file  Communists. You would know better than anyone the strength and  might of the Brezhnev and Shcherbytskyy-style party clutches in  Ukraine. As you see it, what will be the future of what once was  your party and mine? Many post-Communist countries have already  condemned it, including Russia. What is your view of it?    [Kravchuk] Indeed, I have lived not only in the party but  also in the leading organs. I became firmly convinced that  communist ideology and communist ideals do not have any  prospects. This is my profound conviction, and I will not ever  abandon it. However, as president I cannot ban the party on the  basis of this conviction because this would not be democratic. A  party can exist in any country, including the Communist Party.  It is the right of the people to choose a party for themselves.  The situation in our country is different. At present, the  Communist Party wants to say that it is already completely new,  since it proclaims some, shall we say, slightly different  slogans or updates old slogans. If 18- or 20-year-olds came to  this party and tried to create a party for Ukrainian statehood,  so that they could come out in favor of an independent state, of  Ukrainian culture and language, of their preservation, I would  support this party, regardless of my position, although I would  not join in. When people come along and say that this is a  different party, and at the same time accuse us of having made a  mistake in coming out for independence, and demand that the  Union be restored again, this is not a Communist Party of  Ukraine. It is something alien in our state. This party comes  out against the statehood of its country.    [Zholdak] Correct.    [Kravchuk] This is why I am against this party and this  ideology, but not generally against the party.    [Zholdak] You see, Mr. President, the Ministry of Justice  and  its leader, Mr. Onopenko personally, have registered this party  which had been retreaded in order to pull the wool over our eyes.    [Kravchuk] The people there should be the guardians of the  law. Incidentally, Hrushevskyy and Vynnychenko also had certain  socialist views of society, but they talked about a Communist  Party of Ukraine, of their state, a party that defends the  interests of its people, and not at all a party that operates in  Ukraine but whose center is located somewhere in another foreign  country, and which does everything against its people and its  state. You will understand that this is impermissible.    [Zholdak] At present, two similar parties, the Communist and  Socialist Parties, are uniting on this "revolutionary-Leninist  platform."    [Kravchuk] They probably have a lot in common here. This is  why I am telling them: If you are different, be so kind as to  show by deeds and not just words that you are for an independent  state, that you are making an effort to build, that you are  coming out against those who would destroy statehood, who come  out against us. Prove this, and I will support you.    [Zholdak] You know, Leonid Makarovych, I had a conversation  with Stanislav Hurenko about what you are saying. I even wanted  to interview him. We made arrangements, and I notified the  readers about this through the newspaper. Later, he suddenly  called me and said: "You know, I have reread the latest issues  of UKRAYINSKA HAZETA and noticed that we have somewhat different  positions." I said to this: So what if we have different  positions, let us reflect on this, and the readers will draw  conclusions for themselves as to which one is right. He refused,  and it is a pity. Why did I want to talk to him? I liked one  position of his. He had said before that he had prepared the  organizational congress of the Communist Party of Ukraine in  Donetsk after it was banned. However, he then refused to be  elected as a member of the Central Committee, of the leading  organs. Why? It turned out that he was against the desire of  other leaders of the Central Committee for revanche.    [Kravchuk] Oh!    [Zholdak] The second point he made to me: A new party should  be headed by new people, young people--what you have also said.    [Kravchuk] Yes, the party will be new if new and younger  people with other views and convictions come in.    [Zholdak] Who is the "helmsman" of the party now? Petro  Symonenko has grown from a Komsomol [All-Union Lenin Communist  Youth League] boy to a secretary of the Central Committee of the  Lenin Communist Youth League of Ukraine and secretary of the  Donetsk Oblast Party Committee....    [Kravchuk] I do not want to....    [Zholdak] Let us not.... However, another newly elected  secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of  Ukraine, Oleksandr Kotsyuba....    [Kravchuk] I do not want to discuss or characterize any one  of them. Time and the people will do this.    [Zholdak] Do not say anything, Leonid Makarovych, I will say  this. Third, for the party to again conquer the "mind" of all  the masses it should be headed by authoritative individuals  respected by the people.    [Kravchuk] Not just authoritative individuals.... An  authoritative person may have the old mentality and the old  ideology.    [Zholdak] Yes.    [Kravchuk] Do you know how much life and...struggle I needed  in order to tell you these words right now: I will never go back  to the Communist Party? Meanwhile, anybody can say that without  fearing for his life.    [Zholdak] Indeed, it was very interesting and pleasant for  me  to hear these words from your lips, and we will publish this.    [Kravchuk] These are my convictions.    [Zholdak] I believe you.    [Kravchuk] However, I will never take even a step in order  to  ban a Communist Party that will, I repeat, operate in the  interests of an independent Ukraine, or to forbid any person to  join that Communist Party. At the same time, I will fight to the  end the communist ideology or the nationalist ideology that  threatens our state.  <H5>  The Famine of 1933--Genocide of the Ukrainian Nation </H5>   [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, you often talk so persuasively  that one believes you. Will you be able to convince me that you,  the former leader of the ideological front of the Communist  Party, did not know about the year 1933? On one occasion, you  stated that you have only now learned from documents the true  facts about the famine in Ukraine. I had not previously read the  documents, either, but I conjectured and believed that this was  the annihilation of our Ukraine by Stalin's communist clique.  Did you really think otherwise?    [Kravchuk] I made my assessment on the basis of the facts I  knew.    [Zholdak] But you did know! Say that you did. After all, you  have stated that you did not.    [Kravchuk] I have stated that I did not know the real scope.  I said this because I had not seen the documents.    [Zholdak] However, you knew about the fact itself, about  this  having been the annihilation of Ukraine, of the Ukrainian  nation. They also exiled people from Latvia....    [Kravchuk] They exiled people from my village. Why go far?  However, knowing individual facts and seeing the entire panorama  are different things, different values for generalization. I  studied them, and later these documents were published when the  Communist Party was still in power.</p>

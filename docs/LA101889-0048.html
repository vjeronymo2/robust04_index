			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH TO RELAX ANTITRUST LAW, SOURCES CLAIM  </P> <P> Top Bush Administration officials plan to propose a significant relaxation of  antitrust law that would make it easier for rival U.S. companies to manufacture  products jointly, according to Administration sources.  </P> <P> The proposal is based on the theory -- disputed by some experts -- that by  operating factories jointly, American companies would perform better against  foreign competition, especially in capital-intensive, high-technology  industries such as robotics, semiconductors and high-definition TV.  </P> <P> Officials in the Commerce and Justice departments are spearheading the  proposal, and only a few details remain to be debated by senior policy-makers,  the sources said. "There is a consensus" on the approach, one official said.  </P> <P> The proposal's backers hope that it will strongly encourage American companies  to band together in manufacturing consortia similar to U.S. Memories, the  fledgling association of companies that is being formed to jointly produce the  computer-memory chips known as DRAMs. Proponents contend that if high-tech  companies are allowed to pool resources, they will be able to share the high  start-up costs and the risk of questionable returns that are more easily  absorbed by larger competitors overseas.  </P> <P> The proposal would fall far short of an open invitation for companies to join  forces in violation of current antitrust laws, which are aimed at preventing  competing firms from monopolizing markets and rigging prices. Companies seeking  to form manufacturing consortia would be required to notify the Justice  Department, which could block corporate alliances that it believed to be  harmful to competition -- just as it does now.  </P> <P> But one of the key provisions in the proposal would ease the fears that many  executives reportedly have about joining consortia. The provision would  eliminate the chances that a consortium's member firms could face civil suits  for treble damages under the antitrust laws.  </P> <P> At least five bills to encourage manufacturing consortia already have been  introduced in Congress, and the Administration proposal is motivated partly by  a desire to spur passage of such a law and to shape its final form. Atty. Gen.  Dick Thornburgh has long indicated that he favors permitting joint  manufacturing agreements, but it has not been clear up to now if and how the  Administration would want the law to be changed.  </P> <P> The proposal is expected to be greeted warmly on Capitol Hill, where fears are  widespread that U.S. industry is falling behind that in Japan and other  industrial countries. It is also likely to win support from industry; last  month eight trade associations, including the National Assn. of Manufacturers,  formed a coalition to support joint manufacturing initiatives.  </P> <P> But the idea has its critics. Opponents contend that U.S. companies perform  best when they are on their own and that creating consortia could make American  industry stodgy.  </P> <P> "Decreasing competition (in the United States) will not create strong  international businesses," said Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.) a member of the House  Judiciary Committee. "There is no evidence that the alleged decline in the  competitiveness of American business can be traced to the antitrust laws."  </P> <P> Others voice concern that the creation of big consortia could make life  extremely difficult for small, innovative firms in the same industries that are  not consortium members. "Why would any venture capitalist want to put his money  behind a start-up in any technology" in which a consortium was a major player?,  asked David Coelho, founder of two Silicon Valley companies, in recent  congressional testimony.  </P> <P> Officials cautioned that their decision is not final. "There is no  Administration position yet on the legislation," said James F. Rill, assistant  attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division.  </P> <P> But other officials said that after much informal discussion, senior  policy-makers have reached agreement on the thrust of the proposal. Among them  are Thornburgh; Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic  Advisers, and Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher. The proposal has been  delayed only because of a bureaucratic turf battle over how the interagency  process should advance the proposal, sources said.  </P> <P> The consensus proposal is more modest than one that had been backed by some  Commerce officials, who favored a process in which the Commerce and Justice  departments would grant certifications to consortia making them virtually  exempt from antitrust penalties. Opponents within the Administration objected  that the certification process could be a first step toward a federal  "industrial policy".  </P></p>

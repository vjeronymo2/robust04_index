In an article contributed to HANGYORE SINMUN Jan. 16, he  branded Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u as the main culprits in  illegally seizing "power" through the "December 12 coup".  Noting that the traitor Kim Yong-sam "invited" those guys to  "Chongwadae" [presidential office] allegedly for  "reconciliation", Paek Chong-su said such act could not be  overlooked.    There can be no "reconciliation" with Chon-No group, he  stated.</p>

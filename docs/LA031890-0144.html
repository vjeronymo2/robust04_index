			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CITY MIGHT TONE DOWN COLOR CODE  </P> <P> I can't believe it (the two-toned Dana Point Inn)! I worked so hard for  cityhood, and now I have somebody telling me what colors I have to like!  </P> <P> Poor Dana Point Inn! When I first saw the new paint job, I thought, "Hooray!  That dreadful drab, ugly grayish-blue is going to become an upbeat, soft,  Mediterranean peach" . . . which reminds me of Capri and southern France.  </P> <P> How nice!  </P> <P> But not so! Who are these people we hired who orchestrate every nuance of our  lives? Hey guys . . . power going to your collective heads? Next thing they'll  be painting the Ritz-Carlton grayish blue!  </P> <P> Think a minute. . . . We are not a whale-killing, blubber-processing New  England seacoast village. Like it or not -- and I like it -- our heritage is  Spanish. It suits our climate, our building resources (adobe), and it also  makes sense ecologically.  </P> <P> LESLEY M. IRBY  </P> <P> Dana Point  </P></p>

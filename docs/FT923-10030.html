			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Equity risks put damper on prospects - Philip Coggan surveys investment potential in world stock markets HOW SAFE is it for private investors to risk their money in the world's stock markets? There was some cheer this week when the FT-SE 100 rose nearly 50 points on Wednesday. But the UK market has fallen substantially over the summer, the Japanese market has been in retreat and the US market, although strong, is trading on valuations that would deter many British private investors. Some think that the world economy is facing one of its deep periodical crises. Economist Andrew Tylecote spells out the arguments in another article on this page. The bears claim the excesses of the 1980s are having their repercussions now. Companies and consumers are struggling to pay off debt; as a result, economic growth is sluggish. The problems are widespread. Japan: The Tokyo market is now 60 per cent below its peak at the end of 1989. Each time foreign investors have proclaimed that the bottom has been reached, the market has proved them wrong. Successive interest rate cuts, including one this week, have failed to produce a revival. Late in the 1980s, many Japanese stocks commanded stratospheric price-earnings ratios with the market p/e reaching 62 at the end of 1989, according to Datastream. Even after the recent collapse, the ratio is still over 30, well above the level prevailing in the UK. There have been repeated worries that the fall in share prices would cause problems for Japanese banks, which have large equity holdings. Given the role that Japanese investors play in the international financial markets, a banking collapse in Japan could have major repercussions on the world economy. 'You would have to observe that the risk of a major financial dislocation rooted in Tokyo is higher today than ever before,' says Nick Train of GT Management. Even the Japanese economic miracle is looking tarnished, with only 2 per cent GDP growth expected for the year - low by historical standards. Britain: Despite this week's mini-rally, the post-election euphoria has definitely worn off. Traders assumed that the return of John Major to Downing Street would restore consumer confidence and spark recovery. Instead, the chances are that 1992 will see a further decline in GDP. Meanwhile, the government's options are limited severely. Chancellor Norman Lamont has stated again and again his commitment to membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism and the present central rate of DM2.95/Pounds . With the Bundesbank determined to eliminate the inflationary effects of German reunification, that gives him no scope to cut British interest rates. The other classic mechanism for reviving an economy, fiscal policy, is constrained by a budget deficit already close to Pounds 30bn for the present year. United States: Although Wall Street has flirted repeatedly with its all-time high, the economy has struggled to live up to the stock market's optimism. Successive reductions in interest rates have produced only weak economic growth, as shown by the 1.4 per cent second-quarter rise in GDP. But with short-term interest rates not much over 3 per cent, equities still look attractive vis-a-vis cash. 'US stock prices reflect the most favourable monetary conditions that have existed for 30 years,' says Bill Smith, equity strategist at BZW. With the p/e ratio above 20, some feel that the US market is vulnerable to bad news, such as a defeat for George Bush in November's election. In view of all these risks, many cautious investors may feel safer sticking with the generous real returns available from the building society, gilts or national savings. Hardened contrarians may feel that, with all this gloomy news around, this must be a good time to buy shares. Certainly, the FT All-Share is yielding more than 5 per cent at the moment, a traditional sign of value in the equity market. BZW's Smith is looking for lower interest rates and earnings growth in the UK over the next year. But with the risks so high, only brave investors would plunge into the equity market. Cautious contrarians might try the safety-first method of investing via a monthly savings scheme.</p>

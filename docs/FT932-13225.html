			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / US 'will set' Japan market targets THE US is determined to set targets on opening up Japanese markets to American goods, Mr Ron Brown, US Secretary of Commerce, said in Tokyo yesterday. 'We are very serious about a results-oriented approach and measureable results and monitoring those results,' he said. 'The unfortunate fact of the matter is that despite the best efforts of our two governments, the Japanese market is still not truly open to American products.' Mr Brown spoke against a background of US frustration at a bilateral trade deficit in 1992 of nearly Dollars 50bn. He is in Tokyo for an international conference on assistance to Russia. But he arrived two days in advance for meetings with Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, Mr Kabun Muto, the foreign minister and Mr Yoshio Mori, trade and industry minister, which will highlight the tough stance the Clinton administration is adopting in its trade talks with Japan. The Japanese side, so far, has maintained that any attempts to impose quantitative targets will be vigorously resisted. Officials at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry have also tried to play down the implications of the tough rhetoric from the US by emphasising that there has been no formal proposal from the US on targets for specific sectors. While Japan insists that the shape of a new framework for bilateral trade talks has yet to be determined, the US has no doubts about what it is looking for in the new agreement. Mr Brown said that two new bilateral agreements will be drawn up to address both structural and sectoral issues. The US and Japan will work to remove barriers to market access in specific sectors which the US considers strategically crucial. Success will be measured by sales, he said. He also cited the US-Japan semiconductor arrangement, which refers to a 20 per cent market share for imports, as one example of a successful results-oriented approach. Despite Japanese insistence that it will not agree to quantifiable targets, Mr Brown was confident the two sides could reach agreement. Reducing the trade imbalance was in the best interests of Japan too, he said.</p>

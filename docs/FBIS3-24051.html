			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Roundtable discussion with St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy </F> Sobchak at the LITERATURNAYA GAZETA editorial offices; date not  given; published under the rubric "Club 206": "Anatoliy Sobchak:  It Hurts When a Great Power Has Such a Parliament"]    [Text] A. Udaltsov, editor in chief: Anatoliy  Aleksandrovich, you were one of the most prominent personalities  in our first (then all-Union) parliament. Tell us please, what  is your opinion of the current Federal Assembly?    A. Sobchak: Frankly, it hurts that a great power  has such a parliament. Unfortunately, many people who made it  there are absolutely unprepared for parliamentary work. There  are also people with a simply criminal mentality. We know that  so far the parliament has not adopted a single positive  decision. It is engaged in internal score-settling, endless  rallies, petty internal scandals, and defining its own status.    At the same time--and I have already said this more than  once  with different audiences--we are not seeing the results of the  12 December elections in the correct perspective. After all, we  did get a new Constitution and, for the first time, completely  different relations between citizen and state. Unfortunately,  very little is being said about this. Most importantly, for the  first time we held elections in an environment of a multiparty  system, by party lists (other than elections in single-seat  districts). Now about the results. In order for the results to  be different, we should have avoided mistakes--the government,  the president, and the political parties. But it was clear from  the very beginning that the new parliament would be a motley  crew.    Nevertheless, the elections did take place. There is a new  parliament. What its fate will be depends to a large extent on  itself. For me, the important part is that we will no longer be  in the same political dead end we have been in for more than two  years.    Looking back at the elections today, what remains to be done  is to analyze honestly, harshly, and objectively why the outcome  was completely different than that we had hoped for. When I say  "we," I mean politicians and organizations of a democratic  orientation. Nevertheless, we have taken a giant step down the  road of establishing democracy in Russia.    O. Moroz, editorial board member: It appears to me  that over the past two years you have faded as a politician. How  do you explain this? Are you counting on a second wind? Do you  intend to run for president in 1996? In your opinion, who will  be president?    A. Sobchak: Relatively faded... I myself do not  feel that I have faded... Because I have lived the last two  years at the limit of my abilities. I worked perhaps more, and  more actively, than previously in the parliament. When I came to  the parliament from academia, teaching seemed like leisure to  me. Now I am responsible for the life of a 5-million-strong  city, parliamentary work seems rather easy and free of  responsibilities. Here, the responsibility is different: You are  responsible for the life of a city where something happens every  day. Today it is a fire in the Admiralty; tomorrow an entire  rayon--300,000-400,000 people--is without heat, light, and  water. Or, for instance, the situation with purification  systems... City residents are not even aware of the situations  we encounter in the old city with decrepit communications.    That is why I perhaps do not participate in political life  as  actively as I did when I was a member of the Supreme Soviet and  the Congress. But I am involved in the work of the government,  the Presidential Council, and in drafting many decisions.    Being in power and having responsibility for the state of  the  city I could, of course, build up much greater popularity for  myself by criticizing decisions I disagreed with. Had I said in  the press and on television everything I say in the government  or at the Presidential Council, it would have given me much  greater popularity. There are things I could say and tell. But I  believe I should not do so. Because we are going through a very  difficult time. To hand over to the irreconcilable opposition my  own analysis of the mistakes and wrong decisions that have been  made, and are still being made, is to pour water on the mill of  the counter-reformers, the enemy (the latter definition is  simpler and more precise).    Over the past two years I have been asked many times whether  I intend to run in the presidential elections. And I have said  repeatedly for two years that I have a much simpler and more  modest task. I am facing reelection in 1996--the day the  president's term expires, my term as mayor also expires. Until  then I do not intend to go anywhere. I promised the people of my  city when I was running for mayor that I would work in the city  honestly and conscientiously for five years.    O. Moroz: What if Zhirinovskiy becomes president?    A. Sobchak: In the event the impossible does  happen and the country goes to Zhirinovskiy, I will do  everything I can to have Petersburg secede from Russia.    Now, about elections of a new president. Of course, we have  to start preparing for them now. As for myself, I am not  preparing for these elections for a number of reasons. One of  them is a superstitious feeling of self-preservation. Not a  single political figure from Leningrad or Petersburg fared well  after moving to Moscow. Most often their life ended prematurely  and violently.    A. Udaltsov: How, in your opinion, did a change of  course take place in connection with Gaydar's departure? Was  this course correct?    A. Sobchak: In principle, Gaydar's course was  absolutely correct. There is real proof of this. I will not  compare our economy with the Ukrainian, Belarusian, or any  other. Today we have already reached the point where the Russian  ruble is no longer termed "wooden." While other republics  consider their currencies "wooden" in relation to the Russian  ruble. I realize that 100 percent foreign currency  convertibility, at least in relation to these "semi-currencies,"  coupons, and such, is small consolation, but still. When I went  with the president to sign an agreement with Georgia, it was as  if we had returned to the end of 1991, except even worse: The  same distribution of basic foodstuffs by coupon, bread lines,  empty store counters... Returning to St. Petersburg, I  deliberately asked many people: Would you like to go back to  that today? Yes, many people are unhappy about prices. But would  you like to go back to December 1991, when there was a shortage  of everything? Everything except lines? I am convinced that not  a single person in Russia now, now that we have experienced  store saturation, is dreaming about the past, unless he is  playing political games.    The reform course had been chosen correctly. It was  impossible to make it without certain elements of shock therapy.  But from the very beginning a mistake, typical for Russia, was  made. While implementing the reform it was necessary to make  realistic adjustments to it. The idealistic straightforwardness  in the implementation of the reform was obvious.    In St. Petersburg our radical democrats accused me of  conservatism, shouting that I was shielding the nomenklatura.  All because I kept as advisers in the mayoralty many people from  the old nomenklatura who know how to work. I also advised  Gaydar: Have as advisers people who know the national economy.  The kind you can wake up in the middle of the might to tell you  what a plant in Nizhniy Tagil makes, what is produced in  Sverdlovsk and Petersburg, or where production of some or other  item can be set up. They are not being utilized today in any  way, but they have tremendous experience.    Yuriy Shchekochikhin, member of the editorial  board: I am interested to learn about the chief of the  Baltic Steam Line, Kharchenko. He was arrested for taking  bribes. Then he was let go. I know that considerable pressure  was brought on this "case." There was a letter of support from  Rostropovich, although I do not think they are acquainted. I  know that you, too, spoke in defense of Kharchenko. I think this  is not quite proper for a city mayor. It resembles the old party  obkom [oblast committee].    I am generally uncomfortable about a class approach to  corruption. If he is one of ours, he can do anything...    A. Sobchak: I think the entire definition of the  corruption issue is completely incorrect. I remember all those  conferences on corruption, Rutskoy's appointment as the man in  charge of combating this evil--before those 11 suitcases  surfaced. And mutual accusations? All this creates an absolutely  abnormal, distorted atmosphere of public life. It fogs the  environment, and then those who truly are corrupt, who take  bribes, remain in its shadows. While such people as Rutskoy and  Shumeyko slug it out. By the way, I am convinced that neither  one nor the other is corrupt. They, of all people, did not take  bribes. Meanwhile, the ordinary citizen, a Philistine, gets the  impression that they are all from the same lot.    Corruption is the main topic played up by the  counter-reformers, those who are fighting against democracy in  Russia. Their goal is to destroy confidence in the new authority.    This situation seems absolutely abnormal to me. Wherever we  are dealing with crime and corruption we have to have concrete  facts. Instead, people are pushed out of politics by talk and  rumors.    Now about Kharchenko. I took a very definite position on  this  matter because from the very beginning it acquired political  overtones. There were attempts to use it against the city  mayoralty and against me personally. I know that it was  organized at the directive of Moscow, because they needed an  example. This case came up right after the conference in the  Kremlin on combating corruption and crime. Comrade Rutskoy  proposed: Let us stop the idle talk; organize a few cases so  that people can see who steals and how. And suddenly, without  rhyme or reason, proceedings are initiated, and a man is  arrested right on the train. Why is it that all the repressions  in Stalin's time started in Leningrad? It is the most convenient  place to attract attention and give an example of what to combat  and how. I believe, however, that when a criminal case gets  political overtones, I, as the mayor of the city, as a political  figure, as a citizen, and as a jurist, have an obligation to  speak up. And not only with respect to Kharchenko. As to his  particular case, we will wait and see. Let us see how this case  ends and what kind of charges are brought. There are no bribes  involved there. He has nothing to do with corruption. For my  part this is not a class approach--it is the position of the  mayor of the city in which the chairman of the Union of  Entrepreneurs and State Enterprise Directors is arrested.  Economic managers turn to me: Why are we again being arrested,  grabbed in the street? Also, a taste has suddenly developed for  arresting... academicians. It is dangerous to fight gangsters.  An academician, on the other hand, especially on an economic  matter, on charges that he has allegedly set up an illegal  structure, may be taken right on the street, by people  brandishing submachine guns and pretending that they are  fighting mature criminals.    Unfortunately, today all talk of corruption is  phrase-mongering. I am telling you as a jurist. Until I see in  the Russian Criminal Code the words that corruption is a crime  consisting of such and such, as a jurist and a citizen I do not  want to discuss this evil altogether.    Yu. Kulikov, deputy editor in chief: In September  of last year, when Edict No. 1400 came out, could you foresee  the consequences it would lead to? After the events of that fall  the situation in the country, in my opinion, remained as  unsettled as before, if not worse. So was it worth it, as they  say, to start the scuffle?    A. Sobchak: Such a method of resolving a political  situation is altogether unacceptable. They could have, and  should have, done it without tanks shelling the parliament  building. Thus avoiding national shame. Of course, when you do  not know how to play chess, and the opponent starts winning, you  can take the chess board and slam him on the head with it. This  is the same: They could not win the game, so they slammed the  opponent on the head.    I was not the one to make this decision, however. The  Presidential Council is a consultative body. At its meetings we  only express our opinion, and the president has the right to  follow it or disregard it.    I want to emphasize, however, that when it got to the point  of armed rebellion, which is precisely what was happening in  Moscow, I did not have any doubt that force had to be used to  suppress the rebellion. Therefore, on my own initiative, I sent  two OMON [Special Designation Militia Detachments] regiments to  Moscow, leaving my city practically exposed. Since approximately  1600 on 3 October it was clear to me that this was a matter of  life or death. And of the future of the country. I gathered my  staff together; we discussed what was going to happen and what  we have to do if power in Moscow fell into the hands of the  rebels. I believed then and believe now that one has to fight  for his ideas rather than wait to be hanged on the first  available lamppost.    Yu. Solomonov, deputy editor in chief: If fascists  come to power in Russia, St. Petersburg can, of course, secede.  But do you not think that lumpenization of the population in the  city on the Neva is proceeding even faster than in Moscow? I  mean the numerous pro-fascist publications there, the mood, and  most importantly, movements and organizations of this bent.    A. Sobchak: Thank goodness, over the past three  years our city has not experienced the same kind of political  battles as other places. I consider it one of our main  achievements--the city lives a calm political life. We do not  prohibit anyone from holding rallies or demonstrations. And they  take place in a somewhat different key in our city...    Now about how we are fighting the spread of pro-fascist  attitudes. First and foremost, we are trying to restore  Petersburg as a spiritual and cultural center of Russia. Much  has already been done. For instance, not a single theater has  closed down. On the contrary, many new ones have opened. We try  to have cultural events take place in the city each day; we want  to turn it into a center of international festivals, meetings,  seminars. In addition to everything else, it may become one of  the distinguishing features of the city and one of the main  sources of revenue. Today I am doing everything to ensure that  no more plants are built in Petersburg. We are trying to move  production facilities away from the center, especially hazardous  ones. I think that most military-industrial complex enterprises  will die out. First and foremost because there are no people in  Petersburg today who would wish to do such hard unskilled work.  Take the Kirov Tractor Plant, where in the past a man--as a rule  covered with tattoos and rippling muscles--sat there and  tightened nuts on Kirovets wheels. Where did such a guy come  from? The general director would come to the obkom and say: I  need a residence permit for 5,000 "nut-tighteners." The  Leningrad Chief Construction Administration also brought in  about 20,000 construction workers a year, who were housed in  dormitories. This is where Zhirinovskiy's supporters come from.  They are well aware of this in Moscow. In place of the defense  sector, dozens of enterprises should arise, which will produce  all sorts of products for people. This is our future. By the  way, there are no factories in Paris...    I think it is in our common interest not to let the country  become the Russia of Zhirinovskiy. And this should not happen.  Such provincial fascism, a provincial political snow job at an  unbelievably primitive level... Russia will not allow it to  happen.    Yu. Solomonov: Germany also thought highly of  itself.    A. Sobchak: Still, history does not repeat itself.  People do learn from the mistakes of others or from tragedies of  the entire humanity. Therefore, what could happen in Germany at  the end of the 1920's-beginning of the 1930's cannot be repeated  in Russia at the end of the 1990's and beginning of the next  century.    Yu. Solomonov: All this is interesting to listen  to. We have to get rid of hazardous production. But is there not  an attempt at a certain social selection in all this? Your  colleague Yuriy Luzhkov put restrictions on the entry into  Moscow of persons of Caucasian ethnic origin. You put  restrictions on "nut-tighteners." This is not the way to improve  the quality of society and not the way to fight crime. You can,  of course, create "oases." But this milieu will exist somewhere  else and will coagulate into seats of social tension. At the  101st kilometer, perhaps?    A. Sobchak: Do not interpret me in such a  primitive way. We say that the city's profile needs to be  changed--not that Kirov plant workers should be thrown out on  the street. They must start doing other things. It is a job for  a robot to tighten nuts. A worker must move to another job that  will have more content, spirit, will transform him.    A. Sabov, commentator: You said that there are no  factories in Paris. There are factories in Paris. In Rome,  however, there is only one plant--it makes gas lighters. Rome is  completely a city of intelligentsia. But it is also a city of  strong right-wing traditions. The fascist electorate there is  very great. Therefore, ridding the city of proletarians does not  insure it against fascism. How many people in your city live  below the poverty line? As city mayor, what do you do above what  the central authorities do?    A. Sobchak: I would like to get rid right away of  such a formula as "getting rid of workers, of the proletariat."  We do not intend to get rid of anyone. I repeat once again: The  meaning of the program is to give these people different jobs.  So that they may do other things in the city. In particular, in  Paris, too, the Reno plant is not in the center of the city. As  for people living below the poverty level... This is one of the  main problems and difficulties of transition from one system to  another, building a principally new economy. The state may  succeed only if during the transition period it provides a  proper standard of living for the people and proper social  programs.    Journalists reproached Luzhkov for not wanting to let people  from the Caucasus come to Moscow. But this is not Luzhkov's  problem--it is a problem of a state that does not have borders.  When Russia sets up its borders and begins letting into Russia  only those it wants to let in on business or as tourists, then  it will be a different matter...    Until Russia has borders, it will be very difficult to fight  crime.    Now about social protection. Our city is special. Even  Moscow  cannot be compared with it. One and a half million out of 5  million of our population are pensioners, disabled, and  survivors of the blockade. These are the people who have found  themselves practically below the poverty level. And we were the  first in Russia who had to introduce allowances for them,  spending almost half the budget on it. Every quarter we  determine the subsistence minimum. And make up the difference to  those whose salaries or pensions are below that minimum. Of  course, because of this we build less housing, or do less of  some other things. But when I speak to the citizens of the city,  I always say that I cannot do otherwise. If you believe that  this is wrong--please, you have this right, collect enough votes  and recall me. As long as I am the mayor of the city, I cannot  stop caring for these million and a half people.    Thanks to some social measures, the city remains stable. Our  bread prices are still much lower than those in Moscow. Perhaps  this is the reason Zhirinovskiy came in only fourth in our city.  And the democrats as a whole took 65 percent of the vote.    D. Molchanov, commentator: You have said the word  "enemies" several times. This is a very strange trend. Do you  not believe that the authorities today deliberately are building  up the image of an enemy? And do you not think that this is  happening because, as experience shows, this authority can only  operate effectively in extreme situations?    A. Sobchak: I do not think so. The authority is  not creating the image of an enemy. It is simply that during the  transition period there are people who do not accept this  authority and are ready to fight it--not by political methods  but with arms. Which they have said many times. The same  Zhirinovskiy is already threatening to put many in "Sailor's  Rest." This is all much more serious than you think. For  instance, a few days ago in Petersburg a whole underground  munitions plant was liquidated. There are also armed groups  pursuing specific goals. By the way, we have already seen this  in the example of 3-4 October. This is not the image of an  enemy--these are real enemies. Perhaps those who take up arms  are not strictly speaking enemies, just confused people. But  those who are behind them are real enemies of Russia going the  way of democratization, of Russia becoming a democratic instead  of militaristic state, a state that works for its citizens. You  are mistaken if you think that someone is creating this image.    Here is the reality--in Petersburg as late as 1989, 76  percent of the economy was working for defense. This set the  stage for a real confrontation of interests. People who are  fighting to preserve this status are enemies of our society. We  should not be afraid of this word. If they really come to power,  they will shoot, root out all elements of democratic life.  Because they do not need it; it is against their interests.  Therefore we should say these things straight. The Moscow events  in October showed that the irreconcilable opposition has  well-armed, organized structures. And arms, and money, and  trained people. You cannot dismiss this.    And I cannot agree with you that the authority is effective  only in extreme situations. Had that been the case, today we  would be like Georgia. We do live somewhat differently.    A. Rubinov, commentator: As is known, you have  already been president... of the Consumers Union! So how can you  allow the offensive against the consumer to come from Leningrad  of all places. Your city, for instance, was the first to raise  public transportation rates. And yesterday there was a report  that in your city one has to pay now to get information on the  train schedule. The whole perestroyka started with charging for  the use of public restrooms.    A. Sobchak: In Norway it costs a dollar to use a  public restroom. The minimum wage there is $2,500, however...    Anatoliy Zakharovich, as a former president I will say this  to you, the former vice president of the Consumer Union. First,  your information regarding Leningrad introducing this is  somewhat incorrect. We always watch to make sure that our prices  are not higher than those in Moscow. In our city, for instance,  those who use public transportation pay only 14 percent of the  real cost of the ride. The real cost of a subway ride in  Petersburg today is R210. But the passenger pays only 14 percent.    A. Rubinov: Are there examples in the world where  public transportation is self-sustaining?    A. Sobchak: Everywhere.    A. Rubinov: Nowhere! Nowhere in the world!    A. Sobchak: Everywhere. Because the cost of using  public transportation in all developed countries is extremely  high. One subway ride in Norway costs $7... Now, about fees for  information. A journalist's ear is built somewhat differently  than that of other people. This information was reported this  morning. I heard it. This is what it said: We have learned that  the October Railroad administration is considering introducing  fees for information beginning next month... But you should know  that the Leningrad Station in Moscow also belongs to the October  Railroad. Therefore, if this is introduced, it will be in effect  not only in Petersburg but also in Moscow. As mayor, I will try  to interfere. To which the railroad chief will tell me: I plan  to make R200 million a year on this. I will tell him: All right,  I will pay you this R200 million, but do not disgrace our city  in front of the rest of Russia. That is all. But I cannot order  him.    A. Rubinov: If the MPS [Ministry of Railroads]  begins to charge for information, it will be more profitable for  it to keep changing the schedule than to stick to it. This way  the MPS will show a wonderful bottom line, while the trains will  be late even more often.    G. Tsitrinyak, commentator: A purely practical  question. The last time I saw ground attendants was about 15  years ago in the Maksim Trilogy movies. They were dispersing a  demonstration there. How is the situation with ground attendants  now?    And the second question. Do you not believe that people who  get maimed on city streets should get compensation from the city  treasury?    A. Sobchak: The second question is easy to answer.  We have legislation which assigns each city street to housing  offices and enterprises, which are legal entities. Therefore,  there is always someone to sue. The important part is to prove  that the accident was a result of appropriate measures not being  taken, or violation of existing regulations. Then the court will  award you compensation for damages. I happen to be a specialist  in this area. In almost all cases, those who turn to the court  get compensation for traumas received on the street.    Regarding grounds attendants. We have lost them, and normal  care of buildings along with them. Generally speaking, we will  have to do a lot to get things in order. For instance, the  mayoralty has appropriated R100 million to put lights in all  arch passageways in the center of the city. We have practically  completed this work. We are also restoring the position of  grounds attendant. Although this is a very costly undertaking.  It will cost the city budget about R10-15 billion.    Yu. Kulikov: In your future book, which  LITERATURNAYA GAZETA recently referred to, you maintain that the  LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] and its leader are a  creation of the KGB and the CPSU Central Committee. However,  Gorbachev immediately refuted your statement...    A. Sobchak: Yes, I am writing a book "There Once  Was a Communist Party..." It will contain quite a few  little-known facts and details. In particular, this story.  Mikhail Sergeyevich says that Sobchak was not present at that  particular Politburo meeting, and that it did not adopt a  decision regarding the LDPR. But this is not what I am saying.  An opinion, as they say, was floated, an idea--to take the  process of formation of a multiparty system under control. And  the first party that was officially registered after Article 6  had been repealed was the liberal democrats. It was organized  quite quickly, efficiently, and yes, with the participation of  these organs. When I publish this book, it will tell all of this  in detail; I will quote documents, materials, persons. Because I  realize that if I do so without substantiation, I will be facing  lawsuits.    A. Udaltsov: Of course, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA also  took part in preparing society for democratic changes. But then  we saw how much blood was spilled. In Tbilisi, Vilnius, the  Dniester Area, Tajikistan, Karabakh. Was there a different way  to democracy--bloodless? And do you have any new viewpoint on  those events in Tbilisi?    A. Sobchak: The first question, I think, belongs  to the realm of scholastic reasoning. Life, politics, consists  of realities. If we study the real experience of other countries  we can see that a different transition was possible. With less  blood, fewer losses. But let us recall how the transition from a  totalitarian regime to democracy was carried out in postwar  Germany or Japan. They lived in an occupation regime. The  disciplined Germans, those who had been members of the Nazi  party, were simply ordered to join parties of a liberal and  Christian democratic orientation. They did so. In the final  analysis it was all accomplished without bloodshed.    I am not sure that without an occupation regime there they  would have managed without bloodshed. But if there are no  renewal processes in society, it will simply perish. If Genscher  thinks he destroyed communism, it is because he wants to think  this of himself. The communist system destroyed itself. It was  not the democrats who overthrew this regime in 1991. Because if  you read what we were writing and saying as late as the summer  of 1991, you will see that our plans assumed many years of  existence of the Communist Party. But it all collapsed, and not  because of some CIA intrigues or Genscher's activities--it  imploded. Because it could no longer exist. That is all there is.    About the Tbilisi events. I recently met with Boris  Nikolskiy, a former secretary of the Communist Party of Georgia  Central Committee. He is still convinced that the main mistake  was that the action was not tough enough. Had it been tougher,  more decisive, everything would be in order. This is a  tremendous delusion! And the impotence of the authority.  Patiashvili and other Georgian leaders instinctively felt their  impotence. All the rayon and lower level party committees  apparently function, but then suddenly some people appear out of  nowhere, gather a rally, and people follow them. The authorities  can do nothing about it.    This impotence of the authorities begets fear. And fear  begets an inclination toward violent solutions. Had the massacre  not taken place in Tbilisi on 9 April, I am convinced that we  would not have this provincial fascism Gamsakhurdia brought with  him (it is Georgians themselves who found this very precise  description of this regime). There would be no Gamsakhurdia. On  the wave of that massacre, however, he grew into a political  figure of major proportions and managed to convince the entire  nation over a very short period of time that they do not live  well because Russia is squeezing all the life juices from them.  Georgia has everything, he said. As soon as we close the border  with Russia, separate ourselves from it, the nation will recover  and live well. Only a man who is absolutely sick or completely  ignorant in economics could say that. He was both--sick and  ignorant. And he still convinced the people that Georgia would  survive without Russian oil, gas, grain, and many Russian  things. But the fact is that many republics had been subsidized  by Russia. Just like in Russia many autonomies are subsidized by  Petersburg and Moscow, Tyumen, and about 10 other regions. What  is happening is that the excess emotions to which people are  prone are being played on. We have been conditioned by all our  history to create idols for ourselves. This is where our  serfdom, slavery, manifests itself. We cannot do without idols.  Both Georgians, and we, Russians. When we become a civil  society, it will live without idols. It will not talk endlessly  about the president and chairman of the government. This should  be the last thing to interest people. And it is all because a  free man lives with less dependency on the state than we, unfree  people, live today.</p>

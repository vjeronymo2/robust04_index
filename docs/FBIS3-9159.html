The meeting at the Russian Embassy here, organised by  Russia's special envoy to ex-Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin in  coordination with U.S. officials, is the first of its kind to be  held in the Croatian capital under the auspices of the UN  Protection Force (UNPROFOR).    The two sides last year held several similar meetings in  Norway and Austria -- with the Serbs demanding neutral territory  for the talks -- but without success because of Serb insistence  on autonomy for the Serb-dominated Krajina region which they  have proclaimed an independent "republic."    John Mills, the spokesman for the international peace  conference on former Yugoslavia, told journalists the  discussions would focus on "a comprehensive ceasefire and  separation of forces" of the two factions.    The Serbs of Krajina occupy a quarter of Croatian territory,  and Mills acknowledged that separating the two forces was a  "very difficult problem."    Zagreb has until now opposed any withdrawal of Croatian  forces across a demarcation line, which would imply UN  involvement, on the ground that this would undermine Croatia's  sovereignty.    Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has ruled out any kind of  "enlarged autonomy" for the separatist Serbs and is demanding  the unconditional return to Croatia of Krajina, a UN protected  area.    Last week he asked the UN Security Council to authorise the  use of force to disarm the rebels and he is insisting that the  UN peacekeepers, whose mandate for operations in Croatia is up  for renewal at the end of March, maintain strict control of the  border.    Churkin has worked closely with his White House counterpart  Charles Redman, who helped broker the Croat-Moslem agreement on  a federation in Bosnia that was sealed in Washington on Friday.    But further progress in efforts to end more than two years  of  fighting in former Yugoslavia now depends on a solution to the  "Serb question".    "The first thing to do is to sign a very solid document,  which will ensure that fighting will not return in and around"  the Krajina region, Churkin said last week following talks in  Zagreb and Belgrade which laid the ground for Tuesday's meeting.    Two international mediators, Norwegian ambassador Kai Aide,  representing the United Nations, and his German counterpart,  Gert Ahrens, representing the European Union, were attending the  meeting here Tuesday along with U.S. Ambassador Peter Galbraith.    Representing the Croatian delegation were Hrvoje Sarinic,  head of the secret police and liaison officer with the UNPROFOR,  and Slavko Degoricija.    The separatists were represented by Rear Admiral Dusan  Rakic,  who is the rebel Serbs "defence minister", Slobodan Jarcevic,  the "foreign minister" and Mile Novakovic, in charge of security.    Croatian intellectuals, opposed to any dialogue with the  Serbs who they consider to be war criminals, have called a  protest demonstration in central Zagreb later in the day.</p>

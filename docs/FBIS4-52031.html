			<p>CSO     [Text] Argument To Lift Ban on Holding Companies  Resurfaces--Federal Trade Commission Alleges "Threat to  Antimonopoly Law" and Faces Difficult Decision    Debate has resurfaced on the holding company concept banned  by the Antimonopoly Law. The reason is that the business world,  which advocates lifting the ban, has involved foreign firms in  its tactics by using the logic that "the change is necessary to  encourage direct foreign capital investment in Japan." It is  said that, foreign firms of Europe and the United States are  voicing strong sentiments that "we would like to establish  holding companies in Japan and launch operations in different  industries." The business world is stepping up its movements in  such a direction with the help of foreign firms, and it appears  that the Fair Trade Commission [FTC] will be facing the  situation where it will have to make some difficult decisions.    At the beginning of this month Keidanren [Japan Federation  of  Economic Organizations] compiled and presented an emergency  recommendation package to the Management and Coordination Agency  [MCA] saying, "We should revise section 9 of the Antimonopoly  Law." The recommendation package includes plans for encouraging  direct investment in Japan by foreign firms, but a major  provision of the plan includes lifting the ban on holding  companies which is stipulated in section 9 of the Antimonopoly  Law. On the 24th, in a meeting at which Keidanren and the MCA  exchanged opinions, Isao Nakauchi, Keidanren vice president and  chairman and president of Daiei, restated the request to  Director General Ishida for approval of the recommendation  package.  <H5>  Keidanren Assumes Aggressive Stance </H5>   A holding company owns stock in a firm to control the  latter's operations, but the Antimonopoly Law prohibits such  ownership with the belief that it allows for specific firms to  control markets and restrain competition. However, holding  companies provide the advantage of maneuverability in business  operations. The reason is that holding companies can serve as  command posts whence decisions can be made to spin off promising  operations to form strategic subsidiaries, while facilitating  the consolidation of companies whose operations are not  promising.    Holding companies are sanctioned in Europe and the United  States. According to Keidanren, European and U.S. firms and  firms owned by foreign interests have displayed increasing  interest in "establishing holding companies in Japan and  engaging in a variety of business operations." Concurrently,  increasing discontent is voiced in comments such as "holding  companies are authorized in our homeland, but why is it that  they are not allowed in Japan?"    Keidanren, on a mid- and long-range basis, is endeavoring to  cultivate a scenario in which the holding company ban will be  lifted. In the current form in which financial institutions own  100 percent of subsidiary companies, there is not adequate  provision for entry into other business forms and the financial  industry plans to present the holding company format as a new  approach. Industry as a whole plans to use a strategy of timing  its argument that "it would be illogical to allow holding  companies in the financial industry only" so it coincides with  the broaching of the issue by the financial industry and thus  seek equal treatment for industry as a whole. Although there is  strong resistance to changing the law, Keidanren plans on a  lengthy but persistent strategy.  <H5>  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry Also </H5> Lobbies for Change    This is not the first time that the business world has  lobbied for a lifting of the ban. Controversy over the issue was  also generated in the latter half of the 1960's, when the tide  for deregulating capital movement approached and there was a cry  for shoring up the competitiveness of domestic firms. As  recently as October 1992, the Keizai Doyukai [Japan Association  of Corporate Executives] called for lifting the ban in a package  of recommendations on corporate legislation.    A common characteristic found in corporate arguments for  lifting the ban is that "holding companies will enhance  management efficiency and be useful in shoring up  competitiveness." Generally speaking, expanding organizational  structures tends to detract from rapid dissemination of  information and the decisionmaking process and lowers  efficiency. The proposed lifting of the ban envisions the  breakout of operating divisions into subsidiaries to improve  efficiency and to use such changes to enhance operations of the  group as a whole.    In response to such positions taken by the business world,  the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] has  begun to negotiate with the FTC. In November 1993, the  Industrial Structural Council, a MITI advisory organ, issued an  intermediate recommendation calling for a revision of the  regulations on holding companies as a means to facilitate  restructuring of businesses. MITI has arrived at the conclusion  that competition among subsidiaries of various holding companies  which succeed in attaining efficiency, will revitalize the  Japanese economy.    In response to such assertions, the FTC shows no sign of  changing its position, as stated by commission chairman Masami  Kogayu: "The holding company concept undermines the basic  concepts of the Antimonopoly Law and we have no intent of  approving the proposed changes." If holding companies are  recognized, it will lead to the creation of powerful corporate  groups that exercise strong control over markets and would pose  the risk of excluding new market entrants. There is the strong  sense of crisis that competition would be restrained and the  overall efficiency of the economy would be undermined.    On the other hand, Japanese corporate holdings of outside  firms are relatively high and, as can be seen among corporate  groups, interlocking ownership of stocks is widespread.  Commission chairman Kogayu says that "corporate groups would be  stronger" if holding companies were sanctioned under such  conditions. He fears that the result may be an exacerbation of  distrust by foreign nations, including the United States which  asserts that "Japanese markets are exclusionary."  <H5>  Debate Lacks Meeting of Minds </H5>   At present there is no meeting of the minds in the debate  between the business world and the FTC. FTC officials rebut  arguments to lift the ban as a means of promoting foreign  capital investment in Japan by commenting, "It would not be fair  to sanction holding companies for foreign capital only. If they  are to be approved, they should be authorized for Japanese firms  as well, but that is impossible."    However, "external pressure" is about to become a lever in  the business world's drive for lifting of the ban and the debate  concerning holding companies appears to be headed for a higher  level of intensity.</p>

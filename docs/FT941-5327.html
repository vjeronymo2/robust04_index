			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up Secondary market A sharp collapse in the price of secondary market emerging market debt has left many traders in the paper nursing losses. Among prominent traders, JP Morgan, the top-ranked New York bank, saw its shares fall last week as reports swept the market that it had lost money in both emerging market debt and derivatives trading. Simply holding the paper has been enough to help some traders to riches as prices rose relentlessly over the past few years. But losses since the market peaked in mid-January have been rapid. An index calculated by West Merchant Bank - which includes both Brady bonds and restructured bank loans - has fallen almost 13 per cent since it peaked in mid-January. Falls were sharpest in countries that have yet to achieve a Brady debt restructuring. Russian paper lost the most as the price fell more than 40 per cent to just over 30 cents on the dollar. Other big losers were Peru, off more than 25 per cent, Nigeria, down 22 per cent, and Panama, down 20 per cent. VENEZUELA Venezuela became the first country with outstanding Brady bonds to be downgraded when Standard &amp; Poor's lowered its ratings on the republic's Eurobonds to double-B minus from double-B. About Dollars 2.1bn of foreign currency-denominated debt is affected. It has revised its outlook to stable from negative. S &amp; P said the downgrade stemmed from a further substantial weakening in the country's public finances in recent months and uncertain prospects that the new government can pursue effective fiscal and economic reforms over the medium term. MANILA The country's two stock exchange trading floors - in the Ortigas Centre and the Makati financial district - began their merger by trading one stock at a single price last Friday. It is hoped to complete the process in about two weeks. LONDON The Investment Bank of Latvia has signed an equity agreement with the EBRD. The equity stake is the first foreign participation in the bank, and represents 35 per cent of its capital. The LIB, established in 1992, aims to promote Latvia's economic development by lending hard currency to the private sector. Lending goes mainly into the wood processing sector, but also into tourism, harbour facilities and light industry. CAIRO Egypt is considering offering shares of some 314 public sector companies for public subscription. The government has said that about 90 of 360 state companies were running at a loss, with debts of about Dollars 16bn. BRATISLAVA Direct foreign investment to Slovakia was about Dollars 135m in 1993, down from Dollars 151m in 1992, the Slovak statistical bureau has said. Foreign capital investment since the communist government fell in 1989 has totalled Dollars 366.2m. Austria was the leading investor from 1990 to 1993 with Dollars 87m placed in 1,141 companies. Germany followed with Dollars 77m in 743 companies. The US has invested Dollars 47m in 161 companies, and the Czech Republic Dollars 40m in 666 companies.

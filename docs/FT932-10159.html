			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Balladur lightens welfare load on payrolls: Proposals to ease social security pressures PRIME Minister Edouard Balladur yesterday took a couple of steps towards financing more of the French welfare state out of general taxation and less out of the payroll contributions that help generate France's chronically high unemployment His two main proposals here are an increase from 1.1 to 2.4 per cent in the so-called generalised social contribution (CSG) - a kind of income tax whose proceeds go to funding social security - and a shift in some of the 'social' payroll contributions, which employers have to make for lower-paid workers, to the charge of the state. This shift will only involve some FFr4.5bn (Pounds 535m) this year but eventually Mr Balladur hopes to transfer the cost of all family allowances, running at nearly FFr200bn a year, off the backs of employers and onto the state budget. The problem which Mr Balladur is tackling is that France puts more of the burden of its welfare system on its active workforce than any other EC country. Social security contributions by employers/employees accounted for 44.2 per cent of tax receipts in France in 1990, compared with a Community average of 28.4 per cent, 17.5 per cent in Britain and only 3.1 per cent in Denmark (which has the opposite bias, loading virtually all welfare costs onto general taxation). This has given French employers a particular financial incentive to shed labour, so that more than 3m are now out of a job. The more people drop out of the active workforce, the fewer are left to finance the welfare system on which correspondingly greater demands are made in a time of high unemployment (hence, the deficits shown in the accompanying table). But Mr Balladur's reforms do not go very far, though he has proposed setting up a 'solidarity fund' to cover the accumulated social security debt, which a government-ordered audit last week forecast - without yesterday's corrective measures - would rise to nearly FFr135bn by the end of this year. Increasing the CSG is a very useful of righting the imbalance in welfare funding. It bears not only on salaries, but also on unearned income such as dividends, and is therefore more 'progressive' than social security contributions. But it was introduced in 1990 by the Socialists, and as such is strongly disliked by Mr Balladur's conservative coalition. As a sop to his supporters, Mr Balladur is proposing that the extra 1.3 per cent in CSG payments should be deductible from individuals' income tax. This will only add to the many deductions which taxpayers can take. According to Banque Indosuez, only half of households pay income tax at all, compared with three quarters in most other industrialised countries. For those who do pay something to the fisc (tax office), deductions allow them to take an average of half their disposable income out of their taxable income. Mr Balladur was responsible for narrowing the income tax base when he was finance minister in 1986-88. Now heading a government which promised to put more into people's pockets than it takes out, he did nothing yesterday to remedy his earlier acts. But he is looking to Mrs Simone Veil, the ministerial overlord for social services, to find FFr30bn savings up to the end of 1994 in the health system, Europe's most generous. According to OECD figures, France spends an average FFr10,000 keeping each citizen healthy. Mr Balladur is proposing that the French should work a bit longer for a slightly less generous pension. At present, they qualify for a full pension after 37.5 years of work; this threshold would be raised gradually to 40 years. At the moment, pension levels are based on the average of a workers' 10 best-paid years; the level will now be calculated over a 25-year period. But France still faces the problem that, along only with Italy inside the EC, its pension system is still run hand-to-mouth, with contributions coming in from the employed forming the sole source of money being paid out. Unlike the other 10 EC states, France does not yet have private pensions funds, invested in the stock market and providing a supplement to the state scheme.</p>

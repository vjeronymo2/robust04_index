			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Aggressive terms for World Bank L300bn deal THE WORLD BANK tapped the Eurolira sector of the international bond market yesterday, issuing L300bn of 10-year bonds on what were seen as characteristically aggressive terms. The bonds have a coupon of 9.45 per cent and yielded 9.47 per cent at full fees (a price of 99.875). By comparison, one dealer pointed to OKB, the Austrian state-backed financial institution, whose 9.5 per cent 10-year Eurolira bonds were trading to yield 9.55 per cent. 'The (World Bank) deal is quite aggressive, but it is going well,' said one participating bank, reporting interest from retail and institutional investors in Germany, the Benelux countries and Switzerland. Another banker said: 'It is priced on the tight side, so it won't rush away, but it will get done.' The bonds were quoted at 99.90 - 99.95 by mid-afternoon. New issue activity in the international bond market appeared to have slowed down yesterday, with only a clutch of deals. The dragon bond market, regarded by many as still being in its infancy, saw a further development with the launch of the first Canadian dollar deal targeted at Far Eastern investors. Canada's Export Development Corporation launched a CDollars 250m, five-year dragon bond issue with a yield spread of 29 basis points over the Canadian government benchmark, giving a yield of 6.74 per cent. 'The borrower has a requirement for Canadian dollars. It was sounding out the Eurobond market, then decided to raise its profile in the Far East with a dragon bond issue,' said Mr Andrew Ferguson, deputy managing director of Wardley Capital Limited, which was book-runner for the deal. The bonds were sold mostly in Hong Kong, although there was some buying interest from Singapore and Korea. Participating banks noted good demand and described the deal as fairly priced. Latin American names continued to tap the international bond market. Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior, the Mexican state-run foreign trade development bank, is issuing Dollars 200m of 10-year notes as trustee for a special purpose Mexican business trust called Huites Trust. The financing is intended to help pay for the construction of a dam and hydro-electricity facility in Mexico. The bonds will be priced to yield around 230 basis points over the US Treasury bond. Lehman Brothers, the book-runner, said the pricing is in line with that on Bancomext's recent Yankee bond issue, a seven-year deal yielding 215 basis points over the US Treasury bond.</p>

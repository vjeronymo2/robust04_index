			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Kjell Dragnes report: "Norwegian UN Force Leaves Somalia"] </F>   [Text] The Norwegian UN force in Bosnia is now being  withdrawn. The main group will come home Sunday [20 March].  Approximately 120 of the Norwegian soldiers who have served in  the headquarters company in the Somalian capital of Mogadishu  will arrive by plane in Gardermoen. They will then continue on  to Onsrud barracks for medical tests and to hand in all their  equipment before being dismissed.    "Once again, it will be a withdrawal command group  comprising  10 men that will monitor the loading and shipping of equipment,"  said Colonel Ove Stromberg of FDI 4/IR4 [expansion unknown] in  charge of mobilizing the UN forces in that country. The group  in question will be traveling home just before Easter, leaving  behind just five Norwegians who will help the remaining UN force  to take over the headquarters. These last five men will return  in early May.    Most of the equipment that the Norwegian company had at its  disposal will be transported back to Norway, while some will be  sold in Somalia, and Stromberg revealed that some will also be  given to aid organizations.  <H5>  Check </H5>   Once they have returned, both troops and officers will be  subjected to the same procedures as all UN troops undergo.  These will comprise a medical check and talks, and Onsrud also  intends to take up contact with the civil health authorities  covering the areas where the soldiers live to ask them to do any  necessary follow-up. This is something that has been done in the  wake of a major UNIFIL [UN Interim Force in Lebanon] study of  servicemen who had returned from Lebanon.    It has been suggested that the Somalia company will be  eligible for transfer to Bosnia, but Stromberg ruled this out.  The troops will be dismissed in the usual manner, although it  is of course by no means out of the question that some of them  will be selected again -- say for service in Bosnia, he said.    UN duty is beginning to be a heavy burden on the Norwegian  defense authorities, and certain categories of specialized  personnel are extremely hard to find. This is the case, for  example, for mechanics, who are meant to keep the fleet of  vehicles in good running order. It is also proving difficult to  find enough people in the medical service. The defense  authorities want a form of rotation so that UN service does not  become a "life-style" and would prefer to see around 25 percent  of personnel receiving new contracts. However, in some groups  this percentage is already close to 40.    Indian and Pakistani troops will now be the main force  within  UNOSOM -- the UN force in Somalia. The force totals 20,000 men.  The U.S. forces will be out of the country before the end of the  month.</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Rao begins mission to Moscow: Indian PM hopes to restore relations set back by Soviet collapse India's prime minister, Mr Narasimha Rao, begins a four-day visit to Russia today which he hopes will lead to improved trade and diplomatic relations between the two countries. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 dealt a severe blow to the inter-dependence that had lasted 40 years. Mr Rao and his team of four top ministers and key bureaucrats - the most senior to accompany an Indian premier in recent years - hope the visit will begin a new chapter in Indo-Russian relations, where pragmatism and mutual interest would replace the special, often unequal, relationship the two countries shared as allies against the US in the cold war era. 'The fact that the prime minister chose to visit Washington (in May) before Moscow, signals a definite change in our foreign policy,' said an official in Mr Rao's office. India wants to resolve fully the three-year dispute over its Rs380bn (Pounds 7.8bn) debt to the former Soviet Union, a serious obstacle to trade relations. President Boris Yeltsin's visit to India in January last year led to a partial settlement after prolonged disagreement about the rate of repayment following the rouble's dramatic crash. On the eve of Mr Rao's departure, New Delhi has responded favourably to a Russian proposal that it be allowed to set up joint ventures with the rupee funds of Rs30bn that India repays each year to clear its rouble debt. The Russians have been unhappy with the present arrangement, under which rupee funds can be used by Russia only for the purchase of goods and services from India. 'The decision to accept the Russian proposal reflects that we are as anxious as the Russians that the large corpus of rupee funds be utilised,' said a foreign office spokesman. 'Neither India nor Russia benefits if the funds lie idle.' Strengthening co-operation over military technology is high on the agenda of both countries. India has been dependent on the former Soviet Union for most of its defence equipment, and was one of the largest beneficiaries of the former Kremlin policy of supplying arms to the Soviet bloc and to developing countries which had little means of paying for them. Until 1991, India enjoyed a special trade arrangement with Moscow which allowed military equipment to be procured on soft credit and against a rupee payment (the rupee is not yet a convertible currency). Though the new relationship is no longer as beneficial to India, the country needs a constant supply of spares and arms, including sensitive high-technology weapons it cannot secure from the west, such as engines for missiles. Russia, on the other hand, would like to retain its single-largest customer for military equipment. The two sides are to sign more than 10 agreements, demonstrating a shared understanding on issues ranging from common strategic perceptions to the standardisation of weights and measures. Two political agreements will be signed. One broadly lays out the new framework of relations between the two countries in the post-cold war world; the other reiterates common geopolitical perceptions. Officials say it is unlikely there will be any emphasis on the issue of nuclear non-proliferation. Russia is as keen as the US that India adhere to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. A senior bureaucrat in the foreign office said: 'Russia does not see eye to eye with us on many issues, including non-proliferation, and India's entry as a permanent member of the Security Council in a restructured UN. But we are trying to work out a mutually beneficial new relationship, instead of being bogged down by our many differences.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``(c) In no case of an adult who is not well and favorably known to the principal consular officer should an immigration visa be issued outside of the alien's home foreign district without notification to, and receipt of clearance from, the consular officer in the alien's foreign home district, the principal consular office in the foreign country of the alien's nationality, or the principal consular office in the foreign country of the alien's birth, whichever is the nearest office most likely to have a previous record regarding the alien.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``(d) For the purposes of this section an alien's foreign home district shall ordinarily be considered as that district of a foreign country in which the alien has a domicile, or in which he has lived for the last five years. However, an alien who has in good faith abandoned his domicile in his former home country without any purpose of circumventing the immigration laws of the United States may have his visa application accepted at an American consular office in the district in which he may be temporarily residing or sojourning while awaiting an opportunity to immigrate into the United States. In such cases, however, the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``(e) Questionable cases may be reported to the Department for a ruling on the question of jurisdiction.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This regulation remained in effect until promulgation of the revised visa regulations implementing the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The pertinent provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act_section 222(a)_is similar to its predecessor_section 7 of the Immigration Act of 1924_but is also different from it in very significant ways. Unlike its predecessor, which was silent on the subject of place of application, section 222(a) specifically authorizes the Secretary of State to provide by regulation for place of application. The legislative process which led to this provision is of interest because the commenter apparently encountered a portion of it and misunderstood what was occurring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As introduced, both H.R. 5678 (Cong. Walter) and S. 2550 (Sen. McCarran) included in the proposed new section INA 222(a) the following sentence_``Such application shall be filed only with the consular officer in whose district the applicant shall have established his residence, except that an application for an immigrant visa under the Displaced Persons Act of 1948, as amended, and under INA 101(a)(27) may be filed with such consular officer as may be designated by regulations.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the legislative process in the Senate, this sentence remained unchanged and was, thus, a part of the bill when it was approved by the Senate. In the House, however, the Judiciary Committee approved a series of amendments to Mr. Walter's original text, one of which (Amendment 9) deleted the sentence from H.R. 5678. The text of Amendment 9 appears at page 2 of House Report 1365 of February 14, 1952, which accompanied H.R. 5768, and there is, at page 54 of the Report, a paragraph which explains the amendment and the thinking of the Committee in making it. The paragraph, in its entirety, reads as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Amendment 9 (to sec. 222) reflects the committee's cognizance of the unprecedented number of persons who have been uprooted and dislocated during World War II or due to events subsequent thereto. The amendment is designed to alleviate hardship which might be caused by a rigid requirement that visa applications `shall be filed only with the consular officer in whose district the applicant shall have established his residence.' It is believed that the Secretary of State will, by regulations provide for a more flexible requirement regarding the place of filing of visa applications in both nonimmigrant and immigrant cases. Existing regulations could very well serve as a pattern for the new rules to be promulgated.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of this particular amendment, H.R. 5678, as approved by the House of Representatives, contained no statutory provision whatever regarding place of application. Thus, the question of how to deal with place of application for an immigrant visa had to be disposed of in the conference on the differing House and Senate versions. The Conference Report on H.R. 5678_House Report 2096 of June 9, 1952_sets forth the text of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as enacted. The sentence establishing the restrictive rule about place of application was dropped and the phrase ``and at such place'' was inserted in the first sentence of section 222(a). While the Statement of Managers on the Part of the House (at pp. 127&hyph;29 of House Report 2096) is silent on this subject and there is no statement of the Senate managers, the Department believes it fair to conclude that the Congress, after due consideration of the issue, consciously decided to leave the determination of place of immigrant visa application to the Secretary of State and to make that decision explicit by codifying it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

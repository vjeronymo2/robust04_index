			<p>BFN     [Text] Senior officials of ASEAN will meet in Phatthaya a  week tomorrow to discuss remaining matters concerning the  forthcoming first ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in Bangkok.    The senior officials are expected to agree during the  three-day meeting on the structure and formalities concerning  the Forum as well as agendas for discussion.    They will also discuss preparations for the 27th ASEAN  Ministerial Meetings (AMM) to be held for two days immediately  prior to the Regional Forum, which is scheduled for July 25.    Should all matters not be decided on during the meeting in  Phatthaya, the officials will meet again next month prior to the  preparatory meeting set for May 23 and 25 for the ASEAN Post  Ministerial Conference (PMC), according to a senior ASEAN  official.    The annual PMC meeting, which includes ASEAN states and  their  seven dialogue countries, will be held on July 26 and 27  following the ARF. At a previous round of ASEAN senior  officials' preparatory meetings in March, three issues were  proposed for discussion at the Forum.    They were: Asia-Pacific security now and in the future,  confidence building measures and preventive diplomacy.    According to the official, Indonesian officials will be  asked  during the meeting in Phatthaya to elaborate on how to frame the  discussion on preventive diplomacy.    There was also a proposal that a group of "eminent persons"  or a committee could be set up to follow up on issues being  discussed so they could be proposed at the next ARF.    The official added that there could be new proposals  concerning how to make the ARF more meaningful. He did not  elaborate.    Senior officials at the Phatthaya meeting will also have a  working lunch with ASEAN-based Institute of Strategic and  International Studies (ISIS) to discuss new ARF input from the  academic institution. The first ASEAN-ISIS meeting was held in  Singapore last year.    The senior officials however already agreed that the ARF  Forum will be attended by foreign ministers from 18 countries  comprising the six ASEAN states, seven ASEAN dialogue countries,  Vietnam, Laos and Papua New Guinea as ASEAN observers and China  and Russia as ASEAN guests. The ministers could each be  accompanied in the meeting by either one senior officer or one  interpreter.    They also agreed that the Forum should aim first at  promoting  confidence building and that the topic of discussion should  neither be too broad nor too restrictive and the discussion  neither too academic nor too light.    The Forum, they agreed, should rather make all participants  comfortable enough to speak out. Such an atmosphere in itself  will encourage candid discussions that will lead to the  realization of the meeting's aspiration for confidence building.    They also agreed in principle to the concept of a UN Arms  Register in response to the Philippines' proposal on setting up  a Regional Arms Registry as a means to promote confidence.    The Phatthaya meeting is unlikely to further elaborate on  such a proposal, however, the same official said.    Concerning the AMM meeting, Burma will be attending as the  guest of the host, Thailand, and Foreign Minister Prasong  Sunsiri, as current chairman of the ASEAN Standing Committee,  will convey this message when he visits Rangoon on Tuesday and  Wednesday.    A Thai source yesterday said discussion among ASEAN members  about Burma's participation could be open-ended depending on  developments inside Burma, despite the initial ASEAN consensus  on Rangoon's participation.    Cambodia will be attending the AMM meeting as ASEAN's  special  guest.    Thailand might call for an ASEAN approach to the current  situation in Cambodia, the source said without elaborating.</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Names force out details on agencies Hard-hit members of Lloyd's of London yesterday won a court order forcing details to be given on the level of insurance cover bought by the professional agencies they are suing to meet possible negligence awards, Ralph Atkins writes. The ruling in the High Court may lead to some indication being given about the amount of money available to meet any damages awarded to Names, the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the Lloyd's insurance market. The decision is a fillip for Names such as the Gooda Walker Action Group members, who last month won damages they estimated at Pounds 504m against Lloyd's agencies but have yet to discover how much they might actually receive. However, lawyers acting for those who provided the errors and omissions cover said they would appeal against the ruling. They also said the figures, if released, would not indicate how much Names might be entitled to receive because that would depend on the details of actual claims made on the errors and omissions policies, rather than on global figures on total cover. Solicitors Clyde &amp; Co also said the High Court's decision was 'unnecessary and irrelevant' to its attempts in the High Court to obtain guidance on whether Gooda Walker Names, and others near the front of the queue of lossmaking Names seeking legal redress, should be allowed to exhaust funds available from the errors and omissions 'pot'. But Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, said: 'The E&amp;O insurers are always saying that there is not enough cover there to pay us, so why are they so reluctant to reveal these policies?'</p>

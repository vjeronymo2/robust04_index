The United States and the South Korean puppet clique are  openly crying that they would resume the provocative "Team  Spirit" joint military exercises and have decided to deploy  "Patriot" missiles in South Korea. Now fleets of aircraft  carriers of the U.S. Navy are moving toward the waters close to  Korea.    Synchronizing with this, the South Korean puppet Army has  been put on a "standby posture" on the order of the traitor Kim  Yong-sam and the puppet Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a "special  emergency order" to all the puppet Army.    These provocative moves are very dangerous developments  which  may cause a catastrophic crisis on the Korean peninsula.    The perfidious act of the United States in totally reversing  the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New  York is the factor driving the situation on the Korean peninsula  to the brink of war.    Raising unreasonable preconditions to us who have honestly  implemented the points of its agreement with the U.S., the  United States manipulated the Board of Governors of the  International Atomic Energy Agency at its meeting to adopt an  unjustifiable "resolution" against us. Worse still, it is  trying to introduce "sanctions" against us at the United Nations  Security Council.    The seditious forces of the United States are posing a grave  military threat to us, letting loose a string of very  provocative belligerent outbursts that the "international  community must take tough measures", and it "must increase  pressure on North Korea by practical acts."    The acts of the United States in bringing the situation to  extremes after reversing the agreed conclusions in New York and  making the DPRK-U.S. talks abortive will never produce results  favourable to it.    The United States had better look squarely at the  seriousness  of the present situation and ponder it over and must stop the  reckless row of pressure and adventurous war moves at once.</p>

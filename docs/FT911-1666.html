			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): UK and Ireland have longest work hours BRITISH AND Irish employees work longer hours than all other European workers and the UK has among the lowest levels of statutory protection in areas such as night work, rest periods and weekend work, a report to be published next week will show. Only the UK and Denmark, of the 17 countries examined, place no statutory limit on the normal number of hours a worker may be asked to work in a week. Limits in other countries vary from 48 in Germany and Italy to 39 in France. According to the report, the UK is also the only country in western Europe with no legal entitlement to paid annual leave. Entitlements in other countries range from three weeks in the Irish Republic to five weeks in Austria. Britain is also unusual in having almost no restrictions on night work hours, weekend working, rest breaks and overtime working, and no provisions for employee participation in organisation of working hours. In nearly all countries, the law provides for limits on overtime and all except the UK have legislation providing for weekly rest periods. The report coincides with attempts by the EC to establish European-wide norms over working time by introducing, for example, rest periods between shifts and possibly a maximum night shift of eight hours in any 24-hour period. The attempts are being resisted by the government, which believes employers should decide. The report found that the average British employee works 229 days a year, compared with 231 in Ireland, 225 in Sweden - the average in Europe as a whole - and 220 in Germany, the lowest for a European country.

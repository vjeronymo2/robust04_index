As planned, they told Westerners about  their impatience. Jean-Karim Fall reports:    [Fall] After five hours, the participants adopted a final  communique in which they said that, despite some tensions,  inflationary pressure has been curbed thanks to the actions  undertaken since the devaluation of the CFA franc. French  sources report that the average inflation rate in the zone  amounts to around 30 percent.    Participants also expressed their concern over the debt  stock  and over the speed of payments of the promised assistance. This  was one of the main concerns of the member countries of the  zone. On this issue, the backers -- the IMF and the World Bank  -- answered that they have never been so quick. However, French  Minister of Cooperation Michel Roussin said: We will speed up  procedures. He believes that it has been the first time in  years that everyone has heeded the Africans' call.    On the whole, the heads of government and of state in  Ouagadougou expressed their concern over the social consequences  of the devaluation of the CFA franc. The backers -- France, the  IMF, and the World Bank -- tried to reassure them by repeating  that all the promises made in Dakar will be kept.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Muddle in the Chunnel Sir, Your call for the government to bear the risk of the preconstruction stage of major infrastructure projects ('Chunnel link', October 29) is to be welcomed, but your arguments for giving priority to the Channel tunnel link are flawed. First, the fact that the project is already delayed is immaterial; it should be evaluated alongside other competing schemes using today's estimates of benefits and uncommitted costs. The history of the proposed link, however protracted and tortuous, should not affect the decision. Second, using a massive, high-profile initiative is more likely to flood the 'pump' of private/public finance than to prime it. Has not experience of major projects taught us that novel techniques, whether technological, managerial or financial, are most likely to be successful when they have been piloted in lower-risk situations? Surely we should be looking to learn quickly on smaller, high benefit/cost ratio projects and feeding the lessons into the big schemes as they develop. The Chunnel link is needed but let us ensure a decision on its fate is made on rational grounds. Muddling the debate with that on innovative ways of funding public works will do both causes a disservice.

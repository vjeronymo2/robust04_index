			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Overseas companies raise more funds in US FOREIGN companies have been tapping the US capital markets for funds in greater numbers than ever before, according to a study released yesterday by the Securities Industry Association. Annualised data compiled by the SIA suggest that total foreign securities sold in the US primary market in 1992 will approach a record Dollars 67.9bn, 24 per cent more than the Dollars 54.8bn sold the previous year, and seven times the total sold in 1985. The SIA said that a number of factors were behind the boom in foreign issues, including low US interest rates, a favourable dollar exchange rate, increased demand for foreign debt and equity from US investors, and the lowering of some regulatory barriers, especially the introduction of rule 144a which has made it easier to sell securities in the private market. Foreign issuers were also attracted by the size, liquidity and efficiency of the US capital markets, which last year raised a record Dollars 381.4bn in straight debt and equity for US and overseas companies. Last year, foreign issuance of equity and debt was almost evenly distributed between the public and private markets. The SIA study, however, believes the use of public markets would be significantly greater but for the costs and hurdles of registering publicly-issued securities with the government, which it says remain too onerous for many foreign companies. Among overseas issuers of equity in the US, UK companies were the most active last year, thanks primarily to the Dollars 1.1bn issue of American Depositary Receipts in July by Wellcome, the pharmaceutical group. Mexico was the next largest foreign issuer. Again one company, Telefonos de Mexico, which sold Dollars 758m of ADRs in May, dominated.</p>

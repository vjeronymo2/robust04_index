			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / European alliance sought for Eni The Italian government yesterday said it was seeking a European cross-border alliance for Eni, the state oil concern, which is due to be privatised by 1995. The announcement came during the presentation by Mr Paolo Savona, the industry minister, of a policy document on industrial priorities. The document says Eni's oil and gas interests need to acquire a bigger world presence, and then says: 'To achieve this, the government backs conversations in progress to find a European alliance which goes beyond existing exploration and production agreements and deals with R%D strategies, productive ventures leading if possible to share swaps.' Eni is the world's eighth largest oil group with sales of L50,000bn (Pounds 2.8bn). For the past two weeks rumours have been circulating of talks on a share-swap between Eni's main operating arm, Agip, and France's state-controlled Elf-Aquitaine. This followed the annual Franco-Italian summit on November 26 in Rome. Until now both Eni and Elf have declined to comment. Yesterday Mr Savona said coyly: 'Conversations are going on with several prospective partners, some bigger some smaller.' Eni is in the process of re-organising its energy holdings round a new company to be called Super-Agip as a preliminary to privatisation by 1995. Rothschilds were recently brought in as advisers to Eni on the floatation and are in the process of valuing the state holding. Elf-Aquitaine is in the process of discussing share participations with potential investors before its privatisation. Elf, France's largest industrial group, is due to be privatised early next year. It is seeking to find investors to form a hard core of long-term stable investors to replace the state's 50.8 per cent holding. Industry observers in Paris said Agip is a possible member of the hard core, or a potential investor on a smaller scale, pointing out that the French and Italian groups already co-operate in a series of projects. Italian industry has already demonstrated its interest in France's privatisation programme.</p>

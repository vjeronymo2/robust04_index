			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by reporter Yu Haisheng (0060 3189 3932): "Just </F> When Things Are Being Moistened by the Spring Rain -- Assessing  Sino-Japanese Relations from High-level Contacts"]    [Text] Beijing, 21 Mar (XINHUA) -- It may be called vivid  to liken the development momentum of recent Sino-Japanese  relations to the "springing up of bamboo shoots after spring  rain." From President Jiang Zemin's meeting with Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa in Seattle to Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata's  visit to China last January, and from Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's  visit to Japan at the beginning of spring to Prime Minister  Hosokawa's current visit to China, frequent high-level  Sino-Japanese contacts have left a profound mark on the history  of friendly relations between the two countries.    If Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to Japan induced the  emergence of a "China craze" in the Japanese archipelago and the  willingness to forge further cooperation with China, Prime  Minister Hosokawa's official visit to China has heated up the  "Sino-Japanese cooperation craze." Prime Minister Hosokawa  stressed: Japanese-Chinese ties are "one of the most important  pillars" in the foundation of Japan's foreign affairs, and Japan  will actively support China's modernization.    The increasing warmth of Sino-Japanese relations has erased  certain doubts in Japanese business circles, further enhancing  their confidence toward investment in China. The Japanese side  felt that more Japanese capital and technology will enter China  in the next five years.    People here feel that the "Sino-Japanese cooperation craze"  is an important legacy of the overall change in post-Cold War  international relations, China's rapid economic growth, and  Japan's domestic economic readjustment.    In the process wherein the current international order is  changing from polarization to multipolarization, it is of great  benefit for the Chinese and Japanese economies, the stability  and development of the Asia-Pacific region, as well as for  establishing a new international political and economic order,  for China and Japan, two important countries in Asia and the  world, to develop friendly and cooperative relations. The  frequent contacts of Chinese and Japanese leaders have shown  that the two countries have reached common understanding in this  aspect, symbolizing a new era of mature and comprehensive  development in Sino-Japanese relations.    People have noticed that high-level contacts between the two  countries are biased toward economic issues. Economic and trade  cooperation has taken the "leading role" in Sino-Japanese  relations. Last year, economic and trade relations between the  two countries created three "firsts": Sino-Japanese trade volume  reached a record $39 billion and Japan became China's largest  trading partner; Japan's technology exports to China constituted  the largest portion of China's technology imports; and Japanese  enterprises led the rest in investing capital in China. These  three "firsts" have not only favored China's economic  construction, but have also injected new vitality into the  Japanese economy, which is now in recession.    However, speaking on the potential of Sino-Japanese economic  and trade cooperation, the level of these three "firsts" is  still not high. Since the Chinese and Japanese economies  strongly supplement each other, there is wide scope for further  development. China's major development areas involve  transportation, energy, and communications fields, in which  Japan is strong. It can be foreseen that once Japan's  technology and capital continue to increasingly integrate with  China's market and resources on a wider scope, it will  definitely become a reality in the near future for the annual  trade volume of the two countries to reach $390 billion, an  amount predicted by Vice Premier Zhu Rongji when he visited  Japan.    Of course, Sino-Japanese relations are not limited to  economic and trade cooperation. The similarity of viewpoints of  the two sides on many major international issues is clear proof  of this. Following continued deepening of mutual understanding,  the two countries have bright prospects for cooperation in  political, cultural, and environmental protection areas.    In a few more years, mankind will move into the 21st  century.  Despite the turmoil in much of today's world, Asia is  experiencing a general trend of rapid economic development and  relative stability. Just as President Jiang Zemin pointed out  when he met Prime Minister Hosokawa, this is Asia's "rare  development opportunity in history." China and Japan have  clearly expressed that the two countries should seize  opportunities, join hands, as well as establish a long and  stable relationship involving mutually beneficial cooperation to  jointly meet the challenge of the new century. Frequent  contacts between high-level Sino-Japanese officials are a  visible sign of efforts made toward achieving this goal.</p>

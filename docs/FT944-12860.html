			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Moroccan sale oversubscribed seven times Morocco's largest privatisation passed one of its most important hurdles last week when an issue on the Casablanca Stock Exchange representing 16 per cent of the equity in the Societe Nationale d'Investissements (SNI) was seven times oversubscribed. The flotation forms part of the sale of 67 per cent of SNI under a programme to shed state assets started in 1992. In addition to the public shares offered on the stock exchange, a further 51 per cent of SNI's capital is being sold to institutional investors which have been asked to bid for blocks of shares at a floor price of Dirham 325 per share (Pounds 23). Of this 35 per cent will go to a 'hard core' of Moroccan institutional investors who must hold the shares for at least five years, while 16 per cent will be sold to foreign and Moroccan institutions. SNI is a holding company with stakes in 41 businesses ranging from cement to food-processing. Three sectors dominate - cement accounts for 34 per cent of SNI's assets, food processing and drinks another 34 per cent and financial services for 12 per cent. The exact value of SNI's assets is difficult to ascertain as many companies in its portfolio are not publicly traded and the accounts of those that are often not consolidated. But the minimum value of SNI's assets is estimated at Pounds 172m, which makes the holding Morocco's fourth largest company in terms of market value. Since 1992, the state has sold Dirham3.072bn (Pounds 266m) worth of assets. The privatisation of SNI will push this figure to Pounds 331m. A further boost will come before the end of the year when the state expects to sell part of its 50 per cent stake in Morocco's second largest bank, Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur and part of its 49 per cent shareholding in Credit Immobilier et Hotelier, the real estate financing agency. Direct foreign investment in Morocco has risen steadily since 1987 to Pounds 349m last year and is expected to top Pounds 616m this year. Trading volume on the Casablanca stock exchange increased more than three-fold last year and volume in 1994 is already well up on last year's figure. The 25 Share Index set up by Casablanca Finance Group, an investment bank set up in 1992, showed a 35 per cent increase last year; this year's increase is expected to be even larger.</p>

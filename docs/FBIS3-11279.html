			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon] </F>   [Text] The balance of the workers' proposals on how to make  factories more efficient and how to improve the nation's  finances has begun to be reported in the 14 Cuban provinces and  the special Isle of Youth municipality today. It is immediately  obvious that the wide array of suggestions and evaluations will  be very useful to the parliament. This leading government  organization last December studied measures to confront the  negative balance of domestic finances. Prior to approving those  measures, the organization decided to see what the consensus was  among the people. The unions accepted the initiative and have  held approximately 80,000 grass-roots meetings which, after  almost three months of constant conferences to hear opinions,  concluded this Wednesday. Following this free flow of opinions,  it was observed that there was consensus on several possible  measures for correcting domestic finances. Other ideas were  widely discussed but did not receive unanimous support. Among  the most accepted considerations were the implementation of  actions with greater economic efficiency, the elimination of  nonessential gratuities, the closure of nonproductive centers,  and the implementation of monetary, fiscal, and price measures  to face the significant fiscal deficit of 4,200 billion pesos,  which has the same value in dollars according to the official  rate.    The majority was in favor of increasing the price of  nonessential articles and others items that are necessary but  which have such low prices that they do not even cover  production costs. Workers also favored measures to encourage  savings and understood the need to implement a tax system.  There is not much information on tax systems because they do  not exist in Cuba, so the issue was obviously cause for concern.  There was no consensus on a possible change of currency given  that such a measure could be ineffective in the long run.  Thousands of Cubans, however, proposed establishing commitments  to freeze funds for several years.    These are some of the numerous considerations handled in the  so-called parliaments in the workplace, which was the name given  to the trade union assemblies that followed the last meeting of  the People's Government National Assembly in December.    Provincial and national union leaders will today begin to  study the proposals and ideas presented by the rank and file, a  process that should portray more clearly the opinion of the  majority of Cuban workers about economic matters.</p>

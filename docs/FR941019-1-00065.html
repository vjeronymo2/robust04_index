			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With regard to PRP participation, the Department's regulations require that trustee officials provide PRPs with a Notice of Intent to Perform an Assessment before beginning an assessment and invite the participation of the PRPs. See 43 CFR 11.32(a)(2), as amended by 59 FR 14282. Trustee officials are also required to make the Assessment Plan available to PRPs for review and comment. See 43 CFR 11.32(c). Finally, trustee officials are authorized to allow PRPs to perform assessment work. See 43 CFR 11.32(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Determining the appropriate level of public and PRP participation in the natural resource damage assessment process requires balancing the interests of the public, the PRPs, and the trustee officials. The Department solicits comment on whether the regulations strike the appropriate balance and, if not, how the regulations could be revised to strike a more appropriate balance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Optional Nature of Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department's regulations are not mandatory but must be followed in order to obtain a rebuttable presumption. 43 CFR 11.10. Some commenters have questioned the decision to make the regulations optional. For example, one commenter suggested that Federal trustee agencies be required to use the regulations unless all affected trustees agree otherwise. The Department solicits additional comment on whether to require trustee officials to use the regulations when they pursue a claim for natural resource damages under CERCLA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Settlement Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters have requested that the regulations address settlement procedures. For example, when trustee officials use type B procedures, they must develop a preliminary estimate of damages to help scope the range of work appropriate during the Assessment Phase. See 43 CFR 11.35(a), as amended by 59 FR 14282. Some commenters have suggested that trustee officials be encouraged to use the preliminary estimate of damages to initiate settlement discussions. Other commenters have suggested that trustee officials be encouraged to perform separate assessments for each affected resource to facilitate settlement. NOAA's proposed OPA rule includes guidance on settlement procedures. 59 FR 1171.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department strongly supports and encourages the use of the regulations as a framework for negotiated resolutions of natural resource damage claims. The Department is concerned that establishment of specific settlement procedures in the regulations might unduly restrict the flexibility of negotiating parties. However, the Department solicits comment on the need for and possible nature of settlement guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Assessment Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There have been several comments about the Assessment Plan. The regulations require trustee officials to develop a quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) plan that satisfies the requirements listed in guidance developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), if that guidance is applicable. See 43 CFR 11.31(c)(2), as amended by 59 FR 14281. Some commenters thought that the reference to EPA guidance was inappropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department notes that EPA's QA/QC guidance is a well-established standard. Moreover, the Department's regulations provide that EPA guidance need only be followed if applicable. The Department solicits comment on specific areas of concern with EPA's QA/QC guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters questioned whether the requirement that the Assessment Plan include information on sampling size, design, and location and estimated recovery period was necessary. One commenter stated that the Assessment Plan should include a summary of the nature and extent of contamination to ensure that the approach used to assess damages is commensurate with the potential impact on resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the Assessment Plan is to provide the public with a description of, and to organize, the work that will be performed during the Assessment Phase. Inclusion of information about sampling size, design, and location and estimated recovery periods seems appropriate to fulfill that purpose. On the other hand, since a natural resource damage assessment focuses on the actual injuries to resources rather than the level of chemical present, inclusion of information about the nature and extent of contamination may not be essential. However, the Department solicits additional comment on the appropriate scope and level of detail of the Assessment Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters stated that the Department should take precautions to ensure that trustee officials do not undertake basic research when performing damage assessments. These commenters suggested that the Department provide a list of sources of existing scientific data and prohibit trustee officials from performing new research unless there are no existing data regarding the effect of the particular substance on the particular natural resources involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department agrees that trustee officials should not undertake unnecessary basic research and one of the purposes of requiring a publicly available Assessment Plan is to protect against such research. A master list of existing data sources across the full range of potentially affected resources would be costly and time-consuming to compile, virtually impossible to keep up to date, and might also stifle development of new approaches. However, the Department solicits comment on alternative ways of guarding against the performance of unnecessary basic research.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Post-Assessment Phase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters sought additional guidance on post-assessment activities. The Department's regulations already provide some guidance on post-assessment activities. See 43 CFR 11.90&hyph;11.93, as amended by 59 FR 14287. The Department notes that developing guidance requires balancing increased predictability against reduced flexibility to respond to the unique features of the broad range of potential natural resource damage cases. Thus, there is a limit to the level of specificity that can be appropriately provided in the regulations. With this in mind, the Department solicits comment on specific aspects of the Post-assessment Phase that warrant additional guidance. The Department also solicits comment on whether the guidance should be incorporated in the regulations or in a separate guidance document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters have sought additional clarification of the requirements related to the establishment of a restoration account for recovered damages. One commenter thought that the regulations should require trustee officials to hold any collected damages in interest-bearing accounts. Other commenters have asked whether joint damage recoveries by co-trustee agencies can be placed in a single restoration account. Trustee officials' authority to open various forms of accounts is determined by applicable Federal, State, and tribal fiscal law. Therefore, although nothing in the Department's regulations prevents trustee officials from placing damage recoveries in an interest-bearing account, the regulations do not require trustee officials to do so. Instead, the regulations provide that when trustee officials do not have the authority to place damage recoveries in an interest-bearing account, they should adjust their damage claim to account for inflation. 43 CFR 11.92(b), as amended by 59 FR 14287. Also, the regulations neither prohibit nor require the opening of joint accounts. The Department solicits comment on whether additional clarification of the appropriate form of restoration accounts should be provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Assessment Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters sought additional clarification on the scope of recoverable assessment costs. CERCLA provides that trustee officials may only recover ``reasonable'' assessment costs. CERCLA sec. 107(f)(1). The Department's regulations include a definition of ``reasonable cost.'' See 43 CFR 11.14(ee). Among other things, this definition requires that the anticipated cost of the assessment be expected to be less than the anticipated damage amount. Some commenters have stated that this definition should be revised so that the reasonableness of assessment costs is determined by comparing the cost of each component of the assessment to the anticipated damages to be determined by that component. NOAA's proposed OPA rule defines ``reasonable cost of an assessment'' as those costs incurred in performing an assessment in accordance with the OPA rule. 59 FR 1169. The Department solicits comment on whether any revision of its definition of ``reasonable cost'' is appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

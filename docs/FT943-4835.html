			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Survey of Enterprise in Wales (1): A portent of recovery - Though the optimism is tinged with caution, signs from the Welsh economy are encouraging When work on the long-delayed Pounds 150m barrage across Cardiff Bay finally started earlier this year, it could be seen as a portent that the long-heralded recovery was at last under way in Wales. Although the business community is careful to tinge optimism with caution, there has been a string of encouraging signs. That optimism, according to surveys by the Confederation of British Industry, has risen in the principality for seven successive quarters. An analysis published last month by the CBI and the consultancy Business Strat- egies found that manufacturers had higher expectations for orders and output than in any other region. 'Wales has weathered the recession quite well and better than some people might have expected,' says Dr Elizabeth Haywood, director of CBI Wales. And Mr Robert Ellis, senior partner in south Wales of Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, comments: 'Confidence is moving slowly in the right direction.' A recent Touche Ross/Western Mail survey of business opinion found a third of companies expected to employ more people in six months' time and only one in 10 fewer. While 700 redundancies announced last month at Swansea's Driver and Vehicle Licensing Centre show that big employers are still shedding jobs, the unemployment rate was down to 9.6 per cent in July (compared with the UK average of 9.3 per cent). There are other signs of a pick-up in activity. Mr John Mitchell, chief executive of Principality Building Society, says the 'feel good' factor has increased in recent months. 'This year our mortgage lending will break all previous records.' In July, Cardiff-Wales airport handled a record 144,000 passengers, a rise for the 15th consecutive month. Lending by the Bank of Wales to manufacturers has increased by nearly 50 per cent over the last 12 months. Mr Paul Guy, chief executive of TBI, the Cardiff-based property group which became a quoted company this year, believes business has much improved. But he warns: 'The market won't help you out in the 1990s like in the 1980s. To be a success, you have to prove you have a better management team in place.' The more positive picture cannot disguise the fact that Wales still lags on a range of measures. The country is seen as having the potential to become one of Europe's most prosperous regions. First, it has to catch up with other parts of Britain. Gross domestic product per head was only 86.1 per cent of the UK average in 1992; remarkably, in view of the restructuring which has taken place, the gap is just 0.3 per cent narrower than a decade earlier. Income per head in 1992 was lower than in any other UK region. The corollary is that Wales would be much worse placed had it not moved from dependency on coal and steel to a broader-based economy. While service industries such as tourism are crucial (and agriculture still employs 65,000 people), the revitalised manufacturing base helped the country through the recession. Steel remains a large employer but, as Dr Haywood says: 'There is now a very diverse range of industries from biotechnology to textiles.' Having managed this change, Wales needs a further transition: to foster an enterprise culture in which small and medium-sized businesses flourish. There are indications that this can happen. Self- employment has risen by more than a third since 1979 to 15 per cent of the workforce. Companies employing fewer than 100 people account for over 90 per cent of manufacturers. But entrepreneurs are a rare breed and, as elsewhere, many family-owned firms are content to stay the same size. As a catalyst, a Land of Enterprise campaign was launched this year in the wake of the Wales 2010 report for the Institute of Welsh Affairs. A central objective is to raise educational and training standards. While exam results are improving, it is significant that, even at this stage of the recovery, skills shortages are starting to emerge. 'Excellence in education and training are essential to Wales' success in the next century,' Mr John Redwood, the Welsh Secretary, said last month. 'We will earn our living more by our brains than our brawn, more by our own enterprise than by the works of government.' One work of government affecting business is the reform of local authorities, with shadow elections next May to the unitary councils which will replace the existing two-tier structure. While there is support in theory, there is less enthusiasm in practice - one council chief executive describes it as 'an absolute mess.' Mr Michael Rees, director in charge in Cardiff of Chesterton, the property consultancy, is among those critical of the decision to have separate authorities for the capital and Vale of Glamorgan. 'The ability to deliver Cardiff as a major European capital will not be achieved without the formation of a greater Cardiff.' The reforms have reinforced pressure for an all-Wales assembly, to which the Labour party is committed. With Conservatives holding only six of the 38 parliamentary seats, an assembly is advocated as a democratic corrective, especially in view of the growth of non-elected public bodies, or quangos. The Council of Welsh Districts estimates there are nearly 350 quangos in Wales, controlling a fifth of public expenditure. The most prominent is the Welsh Development Agency. Publicly flayed for past practices, the WDA retains much support within the business community. It is admired for its wooing of foreign investors, land reclamation and fostering of partnerships in urban renewal - the decrepit state of many Welsh towns is at last being tackled. In mid-Wales, business people this year also sprang to the defence of the Development Board for Rural Wales when its future was threatened. The DBRW has survived, although Mr David Rowe- Beddoe, the WDA chairman, has also become its chairman to improve co-ordination. Meanwhile, he has revamped the WDA's management and decentralised the agency's structure. The aim is to improve co-operation with councils and give more support to indigenous businesses. 'Small and medium-sized enterprises are our greatest potential strength for the future,' he has said. Recognition that there should be more emphasis on these businesses is echoed by the Welsh Office. One reason is that inward investment, while remaining important, is not a panacea. Successes continue - notably by Cardiff Bay in winning a Japanese and German Pounds 200m joint venture - and foreign companies are investing in their existing Welsh plants. But parts of Wales lost competitive advantage in the government's review last year of assisted areas. Mr Rees of Chesterton warns that Wales faces a difficult task in trying to keep up its inward investment record. He says: 'Moves out of London are slowing down because of the abundance of special offers and rent-free accommodation in the south-east. The differentials between Wales and the south-east are narrowing, particularly when taking into account the Severn crossing tolls.' As the recovery gathers pace, the need for the second Severn bridge, now under construction, will become even more apparent in combating the peripheral view of Wales in Europe. Despite other improvements such as the imminent completion of the M4 near Swansea, and the dualling of the A55 in north Wales, weaknesses in the road, air and rail network remain. By the time the new bridge opens in 1996, Welsh enterprises will have discovered to what extent these weaknesses are further exposed by the Channel tunnel.</p>

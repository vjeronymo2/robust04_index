			<p>BFN     [Text] INTERFAX-Ukraine has been informed that Ukraine's  new parliament speaker Aleksandr Moroz said at consultations  with representatives of parliamentary fractions and deputy  groups on 18 May that he may consider the proposal to postpone  presidential elections in the Republic if President Kravchuk  made the corresponding legislative initiative.    Moroz, the leader of the Socialist Party, was elected  speaker  of the new parliament Wednesday [18 May]. He was also  registered as a candidate for the presidency at the elections  due 26 June.    He assured journalists that his running for the presidential  elections, "if they take place, will not have any bearing on his  work in parliament."    Moroz has repeatedly insisted that the elections be held on  26 June and on no other date. However, he told a May Day  demonstration that the Ukrainian president could be elected by  the parliament.    Moroz believes that the supreme executive body in the  republic ought to be the cabinet of ministers and that the  president should be the head of state.    He told deputies after being elected speaker that his main  position was the "independence for Ukraine and the building of a  Ukrainian state." "The one thing that unites us is Ukraine  itself," he stated.    In an interview with journalists, Moroz called for "order in  relations governing ownership" to be imposed, complaining that  those relations were currently "verging on the criminal." "I  support the most radical measures in that respect," he said.</p>

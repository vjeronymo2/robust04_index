			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow hurt by concerns over monetary policy Wall Street US stocks fell sharply yesterday amid heightened international tensions and nagging concerns over monetary policy, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 30.80 lower at 3,864.85, surrendering all the gains it notched up in the previous session's expiration-related rally. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 2.52 at 468.54. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was off 2.19 at 470.77, while the Nasdaq composite, after setting two consecutive all-time highs, fell 6.63 to 797.30. NYSE activity was light, but a burst of program-driven selling at the opening bell helped boost volume to 247m shares. The optimistic note on which trading ended last week proved to be fleeting. A primary concern yesterday was the failure of the US Treasury market to staunch its losses after a sharp sell-off in the final trading day of last week. Today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, was weighing heavily on bonds. Prices dropped sharply across the yield curve amid anticipation of an imminent move by the Fed to nudge up short-term interest rates for a second time in as many months. Political tensions were exacerbating the market's monetary jitters. Threats by the US to take steps to punish North Korea for its refusal to permit nuclear inspections accelerated a downward push in stocks that normally follows big Friday advances. Stocks which are sensitive to broad economic trends were among the big losers. Chevron sagged Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 90 7/8 , Boeing shed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 46, International Paper dropped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 68 5/8 and 3M lost Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 102. In banking, Baltimore Bancorp jumped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 19 1/4 after First Fidelity offered to buy the group for Dollars 346m, or Dollars 20 3/4 a share. Cadence Design Systems was up Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 15 3/8 in heavy trading on the NYSE. The stock benefited from an upgrading by Mr Gregory Gould, an analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York. IBM closed Dollars 1 1/4 ahead at Dollars 58 1/2 as analysts at a Phoenix trade convention scrutinised computer operating software developed by its Taligent joint venture with Apple. Brazil An unexpected rise in the benchmark overnight interest rate from 54 per cent to 56.5 per cent, and rising inflation forecasts continued to take its toll on the Sao Paulo stock market, where prices dropped 4.6 per cent in weak trading. The Bovespa index ended at 12,708 points, down 610. Turnover was Cr196.3bn (Dollars 243.8m). State-run telecom firm Telebras fell 5 per cent, mining giant Vale do Rio Doce was down down 4.9 per cent, and oil monopoly Petrobras dropped 7.1 per cent. Canada Toronto stocks broke a six-day winning streak, closing sharply lower in moderate trading. The TSE-300 index tumbled 43.11 points, or 0.94 per cent, to 4,523.50, with declines leading advances 459 to 354 in decreased turnover of CDollars 706.8m.</p>

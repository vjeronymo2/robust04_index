			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS  </P> <P> Today's Tips column is devoted to both the seasoned and first-time traveler,  with an update on passports and visas plus other items related to this week's  theme: International Travel. Because the column contains basics for the  overseas visitor, we suggest it be filed as a reference for future journeys.  </P> <P> Passports: With record numbers of Americans preparing to go abroad in 1990,  director Sakae Hawley of the U.S. Passport Agency in West Los Angeles is urging  travelers to apply now to avoid the summer rush. Busiest hours: 11 a.m. to 2  p.m.  </P> <P> Applicants must possess evidence of U.S. citizenship, plus a driver's license  or other identification. Two photos (two inches square) are required. Adult  passports good for 10 years cost $42 (or $35 in the case of renewals). Persons  under 18 pay $27 for a five-year passport. Take cash, check or money order in  the exact amount of the passport to the U.S. Passport Agency, 11000 Wilshire  Blvd., 13th Floor, West Los Angeles, or save yourself the aggravation of long  lines by obtaining application forms at post offices or county courthouses that  may be processed later by the agency.  </P> <P> For recorded instructions, telephone (213) 209-7070.  </P> <P> Visas: Several agencies will help you obtain visas. The oldest and most  experienced is Visas International, which operates a daily courier service to  Washington, D.C. Takes from one day to three weeks (depending on the country)  to get your visa. Figure on three weeks for the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania.  Ten days for Czechoslovakia/Hungary. Visas aren't required by Western European  countries (including France, which discontinued the practice last year). In the  South Pacific, only Australia requires a visa. Rules vary in the Orient, South  America.  </P> <P> For a free brochure containing the requirements for other countries, write to  Visas International, 3169 Barbara Court, Los Angeles 90068, or call (213)  850-1192.  </P> <P> Other Visa Services: International Passports &amp; Visas, 205 S. Beverly Drive,  Suite 204, Los Angeles 90212. Telephone (213) 274-2020.  </P> <P>  -- World Wide Visa Service, 1712 N. Pacific Ave., Glendale 91202. Call (213)  245-0934 for an appointment.  </P> <P>  -- Intercontinental Visa Service, Suite 185, World Trade Center, 350 S.  Figueroa St., Los Angeles 90071. Telephone (213) 625-7175. (Intercontinental  also takes passport photos, stocks travel accessories.)  </P> <P> Persons living outside the Los Angeles area should contact their travel agents  or consulates for additional information.  </P> <P> The World by Train: A guide on rail travel written by Kathryn Turpin and Marvin  Saltzman in 1971 has grown to 816 pages. Covers 112 countries. "Every rail trip  in the world that a tourist might wish to take," insists Saltzman. The title:  "Eurailguide -- How to Travel Europe and All the World by Train." Sells for  $12.95 at leading bookstores or $15.42 direct from Eurailguide, 27540 Pacific  Coast Highway, Malibu 90265. For a free brochure, send a stamped,  self-addressed envelope to the Malibu address or call (213) 457-7286. The  world's most exotic rail trip? Saltzman's vote is for a journey between Lima  and Huancayo in Peru. At one point the train reaches a breathtaking altitude of  15,681 feet. So rarified is the air that a doctor aboard the train administers  oxygen to passengers.  </P> <P> Driving Overseas: If you intend to rent a car overseas, remember that some  countries require an international driver's license. (Ask your travel agent for  a list.) Apply at offices of the Automobile Club of Southern California. You'll  need a couple of passport-size photos plus your California driver's license.  International licenses are issued on the spot. The Auto Club is an excellent  source for maps/guide material. Advisers on the travel desk answer questions,  offer advice.  </P> <P> The Basics: We're reprinting a list of special tips the international traveler  should keep handy:  </P> <P>  -- Photocopy your travel documents (passport identification page, airline  tickets, driver's license, credit cards) for use if reissuance is necessary due  to loss/theft while abroad.  </P> <P>  -- List serial numbers of your traveler's checks, and cash checks only as  additional foreign currency is needed.  </P> <P>  -- Do not exchange currency at black market rates. Could mean real trouble.  </P> <P>  -- Contact U.S. Embassy staffs in the event of legal, medical or financial  emergencies.  </P> <P>  -- Carry your medical insurance identity card as well as a claim form.  </P> <P>  -- Before leaving home, inquire about evacuation insurance in the event an  emergency should arise.  </P> <P>  -- Make a list of travel documents (clothing, medication, etc.). After this,  check off each item while packing.  </P> <P> Greek Holiday: Here's an item for every frustrated soul who has ever dreamed of  escaping the real world. In a move to attract new visitors, the Greeks are  preparing guest accommodations in remote villages throughout their land. A  choice of homes perched on the slopes of Makrinitsa in central Greece. Others  on the storied island of Santorini (a favorite haunt of mine). In the  northeastern Aegean Islands, vacationers settle in a 14th-Century whitewashed  village. Vaulted streets. Peaceful courtyards. Dozens of other choices  throughout Greece, including a medieval tower in the south Peloponnesus.  </P> <P> Details from the Greek National Tourist Organization, 611 West 6th St., Suite  2198, Los Angeles 90017, (213) 626-6696. Ask for a copy of "Traditional  Settlements -- Guest Houses."  </P> <P> Cottage Directory: Livingston Holidays of Santa Ana has published a new  brochure featuring private rentals in Britain. A cottage and a car for a week  for as little as $500. Or live like royalty in a Scottish castle (contains a  dozen bedrooms) for a hefty $3,089. The Livingston people rent flats in London,  put together specialized tours and arrange for low-cost flights across the pond  from Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Livingston Holidays, 1702 E.

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Arts: Away from the horrors of ice-dance - Ballet These are not times of plenty for dance-lovers in London. Ballet at Covent Garden is, shockingly, in abeyance for a month; Sadler's Wells offers nothing. Were it not for the prospect of Twyla Tharp's superb troupe at Riverside Studios next week, we might suppose that Terpsichore had turned her face against us. That television has been revealing the full horrors of 'ice-dancing' from Lillehammer only makes matters worse: we saw prodigious technical skill dedicated to the triumph of the banal, the crass and the bloody-awful. St Vitus is their patron; pop-trash their tune; deep-frozen Kama Sutra their dish. Torvill and Dean merited several gold medals because their movements actually responded to their music. Meantime, up in Birmingham, that city's orchestral survey of 20th century music - Towards the Millennium - has turned towards dance in its consideration of the 1930s. Birmingham Royal Ballet has staged a programme of three significant works of the period: Serenade, Job, The Green Table. Each makes a point about the music-theatre of the age, though, save for Job, not a musical one. Serenade is Balanchine's declaration of intent about America and the classic ballet. It was his first work made for students after he arrived in the US in 1933. It showed 'innocent' bodies how classicism should move from studio to stage. It was also markedly Russian in responding to Tchaikovsky, greeting a New World with a nostalgic glance backwards, to a dance-system that had to be reinvented for a new land. The result remains a masterpiece, in its seeming simplicity, in its stunning craft and in its absolute physical rightness. Even after 40 years looking at it, I marvel at how patterns, incidents, spring from the music, live in it, show Tchaikovsky to us in the most loving and generous way. The Birmingham dancers are, for the most part, willing servants of the choreography. They need to yield more to its impulses - at Tuesday's first performance they looked too much on their best and most reservedly English behaviour - but it is a piece which will do them a power of good. The last movement, where Balanchine colours the dance with hints of narrative about the grief of love lost, was well done. Feelings must not be allowed to get any more explicit, though, and the girls' unbound hair does not require unbound emotions. The waltz needed a more secure male presence; Miyako Yoshida was an unfailing delight, clear, buoyant, at every moment, and Andrea Tredinnick and Monica Zamora were pleasing as the two other leading women. I think a case can be made for seeing Job as Dame Ninette de Valois' most adventurous choreography. Other works - Rake's Progress; Checkmate; the merry Prospect Before Us, which ought to be revived - testify to her dramatic assurance and sense of character in movement. Job tells of her sense of architecture, of grand control of means, a bold theatrical vision, rare in its time, and rare today. It is important that this ballet has been so well revived. I can see no value though, other than as a museum exhibit, in Kurt Jooss's The Green Table. I was bored by it nearly 50 years ago when I saw it with most of the original Jooss dancers. It represents a not very distinguished strand in German dance, and an even less distinguished strand of social commentary.</p>

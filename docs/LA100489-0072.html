			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> As they prepare for hibernation, hundreds of black bears are foraging for  "everything in sight" around Lake Tahoe, wildlife officials said. Residents  were warned not to leave bacon grease or other smelly foods in garbage cans  that would attract bears. Game biologist Gary Herron said that bears eat a wide  variety of animal and vegetable matter and that garbage is "one of their  favorites." Homeowners were advised to put out garbage cans for collection just  before pickup and to wrap smelly garbage in plastic or sprinkle ammonia around  the trash area to mask odors.  </P></p>

			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / NFC sees flat profits at year-end NFC, the freight and trucking group, is unlikely to see any real improvements in earnings in 1992, with pre-tax profits forecast roughly steady at Pounds 90m to Pounds 100m in the year to September 1992. Last fiscal year, the company earned pre-tax profits of Pounds 93.7m. Mr James Watson, chairman, said: 'At the start of the new year, we had expected some recovery. We are not seeing that now.' Mr Watson said that NFC, 45 per cent owned by its employees, managers and pensioners, planned further redundancies and cutbacks in its trucking fleet in the second quarter. In the first quarter ended January 25 1992, it made 500 people redundant at a cost of Pounds 4m. If economic activity falls further, he said, profits would be at the low end of the forecast. NFC is forecasting 1992 earnings per share at 13.0p to 14.5p against 13.6p in 1991. Yesterday, the company announced first-quarter profits of Pounds 18.8m, against Pounds 18.1 a year ago, and increased its dividend to 1.30p per share. The higher earnings are largely due to improvements in the Excel Logistics division which provides transportation and warehousing facilities for goods sent from manufacturers to distributors. NFC's traditional transport division reported a 22 per cent fall in operating profit with truck and trailer rentals continuing at low levels. In the home services division, turnover rose 12 per cent while profits fell 16 per cent, partly reflecting investment in information technology in the US. All 1991 figures have been adjusted to reflect the sale of Pickford's travel agency.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Camacho puts peace before the presidency Mr Manuel Camacho, the peace envoy in the Mexican state of Chiapas, has sought to end speculation about his political ambitions by apparently ruling himself out as a presidential contender this August. 'If it continues to look as if my priority is to become a candidate for the presidency of the republic, this could end up damaging the peace process,' Mr Camacho said. 'Between seeking a candidacy for the presidency and the contribution I can make to the peace process in Chiapas, I choose peace,' he said. However, in giving his work in Chiapas as the reason for not seeking the presidency, Mr Camacho left open the admittedly small possibility his presidential ambitions might return if the conflict in Chiapas were resolved, or if he were no longer needed in the state. Mr Camacho made clear he still wanted to be president, but not at the cost of peace in Chiapas. Despite the potential ambiguity, news of Mr Camacho's announcement led to a sharp recovery in the Mexican stockmarket yesterday which closed 5.4 per cent up. The New York-quoted stock of Telefonos de Mexico ended the day up 11.2 per cent. Over the past six weeks the stock market has lost about 17 per cent of its value on political uncertainty. Mr Camacho, a former Mexico City mayor and foreign minister, is one of the best known and most powerful members of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party. His candidacy could have split the party, and thrown this August's presidential election wide open.</p>

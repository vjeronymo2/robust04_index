			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Perot raises spectre of Dollars 100bn bank disaster DURING the 1988 US presidential election neither Democrats nor Republicans drew much attention to the looming savings and loan crisis that is expected to end up costing taxpayers Dollars 195bn (Pounds 113.3bn), writes George Graham in Washington. A dispute has now broken out over whether the government is again glossing over an impending financial crisis, this time in the banking sector, which could again cost billions of dollars in federal money. President George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton, the two main presidential candidates, agreed in the last of their three televised debates on Monday night that the US banking system was fundamentally sound, though both conceded there were problem banks. But Mr Ross Perot, the independent candidate, raised the prospect that in the immediate aftermath of the election perhaps 100 problem banks might have to close at a cost to the taxpayer of about Dollars 100bn. This catastrophic scenario is based on a controversial study by Mr Roger Vaughan and Prof Edward Hill, published earlier this month by the Washington Post Company. The study, entitled Banking on the Brink, argues that 1,150 banks are so weakly capitalised that they are likely to fail or be forced into mergers in the next few years. While many of the banks meet current international capital standards, the authors argue that the book value of assets such as property loans overstates their real worth. 'If their assets were valued at what they would fetch today in the market, these banks would be shuttered on the spot,' the study says. At the core of the problem, according to Mr Vaughan and Prof Hill, are 10 large bank holding companies each with more than Dollars 10bn in assets. Mr Bert Ely, a banking consultant in Alexandria, Virginia, makes a lower estimate of the likely cost of bank failures and believes the existing resources of the Bank Insurance Fund will be enough to cover depositors in these banks, without increasing the premiums levied on banks. Adding a sense of urgency to the more gloomy predictions is the implementation on December 19 of new legislation which would give federal bank regulators the responsibility to close banks whose capital falls to 2 per cent of assets, rather than waiting until they are technically insolvent. Federal officials, and other banking analysts, reject both these pessimistic calculations on bank capital and the idea of a banking Doomsday on December 19. MR Ross Perot has waded into the controversy surrounding British Airways' proposed Dollars 750m (Pounds 436m) investment in a 44 per cent stake in USAir, writes George Graham. In the final televised debate between the three main presidential candidates on Monday night, Mr Perot said the BA deal, which still needs US government approval, as well as a similar deal already approved in which KLM of the Netherlands took a stake in Northwest Airlines, would be 'terribly destructive to the airline industry'. 'We're getting ready to dismantle the airlines industry in our country and none of you knows it. And I doubt in all candour if the president knows it,' he said. The Texas billionaire used the airline deals to reinforce his complaint that US interests were hurt by the presence of too many lobbyists in the big party campaigns. But Mr Perot neglected to declare his own substantial financial interest in the airline industry. The Perot Group donated land for the recently opened Alliance Airport between Dallas and Fort Worth and then lobbied for millions of dollars in federal money to build the airport. The group stands to benefit from development of an estimated 18,000 acres of land it owns around the Alliance site. In addition, one of Alliance's main customers is Dallas-based American Airlines, whose payments for Alliance facilities underwrite some of the airport's debt and which is also leading the lobbying fight against the BA-USAir deal.

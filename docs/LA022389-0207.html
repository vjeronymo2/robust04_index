			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POSTNUCLEAR BEER DEFEAT MAY MEAN END TO LIVE MUSIC  </P> <P> The Laguna Beach City Council's unanimous refusal Tuesday to allow beer sales  at Club Postnuclear probably means the end of live concerts at the club,  according to owner William (Max) Nee.  </P> <P> Postnuclear, which opened in July at 775 Laguna Canyon Road, has been the only  club in Orange County besides the well-established Coach House in San Juan  Capistrano to regularly present nationally known touring rock and reggae acts.  </P> <P> Nee had launched Postnuclear as an alcohol-free establishment, but late last  year he decided that the lavishly appointed but struggling club needed beer  sales to broaden both its audience and the range of musical attractions that it  could present.  </P> <P> "We won't be able to book our live music now," Nee said after the council  denied his application for a beer permit by a vote of 5 to 0. The decision  capped an hourlong hearing in which public comment was about evenly divided on  the issue of beer sales.  </P> <P> "I lost $10,000 this month" on live shows, Nee said after his council defeat.  "I can't go on like that."  </P> <P> Nee said he would present six more concerts already booked through March 16.  After that, the club will open only on Friday and Saturday nights for dancing  to recorded music, which has proven to be a strong draw.  </P> <P> The City Council vote overturned a previous decision by a lesser city agency,  the Board of Adjustment, that would have allowed Postnuclear, which admits  18-year-olds, to sell beer under strict guidelines aimed at ensuring that  minors would not drink and that security in and around the club would be  tightly enforced. Council members said they were not willing to allow beer to  be sold under any circumstances in a club where some patrons would be under 21.  Some minors might drink, they said, and, barring that, under-age patrons still  would come under a bad influence.  </P> <P> "What 18-year-olds want more than anything else is to be 21 years old," said  Council Member Lida Lenney. Beer sales at Postnuclear would "show them why it's  important to be 21 years old . . . because you get to drink beer," she said.  </P> <P> Council members also said they feared that beer drinking at the club would  increase the number of drunk drivers on Laguna Canyon Road, a route infamous  for bloody car wrecks.  </P> <P> Nee and other club spokesmen had promised to implement a special program, based  on studies done at the University of Minnesota, aimed at deterring excessive  drinking at Postnuclear. It would have included strict security measures and  special training for alcohol servers. Drinking already is a problem among  Laguna Beach teen-agers, Nee said -- and no council member disputed him.  Postnuclear would give them a "safe, controlled" alternative to beer parties,  he argued, and set a model for responsible social drinking.  </P> <P> "My feeling is (the council) never even listened," Nee said after the hearing.  </P> <P> Nee held out one vague avenue for continuing live shows at Postnuclear: forming  a partnership with the neighboring Canyon Bar &amp; Grill, which has a full  liquor license. But it was unclear how such a partnership between two  nightclubs could be implemented or whether it could pass muster with city  officials.  </P> <P> Greg Chastain, owner of the Canyon Bar &amp; Grill, said after the hearing that  he is open to discussions with Nee, but "there's no way Max could buy my liquor  license and install it in his place."  </P> <P> Except for one high school student who complained that Postnuclear doesn't  admit teen-agers under 18, those speaking against the beer license were older  residents. Two were neighboring businessmen who decried traffic problems and  fan behavior Monday at a free afternoon show that featured the rock band Dead  Milkmen.  </P> <P> "They had every freak in Orange County down here," said Gene Henson. "I felt  after walking through that crowd that I should go home and take a bath."  </P> <P> Three speakers 20 and under backed Postnuclear, favorably comparing its  cleanliness and stylishness to other rock clubs they had frequented.  </P> <P> Two adults not connected to the club also argued in favor of a beer permit.  </P> <P> Walter Loeliger told the council that "usually I would not support any  alcohol-related matter because my son (who was 22) was killed by an  irresponsible drunk driver." But Loeliger praised Postnuclear as "a place (for  young people) to let go of their frustrations, the growing pains, and be among  themselves without getting into trouble, as they would at private parties where  they would drink alcohol anyway."  </P> <P> One resident, Kedric Francis, asked the council to consider the cultural  benefits of having an adventurous rock music club in the city.  </P> <P> "What always struck me (about Laguna Beach) was the diversity here -- cultural,  social, artistic," the 28-year-old attorney said. "Now I sense that tolerance  slipping away. These arguments (against Postnuclear) are based on fear of the  young and the new and the different. Culturally, (the club) is on the cutting  edge. . . . When one cultural aspect of the community is strong, it adds  strength to all the others."  </P></p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / N-dump plan will face long delay A PLANNING application for permission to build Britain's first underground repository for radioactive waste is not now expected to be made before the second half of this decade, Mr Michael Folger, managing director of UK Nirex, said yesterday. The slippage in the planning timetable for the proposed Pounds 2.5bn repository at Sellafield in west Cumbria stems from the decision by Nirex, the nuclear waste disposal company, to bring forward plans for an underground research laboratory for the study of rock on the site. When in July 1991 Nirex announced Sellafield as its preferred site for a repository for intermediate and low-level nuclear waste, it expected to apply for planning permission this year, with 2005 as the target date for the facility to begin operating. In June this year, after examining initial results from boreholes drilled in the area, it announced a one-year delay in its timetable for the project because knowledge of the site's hydrogeology was 'not sufficiently firm'. Yesterday Mr Folger said that Nirex hoped the repository would become operational in 2006 or 2007, but added: 'We are very conscious there's a lot outside our control.' Nirex will unveil details of the research laboratory proposal next month. It hopes to seek planning permission for it no later than October 1993. Even if granted without a public inquiry, it would take two to three years to construct. Data would then need to be analysed before a final decision on whether to seek permission for the repository.</p>

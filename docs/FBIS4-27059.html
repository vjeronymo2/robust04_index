			<p>BFN     [Text] Acting Mayor Tian Fengshan met with a delegation  from Hokkaido Development Consulting Company Ltd, of Japan this  morning. Led by the former governor of Hokkaido, (Uchiko  Nagahara), the delegation was invited by the provincial  communications department to attend the ceremony marking the  establishment of (Beilong) technology development company--a  Sino-Japanese joint venture.    Acting Governor Tian Fengshan extended a warm welcome to the  visiting delegation. He said: Heilongjiang and Hokkaido have  established a long-term friendly cooperative relationship and  profound understanding. Heilongjiang is a major province with  rich natural resources. Its economic development over the past  few years can not be separated from its achievements in highway  construction. The establishment of this (Beilong) joint-venture  company to engage in highway design and development is very  conducive to the construction and development of our province's  communications undertakings. He expressed the hope that the  Hokkaido Development Consulting Company Ltd, will conduct  further cooperation with our province in agricultural  development and urban construction in Harbin, including the  building of a subway train.    Also attending the meeting were Cai Qi, deputy secretary  general of the provincial government.</p>

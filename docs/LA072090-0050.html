			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> BUILDER IN TORRANCE FEUD FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY  </P> <P> A developer who has been feuding with the city of Torrance said this week that  Park Beyond the Park, an investment group with which he is connected, has been  forced to file for bankruptcy.  </P> <P> The developer, Jerry L. Conrow, criticized the city for blocking the group's  efforts to rent space to the Los Angeles County court system in a building the  group developed.  </P> <P> "They basically didn't want the court system to expand within Torrance, so they  set requirements that no one could meet," said Conrow, who is general partner  of Park Beyond the Park. Specifically, he cited a city requirement that one  parking space be provided for every 150 square feet of floor space in any  building used for court purposes.  </P> <P> Park Beyond the Park, described by Conrow as a partnership of about 25 people,  owns a 126,000-square-foot office building at 1880 S. Crenshaw Blvd.  </P> <P> The group filed a lawsuit in January claiming that the city cost it the court  contract. A second lawsuit by Conrow, which challenged the city's review of  parking for its cultural arts center, was dismissed in Superior Court last  month.  </P> <P> Jeff Gibson, senior principal planner for the city, declined to comment on  Conrow's criticisms because of the pending litigation.  </P> <P> Conrow said the group filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal  Bankruptcy Act on July 12.

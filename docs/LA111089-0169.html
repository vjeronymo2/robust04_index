			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CLIFFORD HELPS MATER DEI KEEP TITLE HOPES ALIVE WITH VICTORY  </P> <P> Taking a page from an opponent and a friend, Mater Dei High School's Kealii  Clifford took matters onto his legs Thursday, rushing for 155 yards, scoring  four touchdowns and leading his team to a 35-24 Angelus League victory over  Servite at Santa Ana Stadium.  </P> <P> The victory clinched second place for Mater Dei. The Monarchs will share the  championship if St. Paul upsets Bishop Amat tonight.  </P> <P> Servite came into the game having won the past three meetings between the  teams, in large part because of Derek Brown. Three years ago, as a sophomore,  Brown rushed for 334 yards and scored four touchdowns. Last season, he ran for  246 yards and scored five touchdowns.  </P> <P> After that performance, then-Mater Dei coach Chuck Gallo said: "I'm oh-so-happy  to see him graduate. I'd pay for his college education."  </P> <P> Brown is gone, as is Gallo. Clifford, a senior who has started at running back  since he was a sophomore, knew this would be his last chance to win one against  Servite.  </P> <P> He had performed well in games against Servite -- rushing for 65 yards and two  touchdowns last season -- but always there was Brown.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't exactly say I was overshadowed by him, but hey, Derek was Derek, he  was hard to ignore," Clifford said. "We're friends. We met at a track meet. I  wasn't trying to show him up, but wanted to prove myself the way he had."  </P> <P> It didn't take long for that. Clifford ran for 19 yards on Mater Dei's first  play from scrimmage. That drive eventually stalled, but a second went 43 yards  and ended with quarterback Danny O'Neil completing a five-yard touchdown pass  to tight end Terry Flannigan.  </P> <P> Mater Dei (6-4 overall, 3-1 in league) recovered a Servite fumble on the  ensuing kickoff and drove another 30 yards with Clifford scoring from a yard  out.  </P> <P> Servite (3-7, 1-3), meanwhile, was having all kinds of problems. The Friars'  offense didn't enter Mater Dei territory in the first half.  </P> <P> Mater Dei took a 21-0 lead by halftime, the final first-half score coming on a  19-yard pass from O'Neil to Clifford. O'Neil completed 10 of 13 passes for 112  yards and two touchdowns.  </P> <P> His second came late in the third quarter on an eight-yard pass to Clifford,  who caught three passes for 37 yards.  </P> <P> Servite rallied for two touchdowns midway through the fourth quarter -- the  first a 10-yard pass from quarterback Rob Walker to John Garrigan, the second a  five-yard pass to John Kroll -- and followed each with a two-point conversion  to pull to within 28-16.  </P> <P> But Clifford ended any thoughts of a miracle comeback when he scored on a  seven-yard run with 1:47 left.  </P> <P> Servite score on a a seven-yard from Walker to Garrigan and added another  two-point conversion with 29 seconds left in the game.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA &amp; CO.: SOUTHLAND PARKING HEYDAY MAY BE ENDING  </P> <P> This is outrageous.  </P> <P> They now charge an average of $140 a month to park a car in a downtown Los  Angeles office building. For short visits, the average hourly rate is $4.70 and  rising -- provided you can find a place. Who can afford these prices for  something that used to be so cheap and plentiful?  </P> <P> Calm down a little. In San Francisco, the average monthly downtown parking cost  is $257, and in New York it's . . . well, don't even ask.  </P> <P> In parking, as in other things, Los Angeles is catching up with other  "world-class cities." Another element of our dusty pueblo's bill of rights --  the right to park inexpensively -- is biting the dust. The most dramatic prices  for commercial parking are posted downtown, but the pinch is being felt all  over Southern California -- from San Diego to the San Fernando Valley, and from  Irvine to Westwood.  </P> <P> Why? The same old broken record: We're in the big time now. Congested, heavily  populated and very busy.  </P> <P> "Downtown Los Angeles used to have a huge number of surface parking lots that  provided cheap and available parking," said William Francis, whose Western  Parking Services surveys the state of parking here. "With all the new  development, we are losing those lots. We've actually added more parking in the  process, but it's the much more expensive kind in underground garages and  multistory structures."  </P> <P> Parking and its cost have a little-understood but important influence on the  economy. As long as parking is cheap and easy, people in this area will drive  their cars everywhere. Smog regulators try to cut back parking for just that  reason. Meantime, politicians and planners try to add off-street parking to  reduce congestion. The result: mixed signals from the policy makers.  </P> <P> One thing is clear: Cheap parking helps business and contributes to Southern  California's reputation as a retail paradise. It makes possible four stops  instead of one on a Saturday shopping excursion. No schlepping of packages on  crowded subways here; we put them in the trunk.  </P> <P> And it's also clear that parking is another of our growth industries. In Los  Angeles, business taxes paid by parking operators, which are assessed as a  percentage of revenue, soared nearly 400% in the past 10 years. And the city  expects to collect $22.5 million a year from its 10% retail tax on commercial  parking, which went into effect just this month.  </P> <P> If parking becomes too expensive, people here may still drive -- but to fewer  places. And that undoubtedly will influence the pace of economic activity, at  least the way it's been practiced in Southern California since the arrival of  the automobile.  </P> <P> What's more, more than half the employers in Los Angeles are forced to  subsidize parking costs to keep their employees and customers happy, and that  has become part of the higher cost of doing business here that everybody  complains about. If they don't subsidize parking, a lot of companies can't find  employees who are able to pay the full amount or are willing to shift to the  region's inadequate and inconvenient public transit.  </P> <P> But let's back up. It took more than the automobile to turn the Southland into  the motoring capital; it also took lots of free parking. Southern Californians  have always hated to pay for parking. They barked and whined when parking  meters arrived in 1949.  </P> <P> And 35 years ago, if you charged 5 cents an hour to park in most lots, "people  wouldn't stand for it," said parking veteran Stanley Long, president of the  Parking Assn. of California.  </P> <P> So the region grew up with a tradition of cheap and plentiful parking, and that  tradition has evolved into an expectation for those who come here now. But as  population and development increase, the economics of parking is changing  dramatically.  </P> <P> Maguire-Thomas Partners, one of the region's biggest managers of office  buildings, figures that it costs $12,000 to $20,000 to put one parking stall in  a downtown office building these days, according to senior partner Ned Fox. A  recent study by the Southern California Assn. of Governments estimated that the  cost of land, construction, operation and maintenance adds up to $270 a month  for each parking space in a new Los Angeles skyscraper.  </P> <P> "We're shielding people from the real costs," said Donald C. Shoup, a UCLA  urban planning professor who co-authored the SCAG study. "Most people don't  realize how expensive it has become to provide new parking spaces."  </P> <P> This "shielding" is a direct result of our tradition of cheap parking. That  tradition also created the widespread subsidization of employee parking costs  in Southern California. The SCAG study discovered that the amount that downtown  employers pay to lower the cost of parking ranges from $59 to $121 per month  per employee. What that means is few people are actually paying that whopping  $140 a month for downtown monthly parking. The employers share much of the  burden.  </P> <P> Subsidies also come as "free" validation by retailers and some professionals  for customers who use commercial parking lots. Nobody has estimated how much  that costs business.  </P> <P> In other big cities, parking is not a right. In San Francisco and New York,  there have been few minimum requirements for off-street parking in new office  buildings. Most of the cars that park in the relatively few spots available are  those of short-term visitors, not all-day employees. By contrast, about  three-quarters of the cars that park in downtown Los Angeles belong to  employees who work there, not visitors or customers.  </P> <P> In Southern California, we require at least one parking space per 1,000 square  feet of space in a new office building. In some parts of the region, the  requirements are much tougher. Beverly Hills, for instance, requires three  spaces per 1,000 square feet. And politicians, responding to outcries from  residents seeking to reduce street parking congestion, have raised the  requirements for new buildings in a number of other areas. The idea, one  planner says, is to prevent the Melrose Avenue or Ventura Boulevard syndrome.  </P> <P> We have subsidies and minimum parking standards because people here demanded  them. We like our traditions. But the changed economics of parking is already  fencing us in. The high cost of land and construction is making parking too  expensive to permit employees to park all day for next to nothing -- or  shoppers and visitors to gallivant.  </P> <P> And that may finally do something that exhortations from smog abaters, high  gasoline prices and billions of dollars spent on buses and Blue Lines haven't:  make us drive less.  </P> <P> </P> <P> GROWTH INDUSTRY  </P> <P> Business taxes paid by Los Angeles parking operators, which are assessed as a  percentage of revenue, soared nearly 400% in the past 10 years.  </P> <P> Los Angeles business tax collections from parking operators, in thousands of  dollars:  </P> <P> 1989: $1.89 million  </P> <P> Source: City Administrator's Office  </P> <P> </P> <P> OFFICE BUILDING PARKING RATES  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.43IN:2.00IN:2.00IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Jan.

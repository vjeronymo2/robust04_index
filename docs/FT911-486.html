			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Arts: Mean Miser on the South Bank THE NEW production of The Miser at the Olivier Theatre establishes one point beyond reasonable doubt: Moliere can be played just as well in English as he can in French. That is not only a tribute to the new translation by Jeremy Sams, which contains some striking use of the vernacular and is sometimes in verse where Moliere is in prose. It is also a compliment to the entire production. This is the first time that I have seen Moliere in English without being unduly conscious of the original in the background. Apart from that, the production is interesting rather than brilliant. Although it is played more as a comedy than a tragedy, it contains some gratuitous streaks of violence, notably when Valere - who, on any normal reading, is one of the good guys - beats up the coachman. There is a further unnecessary vicious streak at the end when the miser's gold is tipped out of its box. Since he is already isolated and humiliated, it might be better to leave him alone with his treasure. There's not a lot to be said either for the women in the play, though I suppose that is Moliere's doing as much as anyone's. Eleanor Bron has her moments as Frosine, the go-between, early on, but gradually falls out of the plot. The real stars are the men. Best of all is David Ross as Master Jacques, the coachman and cook who adjusts his dress in accordance with the role in which he is being addressed. His versatility extends to running dangerously up and down a set of rather rickety steps on the Olivier stage. I think that the accent is Lancashire; anyway, Ross turns the character into a gem of a part. Some of the other male servants, who have fewer lines, are also outstanding. Harpagon, the miser, is played by Charles Kay as an introverted figure, almost a psychological case. If that is the way you want to do it, there is no fault with the performance. Personally I would have preferred a bit more show of miserliness and avarice on the grand scale. This man is just mean: more an autocratic father than a huge tragi-comic figure. There is no need to carp, however. Steven Pimlott's direction shows that there is room for more than one interpretation. The play in general is a delight. Watch the way the plot unfolds with the appearance of Anselme, the deus ex machina. You will be inevitably reminded of Twelfth Night. The audience, no doubt noticing the similarities, loved the denouement, which was perhaps the first time that the full comedy came through. We have had two recent performances of Corneille comedies at the Old Vic, and they went down very well. One hopes that the arrival of The Miser in this form will help to establish French 17th century drama as a staple part of the English diet.</p>

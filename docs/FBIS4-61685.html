			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with French Minister for European Affairs Alain </F> Lamassoure by HOLOS UKRAYINY correspondent Volodymyr Savtsov, in  Kiev; date not given: "In Mutual Interests"]    [Text] [Savtsov] How do you assess the state of  Franco-Ukrainian relations?    [Lamassoure] Our relations with Ukraine, which were  established from the very start of Ukrainian independence, are  developing at a satisfactory level. My visit is a concrete  manifestation of the interest in your country, an interest that  has never faded in France.    We know that Ukraine is going through an uncommon period  when  the population experiences great difficulties. We realize that  the road toward a market economy cannot be covered overnight.  The transitional period is always quite long and difficult.  However, as follows from experience, the longer important  decisions are delayed, the longer and more difficult the road  will be. We, therefore, hope that Ukraine develops, as soon as  possible, its own economic program, which will enable it to  receive international assistance.    [Savtsov] What specific trends are there in our cooperation?    [Lamassoure] France is an active participant in the G-7  highly developed Western countries striving to improve nuclear  safety in the CIS countries, and in particular in Ukraine.  French public opinion is attentively following the danger to  which the entire European continent and, first and foremost  Ukraine, may be exposed by the continued operation of the  Chernobyl nuclear power station. Recent incidents have added to  our concern. For this particular reason, the French authorities  believe that it is necessary to reach an urgent decision, so  that all reactors at Chernobyl can be closed down as soon as  possible. G-7 has already looked into this issue during the  summit in Munich in 1992, when a special fund was created for  the purpose. Concern was also voiced at the 1993 summit in  Tokyo. On our initiative, this issue will be among the  principal ones on the agenda at the summit in Naples this coming  July. However, the efficiency of the G-7's actions also depends  upon the level of cooperation with the Ukrainian authorities. I  want to assure you that, in any case, France will take an active  part in the quest for a decision and in the work that will be  conducted. Our methods of expert analysis and our know-how have  been recognized by the entire international community. We will  grant this know-how to Ukraine.    There are many other spheres in which we can cooperate. The  determination of policy in the area of power engineering, in  particular, in energy conservation, may become a area for useful  cooperation, because France has much experience in this field.  I might also remind you about the assistance in the  establishment of a law-governed state and of all the related  institutions. We are also ready to take part in training  specialists, in particular, the necessary personnel for a market  economy.    [Savtsov] Does our cooperation have a chance of expanding to  European dimensions?    [Lamassoure] We are very dedicated to European stability.  In terms of its size and geographical situation, Ukraine is an  important element in this stability. In January 1994, we  welcomed your achievements in the sphere of disarmament. We  hope that yet another step will be made after Ukraine ratifies  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.    Ukraine wants to live in peace with its neighbors. That is  why we are pleased with your government's participation in the  constituent conference dealing with the European Stability Pact,  which will be held in Paris at the end of May. The European  Union has adopted the French initiative, which is expected to  help on finding pragmatic solutions to problems that may arise  between the states of central and eastern Europe, more  specifically, on minorities issues. We want Ukraine to take an  active part in resolving these problems.    [Savtsov] Thank you for the interview.</p>

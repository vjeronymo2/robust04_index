			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second tier (substandard quality of care) would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require a civil money penalty, public notice, a plan of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correction and, at the State's option, any other remedy. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repeated, the State or HCFA would require a State monitor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and a directed plan of correction. There were additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandatory remedies imposed at higher scope levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third tier (immediate jeopardy) would require the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutorily mandated temporary management and physician and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nursing home administrator licensing board notice, as well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a denial of payment for new admissions and a plan of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another organization also proposed three severity levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Actual harm, impairment or death; potential harm,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impairment and death; and negative outcome). The scope  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels were also pared down to three levels (isolated,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occasional and widespread/pattern). Substandard quality of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care would be defined as a severity of 2 with a scope of 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in quality of care and all of severity level 3. For non-immediate jeopardy, this proposal would require termination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 180 days from the last date of survey unless compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is achieved during the correction period. For immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardy, termination would take effect in 23 days if no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary manager is appointed or accepted. This proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not require any mandatory fines but rather, would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leave the choice of remedy to the State or HCFA. Other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutorily driven remedies have also been included in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One State organization proposed a matrix which had five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severity levels (harm or death; negative outcome non-staff  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action; negative outcome staff action; negative outcome  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely; and no negative outcome). As in some other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposals, the scope levels remained as we had provided in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed rule. Under this plan, no remedies would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed for severity level of 1 and scope of 1 or severity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level of 1 and scope of 2 or severity level of 2 and scope  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 1. A plan of correction would be required for a severity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and scope of 1&hyph;3, 1&hyph;4 and 2&hyph;2, respectively. A civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty would be imposed for a severity and scope of 2&hyph;3 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2&hyph;4. No fine would be imposed for a scope of 1, even if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiency is at the severity of 3 or 4. Denial of payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for new admissions would only be imposed for severity levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 4 and 5 (except severity 4 and scope of 1). This plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also would exempt facilities from any remedies in certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situations where new requirements had not been disseminated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to nursing homes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another State organization proposed a scope and severity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scale using the four scope levels defined in our proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, but defining the severity levels differently. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> four severity levels would be defined as level 4_life  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threatening harm or death; 3_actual harm; 2_potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harm; and 1_no harm or likelihood of harm. Severity and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scope of 1 would have no remedies imposed. Severity level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 1 and scope of 2 and severity of 2 and scope of 1 or 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have no remedy imposed the first time the deficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was cited, but the State or HCFA would impose a directed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan of correction if the same deficiency(ies) was found at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the next survey. This plan also requires the State or HCFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to choose between a denial of payment for new admissions or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a civil money penalty for severity levels of 3 and 4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another State disagreed with our use of the term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate jeopardy relative to the scales because it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that the term, as described for the scales, carries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no connotation of immediacy and is not equivalent to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language ``likely to cause at any time'' we had proposed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the definition of the term in &sect;488.201 of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. Also, the State questioned our definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substandard quality of care in relationship to severity and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scope. It believed that substandard quality of care should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not apply to one or two residents but should reflect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficient patterns of care, policies or procedures present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in or used by the facility. The State recommended that HCFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide that a finding of substandard quality of care may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made (but is not required) for scope levels of 1 and 2 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severity levels of 3 and 4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters suggested that severity levels 3 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4 should be redefined. Specifically, these commenters found  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> virtually no difference in the application of remedies in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the two levels. Other commenters believed that a potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for life threatening harm should not be an immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardy finding subject to harsher remedies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

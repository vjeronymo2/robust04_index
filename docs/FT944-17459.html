			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Clinton sends in warships to warn Iraq off Kuwait The US and Britain dispatched warships to the Gulf yesterday and put forces on alert after Iraq moved at least 10,000 troops and a large number of tanks within striking distance of the border with Kuwait. Warning Baghdad not to be 'misled into repeating the mistakes of the past', President Bill Clinton said the US had taken 'necessary precautionary steps'. Iraq should not make the mistake of thinking the US was too involved in its military mission in Haiti to pay attention to Kuwait, from which Iraqi troops were expelled by a US-led force after they invaded in 1990. A US official said Mr Clinton had put 'less than 15,000' troops on alert for possible duty in Kuwait and ordered four warships carrying 2,000 US Marines to move north from the southern Gulf. Britain said it was sending HMS Cornwall, a frigate. The Pentagon was also sending an aircraft carrier, the USS George Washington, and two ships equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles to the region. Up to 12 fully loaded US military cargo ships in the Indian Ocean and Pacific have been ordered to either move towards Iraq or stand by for orders. According to US officials at the United Nations, Iraq could soon have nearly 60,000 troops, equipped with some 700 T-72 tanks and 900 armoured personnel carriers, near Kuwait. A Pentagon official said an Iraqi armoured division of about 10,000 troops with ammunition and supplies had moved from the north 'very close' to the Kuwait border and another division was *something in here (HP) * on the move. 'We are robusting our intelligence and reconnaissance assets . . . we see a full up Republican guard unit very close to the border, a matter of tens of clicks (kms) . . . their most forward position we've seen,' he said. Republican Guards, possibly as many as 20,000 troops and 300 tanks, were said by diplomats in Kuwait to be heading towards the border. Iraqi divisions are smaller than in many Western armies, where they often comprise about 12,000 troops, the diplomats said. Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said the troop movements were 'not routine and they're not typical of what we've seen in the past, and therefore they do cause us some concern'. In a statement carried by the state-run Iraqi News Agency last night, Baghdad denied the movements were a prelude to an invasion. 'Peace-loving Iraq . . . has no aggressive intentions,' it said. Diplomats say Iraq made numerous movements of forces after the Gulf war and these had been correctly interpreted as political posturing. However, Kuwait yesterday called an emergency cabinet meeting, called up some army reservists and requested allied assistance. British, French and US jets are based at Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, from where they enforce a 'no-fly' zone in southern Iraq. In a statement Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said: 'We view with concern the troop movements in southern Iraq and the recent hostile statements by Iraq. If Iraq believes that its threatening behaviour will achieve anything, then it is making a serious error of judgment.' The troop movements took place as Iraq sharpened its rhetoric against the UN embargo on oil exports, imposed after its invasion of Kuwait, warning it would take unspecified 'measures' against its 'enemies' unless the Security Council 'immediately' eased the ban. The Security Council last night held emergency consultations. It is due to consider a report from Mr Rolf Ekeus, the UN special envoy, next week, on the readiness of systems for monitoring Iraq's weapons. Mr Ekeus is expected to declare the monitoring systems virtually in place. France, Russia and China have said they believe Iraq should next be given a 'probationary period' of six months for monitoring, after which the Security Council should discuss lifting sanctions. Britain and the US oppose any such timetable. Food rations, upon which Iraqis have relied for 60 per cent of their basic food needs, were recently cut by up to 50 per cent. Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, yesterday called on the international community to examine the 'iniquitous and illegitimate situation' under which he said one or two large major powers were preventing the lifting of the sanctions.

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Secondary offerings The UK's National Audit Office thinks the government's controversial sale of its third tranche of BT shares last year was a success. Techniques devised by merchant bank SG Warburg were effective in discouraging investors from dumping existing stock in the run-up to the issue and so helped maximise the sale's proceeds. The main tactic was to threaten to refuse new shares to those who sold stock aggressively in the offer period. A pat on the back from a happy client will certainly do Warburg no harm as it seeks privatisation work across the world. What is difficult to understand is why investors interviewed for last week's NAO report also thought BT3 a success. At the time, many complained at the strong-arm tactics used by the Treasury. They can hardly be pleased with the shares' 14 per cent underperformance since the issue. The controversy ignited by BT3 is still live. The government is expected to deploy similar tactics when it sells its remaining stakes in National Power and PowerGen next year. Meanwhile, the Stock Exchange is trying to decide whether regulations on short selling should be tightened. One idea is that issuers should be allowed to insist on cash settlement for trades in the run-up to an issue to make it easier to spot investors who dump shares. The Treasury unsuccessfully lobbied for such a system during BT3. The evidence from the NAO report is that issuers are quite capable of looking after themselves without further help from the exchange. If anything, the playing field is already tilted too far in their favour.</p>

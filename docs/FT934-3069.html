			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Arts: 'The Nutcracker', in disguise - Ballet Well, here it is again. Wearing a comic mask and pretending to be different  -'What, me? A Nutcracker? Oh, no, I'm something completely new]'. The answer to all of which is, of course 'Nuts]'. But at least the thing has made an effort with its disguise. Matthew Bourne's Nutcracker was created for his Adventures in Motion Pictures troupe, and I reported on it from last year's Edinburgh Festival where it was part of an Opera North double bill including (as in the first staging in 1892) Tchaikovsky's opera Iolanta. It is a merry transformation for this season of goodwill - though my own goodwill towards Nutcrackers is about the same I would offer to one of those ostrich-sized deep-frozen turkeys that lie menacingly in supermarket freezers. Bourne's witty trick is to transpose the action to an orphanage, run by the vile Dr Dross. His wife is matron - one having the heart-warming charm of Stalin. Their children, Fritz and Sugar, are spoiled brats. The orphans are pathetic, and Bourne gets theatrical mileage from the sincerity with which his cast conveys this. Clara (played with tremendous sincerity and gusto by Etta Murfitt) is the leading orphan, and her love for the Nutcracker (more Chippendale toy-boy than toy) is shown as a piece of Mills and Boonery: despite setbacks, she gets him at last. The staging is everywhere resourceful. Bourne's orphanage is a nicely grim location for a grotesque party, which is well worked out to the music. The mouse-battle is a dormitory pillow fight; the snow-scene a skating party in which Ally Fitzpatrick's Sugar (Sonia Heinje to the life) appropriates the Nutcracker-hunk (Andrew George). The second act Kingdom of Sweets is a collection of noxious goodies - liquorice, marshmallows, three belligerent punk gob-stoppers - which Bourne handles very well. And after the final duet, which has celebrated the union of Sugar and the Nutcracker, Clara awakens back in the orphanage, and we are given a happy ending as she finds the Nutcracker in her bed, ready to elope with her. So far, so amusingly good. The acting abilities of AMP respond well to Bourne's demands; the staging is lively, agreeably sardonic, and looks delightful in Anthony Ward's clever designs; the smaller dance numbers (in which Nutcracker abounds) are jolly revisions of the hallowed old routines. I missed, though, choreography to respond to the two greatest moments in the score, the snow-flake waltz and the grand pas de deux. Bourne misfires with both. The skating party in the snow has a cursory air. The grand pas de deux has always had music wholly unlikely for its purpose - the final celebration in a children's ballet. We hear Tchaikovsky at his most hauntingly melancholic and, as we now know, at his most personal. Roland John Wiley has identified the metric shape of the descending scale (which is the melodic device of the duet) as following exactly the prayer 'And with the saints give rest' which is part of the Russian Orthodox funeral service. Wiley points out that as Tchaikovsky worked to complete the score - with some difficulty - he heard of the death of his beloved sister. The gravity of the music is explained, and it demands the choreographic nobility that Ivanov gave it in the first production. Bourne is too frivolous, his dancers not grand enough. These objections apart, the staging is a happy one, given with enthusiasm by its cast. The young may be taken to it with certainty that they will be entertained. The score, in Rowland Lee's sensitive edition, is well played by the New London orchestra. The Nutcracker is at Sadler's Wells Theatre until December 18. Production sponsored by The Kobler Trust.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.209.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section includes the qualification requirements for brake system electronic inspectors. The ``electronic inspector'' is not necessarily qualified to perform only electronic inspections. For the purposes of these proposed regulations, the electronic inspector will be considered to have the knowledge and skill to maintain the electronic components, including computer control components, of train brake systems as well as the ability to perform brake system inspections and tests. The electronic inspector will play an increasingly important role in train safety as brake system technology continues to advance. The proposed specific training and experience guidelines represent what FRA considers the minimum necessary for the electronic inspector to be effective. Several sections of these new regulations propose incentives for railroads who use qualified electronic inspectors to perform train brake system electronic work. Consequently, in order for a railroad to designate an individual as a qualified train brake system electronic inspector that person must receive instruction in accordance with the following minimum training and experience guidelines:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Have a minimum of three years' experience inspecting, testing, and maintaining the type of train brake electronic subsystems on which he or she is assigned to work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Have successfully completed 32 hours of training including eight hours of ``hands on'' training within the past three years on the Train Brake System Safety Standards. ``Successful completion'' means that the Inspector has been able to pass an examination on the Train Brake System Safety Standards conducted by the railroad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Have successfully completed 80 hours of training including 40 hours of ``hands on'' training within the past three years and an intensive technical course on the operation, test, inspection and maintenance of brake electronics typical of the type of equipment with which the Inspector works. ``Successful completion'' means that the Inspector has been able to pass an examination covering inspection, test, and maintenance of the specific brake equipment on which the inspector works. This test shall be conducted by the railroad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.211.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section contains the qualification requirements for train crew members. Although FRA discourages the practice of using train crew members to perform brake system inspections and tests, FRA recognizes that situations exist where railroads must use crew members to perform this work. Numerous comments were provided by several labor organizations and their individual members to support the position that, on a whole, train crew members are not sufficiently trained to perform brake system inspections and tests. The experience of FRA inspectors in the field also supports this position. At the same time, it is clear that most train crew members are capable of acquiring and applying the pertinent knowledge to perform train brake inspections; and many have demonstrated this capability in the past. Consequently, in order for a railroad to designate an individual as a qualified train crew member capable of performing train brake system inspections and/or tests, that person must receive instruction in accordance with the following minimum training and experience guidelines:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Have a minimum of six months of experience inspecting and testing the type of train brake systems that he or she is assigned to inspect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Have successfully completed 24 hours of training including eight hours of ``hands on'' training within the past three years on the Train Brake System Safety Standards. ``Successful completion'' means that the crew member has been able to pass an examination conducted by the railroad on the provisions of the Train Brake System Safety Standards that apply to work performed by that crew member.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

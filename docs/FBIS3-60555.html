Doctors Hakan Gnarpe and Stefan Sterner in Gavle have  studied  the occurrence of twar bacteria, which was formerly linked to  the odd deaths among those involved in cross-country  orienteering among the recruits.    In 1990, 11 percent of the 506 recruits who were studied had  antitwar antibodies in their bodies. This year antibodies were  found in as many as half of those 394 who were studied. In 1991  and 1992 no comparable studies were done, which is why a clear  picture of how the increase is occurring cannot be drawn.    Gnarpe said that it is not a question of an epidemic within  the I-14 unit alone.    Twar can lead to a number of different infections from head  colds to lung inflammation and heart muscle inflammation. Twar  bacteria have proven to be more common in the Gavle area and in  Dalarna than elsewhere.</p>

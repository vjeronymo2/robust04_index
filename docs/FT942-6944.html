			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Argent share price set at 255p for value of Pounds 140m Argent Group, the property investor and developer, yesterday set its flotation price at 255p per share, valuing the company at Pounds 140m. It is offering 13.7m shares through a placing and intermediaries offer, which represents a discount of 5.2 per cent to its adjusted net asset value. Argent is raising Pounds 27.1m net, which will be used to fund investments and developments, although it will initially be to cut debt. Under the offer, 11.57m shares are being issued and 2.16m shares are being sold by Warburg Pincus. After the offer, Warburg Pincus will be left with 27.3m shares, representing about 49.8 per cent of the company. The management team is not selling any shares in the offer. COMMENT Argent has a lot to live up to. In a market jaded by the glut of property companies attempting flotations, Argent's launch stands out because of the plaudits heaped on its management team, who have a won a reputation for skilful timing over the past five years. The shares have been keenly priced and, in a weak market, could fall to a discount when dealings start. In the short term, asset growth could be held back by the demanding valuations placed on its properties. However, for long-term investors looking for capital growth, rather than income, Argent could be one to back.</p>

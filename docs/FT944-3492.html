			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: No joy for smugglers Sir, I do not suppose many, if any, smugglers read your newspaper, but in case they do I would not like them to be misled by Mr Mike King (Letters, December 8) into thinking that there is such a thing as a Customs-free airport as far as they are concerned. Anti-smuggling staff will continue to be active in airports and ports throughout the UK according to the level of risk posed. Fast response teams are based on site at leading ports and airports, smaller places being covered by area mobile teams. We are confident that by putting greater emphasis on quality results in terms of seizures, and concentrating even more on drug trafficking organisations, the department's success rate will be enhanced. Indeed, we have set targets to prove it. A W Russell, deputy chairman, HM Customs and Excise, New King's Beam House, 22 Upper Ground, London SE1 9PJ</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: Outlook grim for US property COOPERS &amp; Lybrand, the accounting firm, concludes in a gloomy study of the US property market that it will take about 12 years to absorb all the vacant office space across the country. The study reveals 'a nation that is awash in vacancies' and says there is ample justification for the bearish state of the development and construction industries. The survey reports there are 62 sq ft of empty office space for every US office worker and close to 52 sq ft of unoccupied shop floor for every industrial worker. Across the US, Coopers &amp; Lybrand says 1m hotel rooms a day are unfilled and the equivalent of 3,800 shopping centres stand idle. 'These numbers indicate just how pervasive and enduring a problem was caused by the massive overbuilding of the last decade,' said Mr Bjorn Hanson, chairman of Coopers &amp; Lybrand's national real estate division. The report summarises significant land uses throughout the country across property types, and it charts inventories, vacancy rates and the outlook. The worst surfeit of space is among office properties, where the national vacancy rate now exceeds 19 per cent. Absorption of vacant office space will take at least 12 years and even under the most optimistic scenario, Coopers &amp; Lybrand forecasts it will be 1999 before there is a return to traditional rate of vacancy. The hotel segment is about four years away from its normal supply-demand equilibrium, in spite of the fact that its vacancy level of 38.7 per cent is only running at 4.7 percentage points above the traditional rate. On the industrial side, the survey concludes it will take three years at current absorption rates to shave the segment's 9.7 per cent vacancy rate back to more traditional levels of 5 per cent to 7 per cent. An economic recovery would do little to help the retail segment, where the study notes it will take at least three years to fill enough empty store fronts to bring double-digit vacancies back to a normal range. By far the brightest spot on the horizon for the property market is on the residential side, where Coopers &amp; Lybrand finds potential tenants and owners at least outnumber the available housing stock. Both single-family and apartment occupancy could return to normal within a year if consumer confidence continues to recover, according to the study.</p>

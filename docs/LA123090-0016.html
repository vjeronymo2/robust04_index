			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ;  </P> <P> RENEE ROSNES "FOR THE MOMENT" BLUE NOTE * * *  </P> <P> The results of pianist Rosnes' follow-up to her Blue Note debut, are generally  felicitous.  </P> <P> Backed by her regular trio members -- bassist Ira Coleman and drummer Billy  Drummond -- she scores on pieces like "Summer Night" and "Malaga Moon," which  abundantly illustrate the Bill Evans influences of her piano playing.  </P> <P> The precise, understated style of the trio is less effective in support of  tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson, who appears on most of the tracks. Too often  Henderson's efforts to expand the musical envelope are hampered by the failure  of Rosnes, Coleman and Drummond to generate a comparable flow of musical  energy. Saxophonist Steve Wilson is also featured. Don Heckman  </P></p>

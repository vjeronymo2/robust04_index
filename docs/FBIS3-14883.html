			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 28 February, Anton Buteyko, adviser to the  Ukrainian president on international affairs, commented on  Leonid Kravchuk's visit to the United States to a UNIAN  correspondent. In particular, Anton Buteyko said: "There is a  change for the better in the attitude to Ukraine on the part of  United States and other Western states. Previously they were  interested only in the situation concerning nuclear weapons,  whereas now they are interested in full-scale economic  cooperation and assistance for Ukraine in connection with the  economic crisis. The main aim of the visit is to raise both  countries' economic relations to a new level. It is expected  that a number of agreements will be signed: on the legal basis  of Western investments, avoiding double taxation, and statements  on economic and trade relations. Issues connected with  Ukraine's fulfillment of the START I Treaty and with making the  mechanism of granting American aid more concrete are also to be  discussed. A meeting is planned with the leadership of the  International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Their  investments are to be included in the Ukrainian reforms."</p>

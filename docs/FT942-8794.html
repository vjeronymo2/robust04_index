			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Protest by Balaguer opponent Mr Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, a candidate for the presidency of the Dominican Republic, has asked the electoral board to stop publishing the results of the count, and not to declare the results of Monday's election until it investigates his party's allegations of fraud and corruption in the voting. Mr Pena Gomez, who is trying to become the country's first black president, made the request as returns from the election showed his social democrat Dominican Revolutionary Party to be running a close second to the conservative Social Christian Reform Party led by Mr Joaquin Balaguer, the president. Mr Balaguer, at 87, is seeking a seventh term. With 81 per cent of the votes counted yesterday, Mr Balaguer had 42.76 per cent, with Mr Pena Gomez on 40.95 per cent. Mr Pena Gomez has claimed that up to 200,000 people, most of them his supporters, were unable to vote either because their voting cards had been confiscated, or their names were not on the list.</p>

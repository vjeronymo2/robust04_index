			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The week-long Iranian trade exhibition in Kuala  Lumpur is evidence that Iran is keen to establish direct trading  links with Malaysia. This coincides with Malaysia's emphasis on  boosting trade with South-South as well as fellow Islamic  nations. Although Iran is an important trading partner for  Malaysia, the trade figures have been relatively insignificant.  In 1993, bilateral trade stood at only 310 million ringgit.    It is encouraging to note that the figure, though small, had  in fact increased by 75 percent over 1992. The potential for  increased trade is there in view that there are now more  bilateral visits. With over 80 Iranian companies taking part in  the expo, there is bound to be business tie-ups, possibly on a  long-term basis. The reason for the unsatisfactory level of  trade and investment is mainly due to the lack of information.  This has led to trade being conducted by middlemen and other  third parties which, inevitably, results in more expensive  products. Through direct trade, products will be more  competitive. The Malaysian and Iranian private sectors should  also take stock of the economic opportunities available. There  also needs to be more promotions like the expo. Such a trade  display would go a long way in promoting greater awareness of  the opportunities for importing from Iran. Another problem is  the negative Western media coverage of Iran. As such, it is  important Malaysian entrepreneurs find out for themselves the  opportunities available in Iran rather than listening to third  parties.    Iranian businessmen should look to invest in Malaysia in  areas such as resource-based industries, ancillary and  supporting industries, and the agro-based sector. It could also  make Malaysia the gateway to the ASEAN and the larger  Asia-Pacific market. This is where Malaysia's marketing  experience and network of contacts can come in.    The two governments have put in place the necessary  agreements to facilitate commercial relations. Malaysian  companies have the expertise in mining, downstream processing of  agricultural products, and mineral resource sectors. Besides  this, Malaysians can offer their know-how in the services sector  such as telecommunications, finance, engineering consultancy,  construction, and infrastructure development. This ties in  neatly with Iran's five-year development plan.    Malaysian investors should also take note of the immense  opportunities in the free trade zones of the (?Kish) and Qeshum  Islands in the southern regions of Iran. With Iran looking to  privatize its companies and Malaysia's success in the area,  there is much room for mutual benefit.    Closer Malaysian-Iranian ties are crucial in opening new  market opportunities, especially with the emergence of powerful  trade blocs. Iran borders seven Asian Muslim countries and six  Arab countries on the side of the Persian Gulf, so there is a  lot of export potential.    With Malaysia and Iran subscribing to free trade, a new  chapter in greater trade and investment could very well be  opening up between the two countries.</p>

			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Japan snips at red tapeon building supplies JAPAN'S construction ministry is making it less difficult for foreign companies to enter the country's building materials market, an official told Reuter in Tokyo. Complex quality controls have made builders reluctant to use foreign products in public works projects. They have had to check whether they cleared the Japanese Industrial Standard and then apply for ministry approval. Materials had to be checked at the construction site. In future, contractors can entrust testing to two of the ministry's affiliated research and testing organisations. The two will then issue certificates to the contractors.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / S Africa rejoins Commonwealth after 33 years South Africa is today to become the 51st member of the Commonwealth, rejoining the grouping from which the then white minority government withdrew 33 years ago after declaring a republic, Our Foreign Staff writes. Chief Emeka Anyaoku, Commonwealth secretary general, said the admission of a non-racial South Africa following democratic elections in April would assist in 'making the world safer for diversity'. The organisation planned to co-sponsor a conference with the United Nations in mid-September for potential donors 'to help South Africa make up for the huge gaps made by years of apartheid'. Yesterday the country also joined the Non-Aligned Movement of developing countries as delegates began a conference in Cairo. Taking his seat Mr Alfred Nzo, South African foreign minister, committed his country to share its economic, technological and scientific skills with developing nations, particularly in Africa.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Taxing times for Italian workers SALARIED workers in Italy declare higher average earnings and pay more taxes than businessmen, writes Robert Graham in Rome. This trend, long suspected by the tax authorities, has been confirmed by finance ministry research. It is based on 1990 returns of 28.6m Italians and was undertaken following the discovery by tax inspectors on random assessments that employers were on occasions declaring earnings three times less than that of their employees. Analysis of returns also produced the extraordinary finding that almost 40 percent of the 340,000 businesses subject to corporation tax had avoided payment. This was because they either declared earnings below the taxable minimum or reported losses.</p>

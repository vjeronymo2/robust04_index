			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Food and Drink: Reds, whites and blues - Why a varsity match gave Jancis Robinson that sinking feeling OXBRIDGE rivalry is supposed to run deepest on the river Thames between Putney and Mortlake, isn't it? But this year's Boat Race can hardly be more acrimonious than the Oxford v Cambridge Wine Tasting Match held in London on Tuesday. This, the 40th annual such blind tasting, had all the usual hallmarks of varsity confrontation: Cambridge accusing Oxford of weighting the boat with too many graduates; women in a minority; and a certain amount of exhibitionism. The cocktail was headily spiked, however, with a few distinctly 1990s ingredients: gratuitous legal wrangling, the strong whiff of hard-edged commercialism, and calculated yobbism. The Cambridge captain, a law student currently choosing between offers of employment from four investment banks, was proud of the contract he had spent 'hundreds of pounds worth of faxes and paper' drawing up between his team and the competition's sponsors, Pol Roger champagne. 'We're the first team to realise the commercial value of all this,' he said proudly, nodding at his fellow competitors slurping Pol Roger wines around the celebratory lunch table at London's Oxford &amp; Cambridge Club. 'Yeah,' said his vice captain, an American who declared, not entirely coherently, that he could be as rude as he liked since next week he would be at Yale, 'teaching scumbags European History'. This charming fellow, seated just two places away from the the event's organiser, Bill Gunn, the mild-mannered Master of Wine who represents Pol Roger in England, noisily (and erroneously) laid into the quality of the champagne being hosed into our glasses. The vice captain boasted that Cambridge had talked about offering the sponsorship deal to Bollinger, its preferred champagne house, and that it was only by agreeing to the lawyer captain's strict terms and conditions that Pol Roger had secured the privilege of laying on this competition and lunch. With an eye to relatively extensive press coverage last year (helped enormously by New York Times wine writer Frank Prial's entirely coincidental presence in London SW1 that day), the Cambridge captain had decided to polish up the participants' image. In order to present a less privileged and more 'caring' image, he had insisted that Pol Roger changed the prize from champagne to a cheque for Pounds 1,000 for a charity of the winner's choice. No, he had not actually thought about which charity, which was perhaps just as well since Cambridge lost, by 744 points to 855 (out of a possible 1,440), in spite of fielding one young Australian who dropped only 12 points out of a maximum of 120 in the white wine paper. The captain/business manager had clearly put more energy into the subclauses than into coaching his team. Younger Cambridge tasters talked wistfully of how much they could have learnt by tasting together and sharing impressions before the big day, a process assiduously encouraged at Oxford. While Cambridge fielded the regulation stubble-wearer with FT folded ostentatiously into a Samuel Beckett paperback, Oxford's team was long on neatly dressed mathematicians and democracy (joint captains and a positive bias in favour of women). The opposing captains nearly came to blows across the table when the question of graduate participation was broached. 'But our graduates are relatively inexperienced tasters', was Oxford's defence of the maturity of its team. Oh and the wines themselves? Forgive me, they seemed rather peripheral to the event. A New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc (1991 from Selaks) was spotted by almost everyone, even the judges - myself and Hugh Johnson - along with a full throttle Australian Chardonnay (1990 from Tim Knappstein) and a mature rioja, Vina Ardanza Reserva 1985. Best wines there were probably Ch Leoville Las-Cases 1985 (Cambridge had contracted Pol Roger to lay on some smart wines) and Mascarello's Barbaresco Marcarini 1985 (Pounds 17.99 from Winecellars of London SW18). The worst wine, by far, was an unexpectedly oxidised Meursault, Narvaux 1989 from Boyer-Martinot, which some participants loved. This did not surprise me one little bit.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Plan to move into occupied zone Jordan's two biggest commercial banks, Bank of Jordan and Arab Bank, are preparing to open 30 branches in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to serve the Palestinian economy, due to be self-governing by April. Israel and the Palestinians have yet to agree on future economic relations in trade, money and banking, but the Jordanian banks, controlled by Palestinian money, have proceeded to buy land and start buildings. The only bank operating in the territories is Cairo-Amman Bank which has eight branches. Mr Yahya Kadamani, a director of Bank of Jordan, said his bank was ready to open its first branch in Ramallah in January. The building merely awaited furniture from Italy. He expected to be conducting operations in both the Israeli shekel and the Jordanian dinar, which would come under control of the respective central banks of Israel and Jordan. Interest rates would vary according to the currency lent. All foreign exchange business and issuance of letters of credit would have to come under the Israeli central bank. Commercial banks operating in the Palestinian economy would have to establish correspondent banking relations with Israeli commercial banks to carry out foreign exchange transactions. Arab Bank, one of the biggest banks in the Middle East, has also said it will open up to 24 branches across the occupied territories over the next two years. The first are planned to open in six months in Nablus, Ramallah and Hebron. The first Palestinian bank, Palestinian Commercial bank, is also to open eight branches. The decisions of the commercial banks to go ahead with planning branches appears to suggest the bankers have concluded detailed negotiations with the central banks of both Jordan and Israel and with the PLO.</p>

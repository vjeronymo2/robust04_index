			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / The City Bombing: Homeless companies stir market - Total of 200 buildings damaged THE City, where one in every five office buildings is empty, is well placed to accommodate the 40 or so companies displaced by Friday's bombing. There was even reluctant acknowledgement that putting 1m sq ft of office space temporarily out of action could help the depressed property industry. Mr Trevor Osborne, chairman of troubled property company Speyhawk, said: 'There will be some benefit to the market. This means a number of occupiers are seeking space and urgently.' Speyhawk's Exchequer Court building in St Mary Axe will cost 'tens of millions' to repair and may need to be demolished, according to Mr Osborne. But as it is fully insured and may have difficulty finding tenants, delay in its completion could take some pressure off the company. The Corporation of London, the local authority for the City, said no buildings would need to be demolished. However, 10 buildings in St Mary Axe, including the Baltic Exchange, the Chamber of Shipping and Royal Bank of Scotland were severely damaged. A total of 200 buildings were damaged, with 100 badly affected. The damage and associated losses may reach Pounds 300m, and replacing glass will take a month or more. Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments worked through the weekend to find accommodation for tenants - such as Commercial Union Asset Management, the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, and Quilter Goodison - in its Broadgate complex at rents of Pounds 40 per sq ft. Mr Kevin McGovern of Rosehaugh said: 'We are not looking to exploit the circumstances. We want to dispel any notion that this is a strategic long-term solution for us. We are just trying to get people back to work.' On Saturday The Corporation of London set up a help line manned by surveyors to find accommodation for displaced firms.</p>

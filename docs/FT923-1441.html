			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Amateur politicians mauled by offshore sharks: An island that cannot isolate its finances from the mainland the native Manx and the 'come-overs'. The latter were immigrants, sometimes rich and mainly from England. If they did not like the island's way of life and customs, the Manx retort was simple: 'If you don't like it, there's a boat leaving every morning.' As one well-heeled English come-over put it last week: 'I realised early on this was a foreign country. Whingeing come-overs, or those who try to change things, do not do well here. 'I decided to go with the grain and find a Manx partner to work with for my business deals. It has worked well.' He did not want to be named, fearful of falling foul of the network of native islanders openly referred to as the 'Manx mafia'. Two things are precipitating change, he said - a flood of technocratic come-overs who have taken over the island's finance sector; and the collapse 10 years ago of the Savings and Investment Bank with Pounds 42m of depositors' funds. The Manx bank crash shook the island to its millennial roots and Tynwald, the Manx parliament founded by the Vikings, put in tough supervision for the finance sector. That achieved what Tynwald had wanted all along: serious investment by respectable banks and insurance companies that knew they were not going to be tainted by a milieu that encouraged crooks. Last year's census shows that for the first time the proportion of the population who are come-overs is now just over 50 per cent. That will not last, because most of the come-overs are professionals whose children, born on the island, are a new generation of native Manx people. Moreover, a further type of islander has appeared - the 'come-backs'. These are native Manx who emigrated, succeeded, and have returned to play an active part in island life. They rarely returned in the past. Mr David Cannan worked in Sri Lanka and Malaysia before settling in England, where he owned several retail properties and became a Conservative county councillor in Berkshire. He joined the come-backs in 1980 and was elected to Tynwald after the Manx bank crash. As finance minister in 1987 he called in the Metropolitan Police fraud squad to investigate the Manx bank and, together with Mr Miles Walker, then the new chief minister, insisted that the truth be disclosed. The two eventually fell out politically - Mr Cannan is a Tory while Mr Walker is much nearer to being a social democrat - but the truth about the Manx bank finally came out yesterday with publication of the Chadwick report, delayed because a fraud trial connected with the Manx bank's deals in Britain was not completed until last month. Even at 10 years' distance, the report is unpalatable. In 1975 Tynwald decided to expand the island's finance sector to counter chronic depopulation and decline in its traditional industries of tourism, farming and fishing. However, in a community the size of a small English market town, politicians were part-time amateurs and soon found themselves in a sea of complicated offshore tax law alive with sharks. They failed to see the danger and had no budget for serious supervision - and there was no one capable of carrying out that supervision. The island became an easy place for speculators. Some obtained banking licences and dipped directly into depositors' funds - some of it 'black' money carried to the island in cash by tax evaders in Britain and Ireland - to speculate, mainly in land and property in the UK. Savings and Investment Bank was not a 'bad apple' - four other 'banks' also crashed on the island in the early 1980s. But Savings and Investment Bank had a disproportionate impact, because about 2,000 of its 3,000 depositors were honest, innocent local savers. Regulatory failings meant there was no political will to allow the truth to emerge until the government changed in 1987. That proved fatal to punishing the bank's principals - charges against them were dismissed in 1990 because the delay in bringing them to trial was judged unreasonable. Most believe such a thing could not happen again under the strict regime run by Mr Jim Noakes, chief executive of the Financial Supervision Commission. For example, anyone trying to deposit more than Pounds 1,000 in cash anywhere on the island has to prove where it came from. Mr Noakes believes offshore finance centres are a necessary adjunct of international marketplaces such as London, Tokyo or New York, but that they must be properly policed. He says: 'What drives offshore centres is the ability to exploit differences in international tax laws. You can do this openly and many respectable financial and insurance companies do so. 'But where you get people doing it in secret, where you get an atmosphere where you are not likely to encounter much punctiliousness by the authorities, people with dubious records will try to take advantage of it.' His toughness has en-couraged the respectable. Royal Insurance, Roywest and Coutts are among the big operators that have moved in or expanded. Clerical Medical Insurance has won a Queens Award for Export from its Isle of Man base, while Barclays Bank has set up international and money transmission operations on the island and grown from under 100 staff to 260 in four years. The finance sector accounts for 30 per cent of the economy and 14 per cent of jobs, with just as many in professional services such as accountancy and the law. Mr Noakes says the influx has brought professional competence and high ethical standards, while there has been a shift in the nature of deals from the personal to the institutional. But until the Isle of Man confesses its sins over Savings and Investment Bank and purges them by paying fair compensation to depositors, Mr Cannan for one thinks its image will always be tainted.</p>

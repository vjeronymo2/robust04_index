			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: How the wealthy take money from the state ARBITRAGE, THE art of trading to take advantage of different prices in different markets, is one of the oldest games played by financial wheeler-dealers. Now, the UK's Inland Revenue is falling victim to the same trick. The Business Expansion Scheme, introduced as a tax incentive to encourage the wealthy to risk investing in small enterprises, has become a device to help banks and top-rate taxpayers to take slices of the state's money. In the process, it has also converted a significant part of the UK's damaging stock of repossessed housing into private rented accommodation. This is good news for the homeless and for homeowners in houses where values are dropping. But whether the government intended the windfall for top-rate taxpayers to be so generous is another matter. When the arbitrage scheme is finely tuned, it works as follows: an institutional lender (usually a bank) finds itself with a large stock of repossessed housing; dumping it on to the market at current values would increase its loss. Instead, the bank sets up a BES company which takes control of the property. That company must then rent out the property under 'assured tenancy' regulations for five years to qualify for BES reliefs. The bank covenants to buy back the property at the end of five years, at a price only slightly in excess of that paid. Meanwhile, investors buy shares in the BES at Pounds 1 a time. Thanks to BES tax relief, they receive 40p in tax relief, if they pay top-rate tax, so they have effectively only invested 60p. Six months later, the bank offers a loan against the BES shares of 72p for every Pounds 1 share. That represents a substantial mark-up over six months for someone who has only parted with 60p. The loan is on a 'non-recourse' basis, so the BES shares themselves offer the only security which the banks can use. So investors can leave the investment, for a profit, after only six months. Meanwhile, the banks have received Pounds 1 and paid out only 72p for it. Both sides have thus profited handsomely from the relief. Non-recourse schemes were first introduced in September last year and have proved popular. Banks involved included Barclays, TSB, and Bank of Scotland. The Inland Revenue, meanwhile, is allowing both banks and wealthy investors to make some very easy money. Basic rate taxpayers, who effectively invest 75p per Pounds 1, cannot benefit from this trick. For those not prepared to lock their money away for a long term, the attractions of non-recourse schemes are undeniable. Most schemes launched so far have been oversubscribed within a week, and many investors have put money into the BES for the first time. But this creates dangers. Bank-guaranteed non-recourse loan schemes genuinely have a low level of risk. But many other schemes launched in the next 12 months will not be so watertight. Others will be highly speculative. Some schemes, mainly involving universities, offer a 'guaranteed' return after five years. These returns will usually be greater than those on offer after five years in schemes which offer a six-month loan, so they might be preferable if the five-year term is not a problem. In many cases, these schemes are guaranteed only by the universities themselves, so the credit risk is greater than for a bank-backed scheme. Other 'entrepreneurial' schemes make no guarantee, and simply aim to profit as much as possible from any gain in the property market. They have unlimited potential growth, but no safeguard against a continued decline. Schemes launched this week demonstrate the differences: Flexit, sponsored by Richard Ellis Venture Consultants, has exit arrangements backed by the Royal Bank of Scotland. The loan available after six months is high, at 74p for every Pounds 1, but the return after five years is only 105p. It will purchase new homes for Fairclough Homes, a subsidiary of AMEC, and is not involved in repossessions. The Ridings Companies, sponsored by Capital for Companies, will buy new houses from the developers Tay Homes and Persimmon. A non-recourse six-month loan of only 71p per Pounds 1 has been underwritten by the Bank of Scotland, but 105p per share has been guaranteed at the end of five years. Pathfinder Repossessions II, backed by Johnson Fry, is returning to the market. As its name implies it will buy repossessed property, in London. However, it offers no guarantees. The aim is to make as much money as possible, but this would be vulnerable to a weak property market, or to any mistakes by managers. Capital Prime Properties, also sponsored by Johnson Fry, is a hybrid. It is offering loans at the rate of 60p per Pounds 1 invested after six months. These loans are not repayable until the end of the five-year BES period, but they are on a full recourse basis - if the property market does not recover, you will have to pay more at the end of five years. If it does, you could make a profit.</p>

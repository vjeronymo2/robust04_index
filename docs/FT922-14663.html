			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Poll puts London as neck-and-neck LABOUR AND the Tories are running neck-and-neck in London, according to the latest Harris poll for London Weekend Television. The poll coincided with a regional breakdown of six national polls by the BBC for last night's television news, which suggested that Labour was on course to be the largest party in the Commons, but without an overall majority. Sixty five of the 94 Conservative-held seats Labour probably needs for an overall majority are in London, the north-west and the Midlands. The BBC analysis recorded swings towards Labour of 8 per cent in London - one point more than the Harris survey - 8 per cent in the Midlands, and 6 per cent in the north of England. The regional pattern appears to confound the assumption by some commentators that the uneven distribution of marginals across the country would favour the Conservatives. The BBC analysis projects 82 Labour gains, leaving Mr Neil Kinnock around 15 seats short of an overall majority. Last night's Harris London poll suggests Labour may fall just short of securing the seats in the capital it needs to give Mr Kinnock an overall majority. The 7 per cent swing should deliver 17 of the 21 Tory-held London marginals that the party has targeted. A similar poll a week earlier had shown a swing to Labour of more than 8 per cent. The survey puts both leading parties on 40 per cent, wiping out Labour's two-point lead of a week earlier. The Liberal Democrats are up one point on 18 per cent. Almost two thirds of those questioned thought taxes for the average family would rise under Labour, although few expected the increase to exceed Pounds 20 a week but the issue of tax continued to lag far behind the traditional Labour strengths of health and education in terms of importance.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Last night's                 Latest opinion     Betting     Futures FT forecast                       poll            odds      trading  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Conservative    291 seats         37%             6/4         293 Labour          313 seats         39%             4/9         307 Liberal/Dem      22 seats         19%           400/1          27  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             (NOP/Newsnight/   Ladbrokes  Dealing on the                           Independent) Field  (for most  number of seats                                  date           seats)   (IG index mid-                            March 31, April 1                 prices)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Weighed average of six most recent opinion polls computed daily.

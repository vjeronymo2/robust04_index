			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Galkina, historian at the Russian </F> Community Abroad Humanities Center, under the rubric  "Assessments and Predictions," with two introductory paragraphs  by V. Bykov: "Siberia and China. Contemporary Geopolitical  Realities and Prospects for a `Peaceful Expansion'"]    [Text] The maddening glimpses of political figures,  the deafening noise of their melee, the depressing setting of  our daily round--all taken together leave us neither the time  nor the energy to ponder problems that are not of either the day  or the minute, but that quite truly exist and require our  attention because tomorrow they might become the foremost  problems and our main concern. The geopolitical situation of  Siberia, which our newspaper has written about repeatedly, is  one such "nonapparent" problem at present.    The article offered to you considers one of the  important facets of this problem--mutual relations between  Siberia and China. We will be prepared to continue the  discussion of this issue if it is of interest to our  readers.    The history of the relations between Russia and China is  complicated and contradictory. Half a century ago, the leading  political science centers of the West began to develop new  geopolitical models of the world proceeding from a new global  situation (the end of World War II, the spread of communist  ideas in Europe, the scientific-technical revolution). For our  purposes, it is interesting that the exceptional role of Siberia  as a new power center in Eurasia was stressed in all of these  models, regardless of their "national affiliation."  <H5>  Views of Siberia Are Very Different.... </H5>   The prediction that in the decades to come the world would  switch from a bipolar arrangement (USSR-United States) to  pluralism, to the formation of new power centers, among which  China and India would stand out primarily, became commonly  recognized in the West beginning in the late 1950's. Thus, Fr.  Shternberg stressed that the strategic significance of Siberia  would increase sharply as these two states grew stronger.    It would help us to know that Western experts predicted most  of the problems that the Soviet leadership encountered both in  the 1960's and decades later. As early as 1963 the military  specialist and geopolitician F.O. Mikshe published an article  entitled "Russo-Chinese War" in a German military-economic  magazine, in which he sketched the possible theater of military  operations and made a prediction for the next 10-15 years which  subsequently came true to a considerable degree.    While the Soviet leadership affirmed the enslaving  specialization of Siberia as a raw material periphery with  natural and human resources mercilessly exploited, Western  statesmen proceeded from the geopolitical uniqueness of the  Siberian region in modelling the future.    De Gaulle advanced the concept of creating a third  superpower, a "Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals," which  presupposed a change in the role of Siberia. In his opinion, the  Russians have transcended their geopolitical boundaries by  penetrating at one time Siberia, which was populated by "yellow  nomads, shamans, and Muslim tribes." For this reason, the Slavs  would be unavoidably crowded out of these lands by the Mongols  or the Chinese. Socialism was just a short historic episode  which changed nothing in the "substance of an eternal Russia,"  which would return to the West sooner the more it was threatened  by China. The need to ensure its security will compel Russia to  recall its European kinship. The great reformer of France  translated this idea into a plan of specific political actions.  This plan called for the withdrawal of the USSR from Asia and  the withdrawal of the United States from Europe. The world  brought into equilibrium in this manner would rest on three  pillars: the European confederation, the Anglo-Saxon complex,  and China. In the process, Europe, with a new leader, France,  would become the middle link of this "trinity" and, in a way,  the center of the world. All of France's foreign policy,  including a personal visit to Novosibirsk by de Gaulle, amounted  to implementation of this grandiose plan (the development of  France's own nuclear weapons, a friendship pact with West  Germany, opposition to NATO and the United States, recognition  of the role of China, and rapprochement with the USSR). All that  remained was to await the struggle between the white and yellow  races over Siberia and the Far East which had been predicted not  only by de Gaulle but by many political scientists....    In the last decades of the 20th century, history unfolded  according to a different scenario. However, this does not at all  mean that the thoughts and predictions of the 1950's were  groundless.    What is happening now? Contradictions between Europe and  Asia  have abated. Conflicts within Europe and within Asia are  mounting. However, under these conditions it is precisely  Siberia that is playing the role of "buffer" between them, too.  In the process, the plugging of Siberia into worldwide economic  processes and the growth of its significance as a source of  strategic raw materials and a recipient of capital investment  continuously leads the geopoliticians of Japan, China, Korea,  and some other Asian countries into the temptation of making  statements about the unavoidable more "equitable" redivision of  Asia.    It is precisely now, in the environment of political,  economic, and legal chaos in Russia, with the obvious weakening  of state structures and coercive departments, that it is  premature to refer to the elimination of the so-called  "territorial" issue in mutual relations with China.  <H5>  `Master of Asia?' </H5>   At present, China is a powerful state with strong central  authority. Prices for the most important types of products and  raw materials, as well as their production and extraction, are  strictly controlled. International experts view China as the  most promising region of the world for investment of capital and  technology.    A raw material crisis is the only problem that hampers this.  Despite strict state quotas, 30 percent of capacity is idle  because of an electricity shortage alone. As a result, a  consumer market has evolved in China, but not a market for the  means of production. This is precisely what prompts investors of  the world to be oriented toward Thailand, Indonesia, and the  Philippines for now. After this obstacle is surmounted, all the  factors favorable for turning China into a superpower will be  created. Let us not forget about the traditional human might of  the country, which had 100 million unemployed in the early  1990's.    It is no exaggeration to say that the market for the means  of  production is now being created to a considerable degree through  the barbaric exports of machinery and raw materials from Russia  effected by "business circles" of both countries.  <H5>  One Hundred Ways to the Same Objective </H5>   Well aware that all territorial claims against Russia cannot  be satisfied through the use of force, China began a "peaceful  expansion" into the eastern regions of Russia, into Siberia and  the Far East. Which forms of penetration have developed?    First, the establishment of joint ventures. The  overall trends of this process are easy to see in the case of  Novosibirsk Oblast. As of 1 December 1993, 32 joint ventures  with a total capital of $108,000 and 220,000 rubles [R] were  registered here. These insignificant amounts are profoundly  meaningful. More than two-thirds of the joint ventures are  fictitious; however, even those in operation are questionable.  More than 50 percent of them openly designated commercial and  brokerage operations as their main line of business. However,  other joint ventures registered in the sphere of material  production actually engage in trade, having secured the  corresponding tax relief. China has displayed an absolute lack  of interest in creating research-intensive and educational joint  ventures. The only venture in the area of education, Yunfa,  which engages in teaching Russian to Chinese students, is on the  brink of closure, having failed to secure support from the  Chinese side. The size of the contribution made by the foreign  party is also instructive: from 32 percent (Sib-Sheg) to 100  percent (Chzhunin). Clearly, the latter cannot be considered a  joint venture, but it has been registered precisely as such with  all the attendant tax relief. One gets the impression that joint  ventures are springing up as outposts for the permanent  establishment in Siberia. As has already been said, joint  ventures are the first path for peaceful penetration.    Second, there is the merchandise expansion of the  PRC. The Law on the Protection of Consumer Rights applies solely  to legal entities, and then to a strictly defined assortment of  goods. Chinese partners use the services of "shuttle traders" in  order to save the trouble of having the goods certified. Their  operations are planned and controlled by state scientific  centers located close to the border. Things carried by a private  person are absolutely free of control. Moreover, our import  certificates are issued on the basis of safety rather than  quality of goods. Therefore, patently poor-quality goods have  Russian state certificates. The state has fully renounced the  role of guarantor and the responsibility for what its own  citizens consume. The scale of this calamity is such that a  separate issue might be distinguished, "On the influence of the  merchandise expansion of China on the genetic pool and health of  the citizens of Russia." Therefore, a consumer market has been  formed in Russia which is geared towards China to a considerable  degree.    Third, let us note the criminal expansion of the  PRC. In this instance, reaching a certain quantitative level of  Chinese in a given territory is the decisive condition. In  oblasts where the number of the Chinese is above the limit  sufficient for the creation of their own criminal clan, the  Chinese criminal underworld is capable even of engaging in  clashes with law enforcement organs. Due to the above  geopolitical factors and the new rights of foreign citizens,  Siberia has become ideal ground for "dumping" and "laundering"  the money of the Chinese mafia.    Fourth, we consider it a short-sighted policy to  create clustered settlements of PRC citizens, including  agrarian. In a number of oblasts they have already encountered  the problem of manageability of these ethnic formations. It  should be understood that each such settlement is an outpost for  future expansion.    Fifth, we invite the attention of the readers to  the spread of ideas of Oriental religions and the creation of  sects emphasizing hostility to the idea of Orthodoxy and the  unity of Russia.  <H5>  Ability To Resist </H5>   How can Siberia, or more precisely Russia, counter the  activity of China in the region? The government was not in the  habit of familiarizing its own people with either the overall  military doctrine or the regional security concept. The  "Military Doctrine" that was finally released recently requires  legal work....    At one point, intuitive recognition of mounting tension in  Asia compelled the Soviet leadership to significantly augment  the military presence, primarily that of the missile troops and  the air force. However, the strategic measures of the 1960's  compensated for the demographic and economic weaknesses of  Siberia and the Far East only temporarily. A stagnating,  deserted Siberia and an overpopulated China--such has been the  reality of recent decades. It is clear that military bases do  not guarantee the durability of possessing a given territory in  the absence of populated rear areas, well-developed  transportation routes, a stable economy, and energy resources.  Diplomacy will not help in this instance.    In the 1990's, the situation became even more dramatic. A  linear surplus of the death rate over the birth rate has turned  into an exponential, explosive surplus. The notion of "Siberian  health" has been virtually wiped out. The strength of the most  productive and fertile age groups is dropping, especially among  men. The outflow of the population from Siberia, which is being  registered, means the loss of high-quality population with  superior educational and professional standards and the  "accumulation" of individuals with inferior characteristics.    Therefore, we have a demographically exposed Siberia with a  continuously deteriorating population structure, with a social  infrastructure in crisis, with ethnic variegation, and with an  immense, poorly controlled expanse. Is such a Siberia capable of  opposing continuous and energetic expansion? Tremendous  responsibility for the consequences of a short-sighted and  passive policy in the eastern regions of Russia devolves on the  local structures of power and the central government of Russia  alike. It is precisely to this that we would like to attract the  attention of the public in publishing the present article.</p>

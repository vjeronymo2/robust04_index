			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / People: Mattiussi's long distance learning The past 18 months have been unsettling ones for Andrea Mattiussi (above), chief executive of Lawson Mardon, the international packaging group, writes Bernard Simon. From the start, he had to adjust to constant travel between Lawson's head office in Toronto, his home in London, and the base of Lawson's major shareholder in Milan. Mattiussi sometimes describes his office as his briefcase and cellular phone. But the upheavals keep coming. Alusuisse-Lonza, the Swiss industrial group, has spent the past month poring over Lawson's books to decide whether to go ahead with a CDollars 555m takeover bid. This week, Mattiussi's former boss, Italian financier Sergio Cragnotti, agreed to pay CDollars 2.7m to settle allegations of manipulating Lawson's share price and insider trading. Cragnotti, whose investment firm controls Lawson, was also banned for life from being a director or officer of any Ontario-based company. Mattiussi is given high marks for cutting costs and giving a sharper focus to Lawson's business, most of which is in Europe. His shrewdest move, however, may have been to put some distance between himself and Cragnotti. He is said to have vigorously defended the interests of Lawson's outside shareholders, even at the expense of some friction with his former employer. That may explain why Mattiussi heard about Cragnotti's deal with Alusuisse only a couple of hours before it was announced. If Alusuisse goes ahead with its bid, it will need to decide whether it wants Mattiussi to stay on as ceo. Last week the Ontario securities commssion said there was no evidence that Mattiussi or any other Lawson director was involved or aware of Cragnotti's activites.</p>

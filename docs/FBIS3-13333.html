[passage  omitted]    Upon arrival at Abu Dhabi Airport, the brother chairman of  the Presidential Council made a statement to the UAE mass media.  He said: Our visit to the sisterly UAE tonight gives me  personally an opportunity to meet with dear brother His Highness  Shakyh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al-Nuhayyan, the UAE president, and to  hold consultations with him on all that is related to the  intimate relations between the two sisterly countries. These  distinguished relations are testified to by the projects that  have been carried out by the UAE in Yemen, projects that prove  the deep relations of amity among the peoples of the Arabian  Peninsula and the Gulf. Our Yemeni people will always highly  appreciate the stand of Shaykh Zayid and the sons of his  generous people in the UAE and their contribution to our  development process and support for the unity of Yemen. [words  indistinct] a living example of the deep sisterly relations  between the two peoples. During the visit, I will brief my  honorable brother, Shaykh Zayid, on the developments of the  situation in our country in light of the signing of the pledge  and accord document and the efforts being exerted to begin  implementing it on the basis of reviving the Constitutional and  executive institutions and cooperation among all parties to the  government coalition -- the General Peoples's Congress, the  Yemeni Socialist Party, and the Yemeni Reform Grouping. This  will ensure putting an end to the political crisis, containing  its regrettable repercussions, consolidating unity, and  maintaining the democratic experience in our country. In this  regard, we cannot do without the efforts and role of the  brothers in the UAE, led by His Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan, who has  taken honorable pan-Arab stands in support of Yemeni unity,  which is a pan-Arab gain for the Arab nation and a significant  factor for bolstering regional security, stability, and peace.  We are also looking forward to a greater UAE role at the  current stage in view of the his Highness Shaykh Zayid's special  status in the hearts of the sons of Yemen and for his known  wisdom and pan-Arab concern to serve the Arab nation's  objectives and supreme interests. Undoubtedly, our talks in the  UAE will deal with ways of clearing the Arab atmosphere of all  impurities that have stuck to it as a result of the regrettable  Gulf crisis. We will also be discussing ways of restoring Arab  solidarity, especially since His Highness Shaykh Zayid initiated  the call for healing the rift, closing Arab ranks, and restoring  Arab solidarity. We in the Republic of Yemen have supported  this pan-Arab initiative. We will do our best along with our  brothers to achieve this objective.</p>

			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Stanhope renews talks with British Land Stanhope was still trying to avoid receivership last night, more than 24 hours after its banks asked for repayment of their Pounds 148m loans. The board, headed by Mr Stuart Lipton, was meeting to consider its position after a day of talks with British Land, the property investment company run by Mr John Ritblat. British Land's earlier rescue offers were rejected because they asked Stanhope's banks to write-off of more than 20p in the pound on their loans. On Thursday, at least four of Stanhope's 16 banks voted not to extend the deadline for repayment of the company's credit facility. The banks had granted a three-day breathing space on Monday but any further extension required unanimous consent of the syndicate led by Barclays. Stanhope's main asset is its 50 per cent stake in Broadgate Properties, which owns much of the Broadgate and Ludgate office developments in the City of London. Other than British Land, the most credible rescue offer came from PosTel, the post and telecommunications pension fund run by Mr Alastair Ross Goobey. PosTel had proposed a Pounds 250m rights issue which would have enabled Stanhope to repay most of its debts and buy the other half of Broadgate Properties from the receiver to Rosehaugh, Stanhope's former development partner which went into receivership two years ago. However, negotiations with Rosehaugh's receiver broke down this week when PosTel's Pounds 106m offer for the other half of Broadgate Properties was rejected. The receiver, with the support of Rosehaugh's banks, asked for at least Pounds 110m. At this price, PosTel could not offer Stanhope's banks enough for its plan to command their support. Under the guidance of Mr Lipton, Stanhope was behind some of London's most admired developments, including Broadgate and Stockley Park, the innovative commerce park near Heathrow Airport. The company was floated on the Unlisted Securities Market in 1987. Its shares peaked at 321p in 1988, valuing the company at Pounds 500m, and were suspended on Thursday at 8p.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (4): Green hurdle has added to costs - The impact of environmental legislation on the industry ENVIRONMENTAL regulation has saddled the chemical industry with a competitive disadvantage, chemical companies say, even though environmental groups remain sceptical that companies' behaviour has changed for the better. The effect on the industry's cost structure raises questions of whether indus- trialised countries should attempt to manufacture bulk chemicals if they are seriously committed to rising 'green' standards. The chemical industry was one of the first to be targeted by the environmental regul- ation which has built up in layers in the past two decades in industrialised countries. Rules have ratcheted down the permissible level of emissions, and some - such as the UK's 1990 Environmental Protection Act and parts of the US environmental legislation - have begun to insist as well on installation of the best available technology. Meanwhile, the growing popular support for 'green' issues, which reached a peak across much of Europe at the end of the 1980s, has made it harder and less predictable for chemical companies to get approval for expansion. More rules are in the pipeline. The European Commission is working on directives to restrict the emissions of solvents used in wood treatment and paints, and to make companies integrate control of pollution and accident-prevention. The ambitious and much publicised response from the industry was the worldwide 'Responsible Care' programme for voluntary monitoring of emissions. But even if that has helped to improve the industry's public image - a point contested by pressure groups such as Greenpeace - it is clear that new rules have added to some manufacturing costs. Cefic, the European Chemical Industry Council, estimates that environmental spending within European chemical companies is running at about the level of R&amp;D spending, although it lacks firm figures or an historical comparison. Mr Louis Jourdan, Cefic's director of technical affairs, says: 'Of course (the rules) cause some competitive problems, although our innovation remains better than that of India or Indonesia.' He points to the problem for European companies of competing with cheap imports of caprolactam, the raw material for nylon fibres, or with imports from eastern Europe. But he adds: 'It is not just environmental regulation that causes the problem, it is differences in salary levels and energy prices too.' He agrees that there is a debate on whether Europe should produce bulk chemicals, though he argues that declining European production of aluminium and fertilisers is due more to the high cost of European energy. Ms Tamar Posner, director of the UK Chemical Industries Association, believes the handicap stems from uncertainty as much as from higher costs, even though the association estimates that spending on environmental protection has risen from 9 per cent of operational costs to 14 per cent between 1990 and 1992. 'Uncertainty is the killer - opportunity is missed waiting for authorisation,' she says. The 1990 Act has been exceptionally difficult to implement, in her view, because so little consultation with the industry was carried out, unlike the previous year's Act on the control of substances hazardous to health. The association and the Department of the Environment have had complaints about the Environmental Protection Act from speciality chemicals companies which want to be allowed to receive different, one-off orders from a whole range of customers. After struggling to define what constitutes the best affordable technology for each applicant, the pollution inspectorate now appears to be moving towards a definition at industry level, even if some plants then become uneconomic. The industry associations' talk of consultation and co-operation with government departments is likely to do little to pacify the environmental groups. Ms Madeleine Cobbing, of Greenpeace UK, says: 'We haven't seen any positive results from the responsible care programme. There's been a change in what is being said, but whether companies are really changing how they behave is another matter.' Greenpeace has been heavily criticised by government departments and industrialists recently for its 'No legal pollution' campaign, in which it argued that companies should not be given licences that allowed them to pollute rivers and estuaries. However the campaign, not judged to be one of Greenpeace's best even by its supporters, ranked companies on their alleged pollution by the quantities shown in their discharge permits. But companies promptly retaliated that the actual, unpublished, levels were much lower. Environmentalists' response is that there is not enough systematically-gathered public information. Ms Cobbing says: 'There is no way of measuring the real emissions unless the companies give out the data,' which many decline to do on grounds of commercial confidentiality. Releasing this data would be a sign that the chemical industry was 'really prepared to be open,' she adds. Environmental groups long ago decided that the chemical industry was one of the biggest villains on the green landscape. They played a prominent part in alerting the public to the issue and - it must be deduced - in triggering some of the legislation. But they may find it harder in future to keep such a central role in the debate even if they make a practice of bringing pollution prosecutions themselves, as Greenpeace has done against ICI. The pages of legislation on the statute books have taken some pressure off politicians who were being urged by environmentalists and constituents to 'do something'. In turn, the chemical industry's new talk of co-operation and bridge-building has changed the tone of the debate - it no longer appears to be at loggerheads with the government. More time - and, as the environmentalists rightly point out, more data  - is needed to establish how far industry behaviour has changed. Those figures may also show, more clearly than is yet possible, whether companies are handicapped as a result and whether the right balance between competitiveness and green standards has been struck.</p>

(``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  a proposed rule change to amend PHLX Rule 1015, ``Excessive Dealing in Options,'' to delete the phrase ``in view of his financial resources'' from the rule and to renumber the rule as PHLX Rule 1021. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b0(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The proposed rule change was noticed for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33804 (March 22, 1994), 59 FR 14699 (March 29, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Originally, the PHLX also proposed to amend Exchange Rule 771, ``Excessive Trading of Members,'' to delete the phrase ``or in view of the market for such security'' from the rule. Subsequently, the PHLX submitted a letter returning that phrase to Exchange Rule 771. See Letter from Gerald D. O'Connell, Vice President, Market Surveillance, PHLX, to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, Options Regulation, Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission, dated April 13, 1994. This change is non-substantive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Currently, PHLX Rule 1015, ``Excessive Dealing in Options,'' prohibits a member from effecting purchases or sales in options which are excessive in view of his financial resources or in view of the market for such security. The PHLX proposes to amend PHLX Rule 1015 by deleting the phrase ``in view of his financial resources'' and by renumbering the rule as PHLX Rule 1021. The PHLX proposes to delete the reference to the financial resources of a member from current PHLX Rule 1015 because this phrase is already appropriately included in Exchange Rule 771, ``Excessive Trading of Members.'' <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  The PHLX indicates that the financial responsibility reference included in the trade practice rule (PHLX Rule 1015) was recently the source of confusion, which will be corrected by the PHLX's proposal. Specifically, under the proposed rule change, PHLX Rule 771 will govern the financial aspect of excessive options trading and PHLX Rule 1021 will govern the trade practice aspect of excessive options trading. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> PHLX Rule 771 states that ``No member, member organization, partner or stockholder therein shall effect on the Exchange purchases or sales for any account in which he or it is directly or indirectly interested, which purchases or sales are excessive in view or his or its financial resources or in view of the market for such security.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Telephone conversation between Edith Hallahan, Attorney, PHLX, and Yvonne Fraticelli, Staff Attorney, Options Branch, Division, Commission, on April 26, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6 of the Act, in general, and, in particular with section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, as well as to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) in that it is designed to protect investors and the public interest. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  specifically, the proposal will help to clarify the PHLX's rules by deleting the phrase ``in view of his financial resources'' from PHLX Rule 1015, so that PHLX Rule 1015 will apply solely to the trade practice aspect of excessive options trading and PHLX Rule 771 will apply to the financial aspect of excessive options trading. In its proposal, the PHLX states that the financial responsibility reference in PHLX Rule 1015 has been a source of confusion. Because PHLX Rule 771, which applies to both equities and options, contains the same financial responsibility provision as that provided currently in PHLX Rule 1015, the Commission believes that it is reasonable for the PHLX to delete the redundant financial responsibility reference in PHLX Rule 1015 in order to eliminate confusion. Because PHLX Rule 771 applies to both equities and options, the proposal to delete the financial responsibility reference from PHLX Rule 1015 will clarify PHLX Rule 1015 without affecting the substance of the PHLX's prohibition of excessive options trading. In addition, the Commission believes that the increased clarity of PHLX Rule 1015 will help to facilitate compliance with the rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> It is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;PHLX&hyph;93&hyph;51) is approved. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1982). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=3 --> Margaret H.

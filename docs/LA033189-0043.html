			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTER A YEAR AWAY, GARZA SCORES QUICK KO OF ALONSO  </P> <P> Jaime Garza took off a year and four days between fights.  </P> <P> And when he finally decided to return to the ring, the former World Boxing  Council super-bantamweight champion couldn't get down to the required 130  pounds for his 10-round bout against Rocky Alonso Thursday night at the  Hollywood Palladium.  </P> <P> For that, Garza was fined $500 of his $2,500 purse by the State Athletic  Commission.  </P> <P> In the end, it was all worth the weight.  </P> <P> Garza, displaying the sharpness he exhibited as a WBC champion five years ago,  knocked out Alonso 2:57 into the first round Thursday night to the cheers of a  crowd of about 1,000.  </P> <P> Garza, 29, scored early and often in the round with a stinging jab. Alonso's  only effective punch was a right hand midway through the round.  </P> <P> Then, in the closing seconds, Garza caught Alonso with a left, then a straight  right that caused the Bakersfield fighter's legs to wobble.  </P> <P> "I had planned to pace myself," Garza (48-4 with 44 knockouts) said, "because I  didn't want to look sloppy.  </P> <P> "But when I got him hurt, I didn't want to waste any time."  </P> <P> Nor did he. Garza moved in and floored Alonso with an overhand left.  </P> <P> Alonso, who weighed in at 129, tried to struggle to his feet as referee Lou  Filippo counted over him. But by the time Filippo had reached 10, Alonso  (33-24-1) was still on his knees.  </P> <P> That's where most of Garza's early opponents wound up. He won his first 40  fights, 38 by knockout, along with the WBC title by the age of 25.  </P> <P> But Juan Meza then knocked him out in the first round of a 1984 fight in New  York, and Garza has been trying to get back up ever since.  </P> <P> Including the Meza fight, he was just 7-4 before Thursday night's bout.  </P> <P> He had been knocked out in the fifth round of his last fight, a year ago at the  Forum, by Marcos Villasana.  </P> <P> Then, the former Pacoima resident went home to his family ranch in Texas with  thoughts of perhaps opening a restaurant.  </P> <P> Garza broke with long-time manager Benny Georgino. The contract between the two  is currently in arbitration.  </P> <P> Then, Harry Kazandjian and trainer Pat Goossen talked Garza into a comeback.  </P> <P> "I felt strong," Garza said. "but if I have to fight at 135 pounds, that's what  I'll do."  </P></p>

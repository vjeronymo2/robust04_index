			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Harrods prepares Kurt Geiger for market Harrods Holdings, the group owned by the Fayed brothers which includes the famous London department store, is preparing Kurt Geiger, its upmarket shoe retailing subsidiary, for a stock exchange flotation next year. The group has confirmed Mr James Walsh, who has been acting chief executive of Kurt Geiger for several months, in the role and said it was the beginning of a process 'intended to lead to flotation as a public company next year'. That would include the appointment of a non-executive chairman. Mr Walsh, 45, was previously group finance director. His successor in that role is Mr Omar Bayoumi, 39, recruited from SG Warburg, the merchant bank, where he played a prominent part in the Fayeds' Pounds 413m flotation of the House of Fraser department store chain. Mr Bayoumi will also be chief financial officer of Harrods department store. Kurt Geiger is one of several businesses, including Turnbull &amp; Asser, the shirt maker, and the Carlton Highland Hotel in Edinburgh, that remained with Harrods when House of Fraser was floated. It has two trading names, Kurt Geiger and Carvela, with 110 outlets in the UK, including standalone stores in London's Bond Street and Sloane Street, and many concessions in department stores - particularly in House of Fraser. It is the biggest shoe retailer in London stores. It made operating profits last year of Pounds 4m on sales of Pounds 52.8m. Analysts said those figures suggested a flotation might value the business at about Pounds 30m-Pounds 40m. Harrods said Kurt Geiger stood 'an extremely good chance of trading successfully as an independent company'.</p>

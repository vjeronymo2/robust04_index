			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Complaints point to confusion over single market A NUMBER of EC countries have been accused of failing to abolish controls on people and goods only four days after the European Community formally launched the barrier-free internal market. Euro Citizen Action Service, a Brussels-based lobby group for citizens' rights, said yesterday it had already received several 'substantial' complaints about controls, via a fax and telephone hotline which was opened yesterday and will run all this week. In London, the Department of Trade and Industry's single market telephone hotline received about 250 calls yesterday. Some callers appeared to have woken up to the implications of the single market at the last moment, an official said. Popular requests were for information on the rules governing the transferability of professional qualifications in Europe and for a guide to sources of advice on the EC. Inquiry levels were about average for a Monday, which was usually the busiest day of the week, the DTI said. In recent months the DTI 1992 Helpline received an average of 1,000 calls a week and an estimated total of 300,000 since it was set up four years ago. The European Commission's London office also reported a high level of inquiries but other business advice agencies reported a quiet start to the single market. Mr Tony Venables, director of Ecas, said that judging from the 70 calls received, there was still confusion about the lifting of controls. He managed to persuade British immigration officials at London's Gatwick airport to allow him into the UK this weekend without presenting his passport, but other travellers were forced to show documents. Britain has said it will not abolish passport checks on travellers within the EC, although it has promised to lighten controls on EC citizens. But Mr Venables said: 'As far as we can gather at the moment, customs officials have not been given any specific advice.' Ecas is likely to pursue allegations about British immigration authorities persisting with passport checks. It could well follow up complaints from Gibraltar that Spain has tightened border controls. One Belgian woman has also complained that Spanish customs officials made her list the contents of her car at the French border. Greece is under fire for allegedly insisting registered parcels sent from other EC countries should still be examined by customs officials. However, a number of EC citizens have called to complain that lifting border controls would allow drug smugglers and terrorists to move freely. Mr Venables said the hotline might be extended into next week. He said the most substantial allegations would be put to the European Commission. Ecas, Rue Defacqz 1, 1050 Brussels, Belgium.

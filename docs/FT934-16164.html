			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Demand forecast to remain flat WORLD COAL trade is expected to fall this year in both volume and value terms and a return to the high growth rates of the past looks improbable, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. In its annual report on the coal situation, the ECE predicts a 0.5 per cent decline in world imports to about 409m tonnes this year, compared with a rise of 1 per cent rise last year and 6 per cent annual growth in the late 1980s. Further growth in international coal trade will depend on demand for steam coal, the ECE suggests. The coking coal market is in long-term decline because of changing steel-making technologies. World coal production increased slightly last year, though total consumption fell. The ECE expects global coal demand to remain fairly flat over the next five to ten years at about 4.5bn tonnes but then to pick up as oil and gas become scarcer. Output fell sharply in 1992 in central and eastern Europe, notably in Ukraine. The decline is forecast to continue until industrial output in the region stabilises. However, Russia hopes to boost output by 10 per cent a year for the rest of this decade. Coal still provides 44 per cent of the world's electricity, the ECE points out. Though the steady tightening of environmental regulations and control of carbon dioxide emissions could induce some countries to switch to alternative fuels, large amounts of coal will still be required for power generation for the next two decades and beyond to meet rising electricity demand.</p>

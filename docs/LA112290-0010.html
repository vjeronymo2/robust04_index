			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEHIND THE WHEEL / ACURA LEGEND: ALL THE RIGHT STUFF  </P> <P> Describe in one word, suggested the co-driver on our recent whistle around  Cabernet country, the strength of the new Acura Legend.  </P> <P> Harmony.  </P> <P> In two words, continued the inquiring mind, report the car's downside.  </P> <P> Unexciting loveliness.  </P> <P> Or in other words: The second-generation Legend that enters showrooms this  week, is rather like a favorite son-in-law. Says exactly the right things. Does  everything with decorum and the precise amount of hurry and would give you the  button-down off his back.  </P> <P> Yet wouldn't it be fun if just once, Freddie Flawless would get real, buy a  motorcycle and show up for Thanksgiving dinner in a florescent tank-top?  </P> <P> Buffoonery, however, will never be an option with the Legend. It was born  peerless.  </P> <P> Introduced by the Acura Division of Honda in 1986 as the first of Japan's  up-market cars, the dignified Legend immediately earned permanent placement on  the Top Ten lists of major automotive magazines for superb engineering that  provided smoothness of drive and a reputation for endless reliability. From  first year to this, Legend has been the Consumer Satisfaction Index (CSI)  champion of auto-market analysts J. D. Power &amp; Associates. Some say they  should have retired its sheet metal.  </P> <P> Consider the contrasts. On almost all cars -- with the definite exceptions of  Rolls-Royce and Mercedes -- there is a constant sense of small bits of steel  moving rapidly against large pieces of hot aluminum and you just know that  someday, somewhere, something will break. The sound of a Legend is a maestro's  whisper, suggesting the car could be safely delivered with a 25-year warranty  on engine and transmission.  </P> <P> Other motor cars are throaty generators of the rush and twitch of hearty  driving, and true relaxation usually occurs only when the car is parked and  locked. With Legend, polished mechanicals do the manual and mental work.  </P> <P> So while the car goes quickly and very nimbly, there is time and room for a  driver to think of other things, plan ahead and even play license plates with  the kids.  </P> <P> This is not simple excellence.  </P> <P> This is absolute perfection.  </P> <P> But then Lassie, the Lakers of the '80s and Mary Worth were perfect, and purity  gets a little tedious at times. To flaw is definitely human. Conversely, nobody  said that owning a Bentley is as dull as it gets.  </P> <P> So if you thirst for quiet power and a private, muted world once windows hiss  shut, the Legend will be your cup of camomile. But for those who consider  driving to be an exercise in upper-body strength, may we suggest shopping for a  1969 Dodge Charger Daytona?  </P> <P> Exactly how Acura achieved its position close to zero defects is yet another  example of Japan's dedication to what has been called "rapid inch-up" -- a  program of constant improvement with no pauses to relish success or wait for  the competition.  </P> <P> With Legend, said a spokesman, it began soon after the car was launched. The  broad goal, he added, "was to make an already excellent automobile better in  every way."  </P> <P> So the multivalve, 2.7-liter, V-6 engine has been replaced by a new 3.2-liter  V-6. Horsepower has improved from 160 to 200. The engine has been remounted the  way God and Henry Ford intended -- longitudinally, or north to south, instead  of transversely across the engine bay. Despite this mounting, the car retains  its front-wheel drive with power transmitted through a differential and drive  shafts that actually pass through the oil pan. There are two benefits to this  set-up:  </P> <P> Mounting the engine longitudinally gives the car better weight distribution for  greater balance, reduces engine vibrations and improves rigidity of the frame.  </P> <P> Front-wheel drive requires no clumsy shafts and joints (to say nothing of  interior space lost to the transmission tunnel) running to the rear wheels,  which redistributes the overall weight of the car and generally improves  traction in the slick and slushy.  </P> <P> The 1991 Legend (available in base, L and LS sedans -- with a Legend coupe due  in February) is longer, wider and lower than the first-born. Because its sheet  metal is thicker for a more rigid, safer cabin, the car is also heavier. So the  heft of the new Legend, its handling, its squat on the road and even subtleties  of its styling are now much closer to European.  </P> <P> The base and L versions still come crammed with the high technology of  anti-lock brakes, speed-sensitive power steering, driver-side air bag and  quality conveniences bar none. Standard in the LS sedan are leather seats,  burled walnut trim -- and a passenger-side air bag mounted high in the dash  without munching the glove box.  </P> <P> The price, of course, has also grown. Base for the Legend sedan is $26,800, and  the ceiling is over $34,000. So in cost, the new Legend is in competition with  the Alfa Romeo 164, SAAB 9000 Turbo and the Cadillac Seville. But in  technology, comfort and image, claim somewhat ambitious Acurans, it is  alongside the $42,000 BMW 535I and the $45,000 Mercedes-Benz 300E.  </P> <P> What Legend is not -- despite some expectations from industry watchers -- is a  contender for the plush and very rapid thrones occupied by Lexus LS400 and the  Infiniti Q45. According to Acura insiders, the high-end, high-image luxury car  niche is largely overrated verging on the overpopulated.  </P> <P> Styling of the Legend matches the curate's diplomacy when the bishop asked  about his breakfast egg: It's good in parts.  </P> <P> By stretching the wheelbase without moving the position of the rear wheels,  Acura has reduced the front overhang, and that certainly adds a suggestion of  performance and purpose to the front of the car.  </P> <P> Corners and edges have been deeply rounded and softened from earlier and boxier  years. Most of the gapes for engine ventilation have been hidden beneath the  front fascia, leaving one discreet, chromium-rimmed slot as the only really  visible grille.  </P> <P> Wheels beneath wonderfully flared arches fit deeper into the wells, which adds  to the low profile of the car. Gaps between panels and doors have been reduced  almost 50% to give a fit and finish that Honda-Acura stylists consider "the  seamless look."  </P> <P> But the whole is generic and the rear end (right down to the duck tail air dam  borrowed from countless other cars) looks more like a CEO's version of the  Honda Accord. Nothing startles. Everything suggests aerodynamic data shared  with other manufacturers, and one day, swear by it, our cars will come with the  styling differences of Brussels sprouts.  </P> <P> Automotive luxury, however, is judged by how an interior is designed. That,  after all, is where we work and play, either endure or enjoy. Inside the  expanded interior (larger by about 10%) the 1991 Legend is a good room in a  finer hotel.  </P> <P> Seats are firm for spirited driving yet comfy enough for the hours we must  spend creeping nose-to-trunk and reading bumper stickers. Head and hip room are  good up front although leg space seems a little lacking. Yet knee room is  better than average out back.  </P> <P> Visibility of white-on-black instruments, the pleasant addition of primary  radio controls on the steering wheel, the feel of that wheel and soft leather  seats, gearshift position and a long center bank of sound and climate controls  are what everyone expects from Acura: Optimum positioning and convenience.  </P> <P> And in insulating this luxury interior from wind and street noises, Acura seems  to have borrowed the magnificent quietness that comes with Lexus, Infiniti and  Cheops' tomb.  </P> <P> The maturing Legend is very fast, with 0-60 times that out-skedaddle the BMW  535, Lexus LS400, most Mercedes and all the Jaguars. Better yet, full power  comes on early and is concentrated in the 2,400-4,000-r.p.m. range where we  spend approximately 99.97% of our driving time.  </P> <P> The Legend's introduction to the motoring media took place in San Francisco  this month. That allowed full enjoyment of the Legend as a true driver's car  and in a region where, to maintain the theme of things, all vineyards are  surrounded by corkscrew roads.  </P> <P> Being a front-driver means the Legend maneuvers with understeer -- a tendency  of the front tires to lose grip while the rear wheels are still wondering what  all the squealing is about. But it is less than last year, a gentle  progression, and a handling reaction that occurs only when car and driver are  playing Alpine rally.  </P> <P> Off-center, the steering produces heavy castering pressure which did become an  effort on the aforementioned twisty bits. But braking is firm and straight.  Shifting the 5-speed manual transmission (a 4-speed automatic is an option) can  be done by telepathy because Honda/Accord has a patent on cogs and cones of  silk and honey.  </P> <P> If only this gentle gymnast weren't so conservative.  </P> <P> Even Legend's body colors are about as dramatic as George Bush's pajamas.  Twilight (Last Gleaming) Blue. Rosewood (Jim Beam) Brown. Charcoal (Graybeard)  Granite. Cobalt (Black Eye) Blue. Vineyard (Graveyard) Gray. Granada (Boredom)  Black.  </P> <P> Pucker-Up Scarlet would do wonders for such a line.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1991 ACURA LEGEND  </P> <P> COST:  </P> <P> Base sedan, with manual,: $26,800  </P> <P> LS sedan, $34,200 (includes automatic transmission, leather seats, driver and  passenger air bags)  </P> <P> ENGINE:  </P> <P> 3.2 liter, 24-valve, V-6 engine developing 200 horsepower.  </P> <P> TYPE:  </P> <P> Front-wheel drive, four-door, luxury performance sedan.  </P> <P> PERFORMANCE:  </P> <P> 0-60 m.p.h., automatic, as tested, 7.7 seconds.  </P> <P> Top speed, estimated, 135 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Fuel economy, EPA, city-highway, 18-26 m.p.g (manual) and 19/23 m.p.g.

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Wakeham sees thriving electricity competition COMPETITION in electricity generation will develop in spite of an increase in gas prices, Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, said yesterday. Fears that the recent 35 per cent increase in British Gas prices for new contracts to supply power stations would crush the independent stations planned in the UK were unfounded, Mr Wakeham told an Economist conference on electricity in London. The increase was a short-term matter, he said, and longer-term gas reserves in the North Sea were plentiful. Competition in gas supply was emerging and no fundamental change in the gas industry's regulatory regime was necessary. Although British Gas had challenged an order freezing the 35 per cent price increase, issued by gas industry regulator Mr James McKinnon, Mr Wakeham said that the challenge had been agreed with the regulator and was intended by British Gas to allow further talks with power companies. Four power station projects had struck deals with other gas producers, and more were likely. Regulation was promoting competition in both the gas and the electricity industries, Mr Wakeham said. For example, domestic electricity customers had important new rights, such as compensation for power failures, and domestic gas customers had seen prices fall since the privatisation of gas in 1986. Regulation should, he believed, ultimately wither away. 'Enough progress has already been made in this area to throw into considerable doubt the contention that privatisation has simply swapped state ownership for state regulation,' he said. Speaking at the same conference, Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, the regulatory body, said the new electricity market was working well but some changes were still needed. He said he would review charges imposed by the National Grid Company on suppliers and users of electricity. Those ignore the fact that it is more costly to transmit electricity across the country, and do not use prices to indicate to generators and users at which locations it would be most economic for them to join the grid. He also said that more sophisticated meters would be necessary if small customers were to have the opportunity to take electricity from outside their area. The General Electric Company of the UK is to build a Pounds 90m combined heat and power station to provide steam and electricity for British Nuclear Fuels' Sellafield site in Cumbria. THE GOVERNMENT was criticised yesterday for relaxing standards to be applied to pollution from power stations under the new Environmental Protection Act, writes John Hunt. The latest guidance on emissions of nitrogen oxides specifies a ceiling of 650mg per cubic meters from solid fuels at power stations - a relaxation from the 400mg proposed earlier. The DoE emphasised that these levels are kept under review and could be raised later as abatement technology improves. Friends of the Earth, the environmental organisation, complained that the relaxation had been allowed in order to help the newly privatised electricity supply industry. It threatened a court challenge to the Pollution Inspectorate's interpretation of the act.</p>

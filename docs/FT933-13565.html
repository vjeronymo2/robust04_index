			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / The Japanese Election: Leaders get ready for horse-trading / A look at prospects good and bad for the parties and the people JAPAN'S political leaders, old and new, were counting heads early today in preparation for the horse-trading that will determine the shape of the next government. With the Liberal Democratic party having lost its majority, leaders were deciding whom they would back in a coalition and at what price. For the old leaders, the poor results may force resignation. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the LDP leader, apologised for having brought distress to the party, while Mr Sadao Yamahana, head of the Social Democratic party, the largest opposition party, saw half of his MP lose their seats and was 'contemplating' his political future. Meanwhile, Mr Tsutomu Hata, head of the Japan Renewal party, and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japan New party leader, suddenly find themselves with the power to create a government. If the two parties join forces, along with the SDP and other opposition partners, they will have the numbers to force the LDP into opposition for the first time since 1955. LDP officials were hoping that Mr Hosokawa, who has kept his intentions vague, will join it in a coalition in return for a senior post in a new government. After noting that the LDP will not be able to form a government, Mr Hosokawa said: 'I will have to consult my members before making a decision.' Mr Hata, whose defection from the LDP prompted the election, said he would not rejoin the party, though some JRP officials have indicated that, if made prime minister, Mr Hata might accept a coalition with the LDP or the SDP. Whichever way he turns, Mr Hata may find his time at the top is short. The arithmetic is made more complicated by the possibility of further splits from the LDP or a break-up of the SDP. By law, parliament has to convene within 30 days, giving leaders the luxury of time in mixing and matching the nine main parties in the quest for a majority of the 511 seats. Smaller opposition parties were being cagey. The Democratic Socialist party, with 15 members elected, had offered support for the SDP and JRP in a coalition, but last night hinted that it would back the LDP. The generally isolated Japan Communist party, also with 15 members, could also find itself being courted for an opposition coalition. The prospect of a coalition including the left-wing socialists and the relatively right-wing JRP, with the communists thrown in to make up the numbers, gives an indication of the potential instability in coming months. Yesterday's election has set the scene for the next one, expected within a year. If the LDP again takes office, it could be brought down by the opposition parties in coalition. The JRP, which did not have enough time to recruit candidates this time around, is already preparing for the next election, when it will have many more than the 69 representatives who stood yesterday. The results suggest that Japanese politics have changed irrevocably, and yet the battered structure could return to its old shape. One of the new parties could join forces with the LDP, as has happened in the past, and public anger over political scandal could fade, leaving a dominant LDP surrounded by a clutch of directionless opposition parties. LDP officials, knowing their party would lose its majority, were generally hopeful that the election has allowed voters to express their anger. The theory is that the party will recover lost seats at the next election, as the newer parties will no longer be able to campaign only on the issue of 'reform' and will be forced to detail policies on such divisive issues such as foreign policy and taxation. Having successfully presented themselves as an alternative to the SDP, the newer parties, the JNP and JRP, must next prove that they are an alternative to the LDP, which they have not yet done. Most of their votes have come from the SDP, which gained in the past from disgruntlement with the LDP but which has been content with its role as an opposition party never likely to rule. The form of the new government is likely to be determined more by personalities than by policy or ideology. The resignation of Mr Miyazawa will make it easier for one of the opposition parties to join the LDP in a coalition, as exit polls yesterday suggested that 85 per cent of voters want him to resign. A likely successor is Mr Toshiki Kaifu, a former prime minister with a reputation as a reformer. He was dumped by the LDP two years ago after suggesting reforms to the electoral structure, the issue which triggered the election last month. Officials at the JRP and JNP have suggested that Mr Kaifu is preferable to Mr Miyazawa, but have not given commitments of support. The appointment of Mr Kaifu as head of a coalition will not necessarily bring stability or reform. Like Mr Miyazawa, he does not have the support within the party to demand that other factions do his bidding. Mr Kaifu is seen by the heads of the LDP's larger factions as a socially acceptable leader capable of guiding the party through political turbulence  -and back to the good old days, when there was an orderly queue for the prime ministership.</p>

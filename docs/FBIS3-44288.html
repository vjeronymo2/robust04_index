During the first 10 months of 1993, bilateral trade reached  US$1.631 billion, a 12.41 percent growth over the US$1.451  billion registered during the same period of 1992, according to  an official at the ROC embassy in Pretoria.    During the January-October period of 1993, the ROC imported  US$1.127 billion worth of goods from South Africa, up 17.92  percent over the same period of 1992.    Exports to South Africa totaled US$504 million, a growth of  1.78 percent from 1992 tallies. South Africa enjoyed a trade  surplus of US$623 million during the period, the official noted.    The official added that the ROC's booming trade with South  Africa was not affected by the 1993 lifting of a world trade  embargo placed on the country and he predicted an expansion in  overall economic and trade relations between the two countries.</p>

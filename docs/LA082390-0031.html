			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A STITCH IN TIME REALLY WORKS  </P> <P> In the best of times, stricter enforcement of sweatshop abuses would be the  best way to deal with a growing problem. But more enforcement costs money, and  the state has a budget crisis, so Gov. George Deukmejian should at least sign  the measure on his desk. It would toughen the liability of garment  manufacturers for abuses committed by their subcontractors.  </P> <P> The legislation, sponsored by Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), comes in  response to recent revelations of widespread labor violations in sweatshops,  which once were concentrated in downtown Los Angeles and now are moving into  Orange County and other suburbs.  </P> <P> It would add responsibility to an industry that has a reputation for blatantly  exploiting workers. As a recent Times series pointed out, thousands of  seamstresses work for a pittance to support California's $6-billion garment  industry. Most are immigrant Latinas or Asians who are too naive or frightened  to defend themselves.  </P> <P> Some manufacturers invite abuses by hiring subcontractors at rates that can't  possibly cover minimum wages. Also, the industry is riddled with  "stitch-and-ditch" subcontractors who are undercapitalized, or simply  unethical, and who disappear without paying owed wages.  </P> <P> Despite awareness of the abuses, garment industry representatives strongly  object to Hayden's bill, saying it's nearly impossible to keep an eye on  subcontractors, and that the cost of doing so would force many manufacturers  into bankruptcy. Instead, they urge stricter government enforcement of current  laws. But state enforcement, already on the decline, is likely to erode further  under this year's budget cutbacks.  </P> <P> Current state law provides for some joint liability, but only if the  subcontractor is not registered with the state. Hayden's bill, AB 3930, would  put manufacturers on notice that they must carefully screen all those with whom  they contract. That won't erase the problem, but it will inject some measure of  accountability into the process.  </P></p>

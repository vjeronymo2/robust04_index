			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: Nabisco expands Spanish side RJR Nabisco, the US food and tobacco group, yesterday exercised its option to buy the remaining 50 per cent of RJR Alimentacion, the Spanish food company that it has managed for the past year as a joint venture with Tabacalera, Spain's state-controlled tobacco corporation. The purchase of the stake, which values the company at Pta17.25bn (Dollars 125m), signals the end of an ill-fated attempt by Tabacalera to diversify into food production. The US multinational had until March 31 1995 to exercise its option for the rest of the joint venture. Its decision to act now is part of a plan to strengthen its European food businesses. RJR Alimentacion markets Royal Brands products in Spain. These include leading biscuit and powdered puddings brands. The core Royal Brands products were bought by Tabacalera from Nabisco when the US conglomerate sold off extensive operations, among them its European businesses, in the late 1980s. The sales were designed to pay off debts used to finance a leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street investment firm. Tabacalera spent some Pta53bn building up a food division around Royal Brands, taking on canned vegetable units, processed meat firms and juice companies, before deciding that it was more profitable to concentrate on tobacco. In July last year, it transformed its Royal Brands units into RJR Alimentacion, a Nabisco-managed joint venture. Having disposed of its food division earlier than planned, Tabacalera, which is 38 per cent-owned by foreign institutions, is expected to step up a streamlining programme involving staff cuts and the closure of three of its 14 plants.</p>

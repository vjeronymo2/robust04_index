			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SECTION CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> BONITA VISTA'S THORNTON COMPLETES CONVALESCENCE WITH VICTORY  </P> <P> A stomach virus forced David Thornton to withdraw from a junior golf tournament  in Tahoe Sunday, and he didn't know up until his tee time Monday if he'd be  able to play for Bonita Vista High School in the San Diego Section team  championships.  </P> <P> Thornton was feeling fine by Tuesday and even better after Wednesday's final  round of the section individual tournament at Singing Hills Golf Course.  </P> <P> Thornton shot a three-under 68 to go with his first-round 69 and won the  individual title by three strokes over Mike Jun and Brian Cates of Madison.  Thornton's 36-hole total of 137 on the par-71 Oak Glen course was two strokes  off the tournament record of 135 set last year by Phil Mickelson of USDHS.  </P> <P> Madison, which won the team title Monday, placed golfers second, third and  fourth in the individual tournament. Jun won a playoff with a par on the second  extra hole for second over Cates. Kevin Riley finished fourth.  </P> <P> The top 10 individuals who are not members of Madison or Poway, the section's  team qualifiers, advanced to the Southern California Golf Championships  beginning June 11 in Bakersfield. Members of qualifying teams who finish in the  top 10 individuals are not counted against the section's allotment; a total of  15 individuals advanced.  </P> <P> Thornton was playing in his fourth section individual tournament, but this is  the first time he has made the cut for the Southern California tournament.  </P> <P> "It was important (to do well) because I haven't done well here the last three  years," Thornton said. "When I was a freshman, I shot a 69 (at Singing Hills)  but I've never shot that well here since."  </P> <P> Thornton, a senior headed for Southern Methodist, matched the 69 Tuesday with  an eagle, birdie and bogey. Wednesday, he beat it with three birdies.  </P> <P> Rob Dennison of Poway and Cates were a shot back to begin the day. Dennison, an  alternate who did not get into the tournament until there was a no-show, kept  pace until he quadruple-bogeyed the 488-yard, par-five seventh.  </P> <P> Cates stayed close and had a chance to cut Thornton's lead to two on the  par-four 12th but missed a 12-inch putt for a birdie. Thornton then birdied the  par-three 13th to take a four-stroke lead.  </P> <P> Jun, playing in the second group, had a solid round with a two-under 69 to go  with his opening-round 71. Cates had 70s on both days.  </P> <P> While everybody else was trying to play catch-up, Thornton was on cruise  control . . . although he said he didn't feel totally comfortable until the  17th.  </P> <P> "Anything can happen, you saw that kid lose four strokes to par on one hole,"  Thornton said. "That can happen to anybody." RICK HAZELTINE  </P></p>

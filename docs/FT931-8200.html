			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / A case of cutting the coat to match the cloth: FT reporters investigate who will bear the brunt of the price effects of devaluation in five sectors that affect the retail prices index. Will it be retailers, consumers, UK manufacturers or suppliers abroad? DON'T expect the devaluation of sterling to produce higher prices for clothing and footwear quickly. That is the message from retailers, in spite of the very high import content of these products. Customers will not stand for price increases at present, and shopkeepers, manufacturers and importers accept they must absorb some of the extra costs caused by sterling's tumble. In some cases this means looking for cheaper sources of supply. For example, the import of cut-price shoes from China last year jumped 60 per cent to 27m pairs. Some British clothing manufacturers have been approached by retailers, such as Woolworths and Littlewoods, seeking quotes for goods normally supplied from the Far East. About 45 per cent of clothes sold in British high streets are imported. Domestic manufacturers also face an increase in costs. They have little option but to import woollen and cotton fibres and fabrics as well as some synthetic materials. Mr Colin Purvis, secretary-general of the Apparel Knitting and Textiles Alliance, said: 'A rough estimate is that about 55 per cent to 60 per cent by value - and 80 per cent by volume - of textiles sold in Britain come from imported materials.' Courtaulds Textiles said the experiences of manufacturers and retailers have been patchy since devaluation. 'Purchases of many finished goods for the 1993 spring selling season would have been agreed with overseas suppliers before sterling's collapse,' said the company, which imports small amounts of clothing to supplement its domestically manufactured range. Marks and Spencer, which buys 80 per cent of its clothing from UK manufacturers, said it would be difficult to pass increases to customers, though some price rises are likely. The British Footwear Manufacturers' Federation said struggling shoe retailers would not want to pass price increases on to customers. 'Retailers will want to buy the cheapest shoe available,' it said. 'If they cannot get them from traditional manufacturers and importers they will switch to other suppliers from emerging countries such as the Republic of China.'</p>

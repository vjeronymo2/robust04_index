			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Russian air traffic strike RUSSIA'S air traffic controllers have threatened an all-out, indefinite strike from tomorrow in protest at a court action against the union for causing 'economic sabotage' during a strike in August, John Lloyd writes from Moscow. The Federation of Air Traffic Controllers says it will get support in 57 out of Russia's 135 airports, including those in Moscow. Mr Vadim Borisov, a spokesman for the union, said last night that this included Sheremetyevy 2, the main airport for international flights. Mr Gennady Zaitsev, deputy director of the air traffic department, said at the weekend that the government would do all it could to keep air traffic, including international flights, moving.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Charles Baynes falls to Pounds 1.88m CHARLES BAYNES, the spec-ialist engineering and packaging distribution company, suffered the expected downturn in profitability in the first half of 1992, reporting a fall from Pounds 3.02m to Pounds 1.88m pre-tax. However, the directors said they had enough confidence in the longer term outlook and the group's cash position to lift the interim dividend by 5 per cent to 0.525p (0.5p). Earnings per share declined to 1.05p (1.8p). The cash position was further enhanced to Pounds 12m after the period-end by the sale of the building components division to Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, for Pounds 8.6m cash. Turnover in this division, affected by the 'dire straits' of the construction sector, had fallen 17 per cent in the half, though there was a small profit, the company said. Group turnover improved from Pounds 34.1m to Pounds 37.2m but the company said a direct comparison was not meaningful. It pointed to the acquisitions of Fist Fast and Truflo for Pounds 10.6m in April 1991, the closing of Stoneguard in 1991 and the acquisition of Frank Ford, the aircraft components business for Pounds 1.1m in January. The company said that on a comparable basis turnover fell 10 per cent from 1991 levels. Aerospace, the largest part of the group, saw sales fall 26 per cent due to difficulties from re-scheduling orders, while sales of technical products fell 17 per cent, leavened only by the Belgian valve business. Packaging was the bright spot with a 9 per cent increase, though demand was flat.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beirut, 24 Feb (AFP)--The head of the Iranian-backed  Hizballah has accused factions within the government of stirring  up trouble between his organisation and the Lebanese army as  part of moves to halt anti-Israeli attacks.    Shaykh Hasan Nasrallah charged late Wednesday that factions  which he declined to name were "executing a pledge made by the  Lebanese government to U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher."    Earlier this month, Christopher urged Lebanon and Syria to  calm down the situation in south Lebanon after a Katyusha rocket  attack on northern Israel, which was later claimed by  Palestinian hardliners.    Hizballah guerrillas on 7 February killed four Israeli  soldiers and wounded five in the bloodiest attack since August.  Christopher said the violence could undermine Arab-Israeli  peace talks, while Israel warned of a massive operation in south  Lebanon following the rocketing and blamed Syria, which has  35,000 troops in Lebanon.    "Resistance operations will continue (because) Hizballah's  strategy is not part of any political consideration," Nasrallah  said on al-Manar television, a channel owned by Hizballah.    Hizballah spearheads anti-Israeli attacks by Lebanese and  Palestinian factions in south Lebanon, where Israel occupies a  border strip. It opposes the peace talks and rejects any  normalization of ties with the Jewish state.    The Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim fundamentalist group "is  ready to confront the situation" if Syria and Lebanon sign a  peace accord with Israel, Nasrallah said. "We are not only a  military movement. We have popular roots everywhere. No one  will be able to uproot us, no matter what happens," the  Hizballah chief added. Nasrallah also stressed that Hizballah,  which has eight MP's, was "trying to topple the government  through peaceful means."    Its opposition dates back to September when soldiers opened  fire on an illegal protest against the Israeli-PLO autonomy  accord, killing nine Hizballah supporters.    The United States has repeatedly called on Lebanon to disarm  Hizballah, the only militia allowed to keep its weapons since  the end of the country's 15-year war in 1990.</p>

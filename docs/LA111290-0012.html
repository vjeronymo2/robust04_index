			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURBS ON SPEECH  </P> <P> I am writing in response to "Banning Racist Speech Begs the Real Question of  Curbing Racism" (Opinion, Oct. 14). After living in the United States for the  past 13 years, I am still considered a minority, because 17 years ago I was  born in Iran.  </P> <P> Because of the country's hatred toward Iran and Iranians, my country has been  the target for racism for many years. I know how much a racist remark can hurt.  </P> <P> The dream of freedom and the idea of democracy bring immigrants to America.  Freedom of speech under the First Amendment is considered to be a luxury by  many immigrants. Now, university campuses are taking away this freedom because  of the content of what certain groups of people are saying. There is no clause  in the First Amendment banning a specific form of speech. I do not think bans  on racist speech will prevent racism. A bigot will not stop being a bigot  because you stop him from publicly speaking against a certain ethnic group.  </P> <P> An alternate solution could be stronger minority support groups, not a ban on  our freedoms.  </P> <P> BEATRICE MAKABEH, Encino  </P></p>

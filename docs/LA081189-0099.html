			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Five people accused of working to develop anti-helicopter missiles for the  Irish Republican Army were indicted in Boston on federal charges of conspiring  to violate regulations on arms exports. Investigators say the five, including a  computer scientist, were working for the Provisional IRA, the guerrilla wing of  the nationalist group fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland.  Following the arrests of three of the defendants in July, the FBI seized radar  and missile parts "in various stages of development or manufacture" during  raids in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, according to FBI agent  James F. Ahearn.  </P></p>

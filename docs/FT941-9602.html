			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Observer: Et tu, Hewson? Long faces from Australia's political hacks. Prime minister Paul Keating says his appearances in the daily parliamentary question time are to be pared back to Mondays and Thursdays. A duty roster of ministers will function on other days. It's rather like having Hamlet without the prince. Few politicians pack a verbal punch so well as Keating, and some of his pithier taunts against the opposition - 'scumbags' and 'perfumed gigolos' are a couple of recent examples - make great copy. But apparently Keating craves a more statesman-like image. 'No man in our history has done more to downgrade, abuse, sabotage, undermine, subvert and threaten the processes and procedures of this parliament,' declared John Hewson, the opposition leader, of Keating in the wake of his decision to seek gravitas. With enemies like that who needs gravitas?</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Omission Sir, I have just seen Alan Clark's hilariously splenetic piece about my Frustrate Their Knavish Tricks (Books, August 27/28), in which I am presented as a kind of ageing and illiterate Dave Spart, whose extreme leftwing views belong in the 1970s. The only puzzling thing is that the many quotes-out-of-context in Lord Clark's article do not include my sole reference to him. On the very first page of the book I describe the Tory ex-minister as a former MP 'of indisputably blimpish proportions' who has 'written a book review backing a suggestion that Winston Churchill ruined the country'. But then again, he was probably right. If he had mentioned it, some unsporting socialist bounder might have accused him of tit-for-tat reviewing. Ben Pimlott, 9 Milner Place, London N1 1TN</p>

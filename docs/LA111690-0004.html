			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARGARET THATCHER  </P> <P> I found British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's "stern remarks" on the need  for firm military action in the Persian Gulf very interesting.  </P> <P> Her opening address to Parliament, reported on the day after our national  elections, contrasts sharply with the political process in the U.S. in  relationship to this potential conflict.  </P> <P> Two things seem particularly relevant. First, the lives that will be lost in  the battles she urges will not be English lives but the lives of young  Americans. Secondly, how unfortunate that our own national elections should  have been conducted without any single campaign addressing the issues of the  Persian Gulf crisis and the respective roles of Congress and the presidency.  </P> <P> THEODORE A.

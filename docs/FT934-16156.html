			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Brewery stocks on alert NEWS OF the share restructuring at Whitbread, which will enable it to raise cash by means of equity rights, prompted speculation over the drinks group's strategy, and in particular over whether it is about to hit the acquisition trail. Speculation was heightened by the list of investments held by the Whitbread Investment Company (WIC), swallowed up by Whitbread as part of the restructuring move. The deal takes Whitbread's holding in Boddington and Marston to 21 per cent each, six per cent above the ceiling demanded by the government's Beer Orders. Favourite among drinks analysts to receive attention from Whitbread is Marston, which has strong beer brands and a profitable managed estate. Regional brewers aside, WIC's investments in FT-SE stocks total around Pounds 50m, and analysts expect many of these to be off-loaded in the coming months. The drinks sector in particular, where WIC is heavily invested, is likely to see increased trading activity. There was speculation that Greene King might be a candidate to buy WIC's 14.9 per cent stake in Morland, the company which it failed to land last year and in which it still holds a 29.3 per cent stake. Among retail outlets being hinted at as potential targets was Pizza Express. However, yesterday's share price movements suggested that the market was more concerned about stock overhangs than bid premiums. Boddington's had a weak session, although rallied to close steady at 260p. Marston slid 7 to 266p, Vaux a penny to 247p and Morland 8 to 525p. Elsewhere, Greene King steadied at 557p, as did Pizza Express at 107p. Whitbread 'A' shares stayed at 534p and the 'B' shares fell 188 to 1200p. Mr Kevin Feeny at Henderson Crosthwaite said: 'I believe the deal is a good one because it is non-dilutive and gives Whitbread access to ready cash in the form of investments.' He added that the accompanying upbeat statement augured well for current trading.</p>

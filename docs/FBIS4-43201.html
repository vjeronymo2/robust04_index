			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] The Constitutional Court has ruled to stop the  implementation of the law allowing the government to issue  law-decrees to make changes in the state organization and  personnel regulations.    The Motherland Party applied to the Constitutional Court  asking it to stop the implementation of the law until the case  for its cancellation is concluded. The Constitutional Court  discussed the application today and with a majority of votes,  ruled to stop the implementation of the law to prevent  situations and losses that might be impossible or difficult to  recover.</p>

Makarov and Lt Col Ye. Velichko] </F>   [Text] An article published earlier in our  journal[.sup]1[/] examined the state and prospects of  development of China's Air Force, the composition of which  includes national air defense units and subunits. Below we use  foreign press data to shed light on questions concerning the  organization, force composition, training, and employment of air  defense forces and assets.    The basis of the national air defense system is Air Force  forces and assets and also air defense formations of the Ground  Forces, Navy, and the so-called "people's air defense,"  performing civil defense functions. In the opinion of  representatives of the PRC Ministry of Defense, creation of a  unified air defense concept for the long-term future should be  determined by its increased role as a component of the "national  deterrence forces," which will require deployment of warning  forces (primarily space- and air-based) as part of air defense  and centralization of command and control of air defense forces  and assets of the armed forces and "people's air defense" based  on creation of integrated command bodies.    All of China's territory is divided into seven large  military  districts in which air defense forces and assets are stationed.  The commander of the district air forces is responsible for  organizing air defense within each district, and his deputy is  charged with direct supervision.    Command and control of forces and assets is accomplished  from  the main air defense command post (Beijing) and also from the  air defense command posts of the military districts, aviation  formations and large units, and units of surface-to-air missile  [SAM] troops and antiaircraft artillery.    Fighter aviation is an active air defense asset  and numbers up to 4,000 aircraft: 400 J-5 (Xian-5 in national  terminology), 3,000 J-6 (Xian-6), 500 J-7 (Xian-7), and about  100 J-8 (Xian-8) aircraft. Of these, the J-5, J-6, and J-7 are  obsolete fighters made based on the Soviet MiG-17, MiG-19, and  MiG-21 aircraft, respectively.    The main efforts in the development of fighter aviation are  concentrated on optimizing its quantitative composition and  speeding up modernization of the aircraft fleet. Chinese  military experts believe that the structure of the Air Force  should develop in the direction of a more proportional  representation of such branches of aviation as fighter-bomber,  reconnaissance, and auxiliary aviation, which in conditions of  reducing the armed forces can be accomplished with a consistent  decrease in fighter aviation's percentage.    It is planned to decrease the number of fighters by quickly  removing from service obsolete equipment and gradually refitting  with new types of aircraft. The J-7 and J-8 aircraft (Figure 1  [not reproduced]) will remain the country's main air defense  fighters until the year 2000. Their service will be extended by  upgrading them (the latest modifications are the J-7-3 and  J-8-2).    The J-7-3 air defense fighter, unlike the J-7 base model, is  equipped with a more powerful WK-13 engine with 6,500 kgf of  thrust in the afterburner mode. It is equipped with additional  fuel tanks, a JL-7 radar, and a radar warning system. It has a  23-mm under-fuselage cannon, two additional weapon hardpoints,  and improved fire control instruments.    The J-8-2 aircraft has been made since the mid-1980's and is  a multipurpose fighter ensuring the intercept of air targets at  high altitudes and destruction of ground targets. It is equipped  with a nose fairing and auxiliary inlets, two WK-13A turbojet  engines with 6,700 kgf of thrust each on afterburner, and seven  hardpoints for missiles and other weapons. It is planned to  upgrade the aircraft with participation of American firms, which  are to equip 55 aircraft with modern electronics.    Specifications and performance characteristics of China's  modern fighters are shown below.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |J-7-3                    |J-8-2                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Wingspan, meters         |7.154                    |9.344                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Length, meters           |14.885                   |21.59                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Height, meters           |4.103                    |5.41                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Wing area, square meters |23.00                    |41.20                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Takeoff weight, kg:      |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |of empty aircraft        |5,275                    |9,820                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |normal                   |7,531                    |14,300                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Speed (Mach)             |2.05                     |2.2                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Service ceiling, meters  |18,200                   |20,000                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Flight range (with exter-|700-950                  |700                      |  |nal fuel tanks), km      |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Length of landing roll,  |600-900                  |1000                     |  |meters                   |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      A shortage of financial resources in the country does not  make it possible to conduct an accelerated aircraft  modernization; therefore, re-equipping the Air Force with J-7-3  and J-8-2 fighters is being accomplished at a slow pace. In  addition, the Chinese leadership possibly does not want to  continue series production of fighter aircraft lagging 1-2  generations behind those of western countries, especially since  they have begun purchasing modern aircraft abroad (in  particular, Russian Su-27 fighters).    Surface-to-Air Missile Forces and Antiaircraft  Artillery. About 100 battalions of Hunqi-2 medium-range  SAM's (600 launchers) with a maximum height of 28 km are  deployed on China's territory.    Development of the surface-to-air missile forces and  antiaircraft artillery is proceeding along the path of refitting  and re-equipping them with new types of SAM's and antiaircraft  artillery and improving the tactics of their employment and  training facilities. In connection with this, the decision has  been made to accelerate the pace of developing the  surface-to-air missile forces and antiaircraft artillery,  especially in connection with the planned reduction of fighter  aviation and the need to redistribute missions between fighter  aviation and ground air defense components.    Since the first half of the 1980's, China has been actively  developing several new types of SAM's. The basis of their  creation is the requirement to increase mobility, the number of  channels, and protection against jamming, and also to reduce the  time of the firing cycle. As a result, a number of experimental  models of SAM systems of various types have been created.  Individual ones have been put into service.    The basis of China's surface-to-air missile defense is the  HQ-2 (Hunqi-2) medium-range SAM, developed on the base of the  Soviet-made SA-75 SAM. It has been produced since the  mid-1960's. Foreign experts estimate that the air defense force  composition today includes as many as 600 launchers for the  modernized HQ-2A/2J (Hunqi-2A/2J) SAM. In the late 1980's, the  mobile HQ-2B (Hunqi-2B) SAM system was created on its base. It  has a modernized missile which uses a new type of radar  proximity fuze (the point of initiation of the warhead  detonation is adjusted depending on the missile's position  relative to the target). It uses an improved warhead that  creates a large number of flechettes upon detonation and has a  rocket motor with increased thrust. The acquisition and control  radar is equipped with an optical and television target-tracking  system. The KS-1 mobile medium-range SAM system is currently  going through field testing.    Definite progress was achieved in developing a short-range  SAM system. Thus, by the early 1990's China had introduced  models of four new systems: HQ-61 (Hunqi-61), FM-80, PL-9, and  HN-5C. It is planned to use them to reinforce protection of  individual small installations and to build up air defenses of  major administrative-political and military-industrial centers  and also in the interests of battlefield air defenses. Active  formation of battlefield air defense and assigning it from the  composition of field artillery to an independent arm of the  Ground Forces will be accomplished in the next decade.    Development of the HQ-61 SAM system was conduced in China  from the early 1980's, and today has been completed. The system  includes a launcher with two single-stage solid-propellant  SAM's, a Type 571 target acquisition radar (similar to the  Soviet P-15), a missile guidance radar, a control element, and  supporting ground equipment.    The FM-80 SAM system is based on the French Crotale system.  Today, the Chinese press has reported the formation of the first  battalion equipped with this type of SAM system. The system may  be produced both in the mobile and fixed version.    The PL-9 SAM launcher is mounted on an armored personnel  carrier base and resembles the American Chaparral system in  appearance (Figure 2 [not reproduced]). It uses a SAM similar to  PL-9 air-to-air missile made based on the American AIM-9L  Sidewinder.    Development of the HN-5C SAM system began in the early  1980's. It was first presented in 1986. In the original variant,  the launcher was mounted on a light truck chassis. During the  course of subsequent modification it is planned to put the  launcher on the base of a wheeled armored personnel carrier. The  SAM system includes eight missiles in canisters and eight  reserve missiles. The system is service by two people. It uses  the missile from the HN-5A portable SAM system with an infrared  homing head. It is planned to upgrade it and equip it with a new  homing head to support firing at air targets from the forward  hemisphere.    The specifications and performance characteristics of  Chinese-made SAM systems are shown in Table 1.    Table 1.

Antiaircraft artillery from SAM and artillery brigades and  separate antiaircraft artillery regiments is used to combat the  air enemy at low altitudes and in the immediate proximity of  installations being covered. Its inventory includes more than  16,000 100-, 85-, 57-, 37-, and 23-mm antiaircraft pieces.    Development of antiaircraft artillery is proceeding along  the  path of creating antiaircraft artillery and missile-artillery  systems. An artillery system usually includes 35- and 37-mm  guns, a command and control facility, and a Type 702 fire  control radar, which can be used with the improved antiaircraft  fire control instrument. In addition, a missile-artillery system  includes a launcher with four PL-9 missiles.    Radar Monitoring of the Airspace. A military  district is divided into sectors, each of which has 8-12 radar  posts. A total of more than 550 radars, more than 60 percent of  which perform air defense missions, and the rest perform air  traffic control missions. Air defense radar posts are located  mainly along the state border and seacoast, providing a 60-80  percent overlap of the zones of responsibility of adjacent  posts. The posts have the most modern radars, which create a  solid radar field at altitudes of over 2,000 meters. In the  opinion of western military experts, a solid radar field does  not exist at altitudes below 2,000 meters.    Improvement of monitoring equipment in the near future is  tied to the next generation of radars entering service, which  possess better jamming protection and can be linked to automated  control systems. Development of phased-array, over-the-horizon,  and multi-position radars is regarded as the promising priority  directions. In examining foreign experience in improving radar  monitoring systems, Chinese specialists believe it is necessary  to create a single radar field by combining the efforts of the  different armed services and civilian agencies. This will make  it possible to substantially reduce the number of Air Force  radar posts and economize on forces and assets.    Today, the troops are beginning to receive new types of  radars: 408C and HN-503 (first-line radar posts are equipped  with them); multifunctional three-coordinate JY-8 (Figure 3 [not  reproduced]), JY-14, 146-1A (they are part of command and  control and warning centers); JY-8A and JY-9 low-altitude target  acquisition radars; and REL air traffic control radars.    Specifications and performance characteristics of  Chinese-made radars are shown in Table 2.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2.

It is being accomplished during the course  of a dual process of shifting to new types and means of  communications. The main one among them will be space-based  communications and equipping command and control bodies and  elements with computer equipment and combining them into  automated complexes and systems.    An example of such a system is the TADS-2 (Tactical Air  Defense System), on the basis of which an air defense sector or  zone command post can be deployed. It includes five  container-type cabins (two control cabins, each equipped with  six to eight control panels, and three technical support and  communications cabins) and also an electric power generating  unit. The system makes it possible to distribute information on  120 air targets with a discreteness of 10 seconds,  simultaneously track up to eight targets in the automatic mode,  and accomplish up to eight guidance vectorings.    The main directions of the military-technical policy in the  area of improving air defense are being implemented  simultaneously with working out the fundamentals of combat  employment of air defense forces and assets. Chinese military  experts believe that development of a basic form of using air  defense forces and assets, which is what an air defense  operation is, must take place within the framework of forming a  system of views on combat employment of the armed forces. This  will make it possible to coordinate efforts in developing  weapons systems and military equipment and determining the  overall need for them, state more precisely the composition of  the force dispositions in a theater of military operations, and  also optimize their defensive and offensive capabilities. At the  same time, it is recognized that the existing level of the air  defense system, the weak capabilities of automating the command  and control processes, and the incomplete development of  theories of operational art of the armed forces make the task of  organizing and conducting an air defense operation in existing  conditions difficult. In this connection, it is considered  advisable to concentrate efforts on the study and practical  working out of questions of employment of air defense forces and  assets during combined-arms operations and also when repelling  enemy air strikes.    Considerable attention in the future must be given to  working  out questions of organizing and conducting air battles and  engagements, which is dictated by the place and role of fighter  aviation in the country's overall air defense system. Chinese  military experts emphasize that air defense capabilities can be  increased by stepping up scientific research and experimental  design work, expanding production of modern operational systems  and arms, increasing the level of automation, improving engineer  and logistic support, camouflage, concealment, and deception,  and also by stepping up reconnaissance and electronic warfare.    On the whole, close attention is being given to the  development of air defense forces and assets in China, which is  associated with the proclamation of the defensive military  doctrine as the basis for organizational development of the  armed forces. The increase in the importance of air defense is  determined by its future role as one of the important components  of national "deterrence forces." It is planned to further  improve China's air defense within the framework of a  coordinated military-technical policy, in which the development  and deployment of new weapons systems and military equipment are  closely linked to studying the operational-strategic forms of  their employment and other aspects of organizational development  of the armed forces.

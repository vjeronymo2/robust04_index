			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / RBS to keep Charterhouse stake ROYAL Bank of Scotland is likely to retain a minority stake in Charterhouse, the City of London merchant bank which it is in the process of selling. Negotiations on selling Charterhouse to a consortium of European banks are at an advanced stage, though no formal announcement is likely for five or six weeks. The leading members of the consortium are BHF, the German commercial bank, and Credit Commercial de France, the French banking group. Apart from the stake to be retained by RBS, other shares in Charterhouse are likely to be placed with investment institutions if the deal goes through. Charterhouse would gain access to the bank consortium's customers throughout the continent and the UK. However bankers warned yesterday that completion of the deal was by no means certain. RBS, which is being advised by SG Warburg, the merchant bank, is adamant that it will not sell Charterhouse unless the 'price is right', according to a banker. It wants a premium to Charterhouse's net assets, which were Pounds 176.8m in September 1991. If agreement on a sale is not reached by the end of the year, RBS will cease attempts to sell Charterhouse, according to a senior banker. RBS would then follow National Westminster Bank's example by combining its merchant bank and commercial banking operations - reversing a policy of keeping the merchant bank autonomous. Charterhouse's executives, led by Mr Victor Blank, chairman, would however fight to retain independence. They point out that their autonomy has allowed them to be consistently profitable. RBS already has close links with both BHF and CCF. BHF and RBS are members of Inter-Alpha, an association of European banks which serves as a forum for the discussion of mutual problems. CCF is a member of RBS's electronic banking network, Ibos. Ibos allows its members to link their branches electronically, giving their customers access to a European-wide network. The CCF connection to Ibos goes live next month. RBS's board decided to sell Charterhouse nine months ago, after pressure from Mr Blank.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> MARTINEZ'S 'LOVE IN THE LIGHT'  </P> <P> Regarding the column by Al Martinez and his greater understanding of men who  love men, Bravo!  </P> <P> I have been a loyal fan since his column first appeared in your paper.  </P> <P> He has reached new heights of compassion with this insightful piece. May his  blessings be many.  </P> <P> As a gay man who is HIV, I am grateful to have escaped this scourge. I have  seen too many friends and associates die slowly and painfully, both physically  and emotionally from AIDS.  </P> <P> As a volunteer at Project Angel Food where we are feeding upwards of 80  desperately ill men and women each day who have been inflicted by this dread  disease, it continues to be an ongoing struggle.  </P> <P> I thank God for Mr. Martinez and his enlightenment.  </P> <P> DAVID GRAHAM  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

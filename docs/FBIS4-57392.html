			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Herold Jean-Francois] </F>   [Text] Port-au-Prince, 17 May (EFE) -- Senator Bernard  Sansaricq, the primary promoter of the installation of Judge  Emile Jonassaint as chief of the Haitian state, today publicly  voiced his disagreement with the way in which the new government  was established.    The first differences between the soldiers and the civilians  who promoted a coup d'etat that toppled constitutional President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide on 30 September 1991 are emerging six  days after the octogenarian Jonassaint was installed. He also  matter of factly assumed the post of prime minister on 16 May  when he established a new government with the military's support.    Jonassaint, in a decision enacted by decree, assumed full  control of the Executive Branch on Monday and announced that he  would assume the posts of provisional president and prime  minister. After the de facto ruler made his announcement,  Acting Prime Minister Robert Malval urged government officials  and the general public to "ignore all instructions given and  decisions made" by the Jonassaint Government.    Meanwhile, Sansaricq expressed his reservations about  certain  ministers appointed by the new government and presented a copy  of correspondence he exchanged with Jonassaint on 13 May in  which Sansaricq asked Jonassaint to send to the Senate  leadership, which he heads, the name of the person who would  occupy the post of prime minister. Jonassaint, 81, replied that  after consulting Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert  Monde, the latter convinced him to not appoint a prime minister  because of the "special nature" of his government.    Hubert Deronceray, leader of the group Mobilization for  National Development, the main promoter of the implementation of  Article 149 of the Haitian Constitution, which was the basis for  the appointment of Jonassaint to the post, accused the "de  facto" president of violating that constitutional statute.  Deronceray, who had supported the appointment of the ruler  imposed by the military men of General Raoul Cedras, the leader  of the coup against Aristide, said that his party was surprised  to confirm [comprobar] that Jonassaint violated the Haitian  Constitution.    The right-wing leader, who had hoped he would be appointed  head of government, accused Jonassaint of eliminating the post  of prime minister "and of establishing a government without  consulting the parties." Deronceray described the way in which  that article was applied as "a shadow of Article 149" and  stressed he will monitor future developments.    Meanwhile, the de facto ministers appointed by Jonassaint  were installed on 16 May.    Robert Malval, the prime minister appointed by Aristide,  called for fiscal disobedience. Malval, in reaffirming his  rejection of the Jonassaint government, described as void "all  decrees, administrative acts, property concessions, and  creations of associations." [sentence as received] He advised  state traders that if they supply services to the de facto  government, such financial obligations will not be honored.  Malval also said that he will not recognize promotions of  public administration personnel.</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Call for private railway contractors A CALL for private-sector engineering contractors to work on the railways even before privatisation was made by Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, yesterday. Under privatisation proposals, control of the track and other British Rail infrastructure would become the responsibility of a new body, Railtrack, from April 1994. But Mr Freeman told the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors: 'We now see significant further opportunities for private-sector contractors to carry out work on the track and infrastructure of the railway.' He said BR was spending more than Pounds 500m a year on track and infrastructure maintenance, renewal and other civil engineering works. Mr Freeman went on: 'This is a significant market and I am certain that a large proportion of this work can be carried out just as efficiently, if not more so, by the private sector.' The minister outlined two broad options. The first was to 'test the market' - private-sector contractors would be invited to bid in competition with providers within BR. The second option was to move straight to an outright privatisation of BR's internal providers. The government's railway privatisation plans represent 'as significant a turning point as the nationalisation of the railways in 1948', Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, told MPs yesterday, promising a series of consultation documents over coming months to flesh out its proposals.</p>

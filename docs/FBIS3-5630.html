			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- The economy remains mixed  despite some new bright signs this year and it is still too  early to predict recovery, Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno  said Wednesday [9 March].    Mieno told a regular news conference that he wants to  continue "carefully watching" conditions before judging whether  signs of improvement can be sustained.    It is too early to say whether such promising signs as  partial improvement in consumption will prevail over such  worrying indications as a gradually worsening job situation, he  said.    Mieno said, for example, that fiscal year-end factors  apparently played a part in January's modest rebound in  industrial production.    "We'll have to watch a bit longer to judge sustainability  and  growth potential," he said.    He said economic conditions differ from those of last  spring,  when the economy seemed to bottom out, only to slide further.    Last year, there were more negative factors in the economic  mix, Mieno said, adding that the economy was dragged down by the  yen's sharp rise, bad summer weather and political confusion.    The yen has recently been in "a state of remission" on the  foreign exchange market, he said.    Asked about recent rises in long-term market and lending  rates, he said they will not likely have an immediate effect on  the economy. Higher rates are "obviously" a minus for recovery,  he acknowledged, but noted they were just one factor.    Mieno said capital spending by smaller companies, which  usually leads an economic recovery, will continue to slump. But  he said their weak investment will not likely lead to further  setbacks.    Mieno said the central bank will consider economic  conditions  in taking "appropriate" policy steps, but he played down the  idea that falling short-term rates signal an imminent cut in the  official discount rate.    Although market players consider it critical that there be a  half-percentage point spread between the benchmark overnight  lending rate and the discount rate, Mieno said the spread is not  a decisive factor.    He said, however, it would be hard to imagine the overnight  call-money rate falling below the discount rate for a prolonged  period.    With the central bank taking a loose stance in funding the  money market, the overnight unsecured call rate has recently  moved around 2.1 percent, less than a half point above the 1.75  percent discount rate.    Mieno repeated that for recovery to begin, it is not  necessary for companies to have finished adjusting their balance  sheets, hit by shrunken asset values after the bursting of the  speculative "bubble" in the late 1980s.    But, citing the U.S. recovery, he said that if a turnaround  begins while balance sheet adjustments are continuing, it would  be a very "slow tempo" recovery.    Asked about rising public service rates, Mieno said they  would not likely harm the economy, noting that overall prices  remain very stable.    On trade matters, Mieno said cutting Japan's chronically  huge  current account surplus would contribute to stable growth  globally.    He called for "leadership" from Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa in implementing "bold" deregulation, which he said  would directly reduce the imbalance by facilitating imports and  would increase the chances for investment in Japan.    He also urged domestic companies to "actively" develop new  business.    Mieno said fiscal steps taken thus far will help promote  domestic demand-led growth, a key component in curbing Japan's  surpluses, but he also urged further efforts from Japan's  trading partners.</p>

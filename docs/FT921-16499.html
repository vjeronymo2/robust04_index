			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Arts: Peter Pan - Everyman, Cheltenham This is the musical one, with book and songs by Piers Chater-Robinson, more familiar at schools than at theatres. It holds to Barrie's story without any major alteration, inserting songs where appropriate. 'We are the Darlings,' sing the Darling children. Peter and Wendy sing about growing up, and later about flying; and, ensconced in the Never-never-land, Wendy sings of her wish for a pretty house, provided at once, though she never lives in it. Need I say that Peter leads a song aimed at the audience, 'Yes, we believe, Oh, we believe in fairies.' There was a half-hearted, mainly adult, response. Not that the children at the matinee were less than enthusiastic; their chat sometimes drowned the dialogue. Peter is played by Lorraine Brunning, looking very much boy size and shape and using good boyish movements. The old tradition that she should also be glamorous is dispensed with, none the worse for that. Wendy (Caroline Mander) is more a little mother than a little girl, but this is due to Barrie. Her brothers are as neutral as usual, though if John (Peter Thain) wants to join the Coldstream he mustn't wear glasses. The Lost Boys are given much more fun, though they might have put more zing into their pirate-fighting. Dave King is a gentlemanly, not a terrifying Hook, but he has a villainous farewell song to Peter. I hoped I should see him walk the plank, but he is swallowed on his own quarterdeck by the ticking Crocodile. Nettie Edwards's useful sets merge very well when required, but the lighting (Nick Hunt) was for me too autumnal throughout. Choreographer Bill Deamer has given the only big routine to the Redskins, of all people, who also play the pirates. Director Sheila Mander is very good with young people; I only have one quarrel, that she should allow Peter (of all people]) to demand 'Shall I hit him on the bum?' when he has a pirate bent over before him. The production runs until 18 January.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Size of Bundesbank rate cut surprises dealers THE Bundesbank again surprised dealers in financial markets yesterday by cutting the cost of lending funds to commercial banks by a larger amount than had been ex-pected. The German central bank cut its repo rate, which sets the cost of lending short-term funds, by 11 basis points to 7.60 per cent for periods of 14 days and 28 days. The move was immediately followed by cuts in official interest rates in both the Netherlands and Belgium, both of whose central banks cut their three key interest rates by 25 basis points. There was some speculation that France will again ease its intervention rate when the Bank of France operates in the money markets today. Yesterday's Bundesbank move led to new suggestions that the central bank's council will reduce its discount rate again when it meets on May 19. One London-based analyst said there was now a possibility that the discount rate, which sets the floor for all German rates, will come down  1/4 of a percentage point to 7.00 per cent. The repo rate cut also helped to ease pressures on the Danish krone in the run-up to next week's referendum on the Maastricht treaty. The krone was last night trading in London at about DKr3.8509 to the D-Mark, having been at DKr3.8580 the night before. French banks yesterday cut their base rates from 9.25 per cent to 9 per cent in response to last week's reductions in the Bank of France's key interest rates, continuing the downward trend in French rates, Alice Rawsthorn adds from Paris. The fall in base rates, the fourth since France's new centre-right government took power in late March, coincided with a report by the Paris chamber of commerce that retail sales increased 'significantly' in April. The retail sector has for the past year been very sluggish, partly because of the impact of high interest rates. Yesterday's report, which included provisional estimates rather than firm figures, suggested that retail sales had risen by 2.1 per cent in April compared with the same month in 1992, with department stores registering a 6.5 per cent increase.</p>

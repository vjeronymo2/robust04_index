			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 10 June (MTI) -- "The Hungarist Movement  (HM) is concerned about the arrest of more and more of its  members for political reasons. Some have disappeared without a  trace, and there is no information as to their whereabouts,"  Gyorgy Kemal Ekrem, the only co-chairman of the organization not  currently detained, told a news conference at his flat on Friday  [10 June]. The two other HM leaders, Istvan Gyorkos and Albert  Szabo, were taken into police custody on April 28 on the  suspicion of having committed a crime of incitement against a  community.    The HM was founded in Budapest on April 12, 1994. At a news  conference in late April, Ekrem, Gyorkos and Szabo said they  identified partly with the ideas of Ferenc Szalasi's Arrow-Cross  Party. (Szalasi -- 1897-1946 -- led the Hungarian Arrow-Cross  Party-Hungarist Movement. Hitler helped him to power on October  15, 1944, and he introduced a reign of fascist terror in the  country. The Hungarian people's court sentenced him to death as  a war-criminal in 1946.)    At today's press conference, Ekrem said one of their members  was arrested by the police at the demonstration against  Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula Horn for carrying a  poster saying "Never Again the Jewish Terror of Rakosi and  Gero." (Matyas Rakosi was general secretary of the Communist  Party after the war until 1956, and Erno Gero was the second  strong man. Gero headed the party at the outbreak of the 1956  revolution.)    Ekrem said that another Hungarist went on hunger strike  outside parliament for the release of Gyorkos and his  associates, and is also believed to have been arrested, because  he disappeared with the deck-chair and blanket he received from  Ekrem. According to Ekrem, Gyorkos and Szabo were arrested at  the personal instructions of Prime Minister Peter Boross. Ekrem  said the HM was gaining in strength despite harassment by the  authorities: Hungarian emigration entrusted it with the task of  bringing national forces into one camp.    The movement mainly seeks the support of young people,  primarily approaching the "uninfected 17-18-year-olds." Ekrem  said one of their recent meetings was attended by university  students who have quit the Federation of Young Democrats. He  added that they conceive the movement as a nation-building,  cultural, and tradition-fostering organization, and that he  personally rejects racism. In this point, his views differ  somewhat from those of the arrested HM leaders, he admitted.    The prime minister has no involvement in the legal  proceedings against Albert Szabo and Istvan Gyorkos, government  spokeswoman Judit Juhasz told MTI in connection with Ekrem's  remarks. National Police Command spokesman Laszlo Garamvolgyi  termed Ekrem's words as "wandering." There is no case of, nor  has there ever been any precedent of somebody being held in  custody without any information as to their whereabouts, he  added.</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Pilkington buys Finnish minority Pilkington is buying out minority shareholders in its Finnish float glass subsidiary, enabling it to complete the integration of its European float glass production lines. The UK glass group is paying FM69.6m (Pounds 9m) in shares for the remaining 29 per cent of Lahden Lasitehdas. The stake is currently owned by Finnish institutions. Pilkington took a 50 per cent stake in Lahden Lasitehdas in 1978, which it increased to 71 per cent in 1988 when the Finnish government sold a 33 per cent holding for Pounds 6m. Pilkington is streamlining production between its nine European float plants in the UK, Germany, Sweden and Finland. All the others are wholly owned.</p>

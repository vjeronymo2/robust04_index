			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics (Budget '92): Lamont's first eight hide from the spotlight - Peter Marsh on growing pressure for a shadowy team of monetary experts to be more forthcoming EIGHT of the sharpest minds in the Civil Service are advising Mr Norman Lamont on the tricky and also politically charged question of whether to cut interest rates on or near Budget day. As the chancellor comes under pressure to stimulate the economy ahead of the election, he will be drawing heavily on the collective thoughts of the eight - a joint committee of Treasury and Bank of England officials assessing monetary policy. It is also charged with considering how the tax cuts Mr Lamont may announce in the Budget on March 10 would fit in with any relaxation in borrowing rates. The committee's meetings are unpublicised, and it has no formal name. The details of the officials' advice to Mr Lamont remain secret, though some private-sector economists believe that opening up the committee's deliberations could help the financial markets judge UK economic policy, strengthening the government's credibility. The members of the committee meet monthly at the Treasury and confer less formally whenever the need arises, sometimes over a secure telephone link between the Treasury and the Bank. For much of the past two months, they will almost certainly have been urging caution over interest rates, which have been held at 10.5 per cent since early September. They will have argued that, with sterling trading well below its DM2.95 central rate in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, a loosening in policy would risk the pound dropping below its lower ERM limit. The pound has steadied in the past 10 days, providing possible justification for a rate cut which many argue is needed to hasten recovery from the 18-month recession. The monthly meetings of the eight take place in the office of Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary at the Treasury, who takes the chair. There are three other Treasury officials - Professor Alan Budd, the government's chief economic adviser, and Mr Michael Scholar and Mr Paul Gray, who work on monetary policy. The four from the Bank are Mr Tony Coleby, executive director in charge of home finance; Mr Ian Plenderleith, the Bank's markets supremo; Professor Mervyn King, economics director; and Mr John Townend, who has responsibility for UK government bonds (gilts) and money markets. Other colleagues, such as Mr Andrew Crockett, the Bank's international director, and more junior civil servants sometimes attend. The official view is that the topics discussed at the meetings must be confidential. This means that the menu of options presented to the chancellor can be kept as broad as possible, without the risk of sensitive information leaking. Few in Whitehall like to talk about the gatherings; one senior Treasury man says he has never heard of the committee. Yet it can be assumed that their current mood is far from cheery. Treasury officials in particular are smarting from their well-publicised failure to foresee the length or depth of the recession. At the meetings, both the Treasury and the Bank present their assessments of the economy. After discussion, recommendations for monetary and fiscal policy are presented at a later stage to Mr Lamont. One person with close knowledge of the issues says both sides have been in general agreement about the progress of the economy over the past 18 months. But underlying tensions can surface. An economist who follows the meetings says: 'The Bank and the Treasury feel they are in a power struggle, with each side trying to prove itself at the expense of the other.' Some outside economists think the Treasury and Bank could benefit by releasing a precis of what is discussed at the meetings. Mr Simon Briscoe, an economist at Greenwell Montagu, the London stockbroker, believes detailed statements would iron out ambiguities in messages about policy which leak out via other channels. Mr Giles Keating, director of economics at Credit Suisse First Boston, a Swiss-owned bank, says: 'It would be a more healthy and open way of doing things, which could increase confidence.' However, those close to the meetings oppose that view. One says: 'If the committee publicised its assessment, it would mean the markets took more notice of the official view of the economy than was justified. Don't forget that both the Treasury and the Bank can - and often do - get things completely wrong.' A monetary official says there is little hope of releasing more details without a general move towards more openness by the government. 'You could envisage a system where the gist of what civil servants at the Treasury and the Bank think about the economy is made public,' he says. 'But what if the chancellor disagreed? He wouldn't like it, and the committee would end up looking silly.'</p>

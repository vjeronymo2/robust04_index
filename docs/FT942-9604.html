			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil falls 3% on fears for exports Concerns over the government's plans to manage foreign exchange policy after the introduction of a new currency on July 1 dragged Sao Paulo stock prices down 3.1 per cent at the close in light trade. The Bovespa index of the 56 most-active shares ended off 519 at 15,859 points. Analysts were worried about the performance of Brazilian export firms after it was reported that the government might freeze the real/dollar exchange rate at a one-to-one parity after the adoption of the new currency. Investors are waiting for congress to vote on a presidential decree creating the country's single price index. It was reported that the vote has been postponed until next Tuesday.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US agency under attack for cut-price metal sales Complaints that the US Defence Department is dragging down already-depressed metals prices by sales from its strategic stockpile are growing. Sales of zinc by the Defence Logistics Agency, the Pentagon unit overseeing these disposals, are being criticised by Australia, Canada and Spain as well as the US's domestic zinc association. Canada is also complaining about DLA nickel and lead sales and in the recent past Bolivia has called unsuccessfully for tin disposals to be halted. The stockpile was established in 1939 to accumulate strategic materials to avoid shortages during time of national emergency. It has bought and sold millions of tonnes of metal and other commodities since then. The American Zinc Association claims that since March more than 36.3m lb of stockpiled zinc has been sold by the DLA at 3 to 4 cents a lb below the prevailing market price. 'Such a discount drags down the entire market. Efficient private-sector producers lose normal price levels when competing against the government's low-price, taxpayer-subsidised sales,' says Mr George Vary, AZA's executive director. He calculates US taxpayers lost well over Dollars 1m from the zinc sales while one of the four remaining US zinc smelters - Zinc Corporation's. Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 54,000-tonnes-a-year plant - was forced to shut for at least a year and another, Big River Zinc's Sauget, Illinois, smelter has laid off 7 per cent of its hourly workforce. 'The law specifically places responsibility on the government to avoid loss to taxpayers and to avoid undue disruption to markets when the stockpile is disposing of materials. What we have seen is exactly the reverse,' says Mr Vary.</p>

			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS: CALIFORNIA HIGH HAS CERTAIN AIR, THANKS TO HANEY  </P> <P> California High in Whittier has only a 2-4 record in football, but junior  quarterback Larry Haney has gained notice with his passing statistics.  </P> <P> Haney is leading quarterbacks in the Southern Section with an average of 254.4  yards passing per game. In six games, he has completed 131 of 223 passes for  1,526 yards and 18 touchdowns, and in last week's 34-31 double-overtime loss to  Whittier High, he passed for 285 yards and four touchdowns.  </P> <P> Last season, Haney passed for 1,563 yards in his first year as starting  quarterback under Coach Tom Tereschuk. Despite learning a new offense, Haney  showed signs of promise with his mobility and passing touch.  </P> <P> "We run a one-back offense that features a lot of high percentage underneath  passes," said Tereschuk, in his second year as coach at California. "We try to  control the ball with our passing and Haney is the person in control. He has  improved tremendously from his sophomore year."  </P> <P> Haney, 6 feet 2, is as smooth as they come in operating the Condors' passing  offense, but said he was surprised by his passing ranking.  </P> <P> "I didn't think that I'd be so high in the rankings," Haney said. "Even though  we are passing more than last year, our offense is pretty easy. It is basically  a run-and-shoot offense that doesn't throw the ball downfield that often."  </P> <P> Haney's best statistical game this season came in a 44-43 loss to Whittier  Christian, when he passed for 315 yards and six touchdowns. He has learned to  spread the ball around to his receivers, with five of them having double  figures in catches. Toby Whickoff leads with 41 receptions and 10 touchdowns,  followed by Paul Martinez, who has 30 catches.  </P> <P> "I just get the job done because I don't have that strong of an arm," said  Haney, who ran the 400-meter dash on the track team last spring along with  playing in the outfield for the baseball team. "Every week I feel that I'm  improving. For one thing, I stay in the pocket a lot better than I used to and  that has helped."  </P> <P> Hacienda Heights Los Altos Coach Dwayne DeSpain entered this season only four  away from his 200th victory. It seemed like a sure bet considering that Los  Altos has appeared in the playoffs the past 18 seasons, a Southern Section  record, and has won seven Southern Section titles.  </P> <P> However, after winning their first two games of the season, the Conquerors have  had problems, losing three of four games, including last Friday's 35-15 defeat  by Nogales.  </P> <P> "I really haven't thought about (the 200th win)," said DeSpain, who has a  199-67-4 record in his 24 seasons coaching. "It is not something that the team  is concerned about this season. We're not sitting here crying over spilled  milk, but we're not as good as we've been in years past."  </P> <P> So, when does DeSpain think he'll get his 200th victory?  </P> <P> "It might not come," DeSpain said laughing. "It is just one of those things  where we are getting overmatched, but we've still got a chance."  </P> <P> Claremont Coach Bob Baiz gained his 210th victory and his 100th at Claremont  when the Wolfpack defeated previously unbeaten Glendora, 14-7, Friday night.  </P> <P> After trailing, 7-3, at halftime, Claremont received a major break midway  through the third quarter when Glendora's Nathan Pellow kicked a rolling  Wolfpack punt that was recovered by Nick Baiz, the coach's son. Claremont  scored on a four-yard pass from Adam Metwalli to Ryan Wall.  </P> <P> "We punted and the most unlikely thing happened," said Baiz, who coached at San  Dimas and Fermin Lasuen of San Pedro before taking over at Claremont. "Their  safety just kicked the ball while it was still moving. That was a key play to  the game."  </P> <P> Glendora had a chance to score on its last possession when it drove to  Claremont's seven-yard line. However, Nick Baiz again made the big play when he  intercepted Glendora quarterback Tracey Thompson's pass in the end zone with 13  seconds remaining.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TIMES' TOP TEAMS  </P> <P> Southern Section  </P> <P> No. School, League / Division, Record  </P> <P> 1.

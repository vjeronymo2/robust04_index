			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service in  Ukrainian at 1900 GMT on 22 June carries a 10-minute recorded  report by correspondent Tamara Kucherenko on a meeting on 22  June between Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and the  leadership of Ukraine's "power ministries and agencies."  According to Kucherenko, the meeting focused on "the protection  and security of a human being" as a new conceptual problem for  Ukraine.    Kucherenko quotes Deputy Internal Affairs Minister Yuriy  Kravchenko as saying that, although no drastic increase in  criminal activity occurred in Ukraine and there was even a  tendency toward a declining crime rate, the one phenomenon that  was "acquiring a bloody character" was contract killing with the  use of firearms--the number of which has increased three-fold.  Kucherenko says that the situation was particularly serious in  Crimea and that, according to Kravchenko, even while the rate of  crime detection has risen by 14 percent, the murder of  militiamen has become more frequent, and a disproportionately  small number of criminals have been convicted for this crime.    Kucherenko says that both Ukrainian Justice Minister Vasyl  Onopenko and Security Service chief Yevhen Marchuk criticized  Ukraine's criminal law and insisted that, in particular, the law  should be amended to apply the death penalty for the murder of  militiamen.    Kucherenko then quotes Viktor Medvedchuk, president of  Ukraine's Lawyers Union, as saying that 25,000 people had  disappeared in Ukraine in 1993.    Kucherenko also describes Procurator General Vladyslav  Datsyuk's address to the meeting as "quite expressive."  According to Kucherenko, Datsyuk says: What we have is  arbitrariness, rather than law; he says that there are delays in  the handling of cases by the courts, isolation cells are  overcrowded, people are taking turns sleeping, and there is not  enough food for them. Datsyuk is quoted as saying that, at the  same time, some "leading Mafiosi have now become real dollar  millionaires."    Kucherenko reports on President Kravchuk's address to the  meeting and follows with a recording of Kravchuk's remarks.    Kravchuk says: "Today we can say that our citizens--the  citizens of Ukraine, the citizens of the state that exists, that  is in the making--are not protected in full measure and cannot  exercise their vital human rights and freedoms in full measure.  I believe this is true. When we are talking about all those  things that have been mentioned here today, however, we proceed  from the basic principle that the life of an individual is  secure. That is to say, there is peace, accord, and there are  no encroachments on the most valuable thing--life.    "On the one hand, we see the existing difficulties; on the  other hand, we see that there is a possibility for an individual  to feel he is not in a state of emergency. Many other such  examples could be mentioned. However, I agree with what has  been said here. This was said by the chief of the Security  Service and by Vladyslav Datsyuk [word indistinct]. It is clear  that the challenge has been launched, and now we cannot evade  this. We have to respond to war with war. We should not be  afraid of this terminology. That is to say, I formulate [word  indistinct] as follows: not a state of emergency, but emergency  measures to fight the criminal world--emergency measures built  on law, on enforceable enactments.    "This is why it is necessary to urgently submit such a  package of documents--for example, on the initiative of the  president--at least so they can be considered as soon as  possible by the Supreme Council. However, we should immediately  do what we can do on the basis of the already existing laws and  the existing decrees. This includes both preventive detentions  and the genuine protection, first and foremost, of employees of  law enforcement bodies and other individuals who perform  protective functions under the law.    "This does not mean that we will encroach on some rights and  freedoms of either an individual or groups of individuals while  taking emergency measures. We will protect the rights and  freedoms of the largest, the most representative, group of  people who suffer as a result of impudence, armed attacks, and  just [word indistinct] cruelty on the part of various wild--I  say this without any exaggeration--formations and criminal  groups. I believe we have the grounds to do it exactly this  way."    Kucherenko then reports that Kravchuk also reminded the  meeting it became possible to prevent reprisals against the  Communist Party and some of its leaders after the abortive  August putsch of 1991 in Moscow. She reports that Kravchuk said  that threats can be heard today from left-wing forces wishing to  square accounts with their opponents, and they speak openly  about concentration camps and crematoria. Kravchuk says very  little is required to return to those times.</p>

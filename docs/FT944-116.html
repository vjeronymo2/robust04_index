			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / International Company News: Z Groupe Zannier Z Groupe Zannier, French manufacturer of children's clothing, has sold its Kickers footwear brand to Flavio Briatore, the director of the Benetton-Ford Formula One motor racing team, Reuter reports from Paris. 'This operation will have a positive impact, which it is not possible to determine at present, on the extraordinary results of the 1994 financial year,' Zannier, whose other brands include the Z children's clothing range, said in a statement. The sale price was not disclosed but gross annual royalties from Kickers were about FFr20m. Zannier, listed on the Paris bourse's main monthly settlement market earlier this year, had net attributable 1993 profits of FFr64.14m (Dollars 12m) on turnover of FFr1.97bn. The company, which is based near Saint-Etienne, France, used to farm out manufacture of Kickers to subcontractors. It bought the 1970s brand in 1988.</p>

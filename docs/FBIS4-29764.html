			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- The opposition Democratic  Party (DP) proposed Monday to form a joint standing preparation  body with the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) to ensure  supra-partisan support for an inter-Korean summit.    The party's Supreme Council met Monday morning, under the  presidency of Chairman Yi Ki-taek, and made the proposal after  agreeing that the inter-Korean summit requires perfect  preparations since it presents a historic chance to deal with  various national issues including unification and the nuclear  problem.    Members of the supreme committee also decided to form  another  organization inside the party to study details of the summit  including its agenda.    North Korean strongman Kim Il-song, speaking through former  U.S. President Jimmy Carter, has expressed his desire to meet  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam for an early summit "at any  time, any place and without any preconditions." The South's  leader has welcomed the offer.    The opposition party plans to seek an extraordinary session  of the National Assembly to discuss the North Korean nuclear  problem and the Seoul-Pyongyang summit.    Chairman Yi said before the meeting, "There is no need for  me  to visit North Korea ahead of President Kim Yong-sam if the  inter-Korean summit is pushed ahead with smoothly."    North Korea said recently that it would welcome a visit by  Yi.</p>

			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / 500 die in Indian monsoon rains Nearly 500 people have been killed and millions left homeless in torrential rains across several central Indian states since monsoons hit the subcontinent last month. Relief operations in most states have been hampered by continuing rainfall. In Bombay, India's commercial capital, at least 100 people have been killed and more than 80,000 have lost their homes. Several old buildings have collapsed. Railway services were disrupted for the eighth consecutive day yesterday. But the worst hit area is Vidharbha, Maharashtra's cotton-growing region, where more than 50,000 people have been affected and crops worth millions of rupees have been destroyed.</p>

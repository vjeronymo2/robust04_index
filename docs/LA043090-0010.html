			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REIN IN WESTLAKE NORTH  </P> <P> We the people. . .don't seem to get any choices anymore. Or any of that other  stuff that free speech and the will of the majority was all about.  </P> <P> So many of us are giving up and giving in to political contributors. This  letter is my own last attempt to speak out, in despair, to ask other people to  rally, because, even in the Soviet Union these days, when people really care,  things seem to be movable. At least over there.  </P> <P> What's happening over here to our last bit of fresh air, and space, over in  Westlake North and other developments? What happened to all those people who  spoke up and signed and said, "Not another shopping mall! No more pollution! We  value our open spaces! Stop!"  </P> <P> All these people were stopped because a heavy form was not attached to a  petition form. Obviously, the people who value breathing space didn't know that  if you value open space, and the right to rule your own destiny, and not turn  our valuable real estate into another congested "Valley," you have to gather,  not signatures, but dollars, and put them in the right pockets.  </P> <P> I call on everyone who cares to write and call the Westlake city fathers to  stop the huge project planned at Westlake North before it is too late.  </P> <P> Besides, give them a chance to prove me wrong -- show that they are leaders of  people who care, not of pocketbooks.  </P> <P> Or maybe I should be asking you to gather dollars.  </P> <P> CAROL COHEN  </P> <P> Agoura  </P></p>

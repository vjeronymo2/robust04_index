			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / PLO wants US to lean on Jerusalem The Palestine Liberation Organisation is to send envoys to Washington to discuss with the US its 'requirements' for resuming peace talks with Israel, following last week's massacre of Palestinians in Hebron, senior PLO officials said yesterday. The PLO representatives would seek US pressure on Israel to take tougher steps to protect Palestinians in the occupied territories than those announced at the weekend by Israel's Premier Yitzhak Rabin. The PLO has already rejected as 'inadequate' Mr Rabin's move to disarm a few of the most extreme Jewish settlers. In Israel, Mr Rabin appealed to the PLO and the Arab states who have suspended their peace talks with Israel (Syria, Lebanon and Jordan) to return to the negotiating table. If they did not, they would be handing victory to the extremists. At the same time, he rejected Palestinian demands for all 120,000 Jewish settlers in the occupied territories to be disarmed and for some settlements to be dismantled. The PLO was also calling for United Nations observers in the occupied territories. In Washington, the State Department said the US believed the Israelis and Palestinians should continue to negotiate on the basis of the declaration of principles they signed at the White House last September, rather than setting out new conditions. 'The agenda is the declaration of principles and how it can be implemented and the full range of issues associated with the declaration. That has been the agenda and will likely remain the agenda and must remain the agenda for them to move ahead in the process,' said Mr Michael McCurry, State Department spokesman. Although the separate bilateral talks between Israel and Jordan, Syria and Lebanon broke off on Sunday, the US believes they will resume. State Department officials said Mr Farouk Sharaa, Syrian foreign minister, had assured Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, that the break in the talks represented 'a pause, not a retreat'. The PLO hopes last Friday's massacre will galvanise international, and especially US, opinion behind its demands; it believes this offers the only prospect of forcing further concessions from the Israelis.</p>

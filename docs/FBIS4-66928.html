			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mr. Monory Agrees With Mr. </F> Mitterrand on Nuclear Test Moratorium"]    [Excerpts] Senate Speaker Rene Monory (UDF-CDS [Union for  French Democracy-Social Democratic Center]) thinks that the idea  of a referendum on employment launched by Philippe Seguin (RPR  [Rally for the Republic]), his National Assembly counterpart, is  "too simple." Mr. Monory, who was the guest on the Radio-J  "Forum" program on Sunday, 15 May, said: "Employment deserves  more than passing comments. It requires a series of measures.  We must stop indulging in demagoguery and controversy.... I  think that the majority and opposition should not taunt each  other with each other's failures." The Senate speaker hopes  that the presidential election will provide the opportunity "for  a great debate" on this employment question. "Otherwise, we  will be heading for decline," he said. [passage omitted]    Questioned on the disagreement between the prime minister  and  the president of the Republic on the question of the moratorium  on nuclear tests, Mr. Monory expressed the view that this  controversy is "rather pointless" because "our decision," he  said, "is determined more than ever by the attitude of our big  partners." Taking up the argument used by Francois Mitterrand  during his 10 May television speech, he added: "It is true that  if the others do not resume the tests, we will not resume them,  and if the others do resume them, we will resume them."    On the question of the European elections, the Senate  speaker, who had supported Dominique Baudis as candidate to head  the UDF-RPR [Rally for the Republic] list, thinks that "35  percent" would be "a good score."</p>

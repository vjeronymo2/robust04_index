The third round of talks, which ended on Friday, revealed at  least two problems where a compromise is hardly possible. They  are the future political status of Abkhazia and conditions for  the return home of refugees. The draft agreements on both these  problems remained unsigned.    The two sides agreed to renew negotiations in New York on  March 7 on the proposal put forward by U.N. Secretary General's  envoy Edward Brunner and backed by Russian envoy Boris Pastukhov.    Pastukhov told ITAR-TASS that he "regretted that the round  of  talks had not brought the desired result".    The only positive moment he could mention was the "motion  towards a compromise" as both delegations confirmed that they  welcomed the participation of the Russian military contingent in  the UN peace- keeping operations in the conflict area.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Silentnight lower after downturn in UK beds Tough market competition depressed interim profits at Silentnight Holdings, Europe's biggest bed manufacturer. Pre-tax profits for the six months to end-July fell from Pounds 5.22m to Pounds 4.11m. The latest figure was struck after reorganisation costs of Pounds 592,000 for the closure of the group's Sutton bed factory announced last April. Mr Bill Davies, executive chairman, described the performance of the UK beds business as disappointing. There was no sign of recovery and price competition remained intense. However, the German bed and UK cabinet businesses had performed well, and the US division returned to profit. Group sales improved from Pounds 79.6m to Pounds 82.5m. The UK beds division, which continues to contribute the bulk of turnover, reported sales of Pounds 47m (Pounds 47.9m) and operating profits, after taking the reorganisation charge, halved to Pounds 1.51m (Pounds 3.27m). The group expects the consolidation of bed production on its Barnoldswick site to bring annual cost savings of Pounds 750,000. In contrast, the UK cabinets division lifted operating profits by 24 per cent, from Pounds 1.17m to Pounds 1.45m, on sales up from Pounds 19.8m to Pounds 22.3m. Mr Davies said the improvements had been made in spite of the flat market for furniture. The capital expenditure of 18 months ago had led to a good product range, and increasing volume would drop profits straight through to the bottom line. The German beds division made operating profits of Pounds 635,000 on sales of Pounds 6.44m, down from Pounds 737,000 on sales of Pounds 6.28m. In the US, where new management was installed last year, a previous loss of Pounds 14,000 on sales of Pounds 5.1m was turned into a profit of Pounds 341,000 on sales of Pounds 6.36m. Earnings per share fell from 7.41p to 5.84p, while the interim dividend is maintained at 2.75p. COMMENT Not before time, the group has given a divisional breakdown. It makes clear that the biggest problem remains the UK bed market, where margins are under pressure. While this division performed worse than expected, the cabinets division rode to the rescue, and the US climbed back into the black. Forecasting the profits for the bed division is difficult - the absence of exceptionals and the ensuing savings should lead to a Pounds 1.5m turnround, but the continuing effects of disruption are harder to quantify. Prices of raw materials, which account for 50 per cent of a bed, are also set to rise, with an 8 per cent increase expected in imported timber. Analysts yesterday reduced forecasts to about Pounds 11m this year and between Pounds 12.4m and Pounds 13.5m for 1995-96. The upper figure gives a prospective multiple of 10.9 - high enough.</p>

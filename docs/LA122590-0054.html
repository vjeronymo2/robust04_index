			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Tobacco Firm Won't Appeal Ruling: Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Co. said it  will not appeal a New Jersey Supreme Court decision that health warnings on  cigarette packs do not protect tobacco companies from liability suits.  </P> <P> Louisville, Ky.-based Brown &amp; Williamson said it is confident it would win  if any liability cases are presented and would not ask the U.S. Supreme Court  to review the New Jersey decision. The New Jersey ruling flew in the face of a  series of federal decisions that gave tobacco companies immunity from  smoker-death lawsuits after 1966, when Congress ordered the labels placed on  cigarette packs.  </P></p>

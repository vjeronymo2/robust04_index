The sources said the two rivals arrived at a compromise  accord which calls for electing the House of Representatives  through a mix of 300 single-seat districts and 200 seats  distributed by proportional representation based on the division  of the country into 11 blocs.    It was not immediately clear exactly when and how the new  agreement would be sent to the Diet for a vote. The current  parliamentary session ends on Saturday.    Flanked by Ichiro Ozawa, co-leader of Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party], the second-largest but most influential party in  the ruling coalition, and LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori,  the two leaders also agreed to allow each lawmaker to maintain  one fundraising organization, the sources said.    The agreement came about after nearly two hours of talks  between Hosokawa and Kono in the Diet building.    The meeting began at around 7 P.M., shortly after Hosokawa  and Kono met separately with Takako Doi, speaker of the House of  Representatives, who urged the two leaders to come to terms on  the issue. Doi proposed passing the bills without setting a  date for implementation and then discussing revision of the  package in the next ordinary Diet session opening Monday,  coalition sources said.    But both Hosokawa and Kono rejected Doi's compromise  proposal  and later produced the agreement by themselves, coalition and  LDP sources said.    The coalition and the opposition, including the LDP, failed  to reach an accord over the issue Thursday night at a meeting of  a joint council of the two Diet houses.    The council was made up of 10 members from the coalition who  voted for the bills in the lower house and 10 legislators from  the opposition who opposed the package in the upper house.    In the joint council session, the LDP rejected the  compromise, and countered with its own slightly revised reform  package, which was rejected by the lower house in November.    The coalition's original version had called for 274  single-seat districts and 226 seats alloted by proportional  representation, compared with the LDP version's of 300  single-seat constituencies and 171 seats allotted by  proportional representation.    The LDP proposal had also called for allowing individual  politicians to accept corporate donations through designated  fundraising organizations.    The coalition refused to accept this, and Yuichi Ichikawa,  secretary general of Komeito and the coalition's chief  negotiator, who chaired the meeting, declared an end to the  effort by the joint council to find ground for a compromise.    Hosokawa said Thursday he will not cling to power if he  fails  to achieve political reform by Saturday's close of the Diet  session.</p>

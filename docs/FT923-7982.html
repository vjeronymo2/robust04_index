			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Time to think long-term ONE-TENTH of Britain's labour force is now out of work; the number of people who are unable to find work is greater than the 2.75m who appear in the official figures; and both measures of joblessness are likely to carry on rising this year, next year and probably the year after that too. There is little the government can do to prevent this, at least while real interest rates are so high. But it is not powerless. It should act decisively to ensure that the unemployed are able to re-enter employment and thereby hold down inflationary pressures when the recovery finally comes. The government's strategy for dealing with the unemployed looks increasingly behind the times. Job clubs and other measures to help them search for employment or prepare for interviews make eminent sense when the economy is growing. But few economists now expect a recovery this year. The fall in output may have come to a halt, as yesterday's figures suggest. But there is little sign that it will start rising soon. The longer recovery is postponed, the larger the pool of long-term unemployed will become. Cutting the availability of unemployment benefit from a year to six months, as the government is reported to be considering, would not be an improvement. As a way of saving money and cutting the budget deficit, it would be negligible. Of the 600,000 people unemployed for between six months and a year, less than half are eligible for unemployment benefit; and the majority of those would simply shift over to the means-tested supplementary benefit instead. If the UK were plagued by large numbers of long-term unemployed who were unwilling to take available jobs, then cutting supplementary benefit would make more sense. But no-one could seriously argue that this is currently the case. Even when growth is buoyant, the evidence that simply cutting welfare payments helps people back into jobs is weak. Denying welfare payments to unemployed American men has not prevented a rapid growth of long-term joblessness there. And Britain's Restart programme, which toughened eligibility rules, proved more effective at shifting the long-term unemployed off the register than into employment. What does make sense is for the government to make benefits conditional on participation in one of the currently neglected schemes designed to keep the long-term unemployed active: Employment Action and Employment Training. It should also explore training initiatives for those who would benefit: a revival of the acclaimed Training Opportunities Programme for some, remedial education for others. It would require many more places, and more money, than the government has so far should been willing to provide. But in the long-term, it would be worth the cost.</p>

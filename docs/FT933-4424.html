			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Shell in dispute over oil platform deal KVAERNER, the Norwegian engineering, construction and shipbuilding group, is in dispute with Norske Shell, the Norwegian subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, over final settlement of a North Sea oil platform contract. Kvaerner Rosenberg, a unit of Kvaerner, is seeking NKr483m (Pounds 45m) in compensation for extra work it claims the oil company demanded outside the original scope of the contract. Shell, in turn, is seeking NKr1.2bn from Rosenberg for alleged 'wilful misconduct' over the contract. Kvaerner said that during construction of the Draugen platform deck, at the Rosenberg yard in Stavanger, Shell approved substantial changed orders and additional work. The contract was originally valued at NKr834m. 'During its (the contract's) execution, Shell issued instructions and paid for supplementary work worth almost NKr1.2bn. This brings the value of the contract - excluding Kvaerner Rosenberg's disputed claim - to NKr2bn,' Kvaerner said. The contractor said three-quarters of more than 25,000 construction documents supplied by Shell to Rosenberg were received too late for it to meet the stipulated delivery schedule. 'In addition the company received almost 30,000 change orders.' Kvaerner said that despite much extra work, Rosenberg achieved 98.4 per cent completion of the deck when it was ready for delivery in mid-January. Shell, however, requested Aker, Kvaerner's main Norwegian competitor, to undertake final completion and commissioning of the platform.</p>

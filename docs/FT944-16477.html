			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Survey of Bulgaria (10): Investment is forthcoming Although Bulgaria has not revealed plans for privatisation of the telecommunications sector, foreign investment has been forthcoming both in services and manufacturing. Betkom, the first western telecommunications joint venture in the country, was set up between the UK's GPT, a supplier of intelligent pay phones, and Bulgaria's committee of Posts and Telecommunications. GPT, a partnership between two of the world's leaders in telecoms - GEC of the UK and Siemens AG of Germany - holds a 41.1 per cent stake in Betkom. According to John Murgatroid, Betkom manager, the growth of the joint venture since the initial equity investment worth Dollars 437,000 has been on a self-financing basis - profits are reinvested in expanding the network. The number of card phones installed is expected to reach 1,000 by the end of the year, compared to just 100 in 1991, Betkom's first year of operation. Another significant development is Bulgaria's first cellular network which was launched earlier this year by a Bulgarian-British joint venture between Cable &amp; Wireless (49 per cent), BTC (39 per cent) and state-owned company Radio Electronic Systems (12 per cent). Known under its trade name, Mobilfon, the network provides direct mobile connections for Bulgaria's largest cities with more than 70 countries and has attracted more than 4,500 subscribers. Mobiltel, a recently established consortium including Siemens, US West and the Bulgarian financial group Tron is emerging as the main competitor to Mobilfon. The consortium has been licensed to build a GSM digital cellular wireless network and plans to cover 80 per cent of the country by 1998. Some of the components for the establishment of the Mobiltel network are expected to be produced by Digicom, a joint venture between Siemens and Incoms Holding of Bulgaria for the production, installation, and maintenance of switching and transmission systems.</p>

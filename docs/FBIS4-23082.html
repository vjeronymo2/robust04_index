			<p>SUMMARY                                     In the face of a mounting crisis over North Korea's nuclear  reactor refueling activities, Pyongyang is still pressing for  bilateral talks with Washington and trying to create the  impression that it wants to see a peaceful resolution to the  crisis.                                     END SUMMARY     Byongyang media have not been observed so far to report or  comment on a 30 May UN Security Council resolution that  reportedly called on the DPRK to proceed with discharging spent  fuel rods from its 5-megawatt nuclear reactor "in a manner which  preserves the technical possibility of fuel measurements" in the  future (Yonhap, 30 May).  However, Seoul radio on 31 May reported  that Kim Su-man, North Korea's deputy UN ambassador, brushed  aside the UN statement as "another attempt" by Washington and the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to "crush" Pyongyang  and contended that "all pending issues" concerning North Korea  must be resolved through bilateral talks between Pyongyang and  Washington and "not by the UN Security Council" (KBS-1, 31 May).  Kim reportedly added that Pyongyang nonetheless is "willing" to  hold "further negotiations with the IAEA, even though the agency  had previously rejected a North Korean proposal made in an effort  "to reasonably solve" the nuclear issue.     Earlier Statement     Kim's reported remarks are consistent with  a  claim made in a 28 May Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement  that reiterated the importance Pyongyang attaches to a "package  solution" with the United States on the nuclear issue (Pyongyang  radio, 29 May).   Relatively nonconfrontational in tone, the  statement claimed that North Korea is "fully ensuring" the  continuity of nuclear safeguards and is "even" discharging fuel  rods "in such a way as to preserve technical feasibility" of  selected measurement of the rods in the future.  While admitting  that there have been disputes with the IAEA on the methods of  nuclear fuel withdrawal, the statement claimed that the agency  came to "an understanding" that its method of selecting and  segregating fuel rods is not acceptable to the DPRK because it is  tantamount to an "ad hoc" inspection--something Pyongyang has  been rejecting pending the outcome of future DPRK-U.S. talks.  The statement went on to allege that the agency "took note" of  the "theoretical feasibility" of the North Korean method of  preserving fuel rods for future measurements.  The statement also  pledged North Korea's "active efforts" to ensure the  "transparency" of its nuclear activities and its "utmost" effort  to seek an "ultimate solution" to the nuclear i$sue through  "DPRK-U. S. talks."     Other Signs     DPRK media in recent days have also sought to  create the impression that Pyongyang is seeking a peaceful  solution to the nuclear crisis. As it has done in the past when  tensions escalated on the peninsula, Pyongyang again used a  foreign investment-related law to signal its purported hope for a  peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue.  The North Korean news  agency KCNA on 27 May published the full text of a set of  regulations governing the operation of foreign enterprises in  North Korea's free trade zone--regulations adopted two months  earlier.  The timing of the publicity seems designed to convey  the impression that at least part of the North Korean leadership  is looking beyond the current nuclear crisis.  Similarly,  attesting to the eagerness with which Pyongyang is looking for  any signs of softening in Washington's attitude toward North  Korea, KCNA on 28 May publicized a letter attributed to "U.S.  Congresswoman Elizabeth Purse" to President Clinton and the  chairman of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee, in which she  reportedly counseled against "escalating tensions" in Korea and  called for "pursuing a policy for normalizing relations" with  Pyongyang.

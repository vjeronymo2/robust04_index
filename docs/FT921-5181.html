			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei recovers after falling below 21,000 STRENGTH in pharmaceutical shares and a late round of arbitrage-related buying left the Nikkei index with a modest rise yesterday after slipping below the 21,000 level, writes Neil Weinberg in Tokyo. The 225-share average closed 53.71 higher at 21,105.42, just below the day's high of 21,112.24, as drug and bio-technology issues resumed their rally. This followed a drop of 436.11 on Tuesday; yesterday's low of 20,867.71 came on continued corporate selling related to March 31 book-closings and disappointment that Bank of Japan intervention by selling dollars in the foreign exchange market had failed to curb the yen's losses. Volume eased from 256m to 230m shares and, despite the Nikkei's modest rise, declines led advances by 596 to 329 with 193 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section shares fell 5.21 to 1,537.22 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.25 to 1172.16. The market continued to lack sufficient momentum for a sustained rally, although leading trading houses sought to drum up buying interest via pharmaceuticals, bio-tech and environmental protection stocks, dealers said. Mochida Pharmaceutical, which jumped by some 50 per cent last week, continued to rally strongly and finished up Y500 at Y4,180. It was boosted by continued buying interest in the drug sector, as well as rumours that the Ministry of Finance, a leading shareholder, is anxious to see the shares appreciate. Dainippon Pharmaceutical also rose Y220 to Y2,030. Environmental protection issues had another strong day, with Japan Storage Battery up Y80 at Y1,180 as it led the active stocks list, and Mitsubishi Kakoki Y65 better at Y900. Electrical and auto shares languished, with Hitachi off Y17 to Y805 and Nissan Motor Y11 to Y599. Banks, brokerages and non-life insurers also lost ground. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank fell Y30 to Y1,990 and Tokio Marine and Fire Y20 to Y1,040. As the market continues to bide its time, trading around 21,000 on the Nikkei, participants are seeking direction from the foreign exchange market and interest rates. Conditions became even more confused yesterday as the Bank of Japan's action on the yen coincided with comments opposing intervention from the Japanese finance minister, Mr Tsutomu Hata. 'Nobody's sure where the economy is going or whether we're going to get an (official discount) rate cut. It's leaving the market in a void,' said Ms. Caroline Stone of Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Investors are particularly anxious to see the central bank's tankan report on business conditions, due out tomorrow. If it indicates economic activity is slowing sharply, already formidable pressure will mount further for the Bank of Japan to cut its official discount rate from 4.5 per cent. In Osaka, the OSE index fell 114.90 to 22,791.16. Nintendo lost Y200 to Y10,400. Roundup THE REGION's equity markets were mostly mixed to higher yesterday, with Hong Kong regaining the initiative it seemed to have lost on Tuesday. HONG KONG closed at a record high, in spite of shedding 29 points in afternoon trade following the budget speech. The Hang Seng Index finished up 43.37 at 4,954.5. Brokers said that the afternoon decline was largely due to consolidation rather than negative reaction to the budget. HSBC Holdings closed up 75 cents at HKDollars 43.50 on expectations that it may soon make a scrip issue. SINGAPORE closed off the day's highs on late profit-taking. The Straits Times Industrial index gained 7.37 to 1,459.92, having earlier been at a day's high of 1,465.24. Brokers reported that turnover remained low due to the lack of support from fund managers who were investing elsewhere, particularly in Hong Kong. Volume was 44m shares against 42.5m. SEOUL ended sharply higher on rumours that the government planned a package of measures ahead of the election on March 24. The measures, later denied, were said to include extending financial support to securities houses and approving the establishment of a new investment trust company. The composite stock index finished up 14.55 at 630.47 in turnover of Won224bn against Won326.26bn. TAIWAN rose in dull trade and the weighted index closed up 9.76 to 5,066.40 in turnover of TDollars 25bn compared with TDollars 32.9bn. An announcement that the government planned a further sale of its shares in the three largest commercial banks had little impact on the sector. Construction shares were the biggest gainers of the day. AUSTRALIA closed marginally lower and the All Ordinaries index closed down 6.5 at 1,615.2 in volume of 106.5m shares. News Corp lost 4 cents to ADollars 17.76 after falling from an intraday high of ADollars 18.16. NEW ZEALAND finished weaker with the NZSE-40 down 15.65 at 1,468.71 in turnover of NZDollars 26.5m. Magnum, the Auckland-based liquor and grocery group, which reported a smaller than forecast decline in half-year profits, gained 10 cents to NZDollars 1.08. Telecom shed 5 cents to NZDollars 2.42.</p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIOLINIST FODOR PLACED ON PROBATION  </P> <P> Inernationally acclaimed violinist Eugene Fodor, charged with breaking and  entering and possession of cocaine and heroin, was placed on probation Monday.  </P> <P> "Of course, I'm relieved that this ordeal is over," Fodor said. "The experience  has been a frightening and profound one. What I want to do now is get back to  my music and my life."  </P> <P> Fodor, 39, of New York City, pleaded guilty to breaking into the Martha's  Vineyard motel room where he was discovered July 27.  </P> <P> A search of the room turned up a bottle containing more than 20 grams of  cocaine, a hypodermic needle with a small amount of heroin and a dagger.  </P> <P> A Dukes County Grand Jury had returned indictments of breaking and entering,  possession of heroin and cocaine and possession of instruments used to  administer drugs. Fodor pleaded guilty to the breaking-and-entering charge,  which carried a maximum penalty of six months in jail. Fodor pleaded innocent  to the other charges, and they were placed on file, pending his completion of  probation.  </P></p>

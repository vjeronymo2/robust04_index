			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Salinas seeks sweeping amnesty for guerrillas President Carlos Salinas of Mexico yesterday called for a special session of Congress to give an amnesty to rebel guerrillas who seized several towns in the southern state of Chiapas on New Year's Day. The amnesty will be extended to all participants in the uprising, and will cover their illegal acts between January 1 and yesterday. The president said that there would now be no reason for rebels to remain away from their villages; they could carry on with their lives peacefully. Mr Salinas said he would soon propose an integrated plan for justice in Chiapas. The decision followed criticism at home and abroad of the government's repression of the rebellion, and widespread sympathy for the plight of indigenous people in the jungles of Chiapas. A government official said the amnesty would create better conditions for peaceful solution to the conflict, adding that Congress would be convened today and that the necessary law would be passed as soon as possible. On Thursday, Mr Salinas had announced a unilateral cease-fire in the conflict. He then said he would pardon rebels who had acted out of desperation or were pressed into the insurrection. The new amnesty, however, will apply to all participants. It seems to be unconditional. In a further sign of the government's more conciliatory approach to the conflict in Chiapas, Mr Manuel Camacho Sols, government commissioner for peace in the region, has accepted Bishop Samuel Ruiz of San Cristobal de Las Casas as mediator with the guerrilla movement. At first, the government had indirectly attacked followers of the radical bishop for sympathising with the rebels. Newspaper columists generally close to Mr Camacho, a former mayor of Mexico City and foreign minister, yesterday sought to play down reports that he would use his new position to challenge Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, candidate of Mexico's ruling party to succeed Mr Salinas as president via an election this year. Mr Camacho was Mr Colosio's rival for the party's nomination. The former represents the newly ascendant conciliatory wing in the government.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ROSEANNE FALLOUT  </P> <P> I booed Roseanne Barr. I was one of the working women supposedly being honored  at the stadium.  </P> <P> (I don't know too many women who don't work.)  </P> <P> She was just being herself, sports fans.  </P> <P> We are always hoping for heroes. What we always get is a promoter choosing our  heroes, hoping to make a buck and humiliating and demeaning us with the  tastelessness of a Roseanne Barr.  </P> <P> I hope the judgment by Tom Werner was a one-time excusable error. If not, look  out Padre fans, last place could look good to us.  </P> <P> NOMA PINTO  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature, compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] President Levon Ter-Petrosyan favours plans to set  up Russian military bases in Armenia. This has been told to  journalists by Russia's Defence Minister Pavel Grachev at the  end of his private talks with Armenian leaders on Wednesday [8  June].    In Grachev's words, it will finally decided on Thursday how  many military bases will be set up, and what personnel they  would employ.    As INTERFAX has learned from a negotiator, Russia is looking  forward to creating two military bases in Armenia: one for a  motorized infantry regiment at Erevan, the other for a motorized  infantry division positioned at Gyumri.    In Grachev's view, an appropriate agreement with Armenia  will  be signed by 1 September. "By then, Army officers must decide  for themselves who will stay in Armenia and who will return to  Russia," Grachev said.    Military experts believe that the issue on funding was  crucial to the talks between Ter-Petrosyan and Grachev.  According to a spokesman for Grachev, the Armenian leadership  wish that Russia would pay for leasing the sites for its Army in  Armenia. However, the Russian side insists on the free use of  Armenian lands in military purposes.    Negotiations on that continued on Thursday.    During his tour of Caucasian republics, Grachev also plans  to  meet with Georgia's leader Eduard Shevardnadze to discuss with  him the possibility of Russian military presence in that  republic (presumably at Tbilisi, Akhalkalaki, and Batumi -- IF).  Besides, Grachev intends to discuss peace-keeping activity in  the zone of Georgian-Abkhazi hostilities.    As he reported to journalists, at a meeting with President  Geydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan slated for June 11, he would raise  the issue on the need for that republic to adhere to the  agreement on a Karabakh settlement, signed in Moscow on 17 May.  Otherwise, he said, Russia would halt all mediation in  resolving this conflict.    "If the conflicting parties want to stop the war, the  signing  of the Moscow accord is the best chance for that," Grachev  stressed.    IF Note: On 17 May, Russia's Defence Minister Pavel Grachev  mediated the signing by the leaders of Armenia and Karabakh of  an agreement on a stage-by-stage settlement in Karabakh. Only  the Azerbaijani side refused to sign the accord. Stage one  provides for a ceasefire to be followed by a disengagement of  hostile troops by 10-15 km, and by setting up mixed observation  posts. During stage two and three, negotiators are to focus to  ways of liberating the captured Azerbaijani territories and  determining a status for Karabakhs.    Searches for a Karabakh settlement through Russian  mnediation  began in Kyrgyzstan's capital Bishkek in early May when  lawmakers from Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, and Karabakh signed  a protocol to cease-fire and disengage the troops. Azerbaijan  refused to join the accord then.    Only one month later, on 8 June, at a session of the  Interparliamentary Assembly in St. Petersburg, did the  Azerbaijani Parliament's Speaker Rasul Guliyev put his signature  under the Bishkek agreement. However, he argued that the  document "does not solve all Karabakh problems."    In his opinion, since the protocol "only provides for a  cease-fire, documents are required to work out a comprehensive  settlement." He reported at the session that essential papers  were being drafted with help from CSCE, CIS through Russian  mediation."    "Azerbaijani is ready to negotiate these issues and  determine  a status for Karabakh but only after all Azerbaijan lands have  been freed by political means," Guliyev remarked.    In his words, some Azerbaijani forces are trying to  aggravate  the conflict. They regard the Bishkek accords as a provocation  from neighboring states.    Nonetheless, Guliyev advocated an early deployment of  peace-keepers in Karabakh to operate under UN and CSCE control  there.    The Armenian Parliament's Speaker Babken Ararktsyan claims  that a shaky truce in Crabs [as received] can be breached any  time, if the Bishkek protocol is not backed up by legal  documents to be signed by heads of state.    He is convinced that without such signatures, the document  "is incomplete in terms of the law." At the same time, he  stressed that the Bishkek accord "has played its peace-keeping  role."</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Borrowing by companies hits nine-year low: Lower interest rates cut savings A LARGE improvement in company finances, helped by higher profits and lower interest payments, has put the corporate sector on the road to a strong recovery, yesterday's figures from the Central Statistical Office show. In the first quarter companies needed to borrow a net Pounds 591m to cover outgoings - down from Pounds 7.99bn in the fourth quarter of last year and the smallest quarterly figure for nearly nine years. Total undistributed income, allowing for profits and after taking into account interest payments, tax and dividends, came to Pounds 11.6bn in the first quarter at current prices, the highest figure since early 1989. Company investment, paid for out of undistributed income and including cash spent on plant, buildings and vehicles, was a real, inflation-adjusted 0.5 per cent higher in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter of last year. It was particularly boosted by capital spending by non-manufacturing businesses which invested 2.1 per cent more over this period. Capital spending by manufacturers fell 3.2 per cent between the two quarters. Gross trading profits of companies increased 8.4 per cent at current prices in the first quarter compared with the equivalent period a year earlier. Profits were 1.8 per cent higher than in the last quarter of 1992. Taking into account capital transfers and stock appreciation, total company receipts in the first quarter came to Pounds 10.84bn, 14.9 per cent up from the Pounds 9.43bn in the fourth quarter of last year and a healthy 45.1 per cent increase on the corresponding period last year. Company outgoings were reduced by cuts in bank base rates. These pushed interest payments down by 10 per cent between the successive quarters. Taxation came down by 1.3 per cent and dividend payments on ordinary and preference shares fell 10.9 per cent over the same period. The overall financial deficit for companies in the first quarter came to Pounds 147m, down from Pounds 2.1bn in the fourth quarter and the smallest figure since the third quarter of 1987. Companies repaid bank loans totalling a net Pounds 5.19bn.</p>

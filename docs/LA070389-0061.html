			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PICNICKING TO SUIT ANY STYLE;  </P> <P> WHETHER THE OUTING CALLS FOR CHINA OR PAPER PLATES, A GAS GRILL OR CHARCOAL  BRIQUETTES, SUPPLIERS ARE SET FOR SUMMER  </P> <P> John Duncan gestured toward an artfully arranged display of imported English  picnic baskets at the Marjorie Duncan &amp; Associates wholesale showroom in  the L.A. Mart. They are, he pointed out, the real thing: made of sturdy wicker,  lined with linen and filled with country-styled crockery, vacuum bottles and  everything else a party of six might need.  </P> <P> Those hampers, made by Brexton and found in such upscale retailers as Geary's  of Beverly Hills, run about $400, Duncan said. More elaborate outfittings,  featuring fine china, crystal and silver, can quickly send the price into the  thousands of dollars. Such customized hampers hardly cater to a mass market, he  observed, but "you only have to sell one."  </P> <P> Although most California picnickers get by much more modestly, the Brextons  find a steady market among those who enjoy the tradition of hauling what  amounts to catered dinners to such venues as the Hollywood Bowl, whose season  of picnics under the stars preceding concerts begins, incidentally, with a  "preview" this evening. (Among caterers providing meals for these patrons:  Tarzana-based Someone's in the Kitchen, offering a "Hollywood Bowl Feast" for  four at $35 a person; Los Angeles' Along Came Mary, and Rococo Custom Caterers  in Van Nuys.)  </P> <P> But baskets are only the beginning when it comes to the picnic business.  </P> <P> The Barbecue Industry Assn., a trade group based in the Chicago suburb of  Naperville, Ill., expects spending on picnic items to top $6 billion in 1989  for the second straight year. And that doesn't count the purchase of a hamper  (or the occasional use of a caterer).  </P> <P> Food and grocery items will account for nearly $5 billion, barbecue grills $565  million, charcoal briquettes $434 million and lighters $145 million. Consumers  will spend another $125 million on such gear as cooking tools and equipment --  not to mention such oddments as mitts, aprons and chef's toques.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gas More Convenient  </P> <P> Grills fueled by charcoal briquettes, introduced more than 40 years ago, remain  the nation's favorite in sales, accounting for 9.1 million of the 13.1 million  grills sold last year. But gas-fired grills -- with sales of 3.85 million units  -- have significantly closed the gap in this convenience-oriented decade.  Electric grills are a distant third with 135,000 units.  </P> <P> "We've been seeing the gradual growth and development of the gas grill over  about the last decade," said Arthur W. Seeds, president of the Barbecue  Industry Assn. "Most people like the charcoal grill because of the flavor, but  the gas grill is winning favor among consumers who consider it more convenient  in terms of lighting and cleanup."  </P> <P> Speed and ease are important qualities to Baby Boomers, who now account for  most of the population between the ages of 25 and 45, prime child-raising  years. Because of the pressure of heavy work schedules in this age group, Seeds  said, "they're looking for convenience." (Convenience also explains the fact  that 14% of all charcoal sold last year was packed presoaked in lighter fluid  and contained in self-lighting packages.)  </P> <P> But tastes, too, are changing.  </P> <P> More consumers are adding flavor agents. These include varieties of wood chips  -- mostly mesquite, hickory, oak and fruitwood. A Northern California  entrepreneur offers "Winesmoke," described as "a blend of California's finest  grape cuttings" (though the label says nothing of which cuttings might best  accompany fish, fowl or flank steak). And S.A.M. Sales, another wholesaler  represented at the L.A. Mart, offers a charcoal-fired "water smoker" -- a metal  cylinder fitted with a fire pit at the bottom that is topped successively by a  water container (into which flavoring agents are added) and racks for the foods  to be smoked.  </P> <P> Seeds credited an extinct Burbank firm, Big Boy Grills, with pioneering  development of deluxe grills. The more elaborate rigs are popular with serious  patio chefs and professional caterers alike, he said, because they offer not  only speed and easy cleanup but also stove-style burners beside the fire pit  where the rest of a meal can be prepared. Such other amenities as windows in  the hood for closer observation of smoking can boost prices to $300 to $600 and  more. While these command only a small share of the total market nationally, he  said, they are becoming a notable segment in Southern California, where outdoor  cooking takes place all year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Use Lava Rocks  </P> <P> "Grills are still very good buys," Seeds said, "and the market is very  competitive." Thirty-nine manufacturers produced grills last year (a dozen  specializing in gas, 13 in charcoal, the rest producing both). A Cleveland firm  offers a bare-bones brazier at about $2, he said, and Weber's round "Smokey  Joe" retails for less than $25. (Weber's mainstay, featuring a grill 22 inches  across, costs about $70.)  </P> <P> The big market for gas grills is in models costing from $150 to $200, Seeds  said, but small units can be found for about $50. Gas grills heat reusable lava  rocks, or some other radiating substance, so there is rapid and steady heat and  no live coals to be disposed of later.  </P> <P> So far, he said, gas grills are found most frequently in the Northeast.  Californians seem to prefer charcoal barbecuing -- especially the new,  easy-lighting varieties. And some time-pressed chefs in the Midwest are  experimenting with use of microwave ovens to precook whole fowl and large  roasts to be finished over charcoal just before eating.  </P> <P> Regional differences are apparent in menu selection, as well. Cooks in the  South and Southwest, for example, favor more highly spiced sauces and smoke  flavorings, and they usually grill the plentiful and inexpensive chickens that  the region produces, according to a consumer survey conducted for the Barbecue  Industry Assn. Northeasterners, on the other hand, want their cooking  "straight," Californians are experimenters, and coastal residents, not  surprisingly, grill more fish than do other regional chefs, with salmon  particularly favored in the Pacific Northwest. Beef, pork and sausages are  popular fare in the Midwest.  </P> <P> Overall, beef remains the leading picnic menu staple, Seeds said, though the  national trend toward eating lighter and whiter (in terms of meat) is beginning  to show up in outdoor cooking as well.  </P> <P> "People are looking for ways to cut calories," he said, "and we try to sell  them on doing that by cooking on the grill because the fat will drip out of the  food. And people are cooking leaner cuts."  </P></p>

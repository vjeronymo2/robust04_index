			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Tamara Zamyatina report in the "Nuances" column: "Filatov </F> and Ilyushin Vie for Influence in the Kremlin in a Bid To Reform  the Presidential Administration in Their Style"]    [Text] As it transpired on 12 December, the presidential  administration machine -- three analytical centers under the  president, the State Legal Directorate, the Directorate for  Liaison with the Territories, the Presidential Council, and a  host of aides and advisers -- failed either to analyze the  voters' mood in the run-up to the elections, to predict the  outcome of the campaign, or more or less coherently and promptly  to sum up the results of the voting.    The skidding of the "analytical machine" became so obvious  that two parallel projects for reforming the presidential  apparatus were born in the Kremlin simultaneously.    One is being developed by deputy administration chief Sergey  Krasavchenko. Its essence, according to Sergey Filatov,  consists in that the three analytical centers under the  president, headed by Nikolay Malyshev, Anatoliy Rakitov and Petr  Filippov, will be reorganized as a single expert-analytical  center. This center or expert council should concentrate all  analytical information coming in from various research  structures and work out recommendations for the president, the  government, and leaders of the Russian regions. Each expert will  be responsible for a particular area of activity and have a  corresponding working group assigned to him.    In spite of its obvious symmetry, this system does not root  out the isolation of the presidential administrative structures:  Along with the expert-analytical council, the corps of advisers  and various directorates under the president will remain.  Duplication is inevitable.    The other plan for reforming the administration is being  devised by independent experts from among the Presidential  Council members. It rules out the horizontal subdivision of  structures within the administration. This is a classic  hierarchic scheme whereby the head of the "pyramid" will have  several deputies with the rank of presidential aides. In their  turn the deputies will have mid-level analyst personnel  subordinated to them while the latter will rely on working  groups supplying "raw material" and providing preliminary  information analysis.    In fact, however, competition is unfolding not so much  between two concepts as between two figures. Journalists who  are at home in the Kremlin corridors of power know very well  that there are two competing camps in the presidential  apparatus. These are the administration headed by Sergey  Filatov, and a staff of experts/analysts headed by Viktor  Ilyushin, the president's closest aide and chief of his personal  office, and who was also Boris Yeltsin's associate in Sverdlov  party structures. Viktor Ilyushin is apparently the most  "tight-lipped" [zastegnutyy] man in the presidential apparatus,  and the most influential.    Mr. Ilyushin tends to favor the second scheme, whose essence  lies in building a single "pyramid" of the presidential  apparatus with himself sitting at its top.    Strictly speaking, neither Mr. Ilyushin nor Mr. Filatov are  analysts. They substantially differ in the extent of openness  in politics -- openness, the need for which was highlighted by  President Yeltsin at his post-election press conference. Viktor  Ilyushin has perfect command of the apparatus situation but, as  journalists already know, with his style of work the  "presidential court" will be fenced off by a solid wall of  silence and secrecy.    Sergey Filatov's rejection of a deputy's chair in the State  Duma rather signifies his intention to head the drive to reform  the administration. According to some reports, reorganization  will apparently follow the scheme proposed by him. Boris  Yeltsin, too, will hardly decline his good offices and  charismatic image.</p>

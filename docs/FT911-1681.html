			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Scotland lays plans for business: The issues facing the new enterprise bodies MR Crawford Beveridge is the latest government appointee to wrestle with the 'Scottish phenomenon' - the fact that Scots run big businesses the world over, not least in England, while in the home country entrepreneurship is sluggish. Mr Beveridge is an example of the phenomenon. He is also the man responsible for the machinery that could tackle it. He was born 44 years ago in Edinburgh and has spent most of his working life abroad in senior managerial jobs with US electronics companies. Recently he returned to Scotland from California, where he worked for Sun Microsystems, the computer workstation maker which has expanded greatly since its creation in 1982. Mr Beveridge is chief executive of Scottish Enterprise (SE), the new body that has taken over from the Scottish Development Agency and the Training Agency to run business development and training in Scotland. Many of its powers are in the hands of 13 local enterprise companies (Lecs), the Scottish equivalent of the training and enterprise councils (Tecs) in England. True, SE operates from the old Glasgow offices of the SDA but the similarities end there. Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, eager to encourage the Lecs with their private sector boards, and anxious to compensate them for big cuts in training funds this year by the Department of Employment, has urged SE to allocate as much as possible of its budget to the Lecs. SE gave all but 17 per cent of its Pounds 430m budget to the Lecs and admits it has left itself rather short. 'It leaves us at some risk,' Mr Beveridge says. SE dispenses money to the Lecs and authorises how they spend it. It also still has the strategic development responsibilities of the old SDA, such as attracting inward investment through the Locate in Scotland bureau, planning industry-wide initiatives and handling large property and environmental improvement projects. Whereas the Lecs drafted their business plans last autumn, SE is still working on its own first-year plan. 'We'll be OK for money on Locate in Scotland but short on property and environment, as well as on development finance for investing in companies,' Mr Beveridge says. He points out that recession is reducing investment opportunities of all kinds, and so far the SE core staff is between 60 and 70 below its theoretical strength of 430, because SDA staff have left or moved out to Lecs while some civil servants from the Training Agency have refused to join. Morale is said to be low. Mr Beveridge does not believe that the Lecs will be able to spend all the money allocated. Several are starting from scratch, and in recessionary times projects involving the private sector tend to be slow to go ahead. He will review the Lecs' spending progress each quarter. Mindful that the Treasury requires official bodies to spend their budgets within the financial year, he will then 'enter negotiations with them' - the Lecs are independent companies - 'to move money around to where it is most likely to be spent,' including the SE core. In Inverness, Highlands and Islands Enterprise has succeeded the Highlands and Islands Development Board and has a smaller-scale structure similar to Scottish Enterprise, with nine Lecs scattered from Shetland to Argyll. Much more power has been retained at the core here. A veteran of the HIDB says: 'Our Lecs are very small and inexperienced and they need a lot of help from us.' The Scottish Office makes Highland Lecs obtain authorisation from HIE if they wish to spend more than Pounds 15,000, whereas the limit for SE's Lecs is Pounds 250,000. Mr Iain Robertson, the 40-year-old new chief executive, another expatriate Scot who saw an advertisement for his new job in the Financial Times while working for British Petroleum in Cleveland, Ohio, wants his Lecs to have more independence. 'The whole point of the change is to put power into the hands of the communities so that they can no longer say: 'No one ever asked us, the decisions are taken in Inverness or Edinburgh.' I'm determined the Lecs will get more autonomy as things go on.' Still, he admits that only about 25 per cent of HIE's budget is initially going to Lecs, although further allocations are being held in reserve. Most of the HIDB staff have transferred to HIE, including Mr Robertson's predecessor, so the shake-up has been less traumatic than at SE. Others say the old guard from the HIDB have dug themselves in to preserve centralisation. HIE has already drawn up its strategic plan, which recognises that the population of the Highlands is rising for the first time for a century and that the big development projects of the past, such as an aluminium smelter at Invergordon, near Inverness, survived for only a few years, leaving high unemployment. 'People are coming back and we've got to provide jobs for their children that are in tune with the place,' says Mr Robertson, looking at small-scale industry, tourism and fish farming. Back at SE, Mr Beveridge's preoccupations are with strengthening indigenous business and developing a long-term strategy. 'There is much more indigenous business going on here in Scotland than I thought there was looking from outside,' he says. 'And there's a fantastic number of smart people. 'But there are no Sun-sized new Scottish companies,' he says, referring to his California days. 'And the boundaries of the ambitions of the small companies often seem to stop at Carlisle. Not many have a world view, or even an EC view. Something stops them from having these worldwide ambitions.' Then there is his worry about what Scotland will develop or import to replace the current wave of high-technology industries that have successfully replaced the old industrial economy of coal, shipbuilding and steel. He envisages assembling a think tank to help to devise a plan. Is Scottish Enterprise the answer to Scotland's economic worries? 'There will be time to look back and see if this was a sensible idea, but not for about two years,' he says.</p>

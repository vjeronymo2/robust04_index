			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The leader of the Venda, South African homeland, has  a new job. Brigadier Gabriel Ramushwana is to become commander  of the new South African National Peacekeeping Force. He was  apparently a compromise candidate, and it could be a thankless  job, with so many valuables to contend with in a South Africa in  the midst of change. On the line to Venda, Jeremy Skeet asked  Brigadier Ramushwana whether he was surprised to get the job.    [Begin recording] [Ramushwana] Oh yes, I was really  surprised. That came from the blue really, I couldn't believe  it.    [Skeet] How do you see your role in this position?    [Ramushwana] Well, I believe my role will be to, you know,  create peace, to bring about peace within the South African  region, and also to try, you know, to bridge differences that  are there between political parties, followers, and so forth,  and then also encourage the people to respect one another and to  accept one another, as well as maintaining peace amongst  themselves.    [Skeet] Do you think you are the right man for this? You did  lead a bloodless coup to take control of Venda. Do you think  you are the right man for this?    [Ramushwana] Well, maybe the people thought I was the right  guy. For myself, I would say maybe I am. From the records,  yes, in as far as this region is concerned, specially Venda as  such, I took over in 1990, and I tried everything I could to  bring the people together, to bring the warring factions  together, and I also tried to do away with violence.  Eventually, I succeeded. We are the most peaceful group of  people within southern Africa today.    [Skeet] Now, one of the conditions when you become leader of  this national peacekeeping force is that you have to give up  your present job, which is ruler of Venda. Are you prepared to  do this?    [Ramushwana] Oh yes, I am prepared to do this. Today I have  been discussing with my Military Council regarding this issue,  and we are almost about to finalize everything. I could step  down by the end of the month, but I will still remain the chief  of Venda Defense Force. We will be seconded to the South  African Transitional Executive Council.    [Skeet] And will you transfer power to someone else, or will  you just dissolve Venda?    [Ramushwana] No, no, no. What I will do is, seeing that the  period is so short from now to the elections, I think it will be  appropriate for me if I had to ask someone to take over from me  and then continue up to after the elections.    [Skeet] Now, you are also on the ANC [African National  Congress] list of potential candidates for the elections. Now,  you taking this position means you will have to give up any  political ambitions you have.    [Ramushwana] Yes, I have already, you know, resigned or,  shall I say, asked them to remove my name from the list in order  to be able to do my job properly.    [Skeet] So, after the elections, do you see your role within  the new South African Defense Force?    [Ramushwana] Oh yes, the National Peacekeeping Force will  obviously be part and parcel of the new South African Defense  Force.</p>

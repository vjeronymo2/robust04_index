			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Wilson Bowden seeks Pounds 57m to acquire land WILSON BOWDEN yesterday became the sixth UK housebuilder this year to announce a rights issue. It is raising Pounds 57.1m to buy land to take advantage of the housing market recovery. This will take the total raised by housebuilders to Pounds 470m in the first 10 months of the year. This includes Pounds 215m from Tarmac and Pounds 104m from Wimpey. Four of the companies, Wilson Bowden, Countryside Properties, Berkeley Group and Bellway, also had rights issues in 1991. In its latest offer, Wilson Bowden is inviting shareholders to buy one new share at 375p for every five shares already held. The company's share price slid by 8p to 439p following the announcement. The family interests of Mr David Wilson, chairman, which own 57.5 per cent have placed their nil paid rights at 32.2p a share which will reduce their holdings to 48.6 per cent. The latest offer price is only 15p more than the 1991 rights price of 360p, when the company raised Pounds 34.1m in a 1-for-7 issue. Since then the company has raised output from 1,300 homes a year to about 1,800 this year. The number of housing plots it owns that are available for development has also risen, from 8,000 to more than 10,000. Mr Wilson said the company planned to increase output to 2,500 homes a year by 1995-96. The rights issue cash would be used to help fund the expansion. In particular, the company wanted 'to take advantage of Pounds 30m of land buying opportunities already identified'. It was becoming increasingly difficult to win planning permissions for building and therefore opportunities to acquire development land should not be missed. Mr Wilson said: 'Although economic recovery in the UK remains hesitant, positive features are beginning to appear in the housing market.' The company had completed 1,471 homes in the first 10 months of this year compared with 1,060 at the corresponding stage last year - a rise of 39 per cent. After allowing for first time gains from new sites the underlying volume sales improvement was probably between 15 to 20 per cent, said Mr Wilson. He added that new house prices had stopped falling, although they had still to start rising. The group was operating from 77 housing sites in 25 English counties and sales outside its East Midlands base now accounted for half of all housebuilding profits. The company intends to recommend a final net dividend of 6.65p making a total for this year of 9.3p, an increase of 6.3 per cent. The rights issue has been underwritten by Schroders and brokers are James Capel. COMMENT That Wilson Bowden shareholders will most likely take up their rights on a slim 15 per cent discount to an ex-rights price of 433p illustrates the strength of a company which has consistently out-performed the sector. Its strength is its long land bank which is about to grow again. The cash call, given gearing is under 25 per cent, may be a little opportunistic but the money, as in the 1991 rights, will be used to buy assets rather than simply strengthen balance sheets as housebuilders did two years ago. Pre-tax profits this year including a Pounds 5m pension fund credit should be about Pounds 30m. The company deserves its reputation as one of the best in the sector.  ----------------------------------- HOUSING RIGHTS ISSUES SO FAR IN 1993  ----------------------------------- Company          Pounds m      Date  ----------------------------------- Wilson Bowden        57.1     Nov 4 Tarmac              215     Sept 21 Wimpey              104     June 10 Countryside          16.8    May 26 Berkeley             44.1   March 4 Bellway              33.6    Feb 18  -----------------------------------</p>

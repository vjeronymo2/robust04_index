			<p>BFN     [Text] President Zhelev invited ex-Deputy Prime Minister  Valentin Karabashev, in his capacity as an expert on  privatization, to give his views on the amendments to the  Privatization Act that the National Assembly passed. Karabashev  advised Dr. Zhelev to return the law to the National Assembly  for further drafting because the approved changes contain a  number of imperfections. He voiced serious objections  concerning the chapter on mass privatization.    After his meeting with President Zhelev, Valentin Karabashev  declared that he is optimistic that the existing imperfections  in the law can be removed when parliament reconsiders it.</p>

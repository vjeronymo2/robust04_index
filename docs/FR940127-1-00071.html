			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. The Problem_Confidentiality of Reporters' Identities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA believes that its success in encouraging health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professionals to participate in the voluntary adverse event  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting system depends substantially on the guarantee of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confidentiality given the identity of the reporter under FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations (&sect;&sect;20.111(c)(3), 314.430(e)(4), 601.51(e)(3), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 803.9(b)). When FDA receives a request from the public for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse reaction reports submitted voluntarily by health care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professionals, consumers, patients, or manufacturers, FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations require public disclosure of those reports only after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deletion of the following: (1) The names and any information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would identify the person using the product, and (2) the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> names and any information that would identify any third party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved with the report, such as a physician, hospital, or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution (&sect;20.111).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rationale for this policy was first articulated in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of December 24, 1974, in the preamble to FDA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public information regulations. At that time, FDA determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that without a guarantee of confidentiality, ``the possibility of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persuading health professionals voluntarily to submit adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reaction information is substantially diminished, and indeed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perhaps wholly destroyed'' (39 FR 44602 at 44616).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the SMDA amendments, Congress provided some additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection from involvement in private civil lawsuits to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physicians who submit voluntary reports concerning adverse device  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> events. Section 519(b)(3) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360i(b)(3)),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> added by the SMDA, provides that:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [n]o report made under [the device user  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility requirements] by a physician who is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not required to make such a report, shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admissible into evidence or otherwise used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any action involving private parties unless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility, individual, or physician who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made the report had knowledge of the falsity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the information contained in the report.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Congress enacted this provision to encourage private physicians  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to notify FDA or the manufacturer of device problems (H. Rept.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 808, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 21 (1990)). This provision, however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may not be sufficient to prevent manufacturers from being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compelled to release the reporters' or patients' identities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to a discovery order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The policy and program considerations underlying the need to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protect patient and reporter confidentiality have become even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more compelling in recent years. The increase in product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability and medical malpractice litigation has heightened the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reluctance of health professionals to report events observed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> them if they are not given meaningful promises of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confidentiality. In addition, the potential for discrimination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> connected with a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive status or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has strengthened the commitment of health care professionals to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protect patient privacy. As a direct reflection of FDA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longstanding regulations and commitment to this policy, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's MEDWATCH form (and its predecessors) expressly states  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the information identifying the patient and reporter is held  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in confidence (see 58 FR 31611 through 31612, June 3, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, in connection with FDA's current efforts to promote  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the MEDWATCH program and to increase reporting of serious adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> events, the health care community has voiced concerns about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's ability to safeguard confidentiality and protect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identities of the reporter and patient identified in the report,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> especially in situations where the report is in the possession of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an individual manufacturer. Despite FDA's longstanding policy of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> keeping these identities confidential, the current concerns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threaten to undermine the success of the voluntary reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA published its draft uniform MEDWATCH form for reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspect adverse events and product problems on February 26, 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (58 FR 11768). Subsequently, the agency received several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments about FDA's ability to maintain the confidentiality of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patient and reporter identities: (1) When the report of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse event is made directly to the manufacturer or (2) when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the manufacturer receives the information from FDA after a report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is made to the agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The MEDWATCH form permits individuals reporting directly to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the agency to indicate that they do not want their identity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disclosed to the manufacturer. However, the agency encourages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporters to allow the agency to share the reporter's identity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the manufacturer in order to help FDA and the manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conduct necessary followup. Currently, State and local laws  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> govern disclosure of information from adverse event report forms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are in the possession of manufacturers, whether the reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> come directly to the manufacturer from reporters or are relayed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to manufacturers by FDA. Some State and local laws allow or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require disclosure of identities of reporters and patients in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse event reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

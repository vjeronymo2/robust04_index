			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung] </F>   [Text] Tarnished by planning chaos, Shenzhen has vowed to  improve long-term city planning and turn the border city into a  regional "cosmopolis". Shenzhen's Communist Party chief, Li  Youwei said planning should have the aim of turning the city  into a metropolis. "We have to take into account the  convergence of the city with the neighbouring regions," he said.  He was addressing a municipal conference on city planning and  management last week.    Mr Li said the Shenzhen planned to increase ties with Hong  Kong to help elevate it into another "little dragon" in the  Asia-Pacific region. However, the lack of planning and  supervision over city management in the 16-year-old Special  Economic Zone had resulted in chronic problems such as  industrial hazards and backward infrastructure facilities.  According to the SHENZHEN SPECIAL ZONE DAILY, Mr Li urged  municipal officials to try to "converge with Hong Kong and adopt  international practices" when mapping out the city plans and  management regulations. He said: "We should establish a new  city concept under which the economies of Shenzhen and Hong Kong  will be integrated." Mr Li, also the municipal Mayor, said the  Special Economic Zone should be integrated also with the Pearl  River Delta region. He called for innovative thought in  planning developments, and successful experience to be borrowed  from the mainland and abroad.    Mr Li said the "authority" of city planning should be  upheld,  saying the city would oppose sternly any "anarchism and  separatism" and violations of laws. Any violators of laws must  be severely dealt with, he said. To strengthen leadership in  city planning, regulations should establish the task of  planning, construction and supervision in development.    Vice-mayor Li Chuan-fang called for infrastructure planning  and relevant reforms to be speeded up to help the social and  economic development of the country. He said also municipal  authorities would clamp down on malpractice such as unlawful  occupation of land and change of land use.    According to the China News Service, the Shenzhen  authorities  will adopt a series of measures to improve traffic problems.  Traffic lights at 118 road junctions will be automated and  traffic flow at major roads and the first and second borders of  the city will be monitored by closed-circuit television, the  report said. New buildings must have their own car parks, and  vehicle buyers will be required to produce proof of purchase of  a parking lot. Vehicles from outside the city which will be  used in the region for more than three months will have to be  licensed. Mini-bus numbers will be curbed, and mass-transport  facilities, such as buses, will be given priority on roads, it  said.</p>

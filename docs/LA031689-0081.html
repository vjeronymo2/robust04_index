			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MINUTEMAN TECH;  </P> <P> ONE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL THAT REALLY WORKS  </P> <P> Minuteman Tech, a regional, vocational-technical high school in the western  Boston suburb of Lexington, is a far cry from the old image of a vocational  high school.  </P> <P> Minuteman looks more like a high-tech office park than a school. Here, in a  futuristic brick and glass building, is a small city of real-life businesses  providing students with work skills: two student-run restaurants (one serving  grilled salmon with hollandaise), hair salon, fully equipped garage, child-care  center, gift shop and bakery.  </P> <P> Out on the school grounds, students hammer pink insulation into a  state-of-the-art model house.  </P> <P> Minuteman is where David Healy went after his disastrous high school  experience. "It gave me confidence," he says. Healy entered Minuteman as a  postgraduate adult student and did a straight 2-year vocational program. He's  now working on his bachelor of arts and teaching there two nights a week.  </P> <P> "Many of the students in the neglected majority are just as bright, but they  learn in a different way," says James Amara, science department head at  Minuteman. "They're hands-on learners, not book learners." He says Minuteman  presents information in three forms: visual, auditory, and hands-on.  </P> <P> The school, which opened its doors in 1974, has 850 students (including adults)  who come from 16 towns in the district. Tuition-paying students come from  another 15 towns. The school turns out engineers, hotel managers, printers,  beauty salon owners, day-care operators, commercial artists, plumbers, and  more. Some of the school's tech-prep students have gone on to Massachusetts  Institute of Technology, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Purdue  University.  </P> <P> In addition to getting state support, the school goes after grants and is  promoting links with local industry. And there's an eager world of work out  there ready to snatch up grads.  </P> <P> "There are five to six part-time jobs waiting for every student in the culinary  field," the assistant superintendent says. And an auto mechanics teacher says,  "One grad started working at a car dealership. It wasn't 6 months and the boss  is having him do all the trouble jobs and asking me, 'Got any more like him?' "  </P></p>

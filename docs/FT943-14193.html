			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Sales rise 16% at Schering Schering, the Berlin-based pharmaceuticals group, said turnover in the first half of 1994 had risen 16 per cent over the same period a year ago and would be 12 per cent higher for the year as a whole, totalling DM4.6bn (Dollars 2.82bn) However, Mr Giuseppe Vita, chief executive, warned that the company would have to double its present 5 per cent profit margin over the next five years if it was to keep abreast of its US competitors. The improved turnover was due partly to a strong yen but mainly reflected better sales across a range of pharmaceutical products, including contraceptive pills and Betaseron, the first effective treatment for multiple sclerosis. The company, which is now focused exclusively on pharmaceuticals following the sale of its agrochemicals division, gave no details about profits so far this year. Full results for the first six months would be released at the beginning of August, the company said. The group said earlier this year that first-quarter earnings had risen 2 per cent to DM124m and forecast that earnings for the year would match last time's DM254m, 3 per cent down on the year before. In the first two months of 1993, turnover had risen by 21 per cent over the year before but the company said this jump was relative to low sales in the same period in 1993, when health reforms in Germany had dented sales. Continued uncertainty about health reforms in various countries, including the US, would put pressure on pharmaceuticals producers, but 1994 sales of Betaseron would reach the DM300m already forecast, the company said. Schering's turnover totalled DM5.36bn last year but this included the agrochemicals division, which was put into a 40/60 joint venture with Hoechst, the German chemicals group, at the beginning of this year. The improved 1994 turnover forecast is based solely on sales of pharmaceutical products.</p>

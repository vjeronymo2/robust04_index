			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Lasmo Lasmo is putting a brave face on it, but there is no disguising its distress at the current oil price. Without its Pounds 13m exceptional provision release, operating profit would have been flat in the first half. Since then the oil price has fallen further. Lasmo prefers to look at cash flow, since its profits are depressed by the high depreciation charge on assets - such as Piper - for which it overpaid in the past. Even on this basis, though, it looks squeezed. Its projections assume an oil price around Dollars 19 next year. If the price stays around Dollars 16, cash flow will suffer to the tune of around Pounds 60m, equivalent to its entire exploration budget for next year. There is little scope for further savings, but it is hard to believe Lasmo would be prepared instead to jeopardise its future by abandoning the search for replacement assets. A more rational approach, if the going remains tough, would be to recapitalise with a rights issue that would allow expensive older assets to be sold off at a loss. Doubtless Lasmo hopes it will not come to that - not least because its promise to maintain a dividend it cannot really afford would then look doubly rash.</p>

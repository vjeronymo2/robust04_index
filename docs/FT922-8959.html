			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Business Air Travel (8): Market where the sky is the limit - Asia-Pacific THE Asia-Pacific air travel market offers the world's most promising growth prospects for the 1990s, with passenger demand forecast to increase at nearly double-digit rates annually into the next century. As industry deregulation edges along, a fierce dogfight is already shaping up, particularly for lucrative first and business class travellers. Not surprisingly, regional carriers are focusing the same high-quality, low-overhead strategies on air travel that have made Asia-Pacific competitors so formidable in many other industries. 'This region has the best growth potential in the world based on its economic prospects,' says Mr Philip Mok, head of research at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities in Hong Kong. Demand for air travel will increase about 8 per cent annually over the next few years, he predicts. South-east Asian carriers are particularly well positioned to expand rapidly, backed by surging economies and reputations for some of the world's best inflight service. Among the leaders are Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific, Thai Airways International and Singapore Airlines (SIA) - already one of the island state's leading enterprises. Flag carriers from other industrialising nations, including Malaysia Airlines and Garuda Indonesia, are also keen to capitalise on growing business and tourist travel. To the north, Korean Air has carved out an impressive niche, flying between the homeland, North America and neighbouring Japan. Industry observers see the region's economic superpower as the fulcrum for Asia-Pacific business air travel, because of the size and growth potential of Japan's market and its geographical suitability to act as a hub for onward travel from south-east Asia to Europe and North America. Unfortunately, Japanese business travellers have been slow to return since the Gulf War knocked them from the skies, partly because of the current economic slowdown at home. 'We've noticed quite a few Japanese companies since the Gulf War have suffered financially and downgraded executives formerly entitled to a higher class of travel,' says Mr Shiro Shibuya, SIA's manager of industry affairs and public relations in Tokyo. 'Still, we hope business on Japanese routes will grow faster than elsewhere.' The near-term prospects are not bright, says Mr Takeharu Iwata, vice-president of Japan Airlines (JAL), the world's seventh largest carrier in 1990. 'We cannot expect a big improvement to 1989 levels for at least another year or year and a half,' he says. Far from threatening to dominate Asia-Pacific skies, as they have many other regional markets, Japanese rivals will do well just to hang onto their already dwindling market share, industry observers say. 'The way the Japanese achieved their position in many industries was to get in with low prices, aim for market share and slowly build up. But airlines operate on bilateral agreements, so you can't get market share without offering the other party monetary rewards or a similar share,' says Mr Mok. 'There is very little room left' to win away customers with service superior to that of foreign rivals, concedes JAL's Mr Iwata. Incursions into their home airspace by low-overhead carriers are already costing Japanese airlines dearly. Foreign airlines increased their share of international passenger traffic to and from Japan by 1.9 percentage points to 65.1 per cent in the two years through 1990 alone as the annual number of travellers on these routes topped 30m. Japanese airlines must vie with expenses roughly double those for south-east Asian rivals, says JAL's Mr Iwata. 'The Ministry of Transportation must to some extent protect Japanese carriers, but it is also forcing us to compete following the tendency of the US,' he says. 'We do not have a pricing or merchandising advantage, but I think we can maintain the business travel share we now have by introducing new aspects of services and flight schedules.' In early April, JAL launched a major advertising campaign to woo back Japanese business travellers with menu and other changes, but rapidly internationalising domestic rival All Nippon Airlines and especially foreign carriers are likely to continue gaining on the flag carrier. 'Business travel is the cream of airline operations. Our philosophy is to satisfy passengers to gain repeat business, not just offer cheap fares,' says SIA's Mr Shibuya. 'We don't mind using expensive champagne and other things if that's what it takes.' Such strategies combined with lower overhead ultimately could force Japanese airlines to hand over intra-Asian routes to subsidiaries which can take advantage of less costly foreign labour. Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific airlines are setting their sights on newly emerging routes within the region plus destinations much further afield. Close to home, the last several months have witnessed a rush of new services between second-tier Japanese cities such as Fukuoka and Hiroshima and international destinations, in part because no new slots are available at Tokyo and Osaka area terminals. Routes to Indochina also are increasing in number as political conditions improve and a rapidly rising flood of investors and tourists makes its way to Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. Demand for service to the Chinese mainland likewise is quickly expanding. South-east Asian airlines should fare well in competition to and from Europe and North America, argues Mr Mok. 'They have strong cash flows and money to buy new aircraft. Most are also efficiently run. I tend to be bullish on airlines in the region,' he says. The major bottleneck at present and future key to Asia-Pacific travel is Japan's acute shortage of airport capacity, which is already forcing airlines to shelve expansion plans. The New Kansai International Airport off the coast of Osaka will be the nation's first 24-hour facility when it opens in mid-1994, about 15 months behind schedule. A survey earlier this year reflected just how far available terminal space lags demand in reporting that carriers now seek twice the facilities planned in Osaka to accommodate 160,000 arrivals and departures annually. Along with major expansion projects at the Narita and Haneda terminals serving Tokyo, Japanese air traffic capacity should roughly double by 1995. The expanded capacity will add severe price competition to the already troubled Japanese carriers' list of woes, enabling new rivals to enter the market and established foreign airlines to increase service. US carriers have already carved out large markets to Japan and beyond with the help of giant feeder systems back home and politically sensitive international agreements that provide them abundant terminal access. However, even with Japan's new terminals in service, capacity shortages will dampen traffic growth for years. That could be good news for airport projects elsewhere in the region, including South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore, which are seeking some of the hub-terminal activity that has benefited many North American cities.</p>

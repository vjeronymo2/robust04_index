			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Bush seems the lesser evil to US growers - Fear of runaway environmentalism is likely to outweigh dissatisfaction with the president VIRGINIAN CROP farmers are generally speaking rather 'laid back'; at least they are when they discuss the size of their crops. They become quite animated when they turn to sport but I was not in the US last week to talk about ball games. All of the farmers I visited were busy combine harvesting corn, or maize as we call it in the UK. Most crops were yielding exceptionally well and even my most reticent hosts admitted to bringing in more than five tonnes an acre (12.5 tonnes a hectare). But the only sign of satisfaction was the occasional lazy smile followed by a remark to the effect that the big crops were causing storage problems. These are the kinds of problems farmers dream about, and it was as clear as the leaves on the trees that cloak the slopes of the magnificent Shenandoah that those who farmed the land between them were moderately optimistic, in spite of the troubled US economy. Harvest has not been as good across the whole of the US, however. Some dry-land wheat areas once again had severe drought conditions during a crucial period in the growing season and crops in those states were disappointing. The total US yield of what this year has, in fact, been estimated at about the same as last year's and carryover stocks remain tight. It was announced some time ago that there would be no land set-aside requirement for US wheat growers in 1993. American maize, on the other hand, seems set to yield 30m to 35m tonnes more than last year at 220m to 225m tonnes and stocks will be increased significantly. In spite of this some US grain exporters pleaded with Mr Ed Madigan, the agriculture secretary, of not to impose set-aside on the crop next year on the grounds that world demand would increase and reduced production would inhibit their ability to export. Mr Madigan ignored their requests and a few days ago announced that to qualify for loan rate subsidies in 1993 US farmers will have to set-aside 10 per cent of their maize acreage. As well as cutting supplies, of course, the move will also harden prices, which may not be entirely divorced from the coming presidential election and, if the opinion polls are accurate, the somewhat desperate requirement of President George Bush for all the farm votes he can get. Traditionally most farmers do vote Republican. But along with the rest of the electorate the sector has recently become disillusioned with the president' s apparent inability to control the economy. They are even more fed up, however, with the mass of petty, expensive, environmental regulations sent down from Washington recently and there have been rumblings of discontent in rural areas. Mr Bush's response has been to launch a beefed-up Export Enhancement Program for US grain, which will effectively dump almost 30m tonnes on to world markets. Quite how this fits in with US ambitions to get a quick settlement on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, also for electoral reasons, is not entirely clear. The cost to the US treasury, incidentally, will be around Dollars 1bn. In addition the president has overturned the recommendations of his Environmental Protection Agency by backing farmers' calls for ethanol, an extender or replacement for petrol manufacture from either grain or sugar, to be encouraged as a 'green' alternative to fossil fuel. The agency had said that ethanol, while being lead free and therefore desirable from that viewpoint, could cause air pollution because of other chemicals in its make-up if used in large conurbations. By personally approving this alternative market for farm crops the president has shown that he takes US farmers seriously even though they account for only about 2 per cent of the electorate. But would many farmers have voted for Bill Clinton or Ross Perot anyway? A poll of farmers conducted by Farm Futures magazine before most of the above measures were announced indicated that 53 per cent favoured Mr Bush, 32 per cent would vote for Mr Clinton and 15 per cent were undecided. At the time it was not clear whether or not Mr Perot was intending to run. And while there is little enthusiasm on farms, even after the recent financial sweeteners, for four more years under Mr Bush, there is a real fear that a Clinton-Gore administration would make life more difficult for farmers. For although Mr Clinton has said very little about agriculture during his campaign, and even less in his policy proposals, it is expected, should he win, that Al Gore, his running mate, will be put in charge of the environment. That, farmers believe, will lead to even more regulations and interference in their affairs, which they detest. For Al Gore is seen as a loony leftist on the environment. His views were expressed in a book first published a couple of years ago, entitled Earth in the Balance. It has been described by Mr Fred Smith of the US Competitive Enterprise Institute as 'a kind of Mein Kampf of the environment movement'. In his book Gore said, for instance that 'the time has long since come to take more political risks - and endure much more political criticism - by proposing tougher, more effective solutions (to perceived environmental problems) and fighting hard for their enactment'. He wrote of 'our ecological system crumbling as it suffers a powerful collision with the hard surfaces of a civilisation speeding towards it out of control'. The book contained much more in like vein and as the Clinton-Gore bandwagon has rolled onward and upward it has entered the best seller lists across the US. Many copies have undoubtedly been bought by farmers who now fear that they may be easy targets for extremist environmental protection measures by a new Democratic presidency. But one farmer summed up the more general feelings of many when he told me: 'I'm fed up with Bush; I don't trust Clinton and Perot is a joke. To tell the truth I'd rather abstain. But I guess on the day I'll hold my nose and vote for Bush'. If the opinion polls are even close to being right that will not make much difference. 'Slick Willy' Clinton will become president. But only one poll counts and that's the one on November 3. And as an American television presenter said the other evening: 'It ain't over till the fat lady votes'.</p>

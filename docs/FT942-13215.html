			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / UK Company News: Losses narrow to Pounds 2.13m at How How Group, the engineering maintenance and distribution company, announced lower pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.13m for 1993, compared with Pounds 2.28m. Mr Peter How, chairman, said the group continued to encounter difficult trading conditions. Cost reduction and improved efficiency helped reduce operating losses to Pounds 480,000 (Pounds 650,000) on turnover of Pounds 133.4m (Pounds 135.7m). The pre-tax figure included a deficit of Pounds 1.65m (Pounds 4.32m) from discontinued operations and reorganisation costs of Pounds 760,000. Mr How said the flurry of new enquiries and orders in the opening half lost impetus in the second six months. However, they have started strongly this year and there is reasonable expectation of this being maintained. The group ended the year ungeared, with an improved net cash position and substantially reduced bad debts. Losses per share were 3.61p (3.96p), or 0.86p (3.3p earnings) from continuing operations. Following a reduced final of 0.375p the total dividend is halved to 0.75p.</p>

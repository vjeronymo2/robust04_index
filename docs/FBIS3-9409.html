It has been anticipated for a long  time, and there is good reason for it. However, it will not be  the arguments that will decide on this. This is how Defense  Minister Janez Jansa assessed the rumors about an interpellation  over the Smolnikar case. We can agree with everything except  the minister's last statement.    In an interview with our radio station he himself admitted  that the preliminary results of the internal investigation have  shown that some things are controversial, namely the  justification of the use of force and incursion into a personal  vehicle by camouflaged special brigade soldiers, and the time  that elapsed between the detention of a civilian, his  transportation to the ministry, and the police being informed.    However, the essence of the problem lies elsewhere: in the  army's interference in the civilian sphere and the understanding  of a rule-of-law state, regardless of what the civilian in  question might have done. This is another story to which there  will be an epilogue, if the accusations are true.    According to information so far, there is no justification  for the behavior of the Interior Ministry members. The minister  himself made the biggest mistake here because he did not take  steps against his subordinates by at least temporarily  suspending them until the completion of the inquiry,  particularly since this was not the first excess of this type  and it puts the entire army in a bad light.    Had we lived in a normal country, he himself would have  submitted his resignation and everybody would have viewed this  as an honorable act. At the end of the day, the government  might even have fallen because of Sunday's events. However, in  the heated political atmosphere with political clashes and  meetings constantly in the air, along with all sorts of mutual  suspicions, imputations, and tactical games, one cannot hope for  a rational approach. A normal political struggle has in  Slovenia transformed itself into a battle for new and final  victories. Everybody has now left the decision to the prime  minister.</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Island gains aid to refloat economy: James Buxton sees signs of hope in one of Scotland's worst unemployment blackspots Bute, an island in the Firth of Clyde which was once popular with holidaymakers but is now one of Scotland's worst unemployment blackspots, has been chosen as a base for a company which provides teleworking services. Telecom Service Centres will handle telephone inquiries and computer processing for businesses which deal with customers over the telephone. It aims to employ 70 people initially, rising to 150 in three years. TSC's decision to set up in Rothesay, Bute's only town, has been made possible by an initiative launched in 1989 to give the Highlands and Islands a digital telecommunications network earlier than most other parts of Britain. Highlands and Islands Enterprise, under chief executive Mr Iain Robertson, is providing Pounds 450,000 in assistance to the Pounds 2.5m project and building an Pounds 800,000 facility to house it. Winning the project is the first achievement of an Pounds 11.4m programme aimed at reversing the island's economic decline. Rothesay's Victorian seafront makes a fine initial impact as the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry approaches on its 30-minute journey from Wemyss Bay near Greenock. But ashore the impression is of tackiness and decay. A row of shops a few dozen yards from the pier is vacant. Many hotels need refurbishment. A cinema on the front has been shut for 20 years. There is a pleasant main square and an immaculate putting green with little palm trees, but not far away are sites where demolition was carried out in preparation for projects that never materialised. A taxi driver said: 'People go abroad for their holidays nowadays.' In the 1950s 400,000 people a year visited Rothesay, some to stay in the hotels and guest houses, others on day trips 'doon the watter' by steamer from Glasgow. Now the number is 100,000. The population has fallen to 7,000 from 12,000 in 1951 and unemployment is 16 per cent. Apart from tourism there is a printed circuit board assembly plant, a creamery and a small textiles factory. The three-year development strategy says: 'Business confidence is very low and is allied to a great deal of scepticism. Potential is constrained by a negative and pervasive factionalism.' That strategy, led by the Bute Partnership of local authorities and Argyll and the Islands Enterprise, involves reinvigorating businesses, creating new visitor attractions, upgrading hotels and regenerating the centre of Rothesay. Mr James McMillan, vice-chairman of Bute Partnership, acknowledged that a Pounds 30m plan for Bute launched in 1990 had fizzled out. But he added: 'To those who say this place is done - that is tripe and disheartening.' Why should TSC, formed by Scottish businessmen with a background in marketing and information technology, want to go to Bute? One reason is the ready availability of a well-educated labour force. Another is that Mr Lennie Moffat, the Paisley-born managing director, is attracted by the splendid scenery.</p>

			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BEARS' BAILEY PAYS DRUG FINE  </P> <P> Chicago Bears rookie running back Johnny Bailey paid an outstanding fine of  about $1,400 shortly after a prosecutor said he could go to jail.  </P> <P> Bailey had outstanding fines and fees of about $1,400 from a 1986 drug  conviction, Harris County Assistant Dist. Atty.  </P> <P> Bob Stabe said.  </P> <P> Bailey paid the fine Tuesday.  </P> <P> On Monday, Stabe told Bailey's attorney, Robert Bennett, that if Bailey didn't  appear in court by Friday, he would be arrested.  </P> <P> Although Bailey has paid the fine, Stabe said he is still due in court Aug. 31.  </P> <P> Bailey, college football's all-time leading rusher from Texas A&amp;I, also has  failed to report to a probation officer seven times in the past three years,  Stabe said.  </P> <P> Stabe said he does not anticipate having to revoke Bailey's probation.  </P> <P> He added that he will call Illinois authorities if he has to.  </P> <P> "If he's not here on the 31st, I'll not have any problem with having him  arrested," he said.  </P></p>

Gerry Adams, basking in his  new-found legitimacy, has been guest of honour on America's most  popular television chat shows and splashed across the front  pages of its newspapers. Naive interviewers have lobbed him  softball questions, permitting this master of blarney to tell  millions of impressionable Americans how his desire for peace is  being frustrated by the British.    Despite Britain's efforts to alert his interviewers to the  complexities of Northern Ireland, none has pressed Mr Adams on,  for example, the decades of IRA atrocities that have killed  hundreds of innocent civilians. John Alderdice, leader of the  Alliance party, did manage an on-air telephone call to Larry  King Live to counter the spiel of a man Mr King addressed  throughout as "Gerry," but ABC's Good Morning America refused to  let him take part.    "It's a propaganda triumph for Adams," groaned one British  official. "It's set back a true understanding of Northern  Ireland in America by 10 or 15 years." The British warned the  Clinton Administration that this would happen, and one or two  U.S. officials yesterday expressed dismay at Mr Adams's coup.  The chat-show hosts may have been naive, but not half as bad as  those in the White House who believed they could limit the Sinn  Fein leaders exposure by restricting him to a 25-mile radius of  Manhattan.    The British Government argued forcefully that it would be  quite wrong for the Administration to reward Mr Adams before he  had made a single genuine concession, and this was accepted by  the State and Justice Departments, House Speaker Thomas Foley  and the FBI, which has spent years combating Irish and other  terrorists.    Indeed, Sunday's White House statement announcing Mr Adams's  admittance was a model of disinformation. It said Janet Reno,  the Attorney General, had issued the order on the recommendation  of Warren Christopher, the Secretary of State -- the clear  suggestion being that these two senior cabinet secretaries  supported the President's decision. In fact, the White House  leaked it before Miss Reno had even been told.    By this time, even Sir Robin Renwick, the British ambassador  and a formidable behind-the-scenes operator, was unable to save  the situation. After a day of deliberation on Saturday, Mr  Clinton took a decision which reversed a 20-year American policy  and can be construed only as a slap in the face for America's  closest ally. He did so on the recommendation of the National  Security Council, which argued that now was the time to offer Mr  Adams a carrot, and under intense political pressure from a  galvanised Irish-American lobby.    Mr Clinton must also have known that his decision would be  seen as a rebuff to Britain and a propaganda victory for the  IRA. It would be going too far to suggest this was his revenge  for the Conservatives' support of President Bush in the 1992  campaign, but the inescapable conclusion is that he cares less  about Washington's relations with London than his predecessors.    The international relationships he most values are those  based on trade, not security, and on that score Britain rates  well below China, Japan and Germany.    But what really preoccupies Mr Clinton is domestic politics.  He had fences to mend with the powerful Irish-American lobby,  having last year backpedalled on his election promises to admit  Mr Adams and appoint a special envoy to Northern Ireland. The  pressure on him was spearheaded by Edward Kennedy and Daniel  Patrick Moynihan, chairmen respectively of the Senate labour and  finance committees, whose support for Mr Clinton's health-care  reform is critical. They were backed by 12 other senators and  27 congressmen, almost all Democrats from areas with sizeable  Irish communities. Thirty-two of them face re-election this  November.    Earlier this month, these congressmen all signed a letter  urging Mr Clinton to "facilitate the emerging dialogue as an  alternative to violence," and they sustained the pressure up to  the moment the decision was taken. They argued that a  concession to Mr Adams might strengthen his influence over IRA  hardliners opposed to the joint declaration, and that the  British Government had itself had recent contacts with Sinn Fein  and the IRA.    Early last week, British officials thought Mr Adams would  not  be admitted. They were not unduly alarmed even when the  Administration announced last Thursday that it is ordering its  Belfast diplomats to elicit Mr Adams's views on terrorism and  the Anglo-lrish peace initiative. They believed they had  reached an understanding that Mr Adams would only be let in if  he unequivocally renounced violence and supported the joint  declaration. What no one anticipated was that the White House  would instead interpret Mr Adams's weasel words as "constructive  comments warranting a visa."    John Major visits Washington later this month. He will  undoubtedly play down this unhappy episode. But there seems  little chance of the Prime Minister and Mr Clinton sitting down  in a Washington restaurant, as the President did with Germany's  Helmut Kohl this week, and jovially gobbling their way through a  hefty lunch like the best of friends.</p>

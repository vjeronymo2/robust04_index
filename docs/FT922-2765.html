			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of Belgium 92 (5): Transition proves difficult - Dick Leonard examines moves towards devolution between 1830 and 1980 - Belgium was perhaps the most over-centralised state in Europe. It was not considered a great success, at least during the latter part of this period. Now, Belgium is well on the way to becoming the most decentralised, although it is not there yet. The transition is proving difficult and it is far from certain that the process will be completed within the next couple of years, as the present government intends. The centralised system worked well enough in the 19th century, but only on the basis of a less-than-democratic constitution and the understanding that power would be monopolised by the French-speaking minority. The coming of universal suffrage for men in 1918 - women got the vote only 30 years later - meant that it was only a matter of time before the Dutch-speakers, who now make up 57 per cent of the population, would gain the upper hand. Thereafter, a large part of Belgian politics, and an even greater share of the emotional commitment, was devoted to pursuing the interests of the two language groups, with an astonishing array of checks and balances being built into the Belgian constitution. It was to little avail. The Dutch-speaking majority was too conscious of past slights to accept with good grace that, with growing prosperity in Flanders, they were now the top dogs both economically and politically - the last 11 governments have all been headed by Dutch-speakers - and could afford to be magnanimous. The French-speakers were only too aware of their minority status, and tended to be over-defensive. Mr Wilfried Martens, who ceased to be prime minster after 12 years last March, was the first senior Belgian politician to conclude that if the two language groups could not happily collaborate to run a centralised state, each of them should be left to run their own affairs, leaving only a minimal competence to the national government. He was the principal author of the Egmont Pact of 1977, which foresaw the creation of three self-governing regions of Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels. Unfortunately, the pact was never implemented and it was left to Mr Martens to introduce a more limited scheme of devolution when he became prime minister in 1979. This scheme, which came into effect in 1980, established only two regions - Flanders and Wallonia, leaving Brussels under central control. It also established three language communities, including one for the tiny German-speaking minority in eastern Belgium. The regions were given a long list of economic and social responsibilities, including planning, the environment, housing, water policy, the economy, energy, employment and supervision of local government. The language communities were endowed with a narrower range of responsibilities, comprising cultural affairs - language matters, museums, libraries, radio and television, youth policy, sport, tourism, adult education and scientific research - and personal health and welfare services. Each region and community was granted limited taxation powers and an indirectly-elected assembly. The Dutch-speaking community and the Flemish region voted immediately to combine, so that one Flemish assembly and one executive council was responsible for the powers granted to both authorities. No such amalgamation occurred on the French-speaking side, so that both Wallonia and the French-speaking community retained their separate identities. This experiment in partial devolution led to a marked lessening in tension between the two main language groups but failed to remove all the sources of conflict between them. The 1987 poll was brought about by a quarrel over the mayoralty of a tiny mixed-language commune on the Dutch border near Maastricht, known as the Fourons (Voeren in Dutch). This was the third time in 20 years that this commune, whose population is less than 4,500, had brought down a Belgian government and the conviction grew that it was time to reach a final settlement of all constitutional issues affected by the language issue. A three-stage programme of reform was drawn up by Mr Jean-luc Dehaene in 1988, as the basis for forming a new government and it was accepted by the leaders of all the five parties which joined the new left-centre coalition led by Mr Martens. The first two stages were enacted with surprising ease, securing the necessary two-thirds parliamentary majority. These respectively dealt with power-sharing in mixed-language communes, and with increasing the powers of the regional and community councils,including the establishment of a third region for Brussels, with its own directly-elected assembly. Education, previously under national control, was transfered to the language communities. The third stage envisaged the replacement of the Senate with a new upper chamber representing the regions, and the direct election of the Flemish assembly and of those for Wallonia and the French-speaking community. Although the overwhelming majority of parliamentarians supported these changes in principle, it proved impossible to get agreement on the details. This is still the position under the new Dehaene government, which lacks a two-thirds majority although it will need this level of support to get the changes through. The biggest difficulty is over whether French speakers living in Flanders (of whom there are a large number) should have the right to vote in elections for the French-speaking community. Absolutely, say the Walloons. Absolutely not, say the Flemings. Mr Dehaene has set up a standing conference consisting of himself and four members from each of 10 parties represented in the national parliament to seek an agreed approach. It is getting nowhere fast - the opposition parties (in particular, the right-wing Liberals) are setting unacceptable conditions for support. The betting in Brussels is that Mr Dehaene will be unable to break the deadlock and that his government will fall before the autumn. Whether or not a new government, perhaps expanded to include the Liberals to ensure a two-thirds majority, will be any more successful, is far from clear. What is certain is that there is no going back. Either Belgium will complete its transition to a fully federal state or it will be stuck indefinitely at its present, rather more than halfway, house. The days of a unified national structure are dead and gone.</p>

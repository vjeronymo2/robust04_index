			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / World Trade News: Brazil to abolish law on information technology THE Brazilian government is planning to allow foreign companies to produce software in Brazil and to abolish the controversial 'law of similars' which prohibits the import of information technology similar to products manufactured by Brazil companies. The decision was taken last Friday by the National Informatics Council (Conin) which meets today to put the final touches on a new law intended to end the market reserve for Brazilian products and open up this most protected area of the country's economy. If the new law is passed by the Brazilian Congress it will end a long-running trade row with the US and will be welcomed by foreign companies wanting to enter Brazil's market and which hope it will put an end to widespread pirating. However the law's passage through Congress is not expected to be easy as it will spell the demise of many Brazilian computer companies. Information technology products in Brazil generally cost three times the price in the US and are widely thought to be a generation behind. Mr Gregorio Diaz, president of the US company Microsoft in Brazil, says: 'There is an incredible amount of repressed demand in this country and Brazil is currently foregoing lots of opportunities.' He welcomed the Conin recommendations but warned: 'Let us see how it will be implemented.' As part of President Collor's commitment to liberalisation, his government has already promised to end the market reserve for Brazilian information technology by October 1992. The delay is intended to give national industry time to become competitive. However with Brazil currently in recession national computer companies have little resources for modernisation and were furious last October when the government reduced the list of protected products but did not free the components considered necessary for national companies to modernise. Consequently many companies are now seeking foreign partners. Since this was allowed in October two Brazilian companies, SID and Elebra, have signed joint ventures with IBM and Digital respectively. Both IBM and Digital have long been operating in Brazil. With direct access in sight foreign companies not already in Brazil feel they have little to gain from joint ventures.</p>

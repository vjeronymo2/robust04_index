			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Surprise jump in Indian polished diamond exports INDIA'S EXPORTS of cut and polished diamonds jumped 10.6 per cent to USDollars 3.24bn in the year to March 1993, surprising local businesses. The rise resulted from windfall gains for India as consumers in the recession-hit West and Japan switched to small diamonds, in which the country specialises. A sharp fall had been feared as diamond polishing activity in the western part of the country came to a standstill for more than three months following intermittent riots. India, which depends entirely on external sources for rough (uncut) diamonds, imported stones worth Dollars 2.38bn last year mainly through the Diamond Trading Corporation of India. The added value in exports last year was 36.1 per cent, up by two percentage points from the previous year. Exports became more competitive last year with partial convertibility of the rupee, allowing 60 per cent of inward remittances to be converted at market rates. The remaining 40 per cent was to be offered at the rate fixed by the country's central bank. Exporters were given a further boost as the rupee was made fully convertible last month. Mr MR Bhansali, chairman of gem and jewellery export promotion council, says the gain will amount be about 2 per cent.</p>

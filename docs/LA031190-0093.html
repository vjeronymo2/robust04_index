			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAM HALL KAPLAN: A SENSE OF PLACE IN AN AGE OF ALIENATION  </P> <P> The focus of architecture's spotlight in recent decades has been on private  projects: idiosyncratically designed single-family houses, boldly styled  corporate office towers, flamboyantly decorated festival markets and malls and  independent institutions searching for a signature structure.  </P> <P> The commercial projects obviously were designed to engage customers and  clients, but still, when you walk through their doors, you are on private  ground, a guest. A shopping center, no matter how inviting, is not a public  street or a park.  </P> <P> As for most of the other private efforts, they have been isolated, inaccessible  objects, located behind fences, hedges and guarded gates, contributing little  to the public experience of the city and the civic pride of its residents.  </P> <P> In fact, an argument can be made that the waves of indulgent private  architecture of recent years -- the mini-malls, monster mansions, obese office  towers and other anti-contextual exercises -- have heightened the depressing  sense of anomie that marks most of our cities in this age of alienation.  </P> <P> But there are a few hopeful signs that the currents of architecture are  changing and that public projects fashioned to engender a sense of pride and  place once again will be a major focus of the design community, as it was at  the beginning of the century.  </P> <P> During that period, in the wake of the so-called City Beautiful movement, a  variety of public projects blossomed.  </P> <P> These included what are now some of Los Angeles' most prominent architectural  landmarks, such as the Central Library, City Hall, Exposition Park and the  Beverly Hills and Pasadena civic centers.  </P> <P> And it is civic centers that once again are pacing architecture's public  presence.  </P> <P> Nearing completion is the ambitious expansion of the Beverly Hills civic  center. It is a fanciful plan that includes a new firehouse, police station,  library and city offices focused on three palm-lined oval courtyards, styled in  the Spanish Baroque spirit of the 1931 City Hall.  </P> <P> The $83-million project, when completed at the end of this year, promises to  offer an appropriately extravagant public focus for a city known for its  private extravagances.  </P> <P> It was designed with a flourish by Charles Moore and the Urban Innovations  Group, and the landscape architectural firm of Campbell &amp; Campbell.  </P> <P> Also under way is the expansion and revitalization of the landmark Pasadena  civic center, a marvelous collection of classically styled public structures  sited in the beaux-arts tradition of the City Beautiful movement and centered  on a wedding cake of a City Hall.  </P> <P> The expansion includes a new police station (designed by nouvelle classicist  Robert Stern), extensive landscaping and street furnishings (once again by the  traditionalist Campbell &amp; Campbell) and a sensitive mix of complementary  commercial and residential uses (by mix master Johannes Van Tilburg).  </P> <P> "The object is to lend new life to old spaces, building upon the generations of  pride Pasadena residents feel for the civic center," said Marsha Rood of the  city's redevelopment agency. "We want to reinforce the center's place as the  focal point of the city."  </P> <P> In San Diego County, the recently completed first phase of the  Romantic-Spanish-styled Escondido civic center is drawing rave reviews as a  public place during the workweek and a setting for weddings on weekends.  </P> <P> Also promising is the modest, accessible design for Oceanside's new civic  center, now under construction.  </P> <P> Unfortunately not being constructed is the West Hollywood civic center, the  plan for which has narrowly defeated last year by 170 or so votes in a  controversy concerning the proposed site at San Vicente and Santa Monica  boulevards.  </P> <P> The plan called for a distinctive assemblage of public buildings and spaces  (designed by Chang &amp; Sherman, with Gruen Associates), offering the  fledgling city a needed identity. A new site is being sought.  </P> <P> The latest plan for a civic center comes out of Culver City, which a few weeks  ago approved an energetic scheme that seeks to lend the city a sense of history  while providing its downtown with a focus.  </P> <P> Both are desperately needed, for Culver City appears at present to be not much  more than a fragmented collection of residential enclaves in a confused web of  ugly commercial strips that slice and dice the city into unappealing bits and  pieces.  </P> <P> And this despite the city's increasing attractiveness as one of the few  reasonably priced areas on the Westside.  </P> <P> "The plan is an outgrowth of civic pride, or perhaps more accurately, a search  for civic pride," said Culver City's community development director Jody  Hall-Esser.  </P> <P> She explained that in orchestrating the limited competition and public review  that led to the selection of the plan, it was obvious that "people were looking  for some identification with the city, a flag in the wind."  </P> <P> Particularly appealing is that the winning plan by the architectural firm of  CHCG went beyond just designing a City Hall that the competition called for,  and addressed the issue of a civic center and the potential there for a  pedestrian experience.  </P> <P> The new city hall is to be located on a site encompassing the old,  earthquake-unsound City Hall at Culver Boulevard and Duquesne Avenue.  </P> <P> Instead of siting the parking at ground level in the rear of the new City Hall  as originally suggested, it places it below grade, with access by an open,  lushly landscaped stairway to a formal square in front of the building and open  to the street.  </P> <P> The result is an accessible, attractive public space in the rich tradition of  the Spanish Mission style the city requested the center take.  </P> <P> In a gesture to the city's past, the existing facade of the old City Hall is  saved to form an arch for a heritage park featuring historically symbolic  plantings and materials.  </P> <P> The facade also will block in part the view to the northwest of the obnoxious,  over-scaled MGM building and its loading dock. There are plans to further  divert the view toward a plaza across the street, and the welcome redevelopment  of the Moderne-styled Culver Theatre.  </P> <P> Distinguishing the plan is the clear intent not to treat the new City Hall as  just a public service building, but rather as the "corner stone" of an effort  to "protect and extend pedestrian and public values" in the renaissance of  downtown, according to CHCG's David Goodale.  </P> <P> There are still questions concerning the detailing and massing of the City  Hall, in particular how it can be more assertive in its relationship to the  street and its neighbor to the northeast, the Mission-styled Meralta office  building.  </P> <P> Culver City does not need another syrupy suburban exercise. It is time for it  to become a city. The civic center would be a start.  </P></p>

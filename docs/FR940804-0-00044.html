			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Memorandum Opinion and Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> we favored a bright-line test because we believed that it would result in a faster, less burdensome licensing process.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Memorandum Opinion and Order  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> at &para; 113. On reconsideration, however, we have concluded that adding use of a multiplier will allow us to more effectively enforce the broadband PCS/cellular cross-ownership and broadband PCS spectrum cap rules consistent with their intent. We also conclude that using a multiplier is consistent with our policy goal of promoting full competition in wireless markets, because it will not cause the exclusion of firms that pose no threat to competition. Without a multiplier, parties that have neither the ability to exert control nor a substantial financial stake in the cellular or broadband PCS license could be unduly restricted in acquiring interests in such license. Furthermore, absent a multiplier, anomalous and unintended results occur. For example, if Company A holds a 21 percent non-controlling interest in Company B, which in turn holds a 30 percent non-controlling interest in Company X, a cellular licensee, Company A's attributable interest in Company X would be deemed to be 30 percent, in excess of the 20 percent threshold applicable to broadband PCS/cellular cross-ownership. Company A would thus be limited to acquiring a 10 MHz broadband PCS license in Company X's cellular service area, even though it has neither the ability to exert control or significant influence over the operations of Company X's cellular system nor a financial stake in Company X so substantial as to give rise to an incentive to engage in anticompetitive conduct. In comparison, by using a multiplier, Company A's attributable interest in Company X would be 6.3 percent (0.21&times;0.3), under the 20 percent attribution threshold, and Company A would not be restricted to 10 MHz broadband PCS licenses in Company X's cellular service area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Considerations of ``actual involvement'' with, true economic interest in, and ability to control a licensee are crucial in determining whether a particular indirect ownership interest should be attributed to the holder for purposes of our cross-ownership and multiple ownership rules. These considerations apply with equal force in the broadcast, broadband PCS and cellular contexts; thus, we conclude that a multiplier similar to that used in applying our attribution rules in the broadcast area should be adopted for purposes of determining attributable interests in cellular and broadband PCS licensees. We therefore will amend &sect;24.204 of our Rules to include use of a multiplier to determine whether an entity holding indirect non-controlling interests in a cellular licensee or a broadband PCS applicant or licensee has an attributable interest for purposes of our broadband PCS/cellular cross-ownership rule and our broadband PCS spectrum cap rule. For purposes of applying the multiplier, where an entity's ownership interest in any particular link in the ownership chain is greater than 50 percent or is controlling, the interest will be treated as if it were 100 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.

			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / US envoy urges UN force to end Rwanda tragedy A special US envoy to Rwanda said yesterday he would urge the dispatch of a large United Nations peacekeeping force to convince millions of Hutus who have fled the country that it would be safe to return under Rwanda's new Tutsi-dominated government. Mr Brian Atwood, who will brief President Bill Clinton tomorrow on the humanitarian catastrophe caused by the flight of over 1m Hutus into Zaire, expressed confidence in Rwanda's new leaders, the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front, which declared victory this week after a four-year guerrilla war against a Hutu government and army. 'We have been working hard behind the scenes to encourage the formation of a moderate, mixed Hutu-Tutsi government,' Mr Atwood said in Nairobi. 'We are prepared to work with them to consolidate peace and begin the reconstruction of the country.' The Tutsi-led RPF yesterday installed a new government in the capital Kigali which includes a Hutu president, Mr Pasteur Bizimungu, and a Hutu prime minister, Mr Faustin Twagiramungu. Its immediate problem is how to win legitimacy in the eyes of Rwanda's Hutu majority, many members of whom participated in the slaughter of the Tutsi population following the death of President Juvenal Habyarimana in an air crash in April. Several western governments, including Belgium and the US, have now pledged to work with Rwanda's new government. France, which sent an intervention force to Rwanda earlier this month yesterday acknowledged Rwandan rebels had effectively won the war. Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister, said Paris would negotiate with the victors on an end to its intervention. Even if the UN troops are deployed rapidly, Mr Atwood believes it will take several months before the right psychological environment can be created to persuade the Hutu population to return. In RPF-controlled areas, for example, Mr Atwood said rebels were holding Hutus in encampments against their will. But Mr Atwood's immediate concern, like that of all international relief agencies, is how to deal with a refugee crisis of unprecedented proportions on Rwanda's western border with Zaire. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees says there are 1m refugees in the Zairean border town of Goma, and about 100,000 more in Bukavu to the south. Yesterday there were reports that 400,000 Rwandans had flooded into another Zairean town, Uvira. 'It's really an exodus of a nation. The whole country is coming out of its borders. We can't cope,' Mr Panos Moumtzis, an UNHCR spokesman, said. Medecins Sans Frontieres, the medical charity, warned that thousands of people faced almost certain death due to the logistical impossibilities of meeting the needs of the biggest flow of refugees in contemporary history. Mr Atwood also fears Rwanda's defeated Hutu troops, who have also fled into Zaire, might attempt to regroup and invade Rwanda, or wage a war of attrition against the new Tutsi-led regime.</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Hong Kong budget surplus increases THE Hong Kong government yesterday disclosed that its budget surplus for last year was HKDollars 6bn (Pounds 437m) higher than its provisional figure, revealed in March. The extra Dollars HK6bn brings the budget surplus for 1991/1992 to more than Dollars HK20bn. Legislative councillors expressed concern over the government's apparent inability to keep track of its finances. Financial secretary Mr Hamish MacLeod's statement on the windfall surplus was accompanied by a concession on his first budget. He said he would not raise property rates by half a point to 6 per cent, as proposed in his maiden budget speech two months ago. A number of legislative councillors had said earlier that they would vote against the rates increase, in spite of opposition by Mr MacLeod to any tampering with his first budget. He told the Legislative Council yesterday that the decrease in revenue was 'roughly equivalent' to the windfall surplus.</p>

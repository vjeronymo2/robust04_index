Everest, has burned to the ground, a Buddhist priest said Saturday. The priest,  who flew by helicopter to the site high in the Himalayas, told reporters the  ruins of the main prayer hall were still smoldering.  </P> <P> The fire, apparently caused by an electrical fault, broke out late Thursday.  Hikers camping at the monastery helped save some of the religious books and  paintings.  </P></p>

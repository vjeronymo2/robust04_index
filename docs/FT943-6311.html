			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Bull set for return to black Groupe Bull, the troubled French computer manufacturer, will show a profit at the operating level by the end of this financial year and could be profitable at the net level by the middle of 1995. Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, appointed chairman of the state-controlled group 10 months ago, told the Financial Times that the company had improved its performance faster than expected. It was now in a position to plan and implement a growth strategy. The sale of Groupe Bull, in which the state has a 73 per cent stake, has been seen as one of the more difficult of the 21 privatisations planned by the French government. The company lost in excess of FFr15bn (Pounds 1.8bn) over the last three years. It showed an improvement in its first-half results, cutting a deficit of FFr1.72bn to FFr843m. Nevertheless, a turnaround at the pace indicated by Mr Descarpentries would be remarkable, and a sharp rejoinder to those who had written off Bull as the least likely to recover of Europe's ailing computer companies. A rapid return to profitability will have two principal consequences. First, it will encourage potential shareholders who are following the company's progress but holding back on investment. Second, it should convince Brussels that Bull's recovery plan is working and clear the way for approval of a final FFr3.1bn of government money to reduce Bull's debts. It is unlikely that the government's stake in Bull will be reduced to a minority position by the end of the year. It is thought that one of Bull's existing shareholders, the Japanese company NEC, will increase its shareholding and that one other large equity partner will be found. Mr Descarpentries said any new equity partner would have to be a leader in one of Bull's main business areas. He had been given a free hand in the choice of equity partner and there was no reason why it should not be a foreign owned company. He said he was seeking industrial partners in Bull's key technologies and the first two would be announced early in September. Mr Descarpentries said the speed of the recovery was the result of pressure on costs and new organisational and reporting structures. He had rejected conventional turnround methods involving closing businesses and huge redundancies.</p>

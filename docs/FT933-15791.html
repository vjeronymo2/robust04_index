			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / UK forecasts are too optimistic, EC monetary committee warns THE British government has come under sharp criticism from its European Community partners for overestimating the impact of economic growth in curbing its Pounds 50bn (Dollars 75bn) budget deficit. The challenge to the credibility of the government's plan surfaced during a meeting of the EC's secretive monetary committee composed of senior Treasury and central bank officials from the 12 member states. It is likely to reinforce the belief that tougher measures, including tax rises and/or spending cuts, may be needed to restore the worst deterioration in the UK's public finances since the 1976 sterling crisis. Mr Kenneth Clarke, Britain's new chancellor of the exchequer, will be grilled about the government's plans for bringing the economy back into balance at next Monday's meeting of EC finance ministers. The target of the monetary committee's criticism is the UK's 'convergence' plan - the programme to make its economy ready for economic and monetary union by the end of the decade. The plan is based largely on measures announced in Mr Norman Lamont's last Budget in March. Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, director of the French Treasury and chairman of the committee, led criticism of the UK government's plans. He challenged its argument that about 70 per cent of the deficit is 'cyclical' and would therefore be reduced in the course of economic recovery. In similar vein, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimated last week that only half of the UK's budget deficit - now accounting for 8 per cent of gross domestic product - was cyclical. The other half represents a structural increase in spending. British officials - including Sir Nigel Wicks, the UK representative on the monetary committee - were reported to have been taken aback by the attacks on the UK convergence programme. Officials are scrambling to brief Mr Clarke so that he can present a robust response at next Monday's Ecofin meeting. In a separate development, Mr Clarke can expect stiff questions about the government's medium-term financial strategy in relation to the Maastricht treaty's plans for economic and monetary union by 1997 at the earliest, or by the end of the century at the latest. Under the government's plans, the public sector borrowing requirement is set to fall from about 8 per cent of GDP in this financial year to 3.75 per cent by 1997-98. This figure is above the treaty's 3 per cent target. Some member states have inferred that the UK is signalling that it does not believe in the early Emu timetable. British officials retort that the UK Treasury is seeking merely to be realistic about the difficulties in reducing the deficit in the next five years. One diplomat noted that Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, and Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, had raised doubts about the 1997 Emu target date. Moreover, some member states are viewed as having produced over-ambitious convergence programmes to pay lip service to Emu by 1997. Earlier this year, Greece won endorsement for a plan which foresees a reduction in the budget deficit as a proportion of GDP from 9.4 per cent in 1992 to 1.6 per cent in 1996. The Ecofin Council described the Greek programme as 'ambitious' and 'optimistic', but said this was essential in the light of Greece's economic problems.</p>

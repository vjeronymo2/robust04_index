			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Observer: Marked down Oh, these back-biting management gurus] The evangelistic Tom Peters gets a sharp nip from American organisational-politics expert Jeffrey Pfeffer in his latest book, Managing with Power. Apparently, when Peters was working on the mega-selling In Search of Excellence a dozen years ago, he asked to borrow a previous book on politicking by Pfeffer, who handed over his personal copy. When it came back, he found that Peters had disagreed so strongly with some of its points that he had scribbled in the margins. In particular, against passages detailing the Machiavellian politics executives get up to in companies, he'd written: 'Not in effective organisations.' Perhaps that explains why several of Peters's 'excellent' companies have since proved otherwise, comments Pfeffer.</p>

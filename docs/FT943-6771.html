			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: Logitech slides into the red Logitech, the world leader in pointing devices (mice and trackballs) for computers, slumped to an SFr8.6m (Dollars 6.51m) loss in the three months to June 30 compared with a profit of SFr8.8m in the same period of 1993. The directors blamed lower margins, high operating expenses and extraordinary charges for the setback. Sales were down 7.9 per cent to SFr103.5m, with about half of the decline accounted for by currency effects. Restructuring charges of SFr2m contributed to the loss in the current period. There was a SFr3.1m capital gain in the comparative period.</p>

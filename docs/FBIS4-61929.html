			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Nadein: "U.S. Seeks Company for </F> Invasion of Haiti"]    [Text] Washington -- The United States has stepped up  pressure on the military regime in Haiti in a big way. U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is touring Central  and Latin America, has continued the campaign started at the end  of the week by President Clinton's pronouncements.    Apparently, the secretary of state's task is to rally  American countries to such an extent that they allocate military  contingents to overthrow by force the regime that has held sway  in this island state since the expulsion of democratically  elected President Bertrand Aristide.    Although the U.S. Administration acknowledges that the  people  will be the chief victim of any blockade, it is intensifying the  blockade stranglehold as the final means of exerting pressure  before a direct military invasion. At the end of last year U.S.  marines were on the verge of launching an assault on the Haitian  coast, but the White House withheld the order to attack at the  last minute. In accordance with Bill Clinton's doctrine, the  United States does not intend to participate in any peacemaking  operations (that also involve measures to restore democracy and  the rule of law in foreign states) unless it is as part of a  coalition.    The United States has frozen the Haitian leaders' deposits,  banned them and members of their families from visiting the  United States, and confined flights from Haiti to the United  States to commercial flights, carried out in accordance with  schedules that were apporoved a long time ago.    One factor that has contributed to the hardening of the U.S.  line is the Haitian military authorities' gradual strengthenning  of their regime. It is claimed that the military's reign of  terror has led to a sharp fall in support for exiled President  Aristide.    The success of Secretary of State W. Christopher's trip will  to a large extent determine the date of the U.S. military  invasion of Haiti. An invasion by U.S. forces without the  support of allies on the continent, symbolic though it may be,  is considered unlikely.</p>

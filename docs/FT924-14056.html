			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Bank of Scotland poised to complete Countrywide takeover BANK OF Scotland is poised to complete its takeover of the Countrywide Banking Corporation after the last rebel institutional shareholder, National Mutual Association, agreed reluctantly to accept the offer for its 5.5 per cent holding. National Mutual had been fighting an acrimonious rear-guard struggle since May in an effort to force Bank of Scotland to pay more than NZDollars 2.05 a share, saying the offer, which valued Countrywide at Pounds 40.2m, was far too low. It believed the shares to be worth at least NZDollars 2.40. Two other dissident shareholders, Norwich Union and Colonial Mutual, surrendered last month. National Mutual said its struggle was weakened by the late acceptances of the others, but it had considered challenging compulsory acquisition. Bank of Scotland had sent dissidents a formal notice of compulsory acquisition, giving them until November 5 to accept, and claiming it had acceptances for 91.2 per cent. National Mutual said it was accepting because any legal action would have caused further uncertainties over the future of the bank. 'Even if we had managed to retain the shares, their negotiability would have been limited." Last year Countrywide incurred a pre-tax loss of NZDollars 40.9m (Pounds 11.6m) for the year to June 30, against profits of NZDollars 16.5m previously after bad debt provisions of NZDollars 30.5m and a write off of NZDollars 38m to purchase United Banking.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: BAT Industries Like some diva forever postponing the final curtain call, Sir Patrick Sheehy appears reluctant to leave the stage at BAT. Although the company has split the two top jobs for the first time in 90 years, Sir Patrick is to remain in the chair. The figure who has dominated BAT for the past decade will soldier on for up to three more years. By then he will be 65. BAT's normal retirement age is 60. It is easy to imagine how Sir Patrick's continuing presence might make life tricky for the new chief executive, Mr Martin Broughton. However BAT's shareholders are unlikely to feel too aggrieved if the share price continues its recent strong run. For the moment at least, Mr Broughton will doubtless stress the theme of continuity. BAT's tobacco business has found new customers in the developing world while the financial services arm appears to have endured the worst. The stiffer long-term challenge will be to address BAT's structural ACT problem. That may require a significant strategic move in the UK and a new song from Mr Broughton.</p>

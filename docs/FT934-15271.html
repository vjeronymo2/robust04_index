			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / First woman elected to lead Irish political party MS MARY Harney was elected yesterday to lead Ireland's Progressive Democrat party. It is the first time a woman has led a political party in the Irish Republic. The election follows last week's announcement by the outgoing leader, Mr Des O'Malley, that he would withdraw from the frontline of Irish politics. A reforming politician, Ms Harney, 40, has campaigned for the liberalising of Ireland's conservative social legislation since she was elected to the Dail in 1981. She was a key figure in the founding of the Progressive Democrats in 1985 by a group which split from the Fianna Fail party on policy differences over Northern Ireland, the contraceptive issue and internal party democracy. The Progressive Democrat party has 10 seats in the 166-seat Irish parliament. Ms Harney said yesterday she wanted the party to field candidates in every constituency at the next general election, and to mount an 'effective but constructive opposition' to the present government. On economic policy the PDs are conservative in outlook, favouring low taxation and low government spending. The PDs held the balance of power in the last coalition government and were instrumental in the downfall of Mr Charles Haughey, the former prime minister, and the collapse of the last coalition led by Mr Albert Reynolds. Coalitions are likely to be the norm in the foreseeable future, due to Ireland's proportional representation system, and a trend of declining support for Fianna Fail, previously the majority party. This should create an opportunity for the PDs to return to government sometime in the future.</p>

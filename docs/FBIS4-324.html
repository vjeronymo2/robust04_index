			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 8 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill  Zwelithini told African National Congress President Nelson  Mandela on Friday [8 April] morning he would have to distance  himself from the ANC's shooting of Zulu marchers outside the  ANC's Shell House head office before their dialogue continued.  The Zulu monarch met Mr Mandela at an undisclosed venue before a  meeting between the king, Mr Mandela, President F W de Klerk and  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi.    The king's presentation to Mr Mandela was released by Mr.  Buthelezi's office.    "Until and unless you personally distance yourself from the  shedding of the innocent blood of my father's people by means of  your personal initiative leading to the conviction of those who  are guilty of this crime, our dialogue will remain difficult if  not impossible," King Zwelithini said.    King Zwelithini said immediate steps were required from Mr  Mandela to heal the wounds arising from the Shell House  massacre. He asked that Mr Mandela make available all  information related to the killings.    "I ask that you do whatever is in your power as the  president  of the ANC to ensure that all those who plotted, organised and  executed the massacre are arrested and tried for their crime,"  he said.    The Zulu king also condemned ANC statements on the monarchy  and the kwaZulu government.    "The insults that many spokespersons of the ANC, and  particularly the Natal leaders of the ANC, have hurled at me at  numerous times, that I am on the payroll of the kwaZulu  government or that my Prime Minister Prince Mangosuthu is my  paymaster, is something which is more than just offensive."    He said any action taken against the kwaZulu legislative  assembly would be an action against him as reigning king.    He said Mr Mandela and the ANC had repeatedly flouted royal  protocol in their approaches to the institution of the Zulu  monarchy.    He detailed the failed attempts at arranging a meeting  between himself and Mr Mandela and said it would be wrong for  him not to get "these things off my chest".    However, he said he did not expect issues of protocol to  cloud the discussions. "I put them down for the record without  expecting them to be the cause of any acrimony between us."    King Zwelithini said he regarded the state of emergency in  Natal/kwaZulu as an invasion. "I want to make it clear that I,  the king of the Zulu nation, consider the declaration of a state  of emergency in kwaZulu to be an act of foreign aggression, an  invasion of our territory and a rape of our national dignity and  pride.    "I...shall never recognise the legitimacy of the actions  taken in terms of the declaration of the state of emergency."    He said the stigmatisation of his uncle, Chief  Kwaphindangene  (Chief Minister Buthelezi) had also caused offence. "It was he  who destroyed the South African Government's homeland policy,  and it was his refusal to accept so-called independence that  destroyed Mr John Vorster's and Mr P W Botha's dream of  establishing a confederation of South African states."    King Zwelithini said the summit was taking place against the  background of two direct and intolerable attacks on the Zulu  nation -- the Shell House massacre and the state of emergency.    "I have only done as much as is needed to clear things from  my heart so that we can talk openly and simply about the prime  purpose of our meeting".    He said the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the  sovereignty of the Zulu kingdom. He said sovereignty could not  be negotiated or conferred upon kwaZulu by anybody.    "Throughout the period of conquest and subjugation, it was  Zulu identity which kept the Zulus intact as a vibrant force  against colonialism and apartheid." The Zulus had never been  crushed, he said.    He said sovereignty forged by history could not be undone  by political edict or by the passing of a law or by the forcing  of a constitution on the people of a sovereign kingdom. "Now  that apartheid has been finally destroyed and a new South Africa  is being shaped, there shall emerge a sovereign Zulu kingdom.    "I am not prepared to talk to you...about whether or not  there shall be a sovereign Zulu kingdom in the new South Africa.    "The only thing to talk about are the modalities of bringing  the sovereignty of the Zulu kingdom into full recognitio and  relating the kingdom properly to the rest of South Africa."    He said the kingdom would be bounded by the Transvaal in the  west, Mozambique and Swaziland in the north and Transkei and  Lesotho in the south and south-west.    He said the 1993 constitution, even as amended, extended the  "greedy arm of Pretoria right across the Zulu kingdom". He said  he rejected the constitution. He said the kingdom needed a  militia which the constitution did not provide.    King Zwelithini said he had been forced to act decisively by  the failure of negotiations to deliver a federal dispensation.  Nor was the negotiators' provision for traditional leaders  sufficient recognition of the Zulu monarchy.    "As things stand now I cannot encourage my father's people  to  vote on April 26-28 and thereby lend legitimacy to what will be  the destruction of the very foundations on which the sovereignty  of the Zulu kingdom rests."    He said Mr Mandela was rushing into an election rejected by  himself and the Zulu people.    King Zwelithini said a constitution had been written for the  state of kwaZulu/Natal in December, 1992. It set out the Zulu  nation's bottomline demands.    He said he had been hoping for a a federal system in which  the constitution would be recognised.    He called on all Zulus to unite and to defend kwaZulu  freedom  and sovereignty.    "The road ahead is not going to be an easy one," he warned.    "We the Zulu nation convene today on the battleground which  subjugated the freedom of our forefathers.    "We here today proclaim before the world our freedom and  sovereignty and our unwavering will to defend it at all costs.    "Whether we end up as part of one federal state of South  Africa or as a completely autonomous state will depend on what  you and others in South Africa do to me and my people. The key  thing is whether you are prepared to listen to our just  aspirations or whether, like those who conquered us, you think  you must trample with your feet on those just aspirations of my  nation."</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Overcharged by the Revenue I SOLD a second home and provided the Inland Revenue with the necessary information for CGT purposes. In February 1992 they charged me an interim amount of tax, and in March 1992 they charged another final amount. I paid each of these soon after receiving their requests. Recently, they have told me I was considerably overcharged. Should I expect (or is it the duty of) the Revenue to pay interest to me on the overpaid sums? Much depends upon whether the error was a simple mistake or whether it might reasonably be ascribed to incompetence or maladministration. It is possible, for example, that the error was partly attributable to the manner in which you set out the relevant facts, figures and dates. And you must bear in mind that you were under a statutory obligation to submit your own computation of the chargeable gain (by virtue of section 12 of the Taxes Management Act 1970). In order to keep down the cost of tax collection, parliament requires taxpayers to calculate their chargeable gains: you had no legal right simply to provide the tax inspector with the basic data and leave him to work out the chargeable gain. It is a pity you did not think of seeking guidance on the CGT rules from the solicitor who acted for you in the sale of the house. Had you done so, it might have been possible for him to advise you on a way of reducing the prospective CGT bill. You might like to come back to us with the precise facts, figures and dates which you sent to the tax office so that we can calculate what the chargeable gain should be. At the same time you could, if you wish, send us photocopies of the tax office's calculations etc. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

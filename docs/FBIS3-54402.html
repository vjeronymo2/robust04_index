			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter P.V. Vivekanand] </F>   [Text] Amman--Jordan and Iraq have agreed to study  possibilities of building an oil pipeline to link Iraq with the  port of al-'Aqabah after International sanctions on Iraq are  lifted, an official statement said Tuesday [25 January].    The statement, issued by Minister of Energy and Mineral  Resources Walid 'Asfur to the JORDAN NEWS AGENCY, PETRA, said  the agreement to conduct a feasibility study for the project was  part of an accord Mr. 'Asfur and his Iraqi counterpart Safa'  Hadi Jawad signed in Baghdad earlier this week.    The statement did not give details of the project except  that  the agreement also include building a refinery at al-'Aqabah  based on studies on Jordan's consumption beyond the year 2010.  In the meantime, Iraqi supplied oil in excess of Jordanian  consumption would be exported.    PETRA quoted Dr. 'Asfur as saying that the project aimed at  securing Iraqi oil supplies in a "quicker and safer manner once  the sanctions are lifted."    The findings of the feasibility study will be submitted to  the government of the two countries for approval, he said.    During his visit to Baghdad, Dr. 'Asfur also held talks with  other senior Iraqi officials and attended a meeting with the  energy ministers of Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Turkey on linking the  power grids of the five countries in a regional network.    The agreement signed in Baghdad by Dr. 'Asfur and Mr. Jawad  also renewed an arrangement under which Jordan will buy four  million tonnes of crude and fuel oil from Iraq during the year  1994.    This would roughly mean a daily supply of 50,000 barrels of  crude oil and 25,000 barrels of fuel oil--Jordan's full needs of  imported energy.    According to industry sources, part of the oil will be  supplied free of cost and the rest at market prices.    The Iraqi oil supply to Jordan is exempt from the sweeping  international sanctions imposed against Iraq following its  August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.    Dr. 'Asfur also discussed with the Iraqi officials  possibilities of exchange of expertise in oil and mineral  exploration in cooperation with Jordan's natural resources  authority and conducting studies on the al-Rishah gas fields  near the Jordanian-Iraqi border.    The al-'Aqabah pipeline project appears to be a dusted-off  version of a plan Jordan and Iraq abandoned in the mid-80s after  Israel refused to provide an international undertaking not to  attack the installations.    The Israel refusal, which was demanded by both Jordan and  Iraq, [as published] prompted the U.S. Eximbank to refuse a $550  million loan for the project, which at that time was estimated  to cost $1 billion.    The project was considered at the height of Iraqi oil  exports  through al-'Aqabah when part of the Iraqi oil exporting  facilities were crippled during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.    It envisaged laying a 1,000-kilometre long pipeline of 75-  centimetre diameter from the H-3 pumping station in Iraqi  territory near the border and down south through the desert to  al-'Aqabah.    The H-3 station was part of a pre-1948 pipeline that pumped  Iraqi oil across Jordan to the Mediterranean port of Haifa in  British Palestine.    According to industry sources, the Iraqi part of the  pipeline  remains largely intact. Parts of the line in Jordanian  territory near al-Mafraq have been destroyed.    Another project under consideration in the late 80s was  taping an Iraqi pipeline with the Saudi oil port of Yanbu at  midway and building a link with al-'Aqabah. This project  envisaged the linkage in Saudi territory near the border with  Jordan in the south and would have substantially reduced the  cost when compared with the earlier proposal.    Officials said the project, which at one point appeared to  have been all but finalised, was no longer under consideration.</p>

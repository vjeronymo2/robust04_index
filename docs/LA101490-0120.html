			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GULLS FALL TO FORT WAYNE IN OT  </P> <P> Disappointment was tempered by the hope that filled the arena moments earlier.  </P> <P> The Gulls fell 5-4 in sudden-death overtime to Fort Wayne Saturday night at the  San Diego Sports Arena, bringing their International Hockey League record to  1-3-1.  </P> <P> But by fighting back from two-goal deficits twice, it wasn't a bad way to go  down. Not bad at all. And the crowd of 5,357 roared in appreciation of the  effort.  </P> <P> "We didn't quit, but we're still making stupid mistakes," Coach Mike O'Connell  said. "On the winning goal, we made the wrong read, so we're going to have to  make some adjustments."  </P> <P> Fort Wayne's Steve Fletcher scored the overtime goal 1:57 into the three-minute  period as the Komets swept the two-game series.  </P> <P> The Gulls are off until Friday, when they travel to Indianapolis, then return  home Oct. 23.  </P> <P> The Gulls outshot Fort Wayne 40-21 in regulation.  </P> <P> The 2-2 tie came at 5:45 in the third, when a series of passes ended with  defenseman Paul Marshall getting his first score of the season, also the first  Gulls goal by a defender.  </P> <P> Left wing Clark Donatelli, obtained from the North Stars Tuesday, slid a pass  from behind the net to Marshall, who shoved it in from the left.  </P> <P> Fort Wayne retook the lead, 4-2, when it scored back-to-back goals at 8:52 and  10:07, first by John Anderson, followed by Max Midendorf, both from close  range.  </P> <P> Instead of frustrating the Gulls, as they have been in earlier games, this time  they turned it up a notch.  </P> <P> Sapergia avenged himself and pulled the Gulls to within 4-3 when he coaxed in a  goal from the slot on a Bob Jones pass from the left wing.  </P> <P> Floyd evened it at 4-4 on a power-play goal at 15:16. On a pass from Sapergia  from the far right wing, Floyd took a straight shot from the right point  without interference.  </P> <P> Fort Wayne extended its lead to 2-0 at 8:18 in the second, when the Komets set  up a screen for center Bruce Boudreau from inside the right point. Boudreau  swung and the puck landed in the middle of the net.  </P> <P> The second period has proven dry as the Sahara for the Gulls. They were  scoreless in the second until Saturday, when Jim McGeough ended the drought.  McGeough jumped on a shot by Larry Floyd from the high slot that was deflected  off Komet goalie Mike O'Neill. McGeough reached out and tipped it in from  outside the left crease, passing O'Neill from the right at 12:51.  </P> <P> Four minutes later, officials took away the potential game-tying score. Brent  Sapergia took a shot from inside the blue line that passed a pack of players in  front of the goal and skipped into the net. But officials ruled that the Gulls'  Carl Mokosak had kicked the puck in.  </P> <P> The Gulls continued their shot-on-goal dominance. But whereas on Friday, when  they at least had a first-period goal to show for it, Saturday the Gulls  trailed 1-0 after outshooting Fort Wayne 12-7 in the first.  </P> <P> Defenseman Brian McGee, who played in Europe last year, opened scoring for Fort  Wayne on the power play, taking a wrist shot from high in the slot. The puck  caught the tip of goalie Mark Reimer's stick before it took a short bounce and  landed in the lower right corner of the net at 16:33.  </P> <P> Defenseman Al Tuer continued his now-familiar brawling ways, adding a  five-minute second-period fighting penalty to the fighting penalty called  against him Friday. In the third period, he was hit with a 10-minute game  misconduct penalty.  </P> <P> Charlie Simmer, the Gulls' assistant coach and a left wing, sprained his right  ankle and had to be assisted off the ice halfway through the first period.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARYLOUISE OATES: SALUTE TO WISE DRAWS STAR SHOWER  </P> <P> You just don't see a whole lot of invitations like this -- even in a town  where, in the ever-escalating battle for benefit bucks, committee lists begin  to look like a litany of the rich 'n' famous.  </P> <P> When director Robert Wise is honored by the American Friends of Tel Aviv  University on Jan. 21, "special guests" will include Julie Andrews, Walter  Matthau, Paul Newman, Gregory Peck, Charlton Heston and Larry Hagman.  </P> <P> Director Taylor Hackford will preside, and Burt Lancaster will do the  toastmaster honors, while the honorary dinner chairs are Leonard Bernstein,  Samuel Goldwyn Jr. and Dr. Armand Hammer. Paramount's Howard W. Koch is the  dinner chair -- and, if only 10% of the lengthy list of 52 associate chairmen,  57 associate dinner chairmen and 76 host committee members show up for the  Beverly Hilton black-tie event, it will be quite a brand-name jam.  </P> <P> And quite a lucrative one, too, since the ticket price is $1,000 a couple.  </P> <P> It's no wonder Wise has such Hollywood connections. One of America's premier  directors, he has on his resume "The Day the Earth Stood Still," "I Want to  Live," "West Side Story," "The Sound of Music," "Audrey Rose" and "Star Trek."  He has served as president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences  and as president of the Directors Guild of America.  </P> <P> BEST L.A. STORY OF THE YEAR -- Just a few days into January and here it is --  short and sweet.  </P> <P> As screenwriter Gloria Goldsmith tells it, she took her leased Nissan to the  leasing company to be serviced. She was called early last week and, when she  showed up the day after the call to pick up the car, it couldn't be found.  </P> <P> No wonder -- it had been sold.  </P> <P> To a dealer. And when the leasing company tried to buy it back, the dealer had  already sold it.  </P> <P> But everything turned out OK. The dealer bought it back from the buyer, the  leasing company bought it back from the dealer, and Goldsmith is driving it  again.  </P> <P> AT IT AGAIN -- From the folks who brought us last fall's newspaper parody "The  Washington Possible" now comes the L.A. Inaugural Ball -- "The Political Party  for the Rest of Us." The invitation for the Jan. 20 bash is a smaller version  of the newspaper, but this one carries the headline "Bush's Inaugural Message:  'Don't Worry; Be Happy . . . New President Urges Upbeat Mood During Coming  Depression." Oh, yes, "present your ACLU card for a 10% discount." The credit  for the party goes to publicist Josh Baran and Rob Vinson, of the 2nd Coming,  the new dance club on South Bonnie Brae, two blocks east of Alvarado at 9th  Street.  </P> <P> MARK THE FEBRUARY CALENDARS -- Oakwood School salutes 10 years of service by  its headmaster, Jim Astman, with a more-than-all-star benefit show at the  Wiltern Theatre on Feb. 5. Among those performing are Rhea Perlman, Mort Sahl,  Henry Winkler and David Steinberg in a tribute being written variety-show style  by Iris Dart and Ann Beckett. . . .  </P> <P> That same Sunday night, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera will be honored by the  Beverly Hills Charitable Foundation and the Beverly Hills B'nai B'rith Lodge as  men of the year. Tickets for the black-tie event are $350 and $500 a couple --  although the invite does point out that for children, black tie is only  optional and the tickets are $75.  </P> <P> There's a reason for that striking exception, since the evening begins early  with Hanna-Barbera costumed characters posing for pictures with young (and  perhaps not-so-young guests). The party is at the Beverly Hills Hotel, and MCA  President Sidney Sheinberg is honorary chair, while Great American  Broadcasting's chairman Charles S. Mechem Jr. is the honorary co-chair. . . .  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Museum of Art unveils "Hispanic Art in the United States  -- 30 Contemporary Painters &amp; Sculptors" at a black-tie reception Feb. 1.  The exhibit has been organized by the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and was  made possible by grants from the Rockefeller Foundation and the Atlantic  Richfield Foundation, while the national tour was sponsored by the At&amp;T  Foundation. The Los Angeles presentation was made possible by the W. Alton  Jones Foundation.  </P></p>

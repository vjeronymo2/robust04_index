			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Pay rises faster in public sector PAY IN the public sector rose faster than in the private sector for the third year running in the year to April, according to the government's New Earnings Survey figures for this year published yesterday. The figures show a 4.3 per cent increase for the public sector compared with 4 per cent for the private sector. That is in spite of the fact that many key public-sector groups had been affected by the government's 1.5 per cent pay limit when the survey data was compiled. Public-sector pay experts, such as Mr Chris Trinder of the Public Finance Foundation, said the figures helped to explain why the government has imposed another limit on public-sector pay next year. The figures also show that public-sector pay is drifting well over official ceilings. Mr Trinder said: 'The decentralisation of pay in the public sector may have given flexibility advantages, but at a price.' Taking the three years to April this year, pay in the public sector has increased by 25.2 per cent compared with 18.6 per cent in the private sector. Inflation was 12.4 per cent over the period. Over the same period, the economy contracted by 2 per cent. The public sector was also much more generous to the low-paid, with the lowest 10 per cent receiving 4.8 per cent compared with 3.5 per cent for the lowest-paid 10 per cent in the private sector. Although women's pay rose slightly faster than men's at 4.8 per cent, the biggest reductions in pay were for full-time non-manual women workers under 18, whose pay fell 9.3 per cent. This may reflect the lagged effect of the abolition of wages councils for young people. However, those workers who are still covered by wages councils saw their pay rise 4.8 per cent, considerably above the average in the private sector. Overall earnings inequality grew, with weekly manual earnings rising only 2.5 per cent to Pounds 257 compared with non-manual occupations which rose 4.4 per cent to Pounds 350. The average for women at Pounds 253 was just over 71 per cent of the male figure of Pounds 354. That rises to 79 per cent if overtime is excluded. Greater London continued to see earnings increases higher than in other parts of the country at 5.9 per cent - making an average of Pounds 408. The lowest increases were in East Anglia at 1.3 per cent and Tyne and Wear's 1.7 per cent. Average pay for managers and administrators was Pounds 460, a rise of 6.2 per cent, with average professional pay at Pounds 444, a rise of 5.7 per cent. New Earnings Survey 1993, Part A. HMSO.

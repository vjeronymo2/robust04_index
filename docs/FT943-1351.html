			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region pessimistic on fears of further US rate rise With the fear of a further tightening of US interest rates next week weighing on investors' worldwide, the Pacific Region took the view ahead of the weekend that there was little to be optimistic about. Tokyo was closed yesterday for a public holiday. The consensus among analysts seems to be that the US Federal Reserve is likely to move interest rates 50 basis points higher at its Tuesday meeting, with the consequent knock-on effects throughout the world. However, there is also a view among analysts that the US does not need to take further action because the threat of rising inflation in the country remains small. Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia, for instance, remarks that improvements in productivity mean that the US economy can grow more quickly without generating inflation. 'With productivity at world-beating levels, there is just no evidence that inflation is a potential problem in the US . . . Rates have already gone up 175 basis points this year which will slow the economy. When this starts to happen long bond yields will fall towards more sensible levels, ones which reflect the low inflation outlook for the US economy.' Credit Lyonnais believes that in this situation the outlook for Asia would be good, also because high inflationary expectations from weak Bund sales and excessive monetary growth in Germany should weaken confidence in the European currencies. 'The upshot will be a rise in US equities and bonds and a movement of funds out of Europe and into the Asia markets. But to keep funds long term in the region, Asian governments need to address any threat to their export competitiveness,' it concludes. SINGAPORE saw some life return to the market as selective foreign buying boosted the Straits Times Industrials 15.96 higher at 2,302.05, little changed on the week. Brokers said investor sentiment has firmed on the prospect of new foreign money coming into the market in the form of Asian equity mutual funds. KUALA LUMPUR closed lower as funds cashed out after a strong run, although speculative demand was still evident. The composite index lost 9.56 to 1,170.32, for a 1.3 per cent fall on the week. Volume was again heavy at 549m shares.

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Anglesey to raise Pounds 0.5m ANGLESEY MINING, floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1988 to develop Britain's first base metals mine for decades, at Parys Mountain, Anglesey, is raising another Pounds 620,000 (Pounds 515,000 net of expenses) from institutional investors and its biggest shareholder, Imperial Metals of Canada. Work at Parys Mountain came to an abrupt halt at the end of last year when Anglesey, which had spent Pounds 8.5m on the zinc-lead-copper project, failed to raise another Pounds 25m to take it through to production. Imperial's holding in the UK company would remain at about 43 per cent following the latest share issue. It is proposed - provided shareholders agree - that Anglesey issues 12.4m new ordinary shares at 5p each to Imperial and the institutions. Imperial would also take another 4m new ordinary shares at the same price (worth a total of Pounds 200,000) in satisfaction of part of a loan made to Anglesey. The shares fell by  1/2 p to 4 1/2 p.</p>

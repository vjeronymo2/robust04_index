			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Protean expands through two acquisitions for Pounds 9m Protean, the laboratory equipment and water purification specialist, is continuing its expansion programme with the Pounds 9m acquisition of two complementary companies, Techne and LIP. Techne is a US-registered company but its controlled temperature equipment activities are carried out in the UK by a subsidiary at Duxford, Cambridgeshire. LIP, based in Yorkshire, makes medical and laboratory sample plastic bottles. The purchases are to be financed by raising some Pounds 9m cash through a placing and offer to shareholders of up to 5.55m new shares at 180p on the basis of one new ordinary for every 4.73 ordinary held. The shares closed 7p higher at 199p. Techne, which is to be purchased for Pounds 5.43m, made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 825,000 on turnover of Pounds 6.9m in the year to March 31. LIP made a profit of Pounds 695,000, before tax and directors' remuneration, on turnover of Pounds 4.4m for the year to end-September. The purchase price is an initial Pounds 2.9m, plus further consideration linked to future profits up to a maximum of 684,020 ordinary shares - equal to a maximum of Pounds 1.3m. Protean announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.73m (Pounds 1.38m) for the six months to September 30, on turnover ahead at Pounds 18.9m (Pounds 15.3m). Earnings per share rose by 13 per cent, from 3.74p to 4.21p, and there is an increased interim dividend of 1.05p (0.9p). The company bought Epsom Glass Industries and DA Baldwin, the water treatment company, at the end of 1992, when it also announced that it was seeking further acquisitions. The latest purchases 'underline our strategy of complementing the continued organic growth of our existing successful businesses with further additions in closely related fields,' said Mr Peter Ryan, chairman. He said they would serve to broaden the product ranges in the key areas of laboratory equipment and consumables and also overseas.</p>

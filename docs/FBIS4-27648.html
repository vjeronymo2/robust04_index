			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Amando Doronila: "A Foreign Policy Disaster"] </F>   [Text] The order issued by a Quezon City court restraining  the organizers of the Asia-Pacific Conference on East Timor from  holding the conference resolves the Philippine-Indonesia  impasse, ostensibly within the context of the Philippine  constitutional system. The cancellation of the meeting defuses  the diplomatic crisis to the satisfaction of Indonesia, which  had in the first place sought to abort it as early as last  November. It is a triumph of Indonesian blitz diplomacy.    But the resolution of the conflict does not erase the fact  that the crisis has left Philippine diplomacy in a shambles.  The Philippines' handling of the crisis was an absolute  disaster. The crisis inflicted on the Philippines its worst  humiliation and degradation at the hands of another country  since the Japanese occupation, and ironically the humiliation  was administered by the Philippines' supposedly closest ally in  ASEAN. Having observed closely the golden age of Philippine  diplomacy during the 1950s to the 1970s, I have never seen a  more inept handling of Philippine foreign relations than by the  Ramos administration, and the diplomatic disaster should make us  weep over the ignominy of the Republic.    This essay seeks to establish responsibility for this  disaster. From evidence, much of the blame rests on the  usurpation of crisis management by the National Security Council  (NSC) -- a function of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which  has an experienced bureaucracy. When Indonesia applied the heat  on us, President Ramos heeded the counsel of the NSC, headed by  Gen. Jose Almonte, more than it listened to the Department of  Foreign Affairs (DFA), which had its own recommendations to the  president. Malacanang [Palace; presidential office] called,  the shots on the responses to Indonesian pressure and the DFA  merely echoed Palace directives.    The NSC-inspired responses were characterized by panic,  retreat and appeasement. The dispatch of a diplomatic mission  to Jakarta headed by former Secretary of Foreign Affairs Raul  Manglapus and Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino to explain the  Philippine position that the conference cannot be canceled  without breaching our constitutional principles of freedom of  assembly and of speech failed to impress and appease  authoritarian Indonesia. The mission left the impression that  the Philippines acted like a tributary state to Indonesia Raya  (Greater Indonesia), and the Indonesians, of course, arrogantly  displayed their scorn for us. President Suharto refused to  receive the delegation. According to Manglapus, Suharto was in  Bogor, entertaining New Zealand Prime Minister James Bolger, who  was on a state visit. Whatever the explanation, the fact is  that Suharto disdainfully snubbed the mission.    The government had absolutely no response, except  appeasement, to the three-pronged pressure by Indonesia -- the  threat of canceling the peace talks with Muslim separatist  rebels hosted by Indonesia, the Indonesian boycott of the East  Asian Business Conference in Davao on the East Asian economic  triangle, and the detention and harassment of Filipino fishermen  fishing in or near Indonesian waters. The NSC failed to  consider that the threat of Indonesia's withdrawal of support  for the peace talks with the separatist Muslims is partly bluff,  as I shall discuss later. The economic triangle concept is at  an embryonic stage, waiting for its time to come and has an  economic dynamic of its own. The harassment of Filipino  fishermen can be countered by diplomatic protests.    The response of appeasement was premised on the assumption  that relations with Indonesia must be saved at all costs because  of the mistaken belief that Indonesia has been the most  supportive Philippine ally in ASEAN, and therefore we owe a lot  to it. This assumption flies in the face of evidence that  Indonesia is as much in debt to us as we are to it because of  the fact that our hosting of the U.S. military bases served as a  security shield which permitted Indonesia and a host of other  countries in East Asia to divert their resources to development  away from costly defense expenditures.    The failure to respond to the escalated Indonesian pressure  and even to summon anger over Indonesia's bulldozing tactics  revealed the NSC to be bankrupt in experience, imagination, and  sophistication in responding to foreign relations crisis. The  NSC has a de facto "think tank" composed of academics,  consultants and arm-chair experts on geo-politics. Its head,  Gen. Almonte, claims to have a strategic view of things and  appears to have vast pretensions on geo-politics on regional and  international scale, but these pretensions are not matched by  NSC's performance during the crisis. Retreat and appeasement  are the best proof of this bankruptcy.    When the NSC's view of things collided with realpolitik,  the views based on fanciful models, crumbled. I suspect that  the NSC would like to believe that it is a center of strategic  decision making, superior to the Department of Foreign Affairs,  following the model of the U.S. National Security Council under  Dr. Henry Kissinger. Under President Nixon, he depended on  Kissinger for strategic decision more than he did on the State  Department, but the State Department's resources were  nonetheless deployed in policy and decision making, and besides,  Dr. Kissinger is one of the most brilliant practitioners of  realpolitik and had assembled a brilliant staff at the NSC.  Almonte is no Kissinger.    The undermining of the DFA began when President Ramos signed  as one of his first executive orders a directive broadening the  powers of the NSC to intervene in all aspects of national life.  The directive said that with the end of the Cold War and with  the shift in the character of conflict from armed confrontation  to economic competition, the compass of national security should  embrace also economic and foreign affairs.    The usurpation of the functions of the DFA by the NSC was  facilitated by the fact that the DFA has been depleted of senior  leadership -- a vacuum which the NSC tried to fill. During the  1950s up until the 1970s, the DFA had been gifted with strong  foreign ministers and a deep bench of experienced diplomats. It  was led by a constellation of brilliant diplomats such as Carlos  P. Romulo, S.P. Lopez, Jose Inglis, Narciso Reyes, Narciso  Ramos, et al, and second line back up from people like Raul  Manglapus and Leon Ma. Guerrero. These diplomats were  authoritative and presidents listened to them and respected  them. Moreover, foreign relations received a boost from  presidents like Elpidio Quirino and Diosdado Macapagal, who had  an international outlook. Foreign relations was their strong  suit.    By contrast, President Ramos is a man with a provincial and  parochial outlook. He is a plodding leader who has no fire in  his belly. He remains cool even under humiliation of the  national honor. His appreciation of foreign relations is  supplied mainly, by the NSC, whose depth, experience and  sophistication have been found to be nil by the crisis.  Moreover, there have been attempts to undermine the leadership  of the DFA under Secretary Roberto Romulo. Last summer there  were moves, which didn't go unnoticed by the CIA, to inquire  into the medical records of Romulo in the United States, in an  apparent attempt to embarrass him and to oust him from the DFA.    The threat by Indonesia to withdraw support of the peace  talks with Muslim separatists is partly bluff. It later on  decided to allow the talks to be held in Jakarta, and this is  not an act of charity. The settlement of the Muslim rebellion  leading to the ending of separatism serves the interests of  Indonesia as it does the Philippines. Separatism in the  Philippines inspires separatism by the outer islands of  Indonesia. If the separatist movement in Mindanao succeeded in  dismembering the Philippines, latent separatist rebellions in  Indonesia could flare up to detach themselves from the  Java-centered rule in Indonesia. But in panic, the NSC forgot  all about this. Because of its panic, it is extremely important  to reassess the role of the shell-shocked NSC in foreign  relations whose credibility crumbled during the crisis.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Losses increase at refocused Harrington Harrington Kilbride, the magazine publisher, suffered an increased loss after closing two thirds of its titles to concentrate on contract publishing and conferences. Pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.38m in the six months to June 30 compared with a deficit of Pounds 1.08m for the whole of 1993 and a profit of Pounds 621,000 at the interim stage last year. There is no interim dividend (1.7p) and the shares fell 10p to 42p. Turnover in the period under review fell 10 per cent to Pounds 7.88m (Pounds 8.76m), while the cost of sales rose 20 per cent to Pounds 6.12m (Pounds 5.11m). The company blamed its reduced margins on the high cost of establishing its new conference activities. In August the company revoked its proposal to pay a 3.2p final dividend for 1993 after bad debt provisions led it to publish re-audited accounts. The share price almost halved when late extra provisions of Pounds 3m were made in June. The company, which claims to be the UK's second largest contract publisher, expects to turn round its losses in the second half. Fifteen contracts, worth Pounds 4m of turnover this year, have been won, of which less than Pounds 1m was recognised in the first half. Losses per share stood at 13.7p (earnings of 4.1p).</p>

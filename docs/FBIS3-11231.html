			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Raul Beltran] </F>   [Text] The Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] is unhappy. It  says we cannot report the data coming from the Voting Table  Boards; that is what the TSE is saying and is threatening to  take action against the radio station. I would like to tell the  TSE gentlemen that the political parties not the news media have  accepted that law, a law that gags the freedom of thought to  broadcast facts, which have already turned into news after the  voting ended. So as not to cause problems to this company, I am  henceforth going to be silent on the survey and the results  coming from the Voting Table Boards from all over the country.  I only have one thing to say to the TSE gentlemen, who are  supposedly living in a democratic country: Not even the  country's most sinister criminal dictatorships kept the news  media from reporting the results that came from the Voting Table  Boards. That is what you, TSE gentlemen, have done. I am  publicly asking you, for tomorrow and the next elections, to  correct the tremendous disarray you generated, as thousands of  Salvadorans did not appear on the voting lists. Before gagging  the news media, correct the disarray inside the TSE for the sake  of all Salvadorans. Colleagues from this station all over the  country, we will keep our information to ourselves. One has to  express regret that politicians of the TSE and the parties have  accepted a law that is not for the news media. The news media  and the people's will must not be gagged. That is the sad thing.    TSE gentlemen, allow me to repeat this: Not even the  country's most sinister and criminal tyrannies succeeded in  subduing the news media, as you have tried to do today. Long  live freedom of expression, something for which we will fight  tirelessly from this trench. I regret the conduct and  pseudolegal position of the TSE gentlemen.</p>

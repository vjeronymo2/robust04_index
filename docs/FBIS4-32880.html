			<p>Rejected   <F P=102>   PY3105033494 Lima Global de Television Network in Spanish  0130 GMT 31 May 94 </F>  <F P=103> PY3105033494 </F> <F P=104>  Lima Global de Television Network </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] Based on the contention that the time that has  elapsed since the implementation of the Constitution has not  been sufficient to warrant its amendment, the Constitutional  Committee of the Peruvian Constituent Congress tonight decided  to turn down a petition to amend the Constitution, including a  proposal that would cause President Alberto Fujimori to step  down six months before the election date in order for him to be  eligible to seek his reelection. The decision provoked protest  within the opposition.    In justifying the decision, Congressman Carlos Ferrero Costa  said that only five months have elapsed since the implementation  of the Constitution.    [Begin Ferrero recording] In the first place, the president  may step down whether a constitutional reform is approved or  not. No constitutional reform is needed for the president to  step down. Secondly, nowhere in the world is the incumbent  president required to step down in order to seek his reelection.  [end recording]</p>

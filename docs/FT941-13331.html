			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Squabble may spoil life's ambition: Alison Smith examines a long-running regulatory challenge confronting the UK financial services industry 'I want high standards objectively delivered . . . I want genuine self-regulation . . . I want people to put mistakes right with their own money . . . I want an independent committee of inquiry to look at investor protection.' It is an advertisement that the Prudential, the UK's largest life insurance group, has not yet written. But, in the style of the group's current campaign, it would capture the - sometimes conflicting - aspirations of the main players in the British life industry for their future regulatory framework. Not everyone is going to be satisfied. The board of the Personal Investment Authority - the embryonic self-regulatory organisation which many in the industry hope will overcome fears about the way life products are sold - meets today. It will discuss its application for recognition by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog. On one side the board faces pressure from the SIB to restore public confidence in an industry hit by concern over, for example, the sale of personal pension schemes. On the other side, there are many in the industry who fear that the SIB's demands will prolong uncertainty over how the financial services sector is regulated. Since the 1986 financial services act introduced the system of self-regulation within a statutory framework, there has been an unsettling series of changes. What role the PIA should carve for itself has been a matter of debate since early 1992. Then moves began to replace the widely criticised system under which regulation of retail financial services is split mainly between Lautro and Fimbra, responsible for life companies and independent financial advisers respectively. There still is no consensus among practitioners about the best way forward: as the arguments have raged some, including Mr Mick Newmarch, the Prudential's chief executive, have said that the best course is to move to a full-blown statutory system. Now the debate may be coming to a head. The PIA, led by Mr Joe Palmer, a former chief executive of insurance group Legal &amp; General who became PIA chairman late last year, is close to finalising draft proposals to present to the SIB and to the industry in the coming weeks. If the PIA's plan fails to win enough support, the case for the government introducing statutory regulation will be strengthened. All the indications are that the PIA's plans fit closely the specifications of the SIB. Last January its chairman, Mr Andrew Large, told the PIA he wanted 'a step change in standards and practices'. That, he said, must include having only a minority of industry representatives on the PIA board, tougher criteria for admitting companies or individuals into the industry, and an effective system for monitoring compliance with PIA rules. Assuming the PIA board agrees the main points of its application for recognition today, the SIB should announce soon that it is 'minded to recognise' the PIA as a regulator. The next stage will be for the PIA to publish its prospectus and, if it is to become operational, persuade a majority of the life industry to accept it. The PIA hopes to be open for business this summer. But the signs are that the industry is not likely to offer unconditional support for the prospectus: the shadow boxing of recent months will turn into a test of nerves. Four main issues are at stake: Most contentious is the composition of the PIA board. The PIA wants nine of its 19 members to be practitioners, and the other 10, including the chairman and the chief executive, to be 'public interest' directors who do not work in the industry. This has met stiff opposition. Mr Michael Doerr, chief executive of Friends Provident, the mutually owned life and pensions group, says self-regulation should mean just that: 'I'm looking for a change of mind on board membership.' In an attempt at conciliation, Mr Palmer, PIA chairman, has said public interest directors could include people who had previously worked in the industry. But Mr Jim Stretton, deputy managing director of Standard Life, who resigned from the PIA board earlier this month in opposition to its plans, says: 'This would be the worst of all possible worlds.' He believes that Mr Palmer's proposals would fall short of genuine self-regulation, while still not convincing the public that non-practitioner board members were acting in the public interest. Admission procedures are also sensitive for the PIA. Almost all the organisations and individuals who will apply to come under the PIA's umbrella will have been accepted by existing regulators. To exclude significant numbers would anger the industry, but if the PIA excludes nobody, it would be harder to show that the regulatory regime was tougher. 'An opportunity would be lost if PIA membership was not seen as something you have to aspire to,' says Mr Arthur Selman, senior executive responsible for financial services at Halifax building society. The most likely outcome is that some companies and individuals will be excluded - but the admissions procedure will not be the last word and the PIA will rely on continued monitoring to weed out the fraudulent and incompetent. Financing the PIA. The industry is reluctant to bear significantly higher costs for regulation. But the PIA appears to have pitched its budgeting sensitively, envisaging first-year running costs of about Pounds 30m - only slightly higher than the combined running costs of the existing regime. Arrangements for compensation. Here the picture is less clear-cut, since the PIA's plans depend on the outcome of a separate consultation exercise by the SIB on proposed changes to the investors' compensation scheme, which covers all financial services and ensures that badly advised customers can be compensated even if the company involved cannot make payments. 'Mistakes will happen - we want to be sure that when they do the people who make them put them right with their own money,' says Mr Chris Sharp, chief executive of Northern Rock building society and a PIA board member. On all four issues, the options for life insurance companies which do not wish to accept the PIA's prospectus are limited. The regulators have the upper hand: the SIB could increase the pressure to join the PIA by withdrawing recognition of Lautro and Fimbra. One alternative is for life companies and advisers to opt to be regulated directly by the SIB in an effort to undermine the PIA. The disarray this would cause could, if enough exercised this right, trigger early moves to statutory regulation of financial services. That may please some in the life industry - but would be the opposite of what most practitioners, who support self-regulation, would want. So the only realistic option for disgruntled life insurers is to ensure there are enough voices opposing the PIA's plans to stop the organisation from gaining credibility. In the brinkmanship likely in the next few months, the widespread desire for stable regulatory arrangements could prove decisive. Few leading figures in the industry have an appetite for confrontation with the SIB. Mr Newmarch of the Prudential has not ruled out the Prudential joining the PIA. Similarly, Mr Stretton of Standard Life says his company 'is not in the business of just making gestures'. Nevertheless, the concern in the financial services industry over the PIA's proposals are real. There are few who are prepared to offer unqualified support for the new body. If its long-term future is to be assured - and a statutory regime avoided - it will need to prove that it can win the goodwill of the industry and deliver high standards for investors. The ructions surrounding its establishment have not been auspicious.</p>

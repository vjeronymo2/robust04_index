			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Brussels set to clear ASLK-CGER acquisition THE BELGIAN government is likely to clear the way today for Fortis, the Dutch-Belgian financial services group, to buy a majority stake in ASLK-CGER, the state-owned savings and insurance group. The government hopes to raise BFr35bn (Dollars 992m) with the sale of shares in ASLK-CGER, which has a national network of banking and insurance branches. It is the first candidate for sale in a four-year privatisation programme which will help cut Belgium's large budget deficit. At their regular cabinet meeting today, ministers should approve the change in legislation which will allow Fortis to acquire a majority of the group. Fortis was likely to buy 49.9% of the shares with an option to but a majority later. The price is still under negotiation. Meanwhile, Fortis, which groups the activities of AG of Belgium and Amev of the Netherlands, reported a 20 per cent rise in first-half net profit to Ecu226.7m (Dollars 194m), compared with Ecu188.5m in the same period of 1992. Total revenues grew by 10 per cent, from Ecu4.28bn to Ecu4.7bn, on strong increases in income from life insurance and banking, particularly in the Netherlands. Fortis said it expected operating results and net profits for the whole of 1993 to surpass the 1992 figure. The company also benefited from a strong increase in capital gains - from Ecu50.6m to Ecu93.8m - boosted by profits from the sale of most of its 14.7 per cent stake in Generale de Banque, Belgium's largest bank. That sale, and a number of smaller disposals, have left Fortis well placed to buy into ASLK-CGER. Fortis was reluctant yesterday about the ASLK-CGER deal. A spokeswoman pointed out that since the end of July the Dutch-Belgian company has had exclusive rights to negotiate with the savings bank. That privilege lasts until October 15. Generale de Banque complained earlier this week that the Belgian government had missed a great opportunity to regenerate interest in the Brussels bourse by rejecting its proposal to mastermind a British-style public offer of shares in ASLK-CGER.</p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / US Senate to hold Whitewater hearings The US Senate has voted unanimously to hold hearings on the Whitewater affair, but has left to future negotiation their date and the ground they will cover. The compromise, agreed on Thursday night, represents qualified victories for Republicans who have been demanding hearings and Democrats who have resisted them. No grants of immunity from prosecution will be given to those summoned to be questioned. President Bill Clinton seemed resigned to the fact that there would be a congressional forum but again said it would be found not to be worth the expense. The general White House mood is more upbeat than it was 10 days ago, with the president and Mr Hillary Clinton embarked on a heavy round of public appearances to push the administration's domestic agenda. One senior official said of Whitewater: 'We've moved from crisis management to problem management.' The Senate resolution also gives Mr Robert Fiske, the independent counsel, time to conduct his inquiry into whether government officials have conspired to obstruct federal investigations of the failed Arkansas savings and loan entity at the centre of the first family's land and financial dealings, in their home state in the 1980s. Still unresolved by the Senate action are possible hearings by the House banking committee, tentatively scheduled for sometime late next week. Congressman Jim Leach of Iowa, senior Republican on the committee, continues to insist that they be held, but Mr Fiske is unhappy with them and the Democratic leaders in the House are pressing for a delay. Mr Fiske's federal grand jury took testimony on Thursday from two senior White House members, Mr Bernard Nussbaum, former legal counsel, and Mr Harold Ickes, the presidential counsellor mainly involved with healthcare. An additional subpoena has been served on Mr George Stephanopoulos, a close adviser to the president. This brings to 11 the number of White House and Treasury officials called to testify before the grand jury. Meanwhile, the New York Times yesterday said that Mrs Clinton had made as much as Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 66,934) on the commodities market in 1978-1979, thus transforming the Clinton family finances. She was advised in her investments, according to the article, by Mr James Blair, a prominent Arkansas lawyer and an investor long close to the Clintons. Mr Blair's principal legal client was Tyson's Food, the chicken producer and big Arkansas company. The president said yesterday that his wife's investment was 'perfectly independent and perfectly legal', and that taxes had been paid on the money made. The rest of the article, he added, was 'innuendo, unsupported allegation.' Mr Blair responded by saying it was ridiculous for the Clintons to have to 'weed their friends out and say they can only have friends who are sweeping the streets.'</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: BPB shares fall after dividend cut revealed THE SHARE price of BPB Industries, Europe's biggest plasterboard manufacturer, fell sharply yesterday after the company revealed plans to cut dividends by a third for the year to March 31. Following the announcement, the group's share price fell by 7 per cent to close 17p down at 217p, wiping more than Pounds 84m off the company's stock market value. The dividend forecast accompanied the latest euroconvertible bond to be announced by a British company. BPB has raised Pounds 64m from a 15 year subordinated bond with a coupon of 7.25 per cent. The bonds are convertible into 24.8m new ordinary shares at 258p apiece, representing just under 5 per cent of BPB shares currently in issue. BPB's share price had risen by 90 per cent since last September following the end of a bitter European price war between the three largest plasterboard producers: BPB, Lafarge Coppee of France and Knauf of Germany. Plasterboard prices in Britain have risen by about a fifth since the beginning of last year. Prices in France have increased by about a quarter and in Germany by about 15 per cent over the same period, according to BPB. Mr Mark Stockdale, construction analyst with Warburg Securities, said the decline yesterday in BPB's share price was 'due to some investors switching out of BPB ordinary shares into the higher yielding bonds. There was also some concern about falling plasterboard sales in France.' Mr Stockdale said there may have been pockets of disquiet over the extent of the dividend cut, even though most people had been expecting it. Mr John Maxwell, BPB's chief executive, said that the company was taking advantage of the recent strength of its share price and low interest rates to improve its borrowing profile. Proceeds of the issue would be used to redeem short-term debt payable within 18 months, which as a proportion of the total loan portfolio would fall from 66 per cent to 40 per cent. Net debt of Pounds 266m currently was equivalent to 38 per cent of shareholders' funds. Gearing, however, would fall slightly as a result of the issue. The company said that it intended to pay a final dividend of 4.8p for the year to the end of March, compared with 7.25p at the corresponding stage last year. This follows a reduction in the interim dividend from 4p to 2.7p, announced in November. Mr Maxwell said: 'Directors felt that it would not be prudent, given the uncertain outlook for continental European markets in particular, to have an uncovered dividend. We were required to make a forecast with the issue.' He said that volume sales which had been 8 per cent higher at the half year were expected to have risen by only two or three per cent for the year as a whole following a fall in French sales during the second half.

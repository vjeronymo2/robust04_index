			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Most metal prices closed softer on the LME as Monday's gains were not sustained. LEAD finished near 6 1/2 -year lows. Dealers said the lead market finally broke below long-standing support, and looked set for further declines. Meanwhile, metals such as ALUMINIUM and NICKEL, which were boosted on Monday by concern over Russian political tension, lacked follow-through. COPPER also eased, with three-month metal drifting below Dollars 2,200 a tonne, although underlying producer buying stemmed the decline, as did general supply-side concerns. On the London bullion market GOLD prices displayed an easier trend. Dealers said that the market would probably move to test support around the Dollars 331-a-troy-ounce level after failing to breach resistance at Dollars 333. New York raw SUGAR remained broadly lower at midday but was well above the lows logged on the opening. Traders said profit taking after Monday's extension of three-year highs weighed on values but the market remained supported by tightening global supply and bullish chart signs.

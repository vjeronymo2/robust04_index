			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] On the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, the  newspaper AL-AHRAM writes in its editorial: The final round of  these talks ended last Wednesday, having made important progress  regarding formulating the final agreement. All indications  showed that the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho was to  begin on the date which the two sides had agreed on. This  deadline was set for 13 April.    However, everything changed suddenly after the horrific  Hebron massacre. The venue of the negotiations stopped being of  any consequence, be it Washington, Cairo, or Taba where Egypt  was providing all possible support for the progress of the  talks. What is important now is that the talks must focus on  providing international protection for the Palestinian people  and on taking the necessary measures to guarantee that the  Israeli aggressors do not attack the peace-loving Palestinian  people.</p>

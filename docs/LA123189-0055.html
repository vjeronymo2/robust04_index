			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: CRYSTAL BOYS BY PAI HSIEN-YUNG TRANSLATED BY HOWARD  GOLDBLATT (GAY SUNSHINE PRESS: $11.95)  </P> <P> "Crystal Boys" is the first Chinese novel to focus on the buoliquan (literally  "glass community") or gay subculture. After being thrown out of his home by his  father, A-Qing , a young man in his late teens, enters the world of hustlers,  pickpockets and petty con men who frequent a seedy park in Taipei. The  Taiwanese counterculture in "Crystal Boys" is oddly reminiscent of the gay  underworld that John Rechy described in "City of Night:" a hidden realm with  its special names, code of conduct and values that extend to a private  mythology centered on the ill-starred love of the socially prominent Dragon  Prince for the wild delinquent, Phoenix Boy. Pai Hsien-yung uses his  characters' gritty adventures to explore the conflict between the desire for  Western material goods and traditional Chinese mores. Although his work is  virtually unknown in the United States, Hsien-yung's novels are highly  respected in Taiwan and much of the rest of the world.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mehdi Mirvahedi: "Political Line!"] </F>   [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Any logical person can tell  with a mere glance at HAMSHAHRI that despite its allegations,  its administrators have adopted an insincere policy and possibly  think that the people are naive. After all, who does not know  that HAMSHAHRI has come so that His Excellency the Mayor will  stay?    In its commentary [on the first anniversary of the  newspaper], HAMSHAHRI wrote: "We have sincerely tried, contrary  to some existing newspapers, not to be the mouthpiece or  spokesman for one specific line of political thought, to refrain  from making our newspaper an instrument for "settling accounts"  or "throwing rivals off the scene," and not to become involved  in shallow press disputes."    There is no doubt of the fact that HAMSHAHRI can be listed  among those who are "indifferent" to the world of politics.  However, undoubtedly we cannot agree that HAMSHAHRI is nobody's  mouthpiece. It is very clear that analyzing important and basic  domestic and foreign issues is not an easy task, and having  political thought is a newspaper's strength and not a weakness,  as our dear colleagues at HAMSHAHRI believe. But the fact that  they have not chosen to enter this field is probably because  they are unable to and not because they do not want to.  [passage omitted]    Finally, despite the remarks by HAMSHAHRI's proprietor that  "our initiatives and innovations and our use of new techniques  is good for competition" we should say that this competition  with the other newspapers is not being carried out in a healthy  atmosphere. HAMSHAHRI has acquired the new techniques by making  use of the municipality's general budget, which is the money  that the municipality gets from the people. And selling a  newspaper at one-tenth of the price of other newspapers is press  dumping [preceding word in English] and not healthy competition!</p>

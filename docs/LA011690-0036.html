"This guy wandered out into the  street where there was no crosswalk and into the traffic. He had done this  before." Bellante said Kocan had been cited last month for jaywalking in the  area, but details of that incident were unavailable.  </P> <P> The detective said results of tests to determine if Kocan was intoxicated were  incomplete.  </P></p>

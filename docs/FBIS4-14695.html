			<p>BFN     [Text] Negotiators from Georgia and its separatist region  of Abkhazia have reached a ceasefire agreement, Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev said.    He told Interfax and Moscow's Ostankino Television that the  negotiators, at talks in Moscow mediated by Russian and U.N.  representatives, also hammered out a solution to the refugee  problem that conforms to the international law and allows all  those who have left their homes to come back, with the exception  of those proved guilty of fanning up the conflict.    Some other legal problems, including that of Abkhazia's  status, are still unsolved and will be tackled at the next round  of talks, Kozyrev said.    A formal Georgian-Abkhazian ceasefire accord is expected to  be signed in Moscow in the presence of Russian and U.N.  officials on Monday.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Recovery signs at Verson as losses drop VERSON International, the Midlands-based machinery maker, yesterday announced a sharp reduction in losses for the year ended January 31. Mr Tim Kelleher, chairman, said the improvement reflected a 'materially improved financial performance.' With recession biting, turnover fell from Pounds 90m to Pounds 82.4m but the group managed to record profits of Pounds 1.58m before interest, compared with a loss of Pounds 7.64m, after taking account of sharply higher royalty and service fee income of Pounds 5.57m (Pounds 843,000). At the pre-tax level the deficit emerged at Pounds 3.27m (Pounds 12.3m). The results were badly hit by losses from Verson Wilkins, the UK press business, where there was a sharp downturn in demand for new presses and significant cost overrun on the contract, Mr Kelleher explained. Verson Wilkins' overheads have been materially reduced and directors are in the process of merging its operations with Clearing (UK) and focusing the business on parts and rebuilding work. Mr Kelleher said that this would progressively mean a move back to profitability. The group is moving forward on a plan to reduce dependence on bank debt to fund expected continuing growth. On current trading Mr Kelleher said that home market order intake remained depressed. Shareholder approval is to be sought to eliminate the deficit on the profit and loss account leading to a resumption of dividends.</p>

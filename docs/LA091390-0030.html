			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'FAT' JOKES THE BREAD AND BUTTER OF 'BABES'  </P> <P> The new Fox comedy series "Babes" is about three rotund sisters. In the  premiere (at 8:30 tonight on Channels 11 and 6), Darlene (Susan Peretz) and  Charlene (Wendie Jo Sperber) encourage Marlene (Lesley Boone) to get a job as  an oversize hosiery model.  </P> <P> The actresses are fine, but "Babes" is not, its few glimmers of real humor  obliterated by "fat" jokes, one after the other.  </P> <P> "Babes" is pioneering, however. It introduces a new ism to TV comedy. In its  50-year history, American TV has been guilty of racism, anti-Semitism, sexism,  ageism and probably other isms as well.  </P> <P> Now comes fatism.  </P> <P> On the one hand, "Babes" gives lip service to opposing fat bias. Charlene's  boyfriend finds her sexy. Moreover, brassy Darlene tells self-effacing Marlene,  "You're a beautiful woman. Don't be ashamed of who you are." And when Marlene  is called a "porker" by a commercial director, her sisters are outraged.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the entire premise for "Babes" -- its reason for existing,  it appears -- is that fat is funny.  </P> <P> It's in the sisters' body language. Two express anger by butting people in the  stomach with their heads a la the Three Stooges.  </P> <P> It's in the jokes.  </P> <P> * When Darlene shows up, Charlene says, "It's either my sister, Darlene, or a  piece of Sky Lab."  </P> <P> * A secretary tells Marlene when she arrives for an audition, "Take a seat.  Take as many as you need."  </P> <P> It's in the sight gags.  </P> <P> * When all three sisters sleep in the same bed, it, predictably, collapses.  </P> <P> * Darlene eats cereal for breakfast -- a whole box.  </P> <P> * When Darlene gets up from her chair, it clings to her body.  </P> <P> No, not funny, just gross.

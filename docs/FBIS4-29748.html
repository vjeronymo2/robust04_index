			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- The House of Councilors' ad  hoc committee on political reform on Tuesday [21 June] passed  bills to modify the constituencies for upper house elections.    The bills, submitted jointly by the Liberal Democratic  Party,  the Social Democratic Party and three other groups, are designed  to achieve a better balance in representation by adding one seat  each in four constituencies, while slashing four seats from  others.    There will be no change in the size of the second chamber at  252 seats.    The bills are scheduled to be sent to the House of  Representatives after their expected passage Wednesday by the  full upper house.</p>

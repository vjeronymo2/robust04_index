			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Revolutionary forces which will destroy income tax: What has gone wrong with the way that revenue is raised?. And how do we find a more coherent system? The tax reforms of the 1980s have failed; the tax system is a fraud; and next Tuesday's new-look Budget, however hard chancellor Kenneth Clarke and his officials have laboured, is unlikely to make things better. Can anything be done to restore legitimacy to the tax system? And if so what would it look like? In arguments about Budget changes, we often forget the really big question: have we got the wrong system in the first place? Britain's first unified Budget which combines tax and spending, is a good time to try to answer it. But first remember that the stability of the nation may depend on having a tax system which citizens think is reasonable, however much they dislike paying. It was a tax revolt that helped bring about the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and a tax revolt that led to the foundation of the US. More recently, Margaret Thatcher's ill-judged obsession with the poll tax was the immediate cause of her being toppled from power. Tax was the issue which lost elections for George Bush and Neil Kinnock on two sides of the Atlantic last year. Although tax changes are politically fraught and technically difficult, strong economic forces are now pushing Britain and other countries towards radical reform. What, then, has gone wrong after so much change and debate? Public discussion has tended to focus on the way in which taxes redistribute wealth from one section of the community to another. This function of tax is often justified by the principle that an extra pound is worth more to the poor than to the rich. At another level, there has been vigorous debate about the level at which taxes make the economy less efficient, for example by weakening incentives. Above all, there was a presumption that the system would be administered by a wise and benevolent government (like the guardians of Plato's Republic). As a result, discussions on tax policy were elitist and secretive. Until recently, these matters scarcely concerned most people because, as John Kay and Mervyn King say in their classic book The British Tax System, less than a fifth of the working population in 1939 paid income tax. Most people paid only indirect taxes and there was no corporation tax. Everything changed with the second world war and the rise of the welfare state. Since 1960 the whole of the working population has become subject to income tax. The collision of an imperfect income tax system with the growth of public spending gave politicians a huge incentive to mess about with the system by offering special benefits to interest groups who might help them to get elected. The tax system came to reward people not for what they did but for what they were: home owners, pension scheme members, personal equity plan holders and the rest. Rival interest groups divided the spoils according to prevailing political pressure. The result was that patterns of saving, investing and working became heavily distorted. Tax avoidance became a growth industry. The idea of a progressive income tax that rose more than proportionately with income was subverted. Distorted incentives undermined economic efficiency. It was at this point that conventional wisdom about redistribution confronted an intellectual challenge from the libertarian right. In The Constitution of Liberty, Friedrich Hayek, following Von Mises, launched a frontal assault on the progressive character of the tax system, arguing that a democracy in which the majority was free to impose a discriminatory tax burden on the minority was unjust and oppressive. He implied that the rearrangement of income and property rights by a process of haggling between interest groups is ultimately destabilising and that if people really understood how coercive the nature of the redistributive process was, they would be most unlikely to endorse it. At the same time the development of public choice theory in the US challenged the view of a benign state run by philosopher kings. James Buchanan and his followers offered instead a vision of a state which had become predatory, using its monopoly power over the tax base to maximise revenue. Theirs was a populist and constitutional alternative to the elitist, approach. They sought non-electoral means to constrain the coercive nature of democracy, which Lord Hailsham dubbed in Britain as 'elective dictatorship'. The theory found an echo in the Californian tax revolt of the late 1970s, when voters successfully restrained property taxes through the celebrated Proposition 13. The new Right did not score a decisive victory, however. The idea of a social contract, outlined by the philosopher John Rawls, provides a potential justification for redistribution that has been used as a powerful counterweight to Hayek and his followers. Others, such as Dan Usher, the Canadian economist, while attacking the arbitrary re-assignment of income and property rights through the tax system, argued that redistribution which threw up losers as well as winners was necessary to make capitalism acceptable. Yet by the 1980s the practical case for the reform of heavily distorted tax systems across the world was overwhelming. The motto of reformers was 'fiscal neutrality' - the doctrine that tax should not unnecessarily influence the way people spend and save. Such neutralism was hostile to the kind of social engineering in which the tax system had transformed share ownership from a personal to an institutional habit and turned the British into a nation of home owners. It was also hostile to high marginal rates of direct taxation. So the thrust of reform was to reduce headline rates of tax and to broaden the tax base by scrapping allowances and reliefs and by increasing indirect imposts such as value added tax. The formula was applied with varying degrees of rigour in all the English-speaking economies. The aim was to minimise disincentives and bring back some coherence to a ramshackle system that reflected a host of conflicting priorities. This brings us to the fraud. For, while some gains were made on the long path towards neutrality, the overall result of all this frenetic budgetary activity is that the boundaries of the state have not been rolled back and the taxpayer is no better off. In the March budget, the Treasury's Red Book was projecting that public expenditure in 1993-4 would amount to 45 1/2 per cent of national income, higher than the 44 per cent which the Thatcher government inherited when it took office in 1979. Taxes, meantime, at 34 1/2 per cent of national income are back to much the same level as in 1979, having been higher than that in all the intervening years. Even allowing for different stages in the economic cycle, it is clear that the taxpayer has been hoodwinked by political rhetoric. The government's tax-cutting credentials are a sham. Not surprising, say the public choice theorists - this is a practical victory for the predatory state, notwithstanding Lady Thatcher and all her works. The most that tax reform has achieved is the reassignment of tax shares around different groups in the population, with some modest gains in economic efficiency. Already those gains are being eroded or off-set by other changes. The process of simplification started by Lord Howe (chancellor from 1979 to 1983) and continued by Lord Lawson (1983-1989) led to a plethora of income tax rates being slimmed down to just two: 25 per cent and 40 per cent. But with Norman Lamont (1990-1993), Clarke's predecessor, the tax system acquired new encrustations with with the announcement of a 20 per cent tax rate. The method of taxing pension funds, one of the more coherent parts of the system, is being dismantled on an ad hoc basis for no better reason than that the Treasury needs the money. New reliefs have been created and existing reliefs tinkered with. A new cycle of sharing out the spoils and adding new wrinkles is under way. There is, meantime, a widely held view that the limit of how much can be taken from citizens in tax has almost been reached. One response is to say, why worry? If people are reluctant to pay higher taxes, but continue to say they want more of the state services such as education, health and pensions, perhaps this opaque system is in an obscure way giving the electorate what it wants. Does the libertarian right's contention that big government is growing inexorably stand up to close examination? As John Hills, of the London School of Economics, has shown in his study of the welfare state for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the share of national income taken by education health and social security has levelled out since the mid-1970s. It has fluctuated with the economic cycle; and the latest upturn in spending is mainly because of recession. Yet it seems perverse to suggest that people might be happier with the results of an opaque and deceptive political process rather than one in which clear choices are on offer. And whatever the level of tolerance of tax in Britain - and that tolerance will be tested by both Norman Lamont's and Kenneth Clarke's tax increases which have yet to take effect - there are wider grounds for thinking that tax reform in the developed world will develop new impetus. The first is that Europe, regardless of the future of the European Union, cannot escape confronting new taxation problems of a kind that is more familiar in the US federal system. And, since the widespread abolition of exchange controls, capital has become internationally mobile. The result is likely to be a long run shrinkage of national tax bases. Without exchange controls, it is no longer possible for governments to tax the citizen through inflation by defaulting on their IOUs. The citizen can move his investment elsewhere. Governments are following the example set by Lord Lawson in seeking to offer low rates of corporation tax to inward investors. They recognise that investment decisions are increasingly influenced by tax considerations. That is how international competition in tax policy squeezes the corporate tax base. Over the long term the ageing of the population in the developed world will also impose an increasing burden on those workers who are not internationally mobile. So just as US states find that high taxes and highly redistributive tax systems drive away people and companies to lower taxed states, European governments will find their power to tax is eroded. What reforms would cope with a world of increasingly footloose taxpayers? From the public choice theorists' perspective, this competition in fiscal policy is a reform in itself. Protective state functions - defence, law and order - will no doubt continue to be financed by central government. But taxes for other purpose will be closely questioned. To that end Geoff Mulgan and Robin Murray, of the independent think tank Demos, have argued for hypothecation or earmarking taxes so that people know what a particular tax is being spent on. Yet as the Institute for Fiscal Studies has pointed out, if the level of spending is dictated by earmarked tax revenues, it will go up and down with the economic cycle. So national insurance revenues go down in recession, just when the need for social security goes up. A reform with wider potential is the radical system suggested by the Meade Committee in the late 1970s. This was that people should be taxed on what they spend rather than on what they earn or own. This would transfer taxation to the point at which people derive benefit from their money rather than the benefit they might obtain from their income or assets. An expenditure tax, would overcome all the traditional problems that income taxes have with inflation, depreciation, the valuation of pension rights and of human capital. By operating on cash flow rather than income it abolishes the differential taxation of particular forms of income and saving. It can be progressive, rising more than proportionately with income. Politicians often claim that the administrative problems of switching to an expenditure tax would be overwhelming. But perhaps politicians are also worried that such a tax would be more transparent. Individuals and companies would discover that their tax bills were far higher than today's headline rates. It takes a crisis to push through such a radical reform. But many tax theorists, including Charles McClure, main author of the first Reagan tax reform package, believe that income tax, on which the 1980s reforms were based, is in its death throes.</p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Business and the Law: Bill pulls the wrong punches - A document likely to disappoint lawyers and businessmen The UK government's draft arbitration bill, described by Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, as 'a key element of (the government's) deregulation initiative', is likely to fall short of its ambitious aims. Far from effecting much-needed deregulation, the bill would bring only minor improvements in the substantive law. Its main merit is in consolidating in a single statute the law now dispersed in three arbitration acts, some other statutes and numerous judgments. In short, it would simply make it easier to find the bad rules in the law. The bill's main weakness is that it would leave untouched the intrusive - and uniquely English - regulation of arbitration, which, after all, is a private industry. If adopted in its present form, the bill would continue to make English arbitration - particularly marine, insurance and commodity contracts - unnecessarily slow and expensive, and to drive parties seeking the resolution of their disputes to friendlier and cheaper shores. The UK Department of Trade and Industry is inviting comments from the legal profession and business by June 30. English arbitration law lags its Scottish counterpart and its reform had been considered for many years by a DTI departmental advisory committee. The committee was originally chaired by Lord Mustil, a great believer in an arbitration system regulated and dominated by the commercial court. His succession in the chair by Lord Justice Steyn gave rise to a hope of a more progressive attitude. These hopes were boosted when the committee decided to follow the logical structure of the model law of arbitration adopted by United Nations Commission for International Trade Law (UNCITRAL); it commissioned private lawyers to draft a bill. However, though the logical structure of the model law survives in the draft bill, the draft produced by the private lawyers had to be revised, at Whitehall's insistence, to conform to the convoluted style of parliamentary drafters. Though the bill is more lucid than the run-of-the-mill legislation, it is still burdened by verbosity and is far from user-friendly for the average businessman. But the bill does contain some good points. The bill makes it clear that there is no need for the arbitration to follow the procedure of the High Court. The law never required that it should. It was the legal profession which transformed the originally informal arbitration by businessmen or technical experts into a wigless litigation. The bill would also widen the range of admissible evidence and remove such absurdity as the qualification of business and production records as inadmissible hearsay. It would confirm the principle that an arbitration clause survives an invalid agreement of which it is a part - its inclusion in the model law reflects an international consensus on this crucial issue. This measure has already been taken on board by the Court of Appeal on the grounds of the 'practical advantage of one-stop adjudication', but its adoption by the bill is valuable: the inclusion of the measure at this stage would protect it against attempts to excise it in the House of Lords where the views of Lord Mustil carry weight on arbitration matters. The bill also adopts the model law rule that an arbitrator, such as a judge, should be immune from prosecution for negligence, unless he acts in bad faith. In contrast with such useful restatements and marginal improvements, the bill would leave untouched the three main shortcomings of English arbitration law: the rejection of arbitration clauses enabling the arbitrator to decide according to generally recognised principles of law, fairness and justice; the impossibility of opting out from the right of appeal to the courts in the arbitration clause of international marine, insurance and commodity contracts and any domestic contracts; the possibility of leaving to the very end of the proceedings objections to the arbitrator's juris-diction. The model law, now widely followed in Commonwealth countries, provides in Article 28(3) that parties may authorise the arbitral tribunal to act as mediator or to make an award according to what appears to him to be fair and just. It is a pity that the advisory committee reached the conclusion that this should not be followed. While in German courts it is a duty of the judge to attempt settlement before the opening of the trial or during the trial, in England mediation cannot be part of the judicial process and some experts hold that an arbitrator disqualifies himself by an attempt to mediate between the parties. Such a narrow concept of arbitration makes it confrontational, lawyer-dominated, slow and costly. It is hardly surprising that special agencies offering alternative methods of dispute resolution - mediation, mini-trial, for example - are now mushrooming on both sides of the Atlantic. Unless existing rules are relaxed, English arbitration is bound to loose a good deal of work to alternative dispute resolution at home or to foreign arbitration. Non-legalistic solution of business disputes is already common practice in Japan and China and other emerging markets of south-east Asia. The greatest objection to current English arbitration legislation - and one most loudly voiced at international conferences - is the possibility of appealing to the courts against the arbitral award on issues of law. The 'escape by appeal' deprives the award of its finality; worse, a rich party, or one backed by an insurance company or a ship-owners' club, can force its opponent to give up by a mere threat of taking the dispute to the High Court and from there possibly to the Appeal Court or even the House of Lords. This is, of course, a mockery of the original purpose of arbitration. It is regrettable that the bill proposes to uphold the present rule that allows parties to exclude such appeal in their arbitration clause only in international disputes and only if it is not a marine, insurance or commodity case. In such international disputes, and in all domestic disputes, such exclusion of appeal is allowed only after the proceedings start. Finally, Section 3(1) of the bill would retain the present rule which enables parties to raise jurisdictional objections at any time, even after the award was made. A defeated party can try to challenge an unfavourable award, or at least delay its enforcement, by claiming that the arbitrator had no jurisdiction. In contrast, the model law provides in Article 16(2) that jurisdictional objections may be raised only at the outset of arbitration. This seems perfectly reasonable, but the consultative document states that it cannot be done in England. This is backward looking and loses sight of the much-needed deregulation.

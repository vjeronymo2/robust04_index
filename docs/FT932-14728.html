			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / West warns Serbs as forces close in on Srebrenica: Britain, US and France pledge early strengthening of sanctions THE US, Britain and France last night agreed that stronger sanctions should be imposed against Serbia as soon as possible. The announcement from the British Foreign Office came amid growing fears that the besieged Moslem town of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia was about to fall to surrounding Serb forces. The decision to push for tighter sanctions came shortly after President Bill Clinton said he believed the situation had now deteriorated to a point where Russia, the UK and France would have to consider options they had previously ruled out. The US did not specify what additional measures it would seek, though one unidentified Defence Department official was quoted as saying that bombing Bosnian Serb military installations was under consideration. In London, the Foreign Office said that Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, had been in touch with his opposite numbers in Washington and Paris. 'In view of the deteriorating situation in Srebrenica and the seriousness of what the Serbs are doing, the three agreed to adopt a Security Council resolution bringing in more sanctions against the Serbs as soon as possible.' Members of the United Nations security council were last night discussing what measures might be taken and the timing of a full Security Council meeting to adopt them. Under consideration are likely to be measures to turn sanctions into a complete economic blockade. The resolution pending before the council would tighten sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro - which form the rump Yugoslavia - by strictly controlling traffic along the Danube and curbing transshipments through Serbia. It would also require UN members to impound Serbian vessels, freeze Serbian assets, and ban all commercial vessels from entering former Yugoslav territorial waters. Also last night the council was expected to pass a separate resolution proposed by non-aligned members declaring Srebrenica and surrounding areas a safe haven with provision for UN troops to monitor the situation. Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, had already told Russian diplomats that, if the town fell, the US would not wait until after the Russian referendum on April 25 to seek more UN sanctions. Russia and Serbia have traditionally been allies, and Washington had originally promised the delay in order not to jeopardise the position of Mr Boris Yeltsin, who is seeking popular backing for his presidency. Serb forces yesterday advanced to within 1km of Srebrenica, the former silver-mining town which has come to symbolise Bosnian resistance against Serbia. But there was no confirmation of reports from Paris that Serb forces had entered the town. Last night Bosnian leaders broadcast desperate appeals to the outside world as terrorised civilians cowered in cellars to escape Serb artillery bombardments. An amateur radio operator in Srebrenica reported: 'I don't know how much longer we can resist . . . the offensive is unrelenting.' If Srebrenica surrendered, it would probably mean the end of other Moslem-held strongholds such as Gorazde and Zepa, to the south. Mr Kemal Muftic, an aide to Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic, said talks were under way on the terms of surrender of the town. 'The most important thing is to avoid a massacre,' he said. About 50 UN lorries were on standby to evacuate tens of thousands of Moslems from the town, whose population has been swollen to an estimated 30,000-50,000 inhabitants by an influx of refugees. During the past week some 60 people have been reported killed by the Serb bombardment. The US warning on sanctions coincided with a statement by Mr Hurd calling for existing economic measures against Serbia to be tightened into a full blockade. He also proposed the appointment of 'a heavyweight international figure' to ensure the full compliance with and enforcement of sanctions. Contributing to the calls for action against the Serbs, Lord Owen, one of the international mediators for a peace settlement, said the time had come for the world to consider the selective bombing of roads and bridges in Bosnia, to stop supplies reaching the Bosnian Serb forces. Mr John Smith, Labour leader, backed his proposals. Mr Hurd said the British government was not ruling out air strikes 'but we would have to be clear how they would help'. Six RAF Tornado fighter aircraft will leave Britain on Monday to enforce the no-fly zone. Meanwhile Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, stressed that Serb units would not try to take Srebrenica if its Moslem defenders agreed to disarm but his words were not being taken seriously by the UN. A small party of Canadian UN soldiers was expected to cross Serb lines to Srebrenica last night, a move which fuelled fears that the town was about to fall. The UN Protection Force said the troops would try to 'avert a major humanitarian tragedy'.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] President Rabbani has expressed his readiness to  hand over power to a council of people's representatives. He  refused to hand in his resignation in order to avoid a power  vacuum in the country and said: Because a council formed of  nine jehadi leaders is not sufficient to find the solution to  country's problems, representatives of the people will also  participate in the council. After failing to achieve a victory  against the Islamic state and the failure of his coup d'etat,  Golboddin persistently insists that Rabbani was appointed to the  presidency under the Jalalabad agreement, and thus will  relinquish power after his term expires. In response, the  Afghan president has said that he does not insist on staying in  power, and whenever a council is formed of the real  representatives of the nation, he is ready to hand over power to  them. [passage indistinct] On the one hand Golboddin alleges  that no government exists and therefore is not in control  anywhere. However, the people of Afghanistan, and especially  the people of Kabul, recently saw the broad gathering of  governors and jehadi personalities from different provinces. It  is not clear why Golboddin cannot see this real and complete  power. [passage omitted] He accuses the council, which is to be  held in a few days, and continues his crimes as in the past. In  order to satisfy himself even for a few moments and to forget  the bitter memories of all his weaknesses and defeats, Golboddin  bestows upon himself the presidency of the state of Afghanistan,  and declares, completely shamelessly, that he is ready to  relinquish the office of premiership. It is not known to which  premiership he is referring. It is clear that Golboddin knows  what he means more than anyone else, and knows how laughable his  words are. Why has a person who kneels before the dirtiest  figure in history [Dostam] and does not refrain from  subservience to others for power, agreed to step down from the  premiership? The best thing for Golboddin is to learn from the  past. Because the removal of Ahmad Shah Masud from the Ministry  of Defense did not help him, he will not benefit from handing  over power to the representatives of the nation. The nation's  representatives can very well distinguish a national personality  from a foreigner's servant and can separate good and bad.  Confidently, the upcoming choice of a national council will be  nothing else.</p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chicago Board of Trade may extend trading hours THE CHICAGO Board of Trade, under pressure from overseas competition and lagging agricultural volume, is considering changing the trading hours for its grain and soyabean futures. While the exchange's frenetic financial futures trading floor has undergone a number of changes in its trading day over the last decade - including the introduction of a night bond session - its 3 hour and 45 minute grain trading session has been sacrosanct. CBoT traders have opened their grain markets at 09:30 central standard time and closed them at 13:15 since 1885. Plans to break with that tradition have not been favourably received, and the new hours proposals were recently sent back to an exchange committee for further study. 'Change for change's sake is not a good idea,' says Mr Kal Hachem, vice president for Cargill Investor Services agricultural futures group. 'Longer hours do not necessarily mean more volume.' The CBoT's agriculture executive committee is proposing that grain futures open 90 minutes earlier and close 45 minutes earlier, in a bid to garner more European business. A second proposal, extending the session by six afternoons a year to keep trading open during the US Department of Agriculture's major crop reports, is also being considered. While competition for global market share in financial futures is fierce, the CBoT has enjoyed a near monopoly on maize and soyabean futures trading throughout their history. However, CBoT officials see subtle changes coming, and fear complacency may cost the exchange important business. The Tokyo Grain Exchange this year introduced an import maize futures contract that is rapidly building volume, and France's Matif is considering a feed wheat futures contract. Chicago traders also have a healthy respect for their London competitors. Mr Michael Jenkins, who helped build make the London International Financial Futures Exchange into the world's third-largest futures exchange, recently took over the helm at London's Futures and Options Exchange. 'The Fox intends to go after agricultural futures, and now they have Michael Jenkins,' says one CBoT official. Internal pressures may also dictate a change. Globex, the electronic after-hours trading system that the CBoT owns in partnership with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters, will eventually list the CBoT's grain and soyabean contracts. This has prompted traders to consider spending more time in the pits, particularly to catch the fall-out from government reports. Critics say the proposed earlier openings would not expand European participation in Chicago's grain markets significantly, and does not address the potential challenge from Tokyo. West coast grain merchants would also be inconvenienced by the hours. However, other traders say the change is inevitable, and that east coast and midwest grain merchants who already traded cash grain before the futures opened, would benefit from an earlier opening, as would the CBoT's European customers.</p>

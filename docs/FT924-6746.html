			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Costain seeks dismissals in Australian case COSTAIN, the UK construction group, has asked the US Federal Court and the High Court in the UK to dismiss proceedings designed to prevent it from selling its Australian coal mining business to a higher bidder. This follows legal moves to prevent Costain from selling the business to Altus Finance, a subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank. Peabody Holding, the US-based coal-mining subsidiary of Hanson, the UK conglomerate, has asked the US courts to enforce an earlier agreement which would have allowed it to buy the New South Wales coal mines. Altus earlier this month agreed to pay Dollars 245m (Pounds 162m) for the mining operations and Costain's remaining Australian commercial property interests. This compares with an offer of Dollars 200m from Peabody for just the coal mining business. Peabody alleges that Costain in accepting the Altus bid has acted in 'bad faith and breach of written obligations'. Costain said yesterday that it had asked the US Federal court to dismiss the Peabody action. It has also started proceedings against Peabody and Hanson Holdings in the UK High Court seeking a declaration that the deal with Altus be permitted to proceed. The UK construction group said that the original agreement was with a UK subsidiary of Hanson and that 'this was recognised by the specific and voluntary agreement by the parties to accept English law and jurisdiction. Peabody has demonstrated its bad faith by choosing to ignore this. 'We have therefore taken appropriate steps to seek dismissal of the action in the US and have moved in the UK to establish our right to proceed with and complete our agreement with Altus.'</p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Pep firm folds THE CLOSURE 10 days ago of a Winchester-based unit trust manager, Wessex Asset Management - known best as the inventor of the Pep mortgage: a simple but highly cost-efficient product - highlights both the good and not so good aspects of the regulatory system for financial services. IMRO, the companies' regulator, detected financial strains within WAM in December. With the co-operation of its management, IMRO and other regulators moved to secure investors' funds before WAM's troubles could come to a head. These assets - some Pounds 500,000 held in a single unit trust called the Wessex UK Growth trust - are safe in the hands of WAM's trustee, the Royal Bank of Scotland, and a new manager - possibly Cannon Fund Managers - is expected to be appointed soon. Despite all this, the affair still has serious negative implications for investor protection. Terry Moran, WAM's managing director, blames the company's commercial demise on the system's failure to inform the public of the true cost of competing products and, in particular, its apparent inability to make prospective investors aware of the influence commission payments have on advisers. He said: 'It is a fact of life that what is in the best interests of the consumer is not always in the best interests of the salesman. Once people are finally made aware of the commission and charges endowments attract, then Peps will take off.' He added: 'It's sad, but we (WAM) were five to 10 years too early.' Despite receiving hefty front-end commissions, advisers maintain that traditional endowments are safer than unit trust-based Peps because bonuses cannot be taken back once declared and policy-holders do not, therefore, run the risk of a stock market crash wiping out their savings. But the number of traditional endowment policies sold is declining and, even where they are recommended, more than 50 per cent of the total estimated return is likely to be paid in a final 'terminal' bonus which is not guaranteed and is equally vulnerable to market adjustment.

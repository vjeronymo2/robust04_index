On  the first day of the 17th round of Estonian-Russian talks  yesterday [1 March], Ambassador Vasiliy Svirin, the leader of  the Russian delegation, continued to link the withdrawal of  2,600 Russian servicemen from Estonia with social guarantees for  [Russian] military pensioners [living in Estonia]. Svirin told  Estonian Television yesterday that Russia is prepared to present  a schedule for troop withdrawal if Estonia agrees to sign an  agreement concerning social guarantees for military pensioners  and their family members.    The Estonian Foreign Ministry says in its statement today  that such action is in conflict with UN and CSCE documents  according to which Russia has taken upon herself the obligation  of withdrawing her troops from Estonia unconditionally.  Ambassador Vaino Reinart, the Estonian delegation leader,  regrets that Russia wants to initial the two agreements as a  single package. The Estonian delegation requested also an  explanation for the statement made on 28 February by Aleksandr  Udaltsev, a senior Russian Foreign Ministry official, on the  first day of the talks. According to the statement, it is too  soon to talk about the Russian troop withdrawal from Estonia by  31 August of the current year. According to the Russian  delegation, Udaltsev's position does not coincide with the  official Russian position.</p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Scott says Customs probe of Matrix was inadequate Customs officials were yesterday criticised by Lord Justice Scott for failing to ask the right questions during their probe into the Matrix Churchill arms-to-Iraq case. The judge, heading an inquiry into the affair, said investigators had not properly followed up allegations that officials 'did not care' whether machine tools sold to the Iraqis were used to make weapons. Miss Annabelle Bolt, a Customs &amp; Excise lawyer, told the inquiry that the Department of Trade and Industry appeared reluctant to see the affair investigated because shortcomings in its operations might be revealed. Earlier the inquiry heard how Customs continued with its prosecution of three directors of the machine-tool company in spite of concern that it might turn into another 'supergun' fiasco. Then, charges brought over the exporting of pipes for the Iraqi supergun project were dropped after the attorney general warned Customs that the prosecutions would probably be unsuccessful. Sir Brian Unwin, then chairman of the Customs Commissioners, wrote in a memorandum about the Matrix Churchill case: 'To put it crudely, I don't want a repeat of the gun affair.' His note was written in December 1990, two days after he attended a meeting of civil servants to discuss newspaper allegations that Mr Alan Clark, the former trade minister, gave Matrix Churchill 'a nod and a wink' to carry on selling to Iraqi munitions factories.</p>

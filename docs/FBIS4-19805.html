			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington (DPA) -- FRG Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel has indicated the possibility that NATO might extend a  ban on heavy weapons -- along the line of the Sarajevo model --  only to Gorazde and not to all safe areas in Bosnia. "It could  be that first a decision will be made in connection with  Gorazde," Kinkel said on Thursday evening [21 April] after talks  in Washington with his U.S. counterpart Warren Christopher and  U.S. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake.    In addition, the minister expressed doubts about U.S. ideas  of tightening sanctions against Serbia. He has "announced  doubts that we can further tighten the screw," Kinkel said,  referring to the effects of the sanctions on countries such as  Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM].    On Wednesday, U.S. President Bill Clinton had suggested a  united course against the Bosnian Serbs to bring them back to  the negotiating table and to save the Muslim enclave of Gorazde.  The United States wants to win over the Western allies and  Russia for banning heavy weapons in the surroundings of the  other five UN safe areas, following the example of Sarajevo.  Otherwise, the Serbs must expect NATO air raids.    Kinkel stressed the "basic agreement" to the U.S. Bosnian  initiative. In addition to the military plans, it is absolutely  necessary to push ahead the political process and to include  Russia. He assessed the Russian suggestion of a summit with  restraint. Such a conference should be held only if success is  relatively certain, Kinkel said.    Apart from Bosnia, Germany's presidency in the European  Union, which begins on 1 July, was one of the focal points of  Kinkel's talks. He announced close cooperation with the  Americans in the fields of environmental protection, combating  crime, drug trafficking, and terrorism, as well as disarmament.</p>

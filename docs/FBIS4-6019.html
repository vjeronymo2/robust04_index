			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 15 (KCNA) -- A congratulatory  message came to the great leader President Kim Il-song today  from the Central Committee of the South Korean National  Democratic Front [SKNDF] (Hanminjon) on his birthday.    The message says President Kim Il-song founded the chuche  idea to provide the universal truth of the perfection of man, a  mighty sword for the transformation of the nature and society  and has built a powerful socialist state independent,  self-sustaining and self- reliant in national defence, on the  land of chuche cultivated by himself.    Noting that it is a feat of the century worthy of particular  note that he has perfectly solved the question of succeeding to  the revolutionary cause, it stresses that as chuche Korea has  the leader at its head and is guided by the sagacious leader  Comrade Kim Chong- il possessed of literary and military  accomplishments, it has gained a far-flung fame as an invincible  country with solid, singlehearted unity of the leader, the party  and the masses and as an ever- victorious country strong enough  to defeat any aggressor forces at one blow.    "Advancing under the bright rays of chuche with the great  leader as the sun of the nation, Hanminjon and the people of all  walks of life have been able to steadfastly maintain the  life-line in shaping the destiny and continue the movement for  turning the fascist colony into an independent and democratic  land, without slightest vacillation in spite of the fascist  suppression and the grim trials and adversities," it says.    The message expresses the resolution to hasten the modelling  of Hanminjon on the chuche idea, invigorate the righteous  anti-U.S., anti-fascist struggle for national salvation and  activate the reunification movement under the banner of the  10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation with  the immortal chuche idea of the great leader and his constant  view of "believing the people as in heaven" as the motto of the  life and struggle.    It wishes President Kim Il-song good health and long life.</p>

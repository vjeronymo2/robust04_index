			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Overland relief convoys suspended by UN: Tudjman and Cosic appeal for end to conflict in Bosnia THE United Nations refugee agency said yesterday it had been forced to suspend relief convoys along the only all-weather road into Bosnia because uncontrolled 'warlords' were deliberately targeting aid trucks. The suspension came as President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and President Dobrica Cosic of the rump Yugoslavia urged the warring parties in Bosnia-Hercegovina to work for an end to the fighting and for an accord on a new constitution for the republic. The call was in a joint statement made last night at the international peace talks in Geneva, under the chairmanship of Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen. The wording of the statement left little doubt the two presidents were agreed in opposition to arguments by Bosnia's Moslem-led government that the republic should not be divided along ethnic lines. The presidents also agreed new steps towards normalising relations between their two states following war in the second half of last year. Lord Owen said the declaration was another 'building block' in the drive to construct a peaceful edifice covering all the republics of former Yugoslavia. A close aide to President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia, who was also at the Geneva talks, discounted a claim on Croatian radio that the Bosnian leader had been toppled during his absence by a pro-Serb faction. 'We hear a lot of these claims,' the aide said. 'Most of them are spread by people who have their own reasons to make trouble.' He said the president was heading back to Sarajevo today. The suspension of relief convoys leaves the Sarajevo airlift as the only means of transporting humanitarian supplies to the Bosnian capital and central Bosnia-Hercegovina, where more than 750,000 people face starvation and freezing temperatures this winter. Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said the shelling of two convoys on the Mostar-Sarajevo road last Friday was yet another example of the failure of the parties to the conflict to live up to their commitments. UNHCR officials estimate they need to provide 9,230 tonnes of food and other supplies to 1.6m Bosnians each week in winter. Last week it delivered just 1,130 tonnes. Mr Cedric Thornberry, director of civil affairs with the UN protection force (Unprofor) in ex-Yugoslavia, said in Geneva yesterday the situation in Bosnia was 'becoming quite desperate, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced from their homes, many of them wandering the roads and trying to survive in the hills'. General Satish Nambiar, the Unprofor commander, said the extra 6,000 or so UN troops promised to escort aid convoys and open roads would be deployed by mid-November. Gen Nambiar also said Unprofor would protest to the Bosnian Serb leadership over an incident yesterday when its commander in Sarajevo and three aides were held briefly at gunpoint at a checkpoint. Gen Nambiar confirmed that the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from the Prevlaca peninsula in Croatia had been completed. Blind eye, Page 19</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / HK plan to increase disclosure The Hong Kong stock exchange has taken a further step towards adoption of international standards with the release of a consultative paper proposing full disclosure of directors' salaries and calling for an end to the practice of 'hidden' reserves. If passed, the changes to the listing rules would open up directors' renumeration to full scrutiny. Companies would be obliged to list directors' fees, basic salaries plus bonuses, housing allowance and benefits in kind, pension scheme contributions and golden hellos and goodbyes. The stock exchange is also getting tough on banks, insurance and shipping companies which are currently allowed to maintain 'hidden' reserves.</p>

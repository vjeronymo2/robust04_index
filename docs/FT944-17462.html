			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Tory right seeks urgent tax cuts to counter Blair's appeal Mr John Major was last night facing a strong warning on taxes from the Tory right, as Labour's successful Blackpool conference closed with an endorsement of Mr Tony Blair's leadership from Mr John Prescott, his traditionalist deputy. With many Tories rattled by the confidence of Mr Blair's performance, the Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward pressure group was expected to urge the prime minister to make tax cuts an urgent priority. The group was also expected to use tomorrow's issue of its Forward magazine to urge Mr Major to stress in his speech to his party's conference in Bournemouth on Friday that a Conservative government would never join a European single currency. Right-wingers see these steps as vital if the party is to establish 'clear blue water' between itself and Labour. They will also call for a renewed offensive on law and order, an issue on which they feel Labour has successfully eroded the Tories' advantage. In Blackpool, Mr Prescott tried to bridge divisions over the future of Labour's commitment to widespread nationalisation. In a forceful speech designed to undermine Conservative efforts to ridicule him, he told delegates that Mr Blair was 'a leader with the courage to lead'. He said Labour had 'learned its lessons', and promised to consult 'every region of the land' to build a consensus on modernising the party's aims. Senior officials said the regional tour would help ease the pain of transition from the 76-year-old Clause Four commitment to public ownership to the more limited support for public services favoured by Mr Blair. But Mr Blair, who heralded the end of the nationalisation commitment on Tuesday, issued a blunt warning to left-wingers not to exploit the leadership's narrow defeat on the issue in a debate two days later. He said two freshly elected leftwing members of the party's ruling national executive committee would be 'very foolish' if they interpreted their election as a signal of a swing to the left. However, the strains at the top of the party were underlined by Mr Larry Whitty, the outgoing general-secretary, who warned Mr Blair not to ride roughshod over the party's traditions.

"The Romanian spring," as some people called this period,  ended in 1971, after Nicolae Ceausescu's visit to Asia. He  returned enthusiastically from what he saw in China, where the  aberrant and bloody "Cultural Revolution" was in full process of  implementation. The darkest period of the Bolshevik  totalitarianism in Romania began after that visit. That was a  period that ended only with the anticommunist revolution of  1989. The application of the Chinese model -- because, in fact  that is what this was all about -- in the 18 years of the  Ceausescu dictatorship left tragic marks on the Romanian people  in the biological, psychological, economic, social, and moral  sphere and many of those marks can be felt even today.    Four years after the December 1989 events, the history of  the  application of the Chinese model seems to be repeated. In a  moment when, with immense efforts and sacrifice and in spite of  the opposition of those nostalgic Communists, complex processes  are taking place in Romania aimed at gradually leading toward  democracy, free economy, and European reintegration, a careful  observer might distinguish with astonishment and fear certain  elements that suggest a new attempt to follow the Chinese model,  with the appropriate modifications that it went through in the  decades that have passed since it had been implemented by Mao  Zedong.    In this respect, one cannot ignore the numerous visits paid  in recent months to China by important personalities of the  current leadership, among them Adrian Nastase [president of the  Chamber of Deputies of the Romanian Parliament and president of  the ruling Social Democracy Party of Romania] and Mircea Cosea  [chairman of the Council for Coordination, Strategy, and  Economic Reform].    However, we should pay special attention to the fact that  some declarations made very recently by President Iliescu and  Adrian Nastase are very close to the general concept of the  Chinese model, the way it has been remodeled in the past years  by Deng Xiaoping. For example, during the talks held at  Cotroceni [Presidency] with the representatives of the  Democratic Convention, the head of state let it be understood  that the current leaders are ready to hold dialogue with the  opposition, but in no way can there be a question of sharing  power, although the catastrophic situation of our country and  the obvious lack of confidence of the public in the PDSR [Social  Democracy Party of Romania] and in its allies would make a  change of government imperative for the benefit of the country.  This position adopted by Mr. Iliescu has been confirmed also by  the president of the Chamber of Deputies, on the occasion of an  ample interview granted to the Romanian Television on Monday, 17  January, immediately after the major current events program of  that evening. In the interview, the leader of the ruling party  shared with millions of television viewers who were following  the program another idea that derives from the Chinese model,  namely that privatization is not a goal in itself. The Chinese  leaders have launched in recent years the concept of "socialist  market economy" which is a flagrant contradiction of terms,  because the socialist economy (in fact the communist economy) is  not compatible with the market economy, as can be seen from the  tragic experience of the past 75 years. However, market economy  cannot exist without massive privatization, the proof of it  being what is currently happening in our country and in the  former communist countries which carry out half-measure reforms.  The two major leaders of the current neo-communist power in our  country have also spoken out for other "theses" that derive from  the typical cliches of the Chinese models. Thus, on the occasion  of the visit paid to Cotroceni by Mrs. Madeleine Albright, the  representative of the United States to the United Nations, Mr.  Iliescu stated that the current economy is going through a  crisis of system and its major cause is the contradiction  between rich and poor countries. In turn, during his  aforementioned television interview, Mr. Nastase affirmed that  Romania's admission to the Euro-Atlantic structures does not  depend on the democratic reforms in our country but on our  geostrategic position.    Thus, the phantom of the Chinese model is haunting our  country again, but this does not stop us from being optimists,  just as we have been so far. If we look at what happened in  less than three years to the "glorious Soviet Union" and to the  aberrant ideology on which the colossus with clay legs that  frightened the civilized West for three quarter of a century  relied, we can predict what is going to happen in a few years to  the other communist colossus that tries to invent new funny  formulas of survival. The same thing that will happen to those  who try to follow that model. There is nothing we can do except  tell all of them at the right time: "God forgive them for the  evil they inflicted on humanity," because we are too small to do  this.</p>

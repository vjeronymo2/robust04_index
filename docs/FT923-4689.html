			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / How To Spend It: It's fast, it's furious - it's New York I HAVE lived in New York for nearly two years, a blink of the eye in the big scheme of things; but in a city that moves as fast as this one, a lot can be learned in a short space of time. The only important thing to know about visiting New York is, whatever you do, do not pause too long for breath; otherwise, you will miss feasting on the city's extraordinary energy. Tackle everything - shopping, eating, drinking or sightseeing - at speed. You can rest when you get home. SHOPPING The best thing about shopping for clothes in New York is that if you want to spend a bundle on designer labels, you can. But if you want to spend less, and still look good, there is affordable quality in abundance. Classic American clothes are especially good value - Levi 501s, for example, cost just Dollars 36 at any branch of Wings around the city. For men, Banana Republic also offers the classic American look but with an outdoor, preppy twist. Handsome black leather jackets, designed with a minimum of fuss but a maximum of comfort, can be had for only Dollars 325 and dark green suede jackets, which would look wonderful with either a white T-shirt or a smart Brooks Brothers' button-down, are available for Dollars 345. There are several Banana Republics around the city, including one at Lexington Avenue and 59th Street. There is no shortage of choice at the top end of the market. If you like everything in one place, the men's department at Bergdorf Goodman, on Fifth Avenue at 58th Street, is worth a trip - ignore the tweedy, English gentleman's club interior and enjoy the wide range of top American and European designers - as is Barneys on Seventh Avenue in Chelsea, which has the best tie collection and the wackiest window displays in the western hemisphere. If you want the designer labels at permanent sale prices, go downtown to Century 21, a vast, ugly department store opposite the World Trade Centre. Do not be put off by the tacky setting because you can find some tremendous fashion bargains on the ground floor. It is especially good for men's Italian suits and jackets. For those with more particular tastes, try Matsuda on lower Fifth Avenue which sells pricy, but comfortable and chic, Japanese clothes. For women, a wide range of options is available. Obvious recommendations include Bergdorf Goodman, Henri Bendel and Charivari, all situated conveniently within a few blocks of each other around Fifth Avenue and 57th Street; but, among the individual designers, try Betsey Johnson for bright colours in sexy shapes and Morgane Le Fay, where the present autumn fashions are ethereally elegant in warm wine reds, navy blues, off-whites and greys. Both are in SoHo, and all of the above are expensive. There are too many good shoe shops to mention, but Tootsi Plohound at Prince Street in SoHo and Martinez Valero on Third Avenue at 61st Street come recommended for quality women's shoes at good prices. Anyone looking for home furnishing should head straight for Portico, on the corner of Wooster and Spring streets. It has a lovely selection of antique brass beds, plenty of fine linens, towels, and various bathroom fittings and fixtures. Like many of New York's best shops, Portico is worth visiting just to enjoy the space it occupies - a high-ceilinged converted warehouse with polished wooden floors and tall, wide windows. If your tastes are more cosmopolitan, go to Hecho-A-Mano on West Broadway, a fabulous shop that sells hand-made Mexican furniture, crockery and glassware, and Zona (also in SoHo, on Greene Street) which sells an enormous variety of gifts for young and old, including some delightful wooden American folk circus toys. Shopping builds the appetite, so follow the example of many New Yorkers at lunchtime and get something from the many sandwich bars which offer huge, exotic combinations for under Dollars 10. If you want something a cut above the rest, go to Mangia at 54 West 56th Street. Pick up one of its healthy sandwiches, soups or salads and have a picnic in Central Park. Sheep Meadow, a few minutes' walk from the park's southern entrance, is perfect - it is a special quiet zone and has splendid views of the mid-town skyline above the treetops. If you fancy a sit-down meal, but want to keep it informal, go to the Oyster Bar underneath Grand Central Station - a cavernous seafood restaurant packed with local office workers. The food is simple but very good, and the setting magnificent. If you want to come home from New York with a really special buy, head down to the Lower East Side. Orchard Street is famed for its new and second-hand leather jackets (a visiting friend recently bought a superb original 1950s' police leather coat for Dollars 350), while Second Avenue or the eastern end of Houston Street are equally good for vintage American clothes. The multi-coloured 'varsity' jackets worn by high school and college students are particularly fashionable at the moment and cost a fraction of the price they would command overseas. Whatever you do, do not leave until you have visited one of the markets which sell the produce from farms in upstate New York, Pennsylvania, and other outlying areas. The best, at Union Square, is held on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. The produce, most of it grown organically grown, is wonderful - especially the sourdough breads, locally-caught seafood, fresh herbs and mouth-watering sweetcorn. The smells and sounds of the market create a glorious atmosphere; on a sunny Saturday morning, there is no better place to be in New York. EATING OUT Shopping in New York is enjoyable, but your best time in the city probably will be spent in restaurants and bars. One of my favourite bars is the Paris Cafe, on South Street right at the bottom of Manhattan. It is a welcoming, comfortable old place, best visited at weekends (when it is not so busy with Wall Street lunchers) and in the early-morning hours, when the traders and fishmongers from the Fulton Street market next door pop in for a drink after work. If you want to mingle with the young and the beautiful, make for the Coffee Shop on Union Square where you will find more models than on a Paris catwalk. But if you want the truly unusual, step down to the tiny Samurai Bar on Sullivan Street in Greenwich Village, probably the world's only Japanese reggae bar. Drink sake or Sapporo beer, enjoy the music, chat to the friendly Haitian owners - and understand what people mean about the city being a melting pot. Of all the many restaurants in New York, my favourite for atmosphere and impromptu late-night dinners is Raoul's, at 180 Prince Street. Drink with the locals at the crowded bar, or enjoy the simple but well-prepared French food. If you want a more formal night out, with some truly innovative cuisine, go to the Quilted Giraffe, at 550 Madison Avenue, where the heavily Japanese-influenced creations are gorgeous to look at and eat. Go for the 'Beggar's Purse' appetiser - caviar rolled in gold leaf presented on a mini pedestal. Owner and chef Barry Wine will insist you eat it with your hands behind your back and, while you struggle inelegantly, he will snap a picture to add to a collection that includes Warren Beatty, Madonna, William Hurt, and other luminaries. One important note, though: if the New York Giants football team are having a bad season, be extra nice to Frank, the maitre d'. Finally, if you want to be ultra-hip, head down to SoHo. Start off with a late dinner at Boom, on Spring Street. You've heard of 'world music' - well, this is 'world food': Moroccan charmoula-marinated seafood over cinammon couscous, or risotto with white truffle oil and white mushrooms. It tastes as good as it sounds and sometimes there is live jazz to enjoy. After Boom, stroll south to where West Broadway meets Grand Street and fritter the night away at the coolest crossroads in all of New York: the Felix Bar, upstairs at Jour et Nuit, the West Broadway Restaurant, La Jumelle and Lucky Strike are all crammed into one small block. By four or five in the morning you should have had enough, so wind down with a strong black coffee at the all-night Moonshine Diner a few yards away on Sixth Avenue. You will need a good breakfast every morning to ensure you keep up with New York's pace. Try the Edwardian Room at the Plaza, which is located superbly alongside Central Park. Its beautiful light on sunny mornings eases you nicely into the day. For the more adventurous who might want to breakfast downtown, tackle the Texan flavours of Cottonwood on Bleecker St by Eighth Avenue, where a big plateful of huevos rancheros (hot Mexican eggs) and a large Bloody Mary will put enough fire in your belly to last through the day - and cure your hangover, if necessary. WHERE TO STAY Most of the well-known New York hotels are grand and expensive in the old-fashioned way so, for those seeking a more intimate experience, try the Lowell on East 63rd Street just off Madison Avenue. The Lowell is located ideally for an evening at one of my favourite restaurants, Le Bilboquet, a cramped but atmospheric French bistro located across the street and popular with the beautiful people of the Upper East Side. Le Bilboquet does not take reservations but, if you have to wait, Philippe, the irrepressible proprietor, should keep you entertained.</p>

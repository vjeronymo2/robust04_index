			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP REVIEW;  </P> <P> SWENSON AND FAHEY MAKE LONG NIGHT OF ROCK WORTHWHILE  </P> <P> Blow Up magazine's second anniversary party Friday night at Bogart's Bohemian  Cafe was a little like the Orange County-Long Beach alternative rock scene that  the publication was founded to cover: scattered and hard to define (like the  suburbs themselves), but worth delving into.  </P> <P> The lack of stylistic overlap among the five acts which played on the 4  1/2-hour bill was indicative of the absence of a unifying sound on the local  scene. That's bad for marketing (Seattle has established itself as the new hot  spot on the alternative rock map by exporting a relatively uniform and  consistent product: loud sludge rock), but good for the long-term health of the  scene. In music, as in the biosphere, the more varied the gene pool, the  better.  </P> <P> Waiting until the end of the long evening had its rewards: Top billed  singer-songwriters Tim Swenson and Peter Fahey are two talents worthy of  championing the Orange County-Long Beach scene to the outside world. Swenson  nearly got his chance last year while fronting the now-defunct Lunchbox, which  landed a recording deal but watched it fall through. Fahey's shot is due to  come next year with the release of a debut album on one of the PolyGram Records  affiliates.  </P> <P> The two represented effective, but markedly different, approaches toward  acoustic singer-songwriter performance.  </P> <P> Fahey fit the traditional image of the singer-songwriter that reaches back to  the '60s folk boom and (fortunately for him) is back in currency again. Tall  and sturdy-looking, he wore a flannel shirt, unbuttoned over a white T-shirt,  and strummed his guitar in a basic, unadorned way, embellishing it with wails  from a harmonica worn in a collar brace. Fahey's singing was forthright and  homespun, nasal but tuneful. He fit the bill as an American Everyman  troubadour.  </P> <P> In keeping with that mold, Fahey's 45-minute solo acoustic set was full of  melancholy introspection. His performance was often like personal reverie --  there was even a sense of solitude in the floor-jarring kicks of his left boot  with which he kept the beat.  </P> <P> But Fahey's was an inclusive sort of reverie that drew a listener in. His  brief, low-keyed but occasionally humorous song introductions clued a listener  in, and his caressing melodies held attention. So did his lyrics, which didn't  strive for poetic grace notes but did manage to set a scene and evoke feelings  in direct, economical terms. As personal as Fahey's songs were, they touched on  emotional situations that almost everyone has experienced.  </P> <P> Taken together, the set's eight songs sketched a man chastened and wary in his  understanding of life's pain but stoically able to accept it without self-pity.  "Depend On" reflected on how existence can be a lonely thing, even when it's  colored with love and companionship. "I'll Remember You" got to the heart of  one of life's unique emotional experiences: the mingled sense of loss and  relief that comes when death ends an aged grandparent's suffering. Fahey's  directness and simplicity allowed him to pull off songs such as that without  sinking into pathos or sentimentality.  </P> <P> That was true, at least, when he sang from his own point of view. "Picking Up  Pennies," in which Fahey tried to step into the shoes of a Skid Row denizen,  voiced the usual sentiments about extreme poverty, without any imaginative  flashes to make them hit home.  </P> <P> Over a longer set, some counterbalancing lightheartedness or hopefulness would  be in order. The closest Fahey came was "Sweet Dreams" (not the Patsy Cline  song), a combination of Everly Brothers winsomeness and John Lennon's "Imagine"  -- style utopianism.  </P> <P> Where Fahey was meditative and self-contained, Swenson let it rip. Attacking an  acoustic guitar he borrowed from Fahey, accompanied by an electric bassist and  electric guitarist, the Long Beach-based singer showed his roots in the Orange  County punk scene by performing his entire 35-minute set at a hot pitch of  passion. Punk emerged in the aggressiveness and all-out emotionalism of the  performance rather than in the music itself. Swenson sang with a soul-tinged  cry, not a punker's snarl. The shaggy, tattooed singer writhed spasmodically  and stomped in a kinetic display that obviously rose from honest feeling, not  calculated design. Swenson'sa connection to the emotions in his songs was  immediate, complete, and unquestionable.  </P> <P> Swenson sang about frayed inner states, chronicling betrayals suffered, sins  committed, at one point allowing for a vision of redemption conferred. The high  moral stakes in his songs justified the high drama of his fevered delivery.  </P> <P> Bassist John Wersbee and guitarist Dave Davis backed Swenson with just the  right blend of raggedness and sensitivity. Davis' spare, countrified lead  guitar fills and vocal harmonies were consistently on target. The players  interacted, watching each other, exchanging nods of recognition and  satisfaction and making the set seem less a performance than a shared emotional  release.  </P> <P> The other three acts on the bill are still developing, but not without promise.  Medicine Rattle and Spanish Fly front man Dave Pedroza lose points for shirking  the evening's challenge -- it was billed as "An Acoustic Hoedown" -- by  performing electric sets with full-rock rhythm sections. Better to review them  down the road, in full-blown rock settings where they aren't trying to present  a more subdued fish-nor-foul version of themselves (Kirsten Konte of Children's  Day turned in a fine guest appearance, dueting on several songs with Pedroza in  a voice that was clear and firm, but with a strong shading of world-weariness).  </P> <P> Kristi Lewis, formerly the backup singer in Too Many Joes, opened with a set  that made a strong claim for her own place in the spotlight. Playing in an  as-yet-unnamed duo with harmony-singer Tracey New, Lewis sang beautifully,  recalling such pure-sounding sources as Joni Mitchell, Maria McKee and some of  the more ethereal female singers on the British alternative rock scene. She  strummed guitar purposefully, and displayed lots of confidence and the ability  to project herself on stage. New was a reticent performer, but blended with  Lewis in fine close harmonies.  </P> <P> Lewis and New clearly have ability, but they didn't have any good songs.  Everything in their 35-minute set meandered without melodic or lyrical focus,  sounding more like outpourings in a diary than well-shaped songs. The duo's  outlook, though not its sound, resembled the Indigo Girls': ever-earnest  examinations of what it's like to be in limbo between adolescence and that  elusive moment when one figures out an adult purpose for one's life. It's  perfectly legitimate to sing about that post-adolescent search for identity and  meaning, but it has to be done in a way that's resonant, not self-involved.  </P> <P> Blow Up is the creation of co-editors John Surge and Bobbi Villalobos, Long  Beach residents who met when they were journalism students at Humboldt State.  Surge said he saw a need for a publication that would spotlight the Long  Beach-Orange County alternative rock and poetry scene, which he felt received  short shrift from the underground music press in Los Angeles. Using their home  computer, Surge and Villalobos publish a 16-page tabloid edition every other  month and distribute 4,000 copies for free.  </P> <P> Surge said his next goal -- not yet in sight because of tight finances -- is to  have Blow Up sponsor a compilation album that would spotlight local performers  and perhaps serve as a first step toward creating a regular independent label  to go with the magazine.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed Jean-Paul Croize: "Ariane: The </F> Consequences of a Chance Mishap"]    [Text] Two "shop-window" satellites of French technology,  with a global value in the region of 2 billion French francs  [Fr], fell into the Atlantic Ocean together with the rocket that  was carrying them. A developing country, Turkey, and an  international organization, Eutelsat, lost precious  communication tools. Several weeks at least will be needed for  the technical inquiry, bringing Ariane's commercial ambitions to  a temporary halt. These are the weighty consequences of the  failure of the 63rd rocket launch six minutes after lift-off  from the Kourou space center in French Guyana.    However, this should not cast doubts on the credibility of  the European rocket. This was only the sixth accident to occur  since launches commenced in December 1979.    It already appears that this failure was due to a  malfunctioning component in the engine of the third stage used  on this version. According to the announcement made yesterday  afternoon by Charles Bigot, managing director of the rocket's  production company, Arianespace, the faulty component was a  roller bearing in the turbopump supplying the engine with  oxygen. "We view this problem seriously but also calmly,  because we know that our rockets are reliable" he said, before  quoting from a letter from French Industry Minister Gerard  Longuet assuring him of the "confidence" of the French  government.    A commission of inquiry will submit a report explaining in  full the circumstances of the incident, before the next rocket  launch which could be delayed only a few weeks.    Yet, everything had started very well on Monday evening for  this 63rd rocket flight, which took off as planned at 2137 GMT  with its payload of "Turksat 1", Turkey's first  telecommunications satellite, and "Eutelsat II F5" belonging to  the European organization of the same name. Everything went  according to plan with the first and second stage separations,  and the ignition of the third stage engine on this "Ariane 44  LP" rocket was greeted with the usual sigh of relief on the  ground at the Kourou space center.  <H5>  Sensitive Point </H5>   Some 80 seconds later the flight controllers noted an  abnormal pressure drop in the third stage engine's combustion  chamber which was suddenly extinguished.  From that point on, the rocket and its two satellites were  irredeemably lost. Even at an altitude of 200 km Ariane had not  built up a speed sufficient to push it into orbit, and its radar  trace, represented by a dot on the control screens, plummeted  towards the middle of the Atlantic before crashing a few minutes  later.    By the end of the evening, in French Guyana the first  analyses of the measurements taken between third stage ignition  and its premature shutdown had revealed an abnormal heating-up  of one of the roller bearings in the third stage engine's  turbopump, a kind of "carburetor" used to inject the mixture of  liquid hydrogen and oxygen needed to make it work. Some 60  seconds after lift-off, the bearing of the shaft supplying the  engine with oxygen gradually started to heat up before its  temperature rose suddenly at the 80-second mark, which was  probably when the bearing jammed, blocking the turbopump and  causing the engine to stall because it was no longer being  supplied with fuel.    This extremely sophisticated engine has been responsible for  four of the six Ariane failures. However, it would appear that  this failure will not lead to a rethink of the engine's design:  "We fully master its technology, even if it is one of Ariane's  more sensitive points. I consider its design to be the  state-of-the- art," Charles Bigot forcefully underlined. He  also remarked that there had not been a third-stage failure  since 1986, some 44 flights previously. While he admitted that  Arianespace would not run the risk of launching another version  of the rocket before the commission of inquiry had reported back  with its conclusions, he believed that an initial report could  be available by the middle of February. The possibility of  flights beginning again within a few weeks cannot therefore be  ruled out.    Given that there have been 26 successful flights since the  last accident in 1990, and the fact that these two satellites  were particularly well-insured -- according to Kourou the launch  had been covered for $350 million -- Monday evening's failure  seems to have been received calmly. Engineers were talking of a  chance mishap, difficult to take but at the end of the day quite  "acceptable" for a launcher that originally was designed with an  MFR of 10 flights to keep production costs down. The  Arianespace managing director even stated: "It should be  possible to gradually claw back the delay caused by this problem  to achieve our aim of 30 launches over the next three years."    With some 70 percent of the world market in civilian  satellite launches, Ariane still has, after the loss of these  two satellites, a total of 35 firm orders for putting satellites  into orbit between now and 1997. Arianespace stated yesterday  that the coming weeks should see no cancellations cutting into  this winning formula, which generates revenues of more than Fr17  billion.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3 YOUTHS SHOT IN PLACENTIA DRIVE-BY ATTACK  </P> <P> Three youths were wounded Wednesday evening by shotgun blasts in a drive-by  shooting, authorities said.  </P> <P> The three unidentified victims -- believed to have been two girls and a boy --  were shot as they sat in a car on Tafolla Street at Orangethorpe Avenue,  according to Placentia police and witnesses.  </P> <P> Two shotgun blasts were fired from a vehicle passing by on Orangethorpe, said  Police Lt. Ken Rowley. The assailants' vehicle then sped off.  </P> <P> Mike Gonzalez, 19, who witnessed the shooting as he was walking home, said he  saw a passenger in a mini-truck point and fire a gun. He said the truck slowed  suddenly and stereo music blasting from inside stopped. "I was stunned. I was  tripping out. The guys (assailants) just took off," he said.  </P> <P> The shotgun blasts blew out the front and rear windows of the white Buick  Regal. All of the victims were taken to Placentia-Linda Community Hospital.  </P> <P> Witnesses said a boy and a girl appeared to have minor injuries, but another  girl who stayed in a car appeared to be more seriously hurt.  </P> <P> Although youth gangs are known to be active in the area, Rowley said he did not  know whether the shooting was related to gang activity.  </P></p>

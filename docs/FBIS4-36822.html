			<p>BFN     [Text] The secondary school built by the Civilian Affairs  Administration in the border zone was inaugurated in Rumaysh  yesterday. The ceremony was attended by General Gabi Ashkenazi,  Israeli commander of the liaison unit; Colonel Shlomo Hasun,  Israeli head of the Civilian Affairs Administration; and  Lieutenant Colonel 'Aql Hashimi, commander of the western  brigade, who represented South Lebanese Army Commander [SLA]  Staff Major General Antoine Lahd.    In a speech he delivered on the occasion, Lt. Col. Hashim  said that the difficult road that we have taken is nearing its  end, and we have great hope that we will reach a safe haven.  The features of the road are becoming clear after the  successive signing of agreements with the Palestinians and the  Jordanians, and with the Syrians in the future.    Hashim extended thanks on behalf of Rumaysh residents to  Israel and the Israeli army for their assistance to the border  strip residents.    Liaison Unit Commander Gen. Ashkenazi affirmed that Israel  is  extending its hand for peace. He said: We will cooperate with  whoever wants peace and will retaliate against whoever wants war  and terrorism. Our arm is long, and we will choose the suitable  time and place to strike.    Ashkenazi said he is confident that the day will come when  peace will be established between Lebanon and Israel and the  borders between the two countries will come down. Meanwhile, he  said, we will continue to fulfill the tasks we have. We believe  that if there is no peace between nations, there will be no  peace between states, and if there is no mutual respect between  nations, there will be no good relations between states.    Answering correspondents' questions, Ashkenazi said that  Hizballah is trying to carry out terrorist operations against  the border area. It has intentions to do so. We are ready for  such confrontation. We have taken all the possibilities into  consideration and made all the necessary preparations. We hope  that Hizballah will understand that terrorism is not the right  way, and if it does not understand, we will teach it the  necessary lesson. We do not hide in villages and among civilians  as Hizballah does. If Hizballah is seeking a confrontation, let  it come to the battlefield. Ashkenazi stated that he has  instructed the troops not to respond to the sources of fire if  they come from inside villages and fields under cultivation so  that the retaliation will not burn the crops that the farmers  worked hard to cultivate.    Answering a question by our correspondent regarding the  relative calm that has recently prevailed in the area, and  whether it is the result of Hizballah's fear of Israel's  retaliation or the talks that U.S. officials held in Lebanon and  Syria, Ashkenazi said it is due to all these reasons. Hizballah  is afraid of Israeli retaliation. It has recently received a  very painful blow, and needs a long time to recover.</p>

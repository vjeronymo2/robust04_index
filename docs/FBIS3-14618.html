			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dr. Sa'dun Hammadi, adviser at the Presidency, has  said that excessive oil production by certain Arab states has  led to the deterioration of oil prices and greatly harmed  national and pan-Arab economies.    At a symposium yesterday, organized by the Iraqi Economists  Association and attended by Planning Minister Samal Majid Faraj,  Dr. Hammadi said that this intentional excessive production by  some Arab regimes such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United  Arab Emirates [UAE] has caused a glut in world oil markets,  causing a deterioration of the Arab oil price, which has dropped  to $7 per barrel after it had been $34 per barrel.    Dr. Hammadi added: The Arab economy in general is  essentially  based on one commodity -- oil -- as a main source of revenue for  economic development. This deterioration in the price of oil  has caused large balance of payment deficits in several Arab  states, affected development plans, and compelled the Arabs to  seek foreign aid under terms that have affected their economic  and political independence.    Dr. Hammadi wondered about the reason behind this situation,  which has burdened the Arab states with financial losses  amounting to $1 trillion between 1987 and 1992. He said the  reason was that these regimes have thrown themselves into the  lap of U.S. policy.</p>

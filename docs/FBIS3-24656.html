			<p>Europe     Economic Review:  WESTERN EUROPE Vol. III, No. 06, 10  February 1994      Notice To Readers:  FOREIGN MEDIA SURVEY is a series published by  FBIS Europe/Lat in America Group featuring brief summaries of  foreign media reports on topical issues, compiled from the most  recent sources available to FBIS.      Europe Economic Review (EER) is a subseries of FOREIGN MEDIA  SURVEY published by the West and East European Divisions of  Europe/Latin America Group with contributions from FBIS overseas  bureaus.  The EER is intended to supplement coverage of European  economic issues by the FBIS Daily Report for West and East Europe,  and other FBIS publications.  Foreign news, feature, and editorial  reports selected for summary in this publication normally do not  appear in other FBIS publications. The EER is published in two  editions, one for Western Europe (also including media coverage of  Canada and Turkey), and the other for Eastern Europe.  Drawing  primarily from domestic media sources of these countries but also  using other foreign media where appropriate, the EER focuses on  national and regional economic issues, such as economic  competitiveness, regional economic integration, economic reforms and  other changes in economic policies, and foreign trade and  investment.      FOREIGN MEDIA SURVEY is a U.S. Government publication.  Its  contents in no way represent the policies, views, or attitudes of  the U.S. Government.  All comment or analysis contained herein is  attributable to the cited media source, unless otherwise indicated.

According to Thoma, Germany's high labor costs combined  with its short working hours and production times increase prices  for German goods and create a "serious handicap" in international  competition.  Although some other industrial countries have higher  wage rates, generous benefits make Germany's overall labor  compensation the highest in the world at 42 German marks (DM) per  hour in 1992.  The corresponding figures for Japan and the United  States are DM30 and DM24.80, respectively.  At the same time, Thoma  points out, working hours in Germany have been shortened more  rapidly in recent years than in other countries.  Between 1980 and  1992, he notes, manufacturing working hours in Germany dropped by  11.9 percent.  In Japan, they decreased by 7.1 percent and in the  United States they actually increased by 2.6 percent.  Germany also  finished last among industrial countries in machine running times,  with machines operating for just 53 hours per week, compared to 77  hours in Belgium, the European leader in this category.  This is in  turn reflected in Germany's lagging productivity, which grew just 38  percent from 1980 to 1992, compared with 53 percent in the U.S. and  60 percent in Japan.      Thoma also cites lagging innovation as a factor in Germany's loss  of competitiveness.  Companies, he argues, have failed to develop  new products and improve old ones to help compensate for increasing  costs.  In the field of information technology, for example, German  companies have had some success in producing individual products but  have failed to respond to the demand for entire systems.  In  biotechnology, the situation is even more stark:  as of late 1993,  just six licensed biotechnology production facilities were operating  in Germany, compared to 120 in Japan and 300 in the United States.  Thoma also cites statistics from the German Patent Office showing  Germany trailing both Japan and the United States in patent  applications in the fields of vehicle technology, medicine, main  frame computers, entertainment electronics, microelectronics,  biotechnology, office technology, lasers, and aerospace.      Information on the bureaucratic barriers to German  competitiveness could "fill volumes," writes Thoma.  In 1987, for  example, the Bayer company decided to launch production of a new  blood-clotting agent in the United States rather than in Germany,  because of the difference in the time required for government  approval of the new product.  U.S. authorities approved production  after less than 10 months; approval time in Germany could not even  be predicted.  Similarly, BMW had to wait five years for approval to  construct a building in Munich, while an 11-story building in an  earthquake-prone area of Tokyo was approved in just six weeks.      Thoma cites high taxes as yet another hindrance to German  competitiveness, remarking that the country's 44.06 percent tax rate  was among the highest in the world and that experts expected the  rate to climb further to 48.69 percent by 1996.  The figures for the  United States and Japan are expected to reach 30.7 percent and 29.3  percent, respectively, by that date.      Thoma concludes that, while the problems he has described are the  most important obstacles to Germany's competitiveness as an  industrial location, there are other, less tangible "atmospheric" or  psychological" weaknesses.  These, he argues, include a negative  attitude toward technology and a work ethic which is "no longer as  positive" as it was during the early postwar years.  (RoH)  (Munich  SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG in German 25 Jan 94 p 8)      France:  Interest Rate Debate Heats Up      Laurence Ville, chief economic editor for the Paris financial  biweekly  L'EXPANSION, contends that the debate over French interest  rate levels is heating up despite the fact that there "seems to be  the notion" that expressing opposition to current government  monetary policy is "taboo."  Ville claims that although the French  Government policy of setting interest rates on a par with Germany's  to maintain the value of the franc--called a "strong franc" policy-  -is well entrenched, the circumstances that justified it have  changed with business activity stagnating, recovery not yet in  sight, and the growing fear of real deflation.  Among those who have  spoken out against continuing this policy is former National  Institute for Statistics and Economic Research (INSEE) Director  Edmond Malinvaud, who has published a paper called "Ambition for a  European Initiative" in which he recommends lowering interest rates  in face of mounting unemployment.  Malinvaud counsels French  authorities unilaterally to lower French interest rates if the  Bundesbank continues to be "obstinate" and refuses to lower German  rates.  The document is signed by several prestigious European  economists, including France's current INSEE Director Paul Champsau,  French Observatory for Economic Conditions (OFCE) President Jean-  Paul Fitoussi, and National Bank of Paris (BNP) Economic Research  Director Jean-Michel Charpin.      Ville predicts the government's monetary policy will become  increasingly controversial.  He cites as evidence the Bank of France  calling on Patrick Artus, director of the economic studies at the  Caisse des Depots, to "explain himself" after publishing an article  in the Paris daily LE FIGARO which was judged by unnamed top  government officials as "a bit ambiguous" about the advantages and  risks of changing monetary policy.  Additionally, Ville claims, the  debate will likely "take a new turn" since the Bank of France (BOF)  recently acquired independence and has replaced the government in  setting monetary policy.  Although BOF Governor Jean-Claude Trichet  is a partisan of the strong franc policy, a growing number of  economists do not support his position and are now arguing that:      * A deep recession and a strong increase in unemployment call for  a change of monetary policy priorities.  French authorities should  take advantage of more flexible fluctuation bands within the  European Monetary System (EMS).      * European Monetary Union (EMU) would not necessarily be  threatened by allowing the franc to float more freely.  Exchange  rate stability is not an obligatory condition during the second  phase of EMU.  According to Institute of International Relations  (IRI) economist Pierre Jacquet, it is "unlikely that the EU will  return to narrow fluctuation bands before the final phase of EMU.  Floating the franc or other currencies until then does not imply we  reject the objective of a single currency."      * Maintaining the current level of real interest rates represents  a considerable obstacle to recovery.  "The problem is not so much  the date of the recovery...as its strength," according to Anton  Brender, the director of economic studies at the Parisian Rediscount  Company.  He adds, "A lowering of the interest rates is  indispensable if one wants to achieve sustained growth sufficient to  create jobs."      * Gradually reducing interest rates as the French Government  advocates is "insufficient."  A "clear signal" is needed for  household and business spending to increase.  Philippe Sigogne,  director of analysis for OFCE, concludes market expectations must be  reversed to persuade consumers that rates have bottomed out, which  can only be done by lowering short-term rates "significantly and in  one blow" so that they are sharply below long-term rates.  Ville  adds that for a good number of economists, this is indispensable for  recovery.      * The risks of lowering interest rates are limited.  Jacquet  notes that while he wants to keep a strong currency, he believes  current policy is based on a "mistaken definition" of how a strong  currency is maintained.  In Jacquet's view, a strong currency is  based on the domestic stability of prices and of buying power and  not on a reference to an exchange rate.      * With a marked reduction in short-term interest rates, any  depreciation in the franc would be limited and temporary.  The  market would welcome such an initiative if it is "timely."  Additionally, the German mark will be affected adversely by its own  economic problems.      * The risk is greater in doing nothing because of the deep  recession.  Brender contends, "The market knows that an interest  rate reduction is vital if France wants to improve unemployment but  also reduce the public debt."      * France may have to accept temporary depreciation to assure long  term currency strength and economic health.      Ville concludes that if the status quo is maintained, a new wave  of currency speculation and financial upheavals are possible in the  next few months."  He reasons that it is better to take the step  now rather than to be compelled to do so later by financial crisis.

Acknowledging  Germany's complaints about being the largest contributor to the EU  budget and its desire to end EU rebates to Britain, Lamassoure  pointed out that Germany is the country which has benefited the most  from membership in the EU, both commercially and politically.  He  observed, "France pays for 27 percent of the (British) rebate when  it only represents 20 percent of the Community wealth, while Germany  only pays 22.5 percent of the rebate while having 30 percent of  Community wealth." (DiI)  (Paris LE FIGARO Le Fig-Eco supplement in  French 28 Jan 94 p IV)      STUDY FINDS JAPANESE INVESTMENT DROPS IN EU--Investment by  Japanese industry in Europe had dropped to $7.6 billion by July  1993, a decline of 24.7 percent over the previous year, according to  a study by the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Japan  (DIHKJ).  The study attributed the decline in part to the Japanese  recession but also noted that the EU had "generally become much too  expensive" for most Japanese companies.  The DIHKJ also pointed out  that the EU's share of Japan's foreign investments had declined  relative to the U.S. and Asian shares, and now represented barely  one fifth of the $34.14 billion total.  (RoH)  (Munich SUEDDEUTSCHE  ZEITUNG in German 18 Jan 94 p 21)      FINLAND      UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HITS NEW REC0RD HIGH--The Labor Ministry  reported that the jobless rate rose to another high in December,  21.8 percent. According to an article in the 18 January edition of  HELSINGIN SAN0MAT, this meant that 537,000 Finns were without jobs  at the end of December, up from around 500,000 at the end of  November.  While traditional temporary furloughs between Christmas  and New Year's account for part of this rise, Labor Minister Ilka  Kanerva admitted surprise at the steepness of the increase.  Since  the report for the preceding month had showed a slight decline, and  because GDP growth surged to 8 percent for most of 1993, most  economists had predicted a further decline in unemployment for  December.  Especially troublesome was the worsening unemployment  situation for youth (ages 16-25).  In December over 100,000 persons  in this age group were jobless and the situation for the 25- to 30-  year old group was not much better.      These latest figures on youth unemployment were the subject of an  editorial in HELSINGIN SANOMAT on 22 January.  The editorial  expressed concern that so many graduates of colleges and vocational  schools were finding it impossible to enter their chosen fields and  that a recent survey had found that over a third of the unemployed  youth were so discouraged that they had stopped job hunting and were  not interested in further education or training.  Those in the 25-  to 30-year old group with degrees or diplomas in such diverse fields  as business, engineering, waiting tables, and teaching "were even  more discouraged than the 16-25 year olds."  In addition, the  proportion of the long-term unemployed continued to increase.  Those  without jobs for over 12 months amounted to a little over 50,000 in  December 1992; by December 1993 the number had more than doubled to  over 120,000.      Geographically, the worst off county was Kainuu, where the forest  industry suffered from falling exports, according to an article in  the 22 January HELSINGIN SANOMAT.  It had a registered unemployment  of 29 percent, followed by Lappland with 28 percent.  As throughout  Finland's three-year slump, women had a lower jobless rate than men:  20 percent compared to 24 percent.  This is largely explained by the  fact that such male-dominated sectors as forestry, metals, and  chemicals suffered more job losses than government and services.

FRANCE      PRIVATIZATIONS COST STATE FR5 BILLION--Renaud de la Baume,  writing in LIBERATION, claims the French Government will have lost  Fr5.13 billion on its privatizations of BNP, Rhone-Poulenc, and Elf-  Aquitaine because of its failure to set better offering prices for  their shares.  In failing to receive the "correct" price for the  public offerings, the government has "made a gift" for investors of  the stock price gain, thereby losing money for government coffers.  The amount of this "gift," based on de la Baume's research, was  calculated by determining net stock price gains--adjusted to  compensate for the general stock market rise during this period--for  each investor category, some of which bought in at different  offering prices.  Below are the results of de la Baume's research:      * BNP:  The total investor net gain was Fr1.77 billion.  The gain  included a Fr20 per share net gain for small shareholders with 46.9  million shares bought; Fr20 per share net gain for institutional  investors with 27.7 million shares bought; an average net gain of  Fr30 per share for BNP employees with 8 million shares bought; and a  net gain of Fr8.30 per share for Stable Shareholders Group (GAS)  investors with 5.7 million shares bought.      * Rhone-Poulenc: The total investor net gain was Fr0.25 billion.  This included a Fr6.50 per share net gain for small shareholders who  bought 52.3 million shares; a net gain of Fr10 per share for GAS  investors who bought 15.1 million shares; net gain of Fr23 per share  for Rhone Poulenc employees who bought 8.8 million shares; and net  gain of Fr5 per share for institutional investors who bought 26.9  million shares.      * Elf-Aquitaine: Not yet privatized, future total investor net  gain was estimated to be Fr3.11 billion.  The research assumed a per  share public offering price of Fr35 for some 89 million shares,  assuming also the same percentage of stock market gains as occurred  under the above privatizations.  De la Baume claims institutional  investors were "very unhappy" with the lower gains they garnered in  the Rhone-Poulenc privatization when the government offered an  initial Fr135 per share compared to Fr240 per share for BNP.  Consequently, the government has "clearly decided" to avoid  irritating this crucial pool of investors and will offer a better  deal to invest in Elf. (DiI)  (Paris LIBERATION in French 5, 6 Feb  94 p 10)      TOUBON, CARIGNON DIFFER ON AUDIOVISUAL POLICY--Communication  Minister Alain Carignon and Culture Minister Jacques Toubon  "profoundly" disagree over the conduct of audiovisual policy,  according to Emmanuel Schwartzenberg writing in LE FIGARO.  Schwartzenberg cites unnamed Toubon staffers as saying Toubon was  "astonished" by Carignon's establishment of a government working  group on EU audiovisual policy.  Toubon himself openly reproached  Carignon, who is also the mayor of Grenoble, in that city's daily  DAUPHINE LIBERE of 28 January for having opened discussions on the  EU directive on audiovisual policy "alone and without coordination."  He stated, "An issue such as the Television Without Borders  directive is by nature interministerial.  The Foreign Affairs  Ministry itself says that the Communication Ministry cannot make  Community policy for France.  Community policy can only be the  result of governmental action."  Moreover, Toubon warned, "Since  there have been several episodes like this, I think there must be a  call to order."  He added that he will "question" the separation  between these two ministries, noting that ministers must act as a  "solid team."  Schwartzenberg concludes that Toubon's accusations  are "serious" and demand to be quickly attended to or France's  position in international negotiations will be weakened.      Carignon refused to make any official comment on Toubon's  statements.  However, based on Toubon's statements over the last  several weeks, Schwartzenberg contends that Toubon views his role as  one of provoking debate, initiating discussions, then participating  in interministerial coordination.  Such coordination should follow  the debate and not come from closed-door negotiations where lawyers  and technicians leave the public out. (DiI)  (Paris LE FIGARO Le Fig-Eco supplement in French 29, 30 Jan 94 p  VIII)      GOVERNMENT GIVES FR2 BILLION TO AEROSPATIALE--Louis Gallois, the  president of Aerospatiale, who had asked the company's majority  shareholder, the French Government, for 3 billion francs (Fr) to  help the company move toward privatization, will receive only Fr2  billion.  Aerospatiale has had a difficult year marked by low  civilian and military sales.  Despite a 5-percent decrease in sales  for 1993, the company was able to reduce its debt by 9 percent last  year.  However, its balance sheet remains burdened by a "colossal"  debt of Fr15 billion, or two times more than shareholders' equity  (Fr6 billion).      "The state has done its shareholder duty," according to Economy  Minister Edmond Alphandery.  He argues that the EU Commission cannot  criticize the Fr2 billion capital infusion because Aerospatiale,  unlike Bull, is not in difficulty.  The company has an austerity  program in place and should break even by 1995.  In the meantime,  however, privatization is not "the order of the day."  Additionally,  Alphandery confirmed that the Fr2 billion will come from the Fr21  billion budgeted by the government to support state-owned companies.  (DiI)  (Paris LIBERATION in French 3 Feb 94 p 13)      GOVERNMENT'S RECOVERY PLANS CALLED 'AMBIGUOUS'--According to  LIBERATION'S  Chief Economic Editor Laurent Mauduit, Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur is sending mixed economic signals.  On the one hand  Balladur is trying to stimulate consumer spending; on the other, he  is trying to attract savings and investment.  Because of the  depressed state of consumer spending, the government has chosen to  try to convince the French to spend more.  Mauduit argues, for  example, that the new "prudent" Social Security plan which increased  employer social benefit payments, was intended to stimulate savings  without impacting consumer spending through new taxes.  Government  remains ambiguous, however.  It is continuing to stimulate long-term  savings, as it did last spring when it issued government bonds for  the French to subscribe to, but is simultaneously continuing a  privatization process, which is obviously designed to stimulate  investment rather than consumption, Mauduit concludes.  (RM)  (Paris  LIBERATION in French 31 Jan 94 p 3)      GERMANY      COMMENTATOR SAYS FARMERS GROWING 'WRONG' PRODUCTS--Government and  academic proposals for reforming German agriculture overlook the  fact that German farmers are growing the "wrong" products, according  to a commentary by Klaus Kemper in the 22 January Frankfurt/Main  FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE.  According to Kemper, the suggestions  offered by government officials and agricultural economists to  improve the competitiveness and income of German farmers are the  same ones which have failed over the past 40 years.  These proposals  include: combining many small farms into fewer larger ones,  increasing set-aside subsidies for letting land lie fallow,  developing new sources of income such as offering travel packages  for "vacations on the farm," and decreasing the number of farmers  per unit of land.  All of these proposals are valid, Kemper argues,  if one assumes that German farmers should continue to produce  relatively cheap crops, as they have in the past.      In Kemper's view, however, this assumption is false.  He  maintains that, since German farmers have a large number of high  income consumers at their doorstep, they should farm more  "intensively" by growing products like fresh vegetables, fruits, and  flowers, which are more difficult to transport and which yield more  money per unit of land.  By continuing to produce low-income, easily  transportable crops like wheat, barley, oilseed, and sugar beets, he  argues, German farmers are surrendering their natural advantage in  the high end of the domestic agricultural market to overseas  producers.  Kemper concludes that farmers cannot manage the required  shift in agricultural production without assistance and notes that  German agricultural leaders and officials will need more imagination  than they have shown thus far to implement the necessary changes.  (RoH)  (Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE in German 22 Jan 94 p  11)      DISAGREEMENT AMONG MINISTRIES SLOWS ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP--The  Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Environment are debating  the anticipated expenditure of DM6 billion for the cleanup of former  GDR industrial sites.  To date, some 20 major cleanup projects, each  costing at least DM100 million, have been identified.  At issue is  the application of the "Agreement Regulating Financing of Residual  Ecological Burdens," which obligates the Finance Ministry's Trust  Agency to underwrite 60 percent of general cleanup costs and 75  percent of the costs incurred in designated major projects.  The  Environment Ministry view is that cleanup must include preparing the  sites for continued industrial use, thus averting continued  industrial expansion into open land.  The Trust Agency preference is  to limit cleanups to what is needed to avert present dangers,  without pursuing further environmental goals.  (CW)  (Duesseldorf  HANDELSBLATT in German 13 Jan 94 p 3)      TRUST AGENCY PR0MOTES RUSSIAN INVESTMENT--The Moscow office of  the Trust Agency's East European Consulting Group has set up an  April investor workshop for representatives of small and medium-  sized German businesses interested in the privatization of Russian  companies.  The areas targeted are wholesale and retail trade, food  service, and transport operations.  Since 1992, the Trust Agency  group has had some 30 specialists in 17 cities of the Moscow oblast  assisting in privatization and restructuring, and it reports that  about 80 percent of the 10,000 businesses in the pilot areas have  been privatized.  In this case, "privatized" means that 51 percent  of the shares in each company are held by the firm's employees, and  investors are being sought for the remaining shares.  Additional  consulting services are in the works for St. Petersburg, Vladimir,  Irkutsk and Krasnojarsk, and the group has also been advising the  Ministry for Privatization and the Russian Government's antimonopoly  commission.  (CW)  (Frankfurt/Main BLICK DURCH DIE WIRTSCHAFT in  German 27 Jan 94 p 2)      KINKEL ENCOURAGES INVESTMENT IN ASIA--Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel, addressing a three-day conference of the German ambassadors  to Asia, called on the German political and economic sectors to  focus on "the most dynamic region of the world" and not "leave it to  the United States."  He had already instructed the embassies to  provide German firms with all the help possible in their dealings in  Asia.  The goal is not just to increase German exports to the region  but to invest there as well.  According to Kinkel, an earlier German  involvement in Asia could have created 400,000 additional jobs in  Germany.  Kinkel also promised that, in order to fully integrate  Asia into the world market, Germany would work for Chinese and  Taiwanese participation in GATT and would encourage democratic  reforms in China, India, and Vietnam.  The German Government is  planning to use its EU presidency, which begins in July 1994, to  promote its Asia policy on the European level.  Kinkel was cautious  on human rights issues, acknowledging the abuses should be clearly  addressed but warning against a policy of "pointing fingers."  (WS)  (Frankfurt FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU in German 27 Jan 94 p 4)      GREECE      ECONOMIC COURSE DISCUSSED--According to an article in VIMA TIS  KIRIAKIS, the good news on the Greek economy which surfaced in 1994  included:      * Reduced Deficit--The huge "black hole" of the 2.5-trillion-  drachmas deficit inherited by the Panhellenic Socialist Movement  (PASOK) government from the previous New Democracy (ND)  administration has been "decisively plugged."      * Lower Interest Rates--Businessmen, workers, and industrialists  reacted favorably to National Economy Minister Yiorgos Yennimatas's  efforts to lower interest rates 3 percent, which will foster  investment by both small and large companies.      * Booming Stock Market--The stock market recently broke the  1,000-point mark, reaching the same level it did in February 1992,  when investors still hoped that the ND government's economic policy  would have positive results.      However, the good news was mitigated by the January announcement  that four large textile mills are closing and the fact that the  value of the dollar is constantly rising.  This adds a significant  burden to the servicing of the foreign debt, the size of which  demands heavy taxation and continued austerity.  EU Commission  President Jacques Delors and Economics and Financial Affairs  Commissioner Henning Christophersen have already met with Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou and Yennimatas to ask them to pursue  such an austerity policy, the article reports.  While EU officials  "showed understanding," they expressed doubts that the 1994 budget,  which promises to lower the deficit, can be adhered to if austerity  is not followed.      EU doubts are shared by Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis,  Commerce Minister Kostas Simitis, and alternate National Economy  Minister Ioannis Papandoniou, who also advocate austerity measures.  They argue that of the three elections scheduled during the  government's term--European Parliament, municipal, and legislative  elections--the most critical one is the last, allowing the  government time to enact politically costly austerity measures.  While Papandreou shares his ministers' concern, he rejects tighter  economic policies at this time, fearing that austerity will plunge  the economy into an unprecedented recession from which it would be  difficult to dig out.  He is thus advocating Yennimatas's policy of  only tightening tax collection.  According to the article, this  "formidable" task cannot be carried out by Yennimatas, who is ill  with cancer, alone and Deputy Minister of Finance Alexandros  Papadhopoulos may soon have his responsibilities expanded to help  out. (RM)  (Athens TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS in Greek 9 Jan 94 p A4)      REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT BANK ESTABLISHED IN SALONICA--The Black Sea  Economic Cooperation Organization, whose members are Albania,  Azerbaijan, Armenia, Bulgaria, Romania, Georgia, Greece, Moldova,  Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine, selected Salonica as the site for its  newly-created Black Sea Development and Commerce Bank.  The  selection of Greece for the bank is a significant challenge for  Greece, as well as a "window of opportunity" for the country to  promote Greek entrepreneurship and economic leadership in the  Balkans and the Black Sea region.  The bank is scheduled to open in  1994.  However, it may be delayed because of its members' different  levels of development and national political and economic goals.      The bank presidency will rotate among its members.  The first  governor will be Turkish and his deputy Bulgarian.  Greece will be  responsible for the bank's organization and operation.  Each country  will contribute to the financing of the institution with alternative  funding to come from the "plethora" of EU, European Reconstruction  and Development Bank (EBRD), European Investment Bank (EIB), and  World Bank programs.

Following is a summary of the positions the advocate:      * Mario Baldassari, Pact for Italy      --Guarantee a tax ceiling, reducing tax rate from 43 to 40  percent.  Broaden the tax base through agreements with the self-  employed.  Reduce the number of taxes from 200 to no more than 10,  since 80 percent of revenues come from six taxes.     --Modify public assistance regulations.  Intervene to save the  pension system by raising minimum pension age, establishing  compulsory contributions, and creating private pension funds.     --Increase the pace of privatization and include municipal  companies and local savings banks.  Create a network of merchant  banks for small- and medium-sized companies.      * Giancarlo Pagliarini, Northern League      --Establish a tax ceiling, with a rate which has a "fair"  percentage share of GDP.     --Pay for health care and pensions through the EU's budget.  Change to a contribution-defined system rather than a benefit-  defined system.  Those outside the system who do not contribute  should receive state benefits.  Contributions should be managed by  pension funds in competition with each other rather than by the  National Agency for Social Security (INPS).     --Extend privatization to everything because "it makes no sense  for the state to manage the economy."      * Roberto Pinza, Italian Popular Party      --Do not impose a tax ceiling before country's finances are in  order.  Meanwhile, follow the policy established by the current  legislature for the  next few years.  Simplify and return tax  refunds as quickly as possible.     --Seek and maintain a balance between efficiency and state  benefits, especially health-related benefits.  Give public  assistance to those who really need it and require those less needy  to pay for it.     --Privatize but keep strategic industries under state control.  Additionally, Pinza is "worried" about privatizing savings banks.  He would recommend not allowing local governments to control all the  savings banks.      * Antonio Martino, Forza Italia      --Establish a tax ceiling to control spending.     --Find more efficient methods of parcelling out state aid.  Provide non-negotiable vouchers to purchase health insurance plans,  allowing personal choice of which one.  Martino claims this would  produce more efficient health care for everyone at half the present  health care cost     --Extend privatization to many industries which are currently  under political and bureaucratic control.  Martino views the linkage  of economic and political interests as the principal cause of  corruption in Italy.      * Maurizio Gasparri, National Alliance      --Limit spending, either through a constitutional mandate or  through law.  Reduce tax rates to fight tax evasion.     --Give more administrative autonomy to individual benefit  categories.  For example, social security and health care could be  self-managed by groups such as company employees or by larger  classes such as public employees or steelworkers.  The state must  guarantee a minimum of assistance to the neediest and public  assistance must no longer be a political bargaining chip.     --Remove obstacles to privatization but maintain state control  over certain strategic companies and over a part of the banking  system to avoid being "colonized by the multinationals."  Diversify  ownership of companies.  Remove the tax from reinvested company  profits because such reinvestment stimulates the economy, increases  production, and increases government revenues. (AB)  (Rome IL  MESSAGGERO in Italian 26 Jan 94 p 2)      MAJOR UNIONS TO UNITE IN 'SECOND REPUBLIC'--On 20 January the  national secretaries of three major unions--the Italian General  Confederation of Labor (CGIL), the Italian Confederation of Trade  Unions (CISL), and the Italian Federation of Trade Unions (UIL)-  -announced that they will unite during the upcoming political and  constitutional changeover to a "Second Republic" which will occur  during 1994-95.  The new union will not be a merger of the three  federations but a totally new entity that will have to identify its  new functions and rationalize its activities.  According to Giorgio  Lonardi writing in LA REPUBBLICA, the union will heavily affect the  present unions' bureaucracy, and CGIL Secretary Bruno Trentin said  that the number of full-time officials will be "drastically"  reduced.  CISL Secretary Sergio D'Antoni agreed that the new union  management will be slimmer and recognized that there will be a  problem in redistributing its human resources.  The new union will  be a "revolutionary order with precise definitions for the role and  participation of the workers," according to D'Antoni.      Both Trentin and D'Antoni agreed that the new union will be  apolitical.  It's institutions will be stronger this way, D'Antoni  said, and the union's major role will be to represent the workers  before whatever government may be in power.  This does not mean that  the union cannot have its own positions or that individual leaders  cannot make political choices, D'Antoni noted.  Trentin added,  however, that the union's contribution to a discussion between  political forces "is something else." (AB)  (Rome LA REPUBBLICA in  Italian 21 Jan 94 P 40)      PORTUGAL      FARMERS RECEIVE SMALL SHARE OF EU AID--According to a statement  by the Farmers' Confederation of Portugal (CAP), Portuguese farmers  received less than a third of EU farm subsidies granted to the  country.  A CAP-commissioned study showed that farmers received  public funds from both national and EU sources of about 263 million  contos between 1986 and 1992, a "far cry" from the 900 million  contos touted as the total by the government.  Another study  conducted by agronomist Sevinate Pinto and Francisco Avillez,  professor at the Higher Institute of Agronomy, contends that the  income of Portuguese farmers fell by almost half in the last three  years.  The study showed that in the eight years since Portugal  entered the EU, farmers received 346 million contos from EU  subsidies and from the General State Budget (OGE).  In comparison,  the country made interest payments of 412 million contos to  financial institutions during this time.  The study contends that  consumers, taxpayers, and the state have benefited from the sizable  drop in national assistance to the agricultural sector and the  significant drop in farm prices.  The authors also maintain that  only 60 percent of the funds provided by the European Farm  Orientation and Guarantee Fund (FEOGA) went to producers, with the  remaining 40 percent shared in almost equal parts by exporters,  consumers, and the state.

He revealed that Volvo will return to being only a  manufacturing company, shedding the diverse service businesses it  was involved in previously.  Gyll saw a favorable economic climate  for this streamlining, noting that "the positive factors in the  market outweigh the negative ones."  Volvo's earnings are expected  to total 5 billion kronor this year and 10 billion next year.  According to Gyll, the company's passenger car division has captured  new market shares in Sweden, Germany, and Great Britain.  Gyll also  said that the Volvo-Renault partnership is being reviewed to see how  common operations such as purchasing, quality control, and  production planning can be divided.  The two firms are also  examining which previously planned projects remain worthwhile.  Mutual purchasing agreements will remain in effect.  (WS)  (Stockholm DAGENS NYHETER in Swedish 17 January 94 p C1)      SWITZERLAND      STUDY SAYS JOINING EU WOULD HELP GROWTH, J0BS--If Switzerland  joined the EU, its economy would grow "slightly" faster and  potential job losses would be avoided, according to a study prepared  for the Swiss government by the St. Gall Center for Future Research.  According to the study, Switzerland's annual growth rate would  accelerate from 1.2 to 1.5 percent by the year 2000 if it joined the  EU.  Becoming part of the Union would also make overall employment  prospects in Switzerland "less negative":  as an EU member,  Switzerland could expect to lose about 13,000 jobs by the year 2000;  if it remained outside the Union, however, it would face the  prospect of losing 30,000 jobs in the same period.      The study found that those industries which are already  internationally oriented would profit most if Switzerland joined the  EU.  The service sector, for example, would register 25.5 billion  Swiss francs (SFr) in annual growth in the EU, versus SFr22 billion  outside.  Similarly, the Swiss chemical industry would grow by  SFr4.4 billion inside the EU, but by only SFR3.1 billion outside.  Other industries more oriented toward domestic consumption, however,  would suffer in the event of Swiss EU entry.  The food and luxury  goods industry, for example, could expect "slight" growth of SFr40  million outside the EU but would shrink by SFr700 million if  Switzerland joined the Union.  EU membership would also mean losses  for the agriculture and clothing industries.

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Finland raises interest rates Finland's central bank surprised financial markets yesterday by raising official interest rates for the first time in two years to damp rising inflation expectations and cost pressures which it said threatened price stability. The move, lifting its 'tender' rate for short-term money market lending to 5.5 per cent from 5.01 per cent, came despite historically low inflation rates in Finland. Year-on-year inflation is running at 1.9 per cent after a deep recession which shrank the economy by 15 per cent and pushed unemployment to almost 20 per cent of the workforce. But the central bank is worried that a surge back to strong economic growth - gross national product is expected to rise by more than five per cent in 1995 - could trigger renewed inflation growth through wage claims and capacity shortages.</p>

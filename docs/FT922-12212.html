			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / US team at Scots steel plant today A TEAM from Nucor, the US steel company, is visiting the Ravenscraig steelworks in Scotland today to look at the viability and production of liquid steel. The two-day visit was arranged by Scottish Enterprise, formerly the Scottish development agency, which was entrusted with marketing the site after British Steel decided to close it. Ravenscraig is due to close in September with the loss of 1,200 jobs. Mr Keith Busse, Nucor's general manger, said the team's findings would be studied by the company and that it would probably be a month before any conclusions were reached. Nucor is thought to want to establish a foothold in the European market.</p>

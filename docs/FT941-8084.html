			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (South Africa): Bullion weakness pressures gold stocks Johannesburg struggled to attract investor interest owing to the closure of Wall Street, with traders commenting that only weakness in the price of bullion provided some direction throughout the session. Sentiment also remained under pressure from the stalled constitutional talks and further violence at the weekend, when 15 ANC election campaigners were killed in Natal province. The golds index lost 40 at 1,862, industrials gained 9 at 5,704 and the overall index edged down 21 to 4,831. Both De Beers and Anglos declined R1.50 to R105.50 and R194 respectively. In golds, Kloof shed 50 cents to R43.25 and Vaal Reefs R12 to R406. Among the industrial stocks, Barlow Rand dipped 10 cents to R28.50 and SAB fell by 75 cents to R87.</p>

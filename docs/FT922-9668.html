			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: US media boss sees second half recovery A RECOVERY in earnings in the second half of 1992 was forecast yesterday by Mr Daniel Burke, president and chief executive of Capital Cities/ABC, the US television and newspapers group. Mr Burke told shareholders the second-half results would benefit from an improvement in advertising demand in the broadcasting division. The company's shares reacted with a rise of Dollars 8 3/4 to close at Dollars 449. 'We cannot make predictions beyond that for the balance of the year, although we expect the company's expense growth to be modest,' he said. The media group's 1991 net income declined by 28.1 per cent to Dollars 343.5m, on revenues of Dollars 5.4bn. In the first quarter of 1992 net profits at Capital Cities/ABC plunged by 45 per cent, to Dollars 58.6m, on unchanged revenues of Dollars 1.26bn. Mr Burke promised that ABC would remain 'a player of consequence' in the global television market, having established partnerships in seven media-based ventures.</p>

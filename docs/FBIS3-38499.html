			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "Will Ciller Run Out of Smoke </F> Screens?"]    [Text] Only on Saturday [29 January] we wholeheartedly  applauded the Turkish air raid against the Zhalah terrorist camp  of the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) and said we believed the  terrorists got what they deserved. Now we see that an  unfortunate controversy has surrounded the military operation  against Zhalah in northern Iraq.    The operation against Zhalah was justified and well overdue.  We had pointed out several times in the past in the TURKISH  DAILY NEWS that the Iraqi Kurdish leaders had lost control over  the separatist militants of the PKK who were using Zhalah as a  logistics base as well as a training camp. The fact that Turkey  can launch such an operation deep inside a foreign territory  should be an appropriate message for all those who provide  shelter to terrorists. This is all fine. Yet we are saddened  by claims that Ciller had ordered the air raid against Zhalah  simply to divert public attention from her economic defeat when  the Turkish lira was devalued by 13.6 percent earlier last week.  We know well that the military had contingency plans to raid  Zhalah and that all preparations had been made for the attack.  Yet we are now told that Ciller wanted the air raid on Friday  at short notice for her own political benefit rather than to  fulfill a particular security goal. The fact that the PKK  claims its casualties are minimal, and is prepared to take  journalists to Zhalah to prove it, will put many people in a  poor light. It seems Ciller did not bargain for the current  controversy surrounding the Zhalah raid. Now she will have to  create a new smoke screen to make people forget the Zhalah  incident. So what can she do?    She can start with devaluing the Turkish lira a bit more, or  even announce a new bitter economic austerity package to bring  us back to our senses. Then we will all be thinking about our  pockets again and we can forget about Zhalah...    If things really get out of hand and people revolt, then  Tansu Ciller could even declare war on Armenia or Syria to once  again divert our attention abroad.    She will never run out of smoke screens and the Turkish  nation will continue to find itself in woman-made disasters  until the people get the chance to vote her out of office or her  own party deposes her.</p>

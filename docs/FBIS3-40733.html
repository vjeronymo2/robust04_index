			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ashok Mitra: "Capitulation and Decapitation"] </F>   [Text] The rebuff to the Bharatiya Janata Party apart, on  at least one other matter the verdict of Aryavarta is not  encumbered by ifs and buts. For the first time, a proposed  international treaty was made an electoral issue in this country.    The nation's largest political party, now ruling at the  Centre, had chosen to defend before the electorate its decision  to accept the Dunkel draft. The implementation of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade proposals, its election manifesto  sought to say, would be a great boon to the Indian peasantry.  The government should cherish no illusions: the Dunkel draft has  not received Aryavarta's mandate, and particularly not the  mandate of the Uttar Pradesh farm belt.    Perhaps that will not bother the government too much.  Decisions on crucial economic questions have for some while  ceased to be made on the basis of any objective assessment of  the predilections and interests of citizens. Discussion in  Parliament on the implications of the GATT document has been  carefully avoided for as long as possible.    Negotiating an international agreement, the prime minister,  Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, has obliquely suggested, is the  prerogative of the government. Were the final signed document to  turn out not to the liking of the representatives of the people  the latter could, he seems to imply, move a vote of no  confidence against the government. It would now perhaps be  claimed on behalf of the prime minister that just as the  assembly elections were not a referendum on the performance of  his government, they constituted no referendum on the Dunkel  draft either.    The prime minister and his party would clearly be caught in  a  bit of a contradiction here. The backtracking would, however, be  understandable. Politicians, at least those who are without  ideology and have assumed politics to be not dissimilar to any  other random profession, have to survive in power, which  compulsion necessitates occasional dissembling.    The issue will still not go away. The Dunkel draft is not  like any other ordinary international treaty dealing with this  or that aspect of external relations. It is going to interfere  with India's internal economic processes.    Under the guise of ushering in an international trade regime  untramelled by tariffs and other restrictions, it would  restructure production, distribution and pricing arrangements in  country after country, including in this one. The government  would be on extremely vulnerable grounds were it to suggest the  effects of such restructuring on the people is no business of  Parliament.    Provisions in the draft concerning the pharmaceutical or  software industries, biodiversities, finance and communications  aside, two matters stand out. The consequences for the country's  public distribution system including the system of food and  necessity subsidy, and the vulnerability of agriculture if farm  products from overseas were allowed entry into the country.    The government, faithfully adherent to the notes furnished  by  the GATT secretariat, has sought to laugh away the possibility  of any post-Dunkel upheaval affecting the existing public  distribution arrangements. Its point of view is deceptively  simple. Subsidy in the case of a foodgrain distributed by a  government agency, the draft says, must not be more than 10 per  cent of the prevailing market price of the grain.    In no year in the past decade, it seems, has the subsidy for  publicly distributed wheat or rice exceeded this margin. What  has not happened in the past is unlikely to happen in the future  either, the government argues. The apprehensions of economists  and Opposition politicians, it suggests, are altogether  unfounded. The discretionary margin allowed by the draft  agreement is sufficiently wide for the power to distribute  subsidised food to the weaker sections of society to be left  unimpaired.    But will it? No major crop failure has taken place in the  country during the past decade. The demands placed on the public  distribution system have naturally been modest and the gap  between the market price and the price in ration and fair price  shops for the main cereals has been relatively narrow.    However, if the rains fail in some years in the proximate  future this will change. And this could well happen as the  country has had good rains successively for five years. The  resulting crop failure might then lead to a steep decline in  market supplies. Foodgrain prices could skyrocket.    Going by what was experienced in the mid-Sixties, it is by  no  means certain that a price rise of 200 to 300 per cent would not  take place in the event of a mere 20 per cent drop in output.  The market price for the principal cereals could shoot up to as  much as Rs 20 per kilogram--if not everywhere, at least in some  parts of the country. Were the Dunkel proposals to become the  law of the land the government would in that eventuality be  precluded from distributing rice or wheat at less than Rs 18 per  kilogram.    Few of the nation's poor would be able to afford this price.  In case the government were to announce, as part of famine  relief operations, the free distribution of grain to distressed  people, nothing would stop a free market zealot from requesting  the GATT authorities that penal action be initiated against the  Indian authorities for distributing farm products at a 100 per  cent subsidy.    What is more, once the draft is signed, the government will  have to allow the import of any and every agricultural commodity  to the extent of 3.3 per cent of its domestic output. This is  not as harmless as it sounds. Economic textbooks are full of  examples of the violent price fluctuations of a farm product  that could be brought about by a marginal increase or decrease  in its supplies.    Once expectations are queered in a particular manner, and  speculators and buyers are conditioned in their behaviour, even  a marginal augmentation of supply is capable of bringing down  prices by as much as 50 or 60 per cent, and thereby ruining the  peasantry.    This clause inserted in the Dunkel proposals is not  necessarily an innocent academic proviso. Some years ago, a  group of strategists ensconced in the World Bank had floated a  trial balloon. Global efficiency of production deserved to be  maximised, including farm output. Agricultural productivity in  the United States and Canada, as is common knowledge, is way  ahead of productivity in other parts of the world, including of  course Asia, Africa and Latin America. If the objective is--as  it should be--to raise global resource use to its most feasible  level, would it therefore not be sensible to concentrate all  farm activity in the US and Canada alone?    The strategists ensconced inside the World Bank were not  deterred by piffling little details. They did not care to spell  out the alternative occupation or livelihood the poor peasantry  in the inefficient countries could switch to if they surrendered  their right to cultivate their land and became wholly dependent  on imports.    Though the peasants of these poor lands would be without any  occupation or income, it might nonetheless be insisted upon they  pay for their imports at proper North American prices. It would  be too bad if they failed to pay such prices. Imports would stop  and they would be welcome to starve and die.    What is apocalypse to some is millenium to others. The  Dunkel  draft incorporates in itself the vision of a millenium thought  up by the world's rich. Should the agriculture of a poor country  collapse, the multinational monopolies could comfortably move in  and do whatever they wanted with the country's food and  agricultural policy.    It is a beautiful scheme. Once the signatures get appended  to  the Dunkel proposals, it would be binding on the government. The  latter has for months on end refused to face Parliament on the  issue, and it would be furiously denied that the verdict in UP  is in part an expression of the people's wrath at the  endorsement of the GATT final draft. Cheered by Western  governments and the multinational lobby, it would proceed to  arrange the noose around the nation's neck, nor would it feel  ashamed at being present at its own beheading.</p>

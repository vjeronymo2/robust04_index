			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S., ISRAEL AND CONRAD  </P> <P> On June 10, The Times reported on China, "U.S. Calls Reprisals Against  Dissident Leaders Repugnant." In the same issue it was also reported, "U.S.  Vetoes U.N. Resolution Condemning Israel on Arab Areas."  </P> <P> The excuse for this latest unanimous U.N. vote against Israel (excepting us, of  course) was that the resolution did not carry a condemnation of the Palestinian  "violence."  </P> <P> As the historical facts show, these people are fighting for their freedom and  that the basic mode of resistance has been stones against guns. Further facts  are that it has been for the most part children who have been the victims of  this ongoing policy.  </P> <P> Recently, there has been a number of letters condemning Conrad for his cartoons  on Israel (June 8 and 12). Quite typically these letters summon up the old  Israel is a "democracy" bit, and point fingers at others such as Syria, the  Soviet Union, and now with the new opportunity of diverting attention away from  Israel we are supposed to direct our righteousness towards China.  </P> <P> The U.S. does not give any of these nations $3.5 billion a year as we do for  Israel. Since the intifada began in December, 1987, we have given Israel $5  billion. This comes out to $10 million for each Palestinian killed.  </P> <P> A thorough knowledge of what is behind this undaunted support of Israel  assaults one's very sense of national respect. Americans should start to ask  themselves what is it that compels children to lay down their lives time and  time and time again, and what is behind our support of this Israeli policy  while we go chasing after everything else?  </P> <P> TOM MORAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

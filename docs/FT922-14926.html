			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Nuclear stand was 'error of judgment' MR NEIL KINNOCK last night candidly admitted to errors of judgment in his support for unilateral nuclear disarmament and failure to campaign to change Labour's policy on the European Community after the 1975 referendum. His admission, in an ITV interview with Sir Robin Day, came after the Labour leader denied that his readiness for an all-party commission on electoral reform was an 'open door' to a pact with the Liberal Democrats. Looking confident and relaxed, Mr Kinnock said he had believed unilateral disarmament was the only means of breaking the 'log jam' in the build-up of nuclear weapons. On reflection this 'may have been an error of judgment'. On the EC, Mr Kinnock said that in retrospect he believed Labour should have accepted the verdict of the 1975 plebiscite which overwhelmingly supported continued British EC membership. But he added that he was guided by the principle of collective responsibility which precluded him from publicly opposing the party. In the event he changed his own position shortly before the 1983 election and made his views known afterwards. 'Such was the turmoil and the weakness in my party, to which I owe a duty, I wasn't going to inflict an additional burden,' he said. Questioned on devolution, Mr Kinnock denied that he had opposed the move on principle, but only in the form proposed by the Callaghan government's referendum in 1978. He also strongly defended Labour's tax and national insurance plans, set to raise total deductions for top payers to 59 per cent.</p>

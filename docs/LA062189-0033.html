			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO STATE SUSPENDS TRACK AND FIELD PROGRAM  </P> <P> Citing increased budget problems within the athletic department, San Diego  State Athletic Director Fred Miller announced Tuesday the indefinite suspension  of men's and women's track and field.  </P> <P> Miller, who made the announcement at SDSU's football operations center, said  the athletic department needed to make "cost-containing moves" because of a  budget deficit that has now reached $577,000.  </P> <P> The cutting of track and field would save about $225,000 on the 1989-90 budget,  Miller said.  </P> <P> After dropping track, SDSU needed to add another women's sport to meet the NCAA  requirements for remaining a Division I program, and Miller also announced the  addition of women's soccer. SDSU now has 15 sports, eight men's and seven  women's.  </P> <P> Women's soccer, which will offer no scholarships initially, will cost around  $5,000 because it is already a club sport that generates its own income. Chuck  Clegg, the men's soccer coach, will serve as director of soccer, overseeing men  and women.  </P> <P> "We take no pride in this kind of announcement," Miller said. "Other  universities are in the same situation. We're no different than anyone's family  budget, where we've spent more than we've taken in."  </P> <P> Miller said revenue from football was down about $190,000 from projected  figures because of sluggish attendance stemming from the poor records of the  past two seasons. Men's basketball revenue was $85,000 above projections, but  it was not enough to save track.  </P> <P> "We only have two income generators, football and (men's) basketball. Those  programs have to succeed. And we have to make sure those programs succeed,"  Miller said.  </P> <P> Jim Cerveny, director of men's and women's track and field, said Miller  notified him of the school's action around 5 p.m. Monday, and the two met  Tuesday morning to discuss the situation further. Cerveny accepted the news but  refused to see it as the end of track at SDSU.  </P> <P> "It was difficult to accept," Cerveny said. "But we knew we had to make some  budget cuts. Dr. Miller has been very positive all the way. I really believe he  didn't want to cut the program. Our program was the easiest solution to the  budgetary needs."  </P> <P> But he added, "I don't want the rug to be pulled. Cut my budget, but let me run  a program." He said he could run the program with $150,000 and will try to  revive it through donations.  </P> <P> He said that $50,000 of that budget is set aside for scholarships and grants,  which the school has agreed to honor next season anyway. Of the remaining  $100,000 needed, Cerveny said he already has $20,000 committed ($10,000 from  the athletic department and $5,000 each from the budgets of men's soccer team  and men's volleyball) and has set a Aug. 1 deadline to raise the additional  money.  </P> <P> "I figure that we're not ready to quit. We're survivors."  </P> <P> The track program consisted of approximately 90 athletes (this year's roster  listed 57 men and 32 women) and four coaches, including Cerveny, who has been  at SDSU for eight years after coaching highly successful Morse High teams from  1974 to 1981.  </P> <P> Last year, SDSU received $225,000 in grants from the state for improvements to  Choc Sportsman Track, a state-of-the-art, multi-event facility. The  improvements have been completed, and the improved facility was scheduled as  the site of the Western Athletic Conference championships in 1991.  </P> <P> Miller said SDSU will honor all track scholarships and grants next year if the  athlete chooses to remain at the school. Those wishing to transfer will be  permitted to compete immediately for a new school under the NCAA rules of  transfering from a canceled program.  </P> <P> The suspension of the program puts the futures of many of its participants in  doubt. At least one of its best athletes thinks he will have no choice but to  transfer.  </P> <P> Said Pat Thiss, a junior hammer thrower who finished 14th at the NCAA  championships this month, "I don't know why they cut our program. The women's  basketball team is in mid-scandal. They just fired the coach. They're paying  Denny Stolz to coach golf. Why do they cut us?  </P> <P> "We don't cause problems. We never cause problems. We win. We send athletes to  the nationals. Fred Miller dropped a bomb on us. He really did a number on us.  That's 90 athletes who have really had a monkey wrench thrown into their  lives."  </P> <P> Thiss said he will wait before deciding whether to transfer. But he made it  clear that if track is not reinstated, he will leave. "I'm on schedule to  graduate. Transfering to another school would really put me back. But I would  have to transfer," he said.  </P> <P> Cerveny, who is also the men's and women's cross-country coach, said the school  will keep him for the fall cross-country season, but his status is uncertain  after Feb. 1, 1990.  </P></p>

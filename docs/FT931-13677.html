			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Letter: Contracting out not affected by judgment Sir, Your labour editor has drawn attention ('EC setback for ministers on contracting-out', January 18) to a recent case in the European Court of Justice, Rask v ISS Kantineservice A/S. It was suggested that the judgment in this case means that the EC Acquired Rights Directive applies when a service is contracted out. In fact the judgment went no further than to confirm that the directive is capable, in principle, of applying in such cases. There is nothing new in this. The judgment specifically left it to the Danish courts to decide, on the facts of the case, whether a transfer of an undertaking had taken place. The Rask case therefore makes no difference to the position which has been long understood, that employees will only have rights under the directive if the undertaking in which they work has been transferred as a going concern. If no more than a contract to provide a service has been transferred, the directive does not apply. The Rask judgment does not therefore have the effect of applying the directive to contracting out, any more than it applied in such cases before. Michael Forsyth, Minister of State for Employment, Department of Employment, Caxton House, Tothill Street, London SW1</p>

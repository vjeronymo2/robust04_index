			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (14): A humble investor is agreeably surprised - The portfolio, up 58 per cent in 15 months, has been helped by a number of cautious decisions, and by retaining a hefty cash pile I AM just a private investor. I have no access to company meetings with analysts and direct company contacts. There are no computer experts, marketmakers and economists suggesting and supporting my individual investment decisions. Yet, somewhat to my surprise, the portfolio I started with a notional Pounds 10,000 in the autumn of 1991 has now grown to Pounds 15,835 - an increase of 58 per cent in 15 months. One of the reasons why I am surprised by the extent of its success is because, when I was first asked to create a portfolio for the Review, it was impressed upon me that I should adopt a somewhat cautious approach and not be 'too speculative'. While I thought the good gains could be made over the longer term, in the short term I believed a conservative portfolio might be lacklustre. However, I think the portfolio has been helped by a number of cautious decisions: only investing in companies which it was thought were undervalued and had solid assets; waiting for some of the target companies to fall in price before making an investment; and not being over-dependent on any one company for success, but retaining a rather hefty cash pile. It was a sound, and cautious, approach that led to the portfolio investing in Taveners, a UK confectionery firm. But the company was profitable, and I thought that, at 70p, the shares were undervalued as several years earlier the price had soared to 220p on takeover speculation. When Fabrikker, a Danish company, took over Taveners last year it meant that the portfolio's Pounds 2,450 investment in that company turned into Pounds 5,985 in cash. It was caution which prevented the portfolio buying shares in Fisons at 356p each. In last spring's quarterly review, I wondered if all the bad news about the company had been discovered and released. The portfolio played safe. Fisons then announced a downturn in profits and the shares slumped. The portfolio eventually bought Fisons shares for 168p last August. The shares are now 238p, helped by the company selling its consumer health care businesses in the UK, US and Canada. While Fisons still has some takeover attractions and the possibilities of a jump in share price if the various new drugs gain US approval, the portfolio will retain its cautious stance towards the company and will raise its 'stop loss' limit (the price at which it will sell the shares) to 200p. If the shares drop back again to the 160-70p level, then, depending on prospects for the company and general stock market conditions, a further purchase of Fisons' shares would be contemplated. Another cautious purchase was Pentland group shares at 99p each. I have long been impressed by the quality of Pentland's management, and my personal pension scheme owns some Pentland shares. While the company's greetings card division might have had a tough Christmas, and a decline in interest rates must have some effect on Pentland's cash pile of over Pounds 300m, I feel that some analysts have underestimated Pentland's management. The shares are still good value at 127p taking a long-term view, as its Speedo swimwear division ought to be progressing well. The portfolio will raise its 'stop loss' limit on Pentland to 110p. If the shares subsequently fell back to 95p, then further purchases will be considered. Caution led to the purchase of shares in Burlington group at 11.5p each, as the company had net assets worth more than its then share price. I warned, however, that the shares should not be chased too far as, in the past, they had tended to rise and fall rapidly. This proved to be sound advice. Soon after the article was published, Burlington shares raced upwards and by November were 17p. If I had not written the article, I would have sold my personal pension scheme's shares in Burlington at around that level expecting (as in the past) to be able to buy them back again at much lower levels. I did not do this as, being an ethical fellow, in the absence of any other news to explain Burlington's share price rise, it might have looked as if I had profited from 'talking up' Burlington. Soon after reaching 17p, Burlington shares fell back to 13p before moving smartly upwards again. Maybe the recent rise means that something is about to happen at Burlington? I hope so. But in the absence of any bid rumours, the portfolio will sell its Burlington shares if they reach 23p-25p, in the hope of being able to buy them back again should they fall to around 12p-13p. While caution sometimes pays, it can also hamper the quick acquisition of profits. If the portfolio had invested Pounds 8,000 of its cash pile in Burlington shares (instead of only Pounds 920), it would have turned that sum into Pounds 13,217 at the recent peak of 19p. Caution also prevented a profit being made on Allied Colloids, where the portfolio was hoping the shares would fall from around 212p to 170p-180p. The shares did not fall, but powered ahead to 245p. The portfolio will continue to follow Allied Colloids, as more than 80 per cent of this speciality chemical company's sales are to overseas customers so that it ought to benefit from the pound's devaluation. Although I am still expecting a general downturn in the UK and US stock markets, which I consider to be currently at too-high levels for comfort, I will raise the price at which the portfolio will be prepared to buy Allied Colloid's shares to 200-210p. While maintaining the portfolio's cautious stance, the heavy cash weighting in times of comparatively low interest rate, is causing me some concern. I feel that, if there is recovery to be achieved within the next 18 months or so (and I still have some doubts), the strongly managed engineering companies with sizeable overseas sales should be among the first to benefit when a significant upturn occurs. I particularly like Meggitt, which has a market capitalisation of Pounds 212m and in which BTR has an 18.2 per cent interest. If the shares fell to 75p-80p and looked as if they would not fall much further, the portfolio would buy 2,000 of them. Renishaw is a company involved in the design, manufacture and sale of advanced precision metrology and inspection equipment. Over 90 per cent of its sales are to overseas customers. If Renishaw's share price fell to around 240p-250p, the portfolio would consider buying 1,000 of them. Another engineering group with appeal is EIS group. If its shares fell back to their 1992-3 low of 355p, then the portfolio would consider buying 750 of them. I also like William Ransom (in which my pension scheme has a small holding). This company manufactures pharmaceutical products and appears to be well managed. If the shares fell to around 40-45p, the portfolio would consider buying 5,000. All these potential purchases would take rather more than the cash available in the portfolio, but I do not expect them all to fall within the limit set. Some may well remain above the hoped-for purchase price. Which ones I do not know, but at least the portfolio will be prepared. The author of this feature, which commenced in the autumn 1991 issue of the Review, is familiar to many readers as the writer of the Diary of a Private Investor column in the Weekend FT.  The Review invited him to suggest a Pounds 10,000 portfolio for capital growth, without being too speculative. The opinions expressed are his own.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- How the Pounds 10,000 portfolio stands after 15 months  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  Number    Purchase    Cost     Jan 14       Jan 14 Company         of shares  price (p) (Pounds)  price (p)  value (Pounds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pentland          3,500       99      3,465      127         4,445 Fisons            1,000      168      1,680      238         2,380 Burlington Group  8,000     11.5        920       16         1,280 Cash*                                                        7,730 Total                                                       15,835  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Cash figure allows for interest in the Lazard Money Market fund and dividends  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

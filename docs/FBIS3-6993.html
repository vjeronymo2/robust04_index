			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the spokesman of the Committee for the </F> Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland in Pyongyang on 22  March]    [Text] The spokesman of the Committee for the Peaceful  Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF] issued the following  statement denouncing the South Korean authorities for moving  toward confrontation and war, totally blocking the exchange of  top-level special envoys and dialogue between the North and the  South.    Statement by the spokesman of the CPRF:    Currently, the South Korean authorities are moving toward  the  road of confrontation and war by totally blocking the exchange  of top-level special envoys and dialogue between the North and  the South.    As is already known, at the threshold the eighth  working-level delegates contact for the exchange of special  envoys held on 19 March, at a high-level strategic meeting, the  South Korean authorities talked about some kind of strong  measure and babbled about the resumption of the Team Spirit  nuclear war exercise, bringing in Patriot missiles, and taking  part in international sanctions. Such provocative action by the  South Korean authorities already predicted the destiny of the  exchange of special envoys and the harassment of peace. Today's  situation has taken that course.    At the 19 March working-level delegates contact, the South  side took a position of virtually declaring separation from us,  thus bringing the working-level delegates contact itself to a  rupture, and it is now driving the situation on the Korean  peninsula to an acute phase of war.    The provocative steps taken at the so-called meeting of  security-related ministers on 21 March was a sort of a  declaration of total confrontation and a declaration of war  against us.    Right after this reckless provocative declaration by the  puppet rulers, the puppet forces entered into an emergency alert  in South Korea and there are signs of moves to bring in new  military equipment, including Patriot missiles from the United  States.    The CPRF resolutely denounces in the name of the entire  Korean people the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique for unilaterally  breaking up the dialogue with fellow countrymen and pushing the  country's situation to a very dangerous brink of war by  following outside forces.    All of today's situation clearly shows that, from the very  beginning, the South Korean rulers did not want peace and  peaceful reunification of the country, not to speak of the  exchange of special envoys, but used the North-South dialogue  for their insidious aim of putting the brakes on the DPRK-U.S.  talks.    The reality in which the country's situation is rushing to a  new phase of war urges the whole nation to see with high  consciousness what a grave situation has been caused by the  criminal acts of the Kim Yong-sam ring in abandoning the  North-South dialogue and obstructing the DPRK-U.S. talks.    Facts show that the North and the South may fall victim to  outside forces, failing to achieve reconciliation and  reunification, while such flunkeyist nation-sellers and national  traitors as the Kim Yong-sam ring are left alone in the country,  the traitors who set greater store by the interests of outside  forces than by the nation's security and interests and think  more of their personal comfort and distinction than of the  nation's destiny.    Now, the Kim Yong-sam ring has become unable to conceal the  fact that it is an antinational group that blocks dialogue  between the fellow countrymen and seeks to inflict the scourge  of war upon the nation, keeping outside forces within the  country. The national traitors must be removed and liquidated  within the nation as early as possible.    As long as the South Korean people already judged that there  is nothing more to expect from the Kim Yong-sam fascist  nation-selling regime, we will carry out a resolute struggle to  eliminate the nation-sellers in the hope of promoting  reconciliation and unity between the North and the South and  open the road for the country's peace and peaceful reunification.    [Issued] 22 March 1994, Pyongyang</p>

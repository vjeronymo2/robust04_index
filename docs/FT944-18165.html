			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / The Gooda Walker Judgment: ASA uphold Lloyd's complaint The Advertising Standards Authority, the advertising watchdog, yesterday upheld a complaint by Lloyd's that a group of names had placed 'inaccurate, grossly misleading and offensive' advertisements in the press. The regional press advertisements, from the Wellington Names Association, were headlined 'How many more people have to die before Lloyd's is brought to account?' A subheading read: 'At least 31 suicides and premature deaths have been attributed to the losses sustained by Lloyd's Names.' The ASA said it was concerned with the lack of substantiation for all of the 31 deaths, and asked the advertisers not to refer to them again.</p>

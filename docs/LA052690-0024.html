			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TO SILVER'S DEFENSE  </P> <P> To label Gerald A. Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino, a "slow-growth  gadfly" (L.A. Times, May 10) is to trivialize a person that many of us would  call a civic hero. That pejorative reference reveals your reporter's ignorance  of Silver's tireless and unpaid efforts over some 20 years fighting some of the  most pressing battles facing the San Fernando Valley -- airport noise,  irresponsible development and sewer pollution, just to mention a few.  </P> <P> Gerald Silver, perhaps a "Don Quixote" at worst, is laboring on his own time  and expense to accomplish what we pay city employees to do full time -- to make  this a more livable city. Los Angeles needs more Gerald Silvers, whatever his  label.  </P> <P> ZANVILLE S. GREEN  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Zhan Videnov, chairman of the Bulgarian </F> Socialist Party Supreme Council, by Dora Chichkova in Sofia on 6  June: "If You Fight Battles of the Past You Remain in the Past"]    [Text] Zhan Videnov gave DUMA this interview after a long  and sleepless night on the fourth day of the Bulgarian Socialist  Party [BSP] congress. Very tired, with bloodshot eyes -- which,  according to people close to him, he has had for months -- he  changed all known notions of ability to work and physical and  moral stamina. He was chased by a mob of journalists, who no  longer attach a different family name to his name, and remained  calm, confident, and generous, as the undisputable leader of the  greatest and staunchest Bulgarian party.    [Chichkova] Did you anticipate such an unconditional victory  as party leader?    [Videnov] It is difficult for me to assess this. I can only  say that I did not have any problems with the congress' tactic,  because it fully springs from the strategy I have followed over  the last two and a half years. This is a rather simpler, but  very efficient strategy -- it relies on consistency, dignity,  openness, and selflessness. Others relied on different schemes,  and I think that they made a mistake, because as we all  constantly say, the BSP is a changing party. None of its  congresses repeats the previous one. Whoever wants to fight the  battles of the past should remain in the past.    [Chichkova] I had the feeling that this was a struggle not  only for the formal, but also for the informal BSP leadership.  Does the congress put an end to the inner-party theme of the  dual character of the power, and the theme about the existence  of two or even more centers of power in the party?    [Videnov] I think that the existence of different sources of  political impulse within the BSP is not only a trouble but a  source of wealth for the BSP. We got used to working under such  conditions and utilizing its advantages. We almost completely  eliminated its obvious risks. Therefore, I do not view the  problems regarding the BSP leadership as an action aimed at  annihilating certain weapon emplacements of the enemy. On the  contrary, I strive to connect all those manifestations of talent  and initiative, responsibility and human dignity, into a common  net. There are thousands of such manifestations, they form the  BSP power, and there is no reason to separate them.    [Chichkova] Are you concerned with the future relations with  the BSP Sofia city organization? I mean the recent tension that  was evoked and the results of the congress.    [Videnov] I do not see reason for a lasting conflict. The  BSP Sofia city organization was represented very strongly at the  congress. I had the opportunity both to understand the  congress' thinking and contribute to its forming. I think that  in this process the Sofia delegates became convinced that they  must correct some of their postulates. For example, the issue  regarding the leaders' morals as a BSP problem. This could be  the basic problem of another party, or a certain former party,  but not of the BSP! No, this really is not a BSP problem.    I do not think that the party has the right to utilize its  basic problems in an attempt to resolve tactical tasks. I mean  ideological problems, management problems, and problems related  to the party's dignity. Those problems must remain outside the  realm of tactics. Tactical goals should be pursued by tactical  means. The congress created the opportunity to utilize such  means. I rejoice not at the fact that they failed, but at the  fact that with certain minor exceptions, such means were not  used at all. This shows that the party clearly distinguishes  between its strategy and tactics, and is not inclined to use  every acutely topical issue as a combat weapon.    [Chichkova] At the beginning of your first mandate you said  something like "there is no Zhan Videnov political line." What  could you say at the beginning of your second mandate?    [Videnov] If I remember correctly, I said that Zhan  Videnov's political image is not clear to the party, and that if  the party selected him, it must be aware of the risk it is  taking. I do not know whether the party accepted this risk with  open or closed eyes. I think that they were half opened.    Now, I again would warn the party of the same thing, as far  as the leaders' issue is concerned. I did everything that  depends on me to help the party form, clarify, and stress its  ideological image. I did this also through my participation in  the congress. I think that now the party has a better  opportunity to calculate the risk it took. The new risk the  party will have with its reelected leader is that ... I go a bit  too far in seeking unity of ideas, words, and deeds. I demand  this not only from myself, but also from all the rest, and the  party as a whole. There are complex and deeply rooted inert  processes in our party, and they change very slowly. In any  event, I did not offend anyone. As far as the half-opened eyes  are concerned, they could open completely at the next congress.    [Chichkova] Do the decisions of the 41st BSP Congress  regarding the BSP political line preclude future dramatic splits  such as the one that emerged at the last vote of confidence in  the cabinet?    [Videnov] The congress confirmed the correctness of the  political line implemented after the 1990 40th BSP Congress,  despite all the complex vicissitudes in the political situation  since then. I think that the congress' work was facilitated to a  large degree by the last plenum of the BSP Supreme Council. It  produced a good analysis, clear assessment, and precise  explanation of the need for change. The congress understood the  reasons why we maintained the line of stabilization throughout  all those difficult months, and the reasons that prompted the  change in this line. We decided to seek a solution through  early elections this fall.    [Chichkova] Are the specific steps the BSP intends to adopt  to win those elections clear?    [Videnov] We have two basic tasks. The first is to complete  what we planned, paid for, and practically accomplished in the  activity of the parliament and our relations with the cabinet.  The second is to guarantee that free, honest, and democratic  elections be held in Bulgaria in a stable situation, and that  those elections will produce a mandate for a lasting and  successful leftist-centrist government.    The first task is very difficult, but it could be  implemented. I do not have the illusion, as some of the  congress delegates, that from now on every parliamentary week  will be similar to the last one. No, they will be completely  different, and it will constantly be more difficult.    The second task is even more difficult, not because of the  danger of an authoritarian degeneration of the transition or  radical changes in the political situation and the positions of  the other political forces. (I do not think that those  possibilities are very plausible, but I do not underestimate or  exclude them.) The difficult part is to overcome the thinking  that we can assert ourselves through the negation of others. We  must rely on the principle according to which we could and must  negotiate with everyone.    Moreover, after two and a half years it is high time to  soberly assess the possibilities of a practical leftist-centrist  agreement. Unfortunately, such an agreement does not depend only  on us. I assess the situation in the Bulgarian leftist and  leftist-centrist forces as very bad. However, with a bit more  commitment, consistency, insistence, and concentration of the  BSP efforts, the situation there could probably change.    [Chichkova] Do you like the new BSP Supreme Council?    [Videnov] Yes, I definitely like the new BSP Supreme  Council. I think that it can accomplish a lot. I rejoice  equally at its new members and at the fact that the continuity  in its membership represents the confidence in what my closest  associates in the party and parliamentary leadership have  accomplished in the last two and a half years.</p>

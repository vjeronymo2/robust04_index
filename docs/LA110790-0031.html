			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURY DEADLOCKS, JUDGE DECLARES MISTRIAL IN TRIPLE-MURDER CASE  </P> <P> A judge reluctantly declared a mistrial Tuesday in the Thomas Maniscalco  triple-murder case, the longest in Orange County history, after jurors said  they were hopelessly deadlocked on the 26th day of deliberation.  </P> <P> Some jurors, who told Superior Court Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary they were split  10-2, with most voting for a guilty verdict in the 10-year-old case, said they  questioned the credibility of some of the witnesses for the prosecution.  </P> <P> "The prosecutor did the best he could, but I think it is a very, very weak  case," said Diane Martinez of Fullerton, one of the two holdout jurors.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard M. King told O'Leary he was ready to immediately  retry the Westminster attorney and biker leader, and a Nov. 13 date was set for  a new trial.  </P> <P> The Maniscalco trial began with jury selection more than 17 months ago. The  jury's marathon deliberations continued over two months, surpassing the  previous record for a trial by at least 11 days.  </P> <P> "I guess to just say thank you is rather hollow at this point," O'Leary told  the jurors.  </P> <P> By the time Maniscalco is retried, and co-defendant Daniel Duffy is tried at  the end of 1991, the cost of bringing them to court will run in the millions of  dollars, although the specific costs have not yet been calculated.  </P> <P> Maniscalco, 45, who helped found the Hessian motorcycle gang, is accused of  leading a band of killers to the Westminster home of his former best friend,  Richard (Rabbit) Rizzone, 36, on Memorial Day weekend, 1980, to kill him and  any witnesses. More than a week later Rizzone, Thomas Monahan, 28, considered a  Rizzone bodyguard, and Rena Miley, 19, Rizzone's girlfriend, were found dead at  Rizzone's tract home. Miley had been raped and then shot. The other two were  also shot to death.  </P> <P> Prosecution witnesses said Maniscalco, who describes his legal career as  "dedicated to counterculture people," mainly bikers, was also running drug and  counterfeit money operations. Maniscalco was upset with Rizzone, prosecutors  claim, because he was skimming profits from the illegal operations.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A new wave of Serbian repression in Kosova.  Deputies of the parliament of the Republic of Kosova have  recently been targets of police expeditions. For more, our  correspondent Sherif Konjufca:    [Konjufca] During the last week alone, 30 Albanian families  were raided in the Kallamoc, Serpeve, Drenoc, Karashnik villages  of the Malisheve commune. Among those raided was the house of  Agim Bytyci, deputy of the parliament of Kosova. Gani Krasniqi,  another deputy from this commune, a former prisoner of  conscience for many years, and the chairman of the Communal  Council for Finance, was among many who were maltreated.    The Serbian police behaved with brutality everywhere. On  this occasion, the police damaged the houses and savings of the  raided families and confiscated the passports and other  documents of numerous inhabitants.    The police undertook similar actions in many localities in  Ferizaj, in Prishtina, Suhareke, Obilisht, as well as against  casual passers-by on the roads of Kosova.    Another form of Serbian repression against the Albanians,  through which the ethnic cleansing of Kosova is carried out, is  the seizure of Albanian homes. Dr. Bardhyl Caushi, professor of  the Prishtina University and chairman of the Kosova Jurists'  Independent Association, was added to the great number of those  whose homes were seized.    At the same time, as reported by the BUJKU newspaper, a  Serbian Army unit has been stationed in Mulliq village, in the  border area between Kosova and Albania. This unit is causing  great problems for pupils and inhabitants of the Potok village.    On the other hand, the militant Serbian Association of  Bozhur  asked the Serbian highest authorities to send an official note  to Albania, informing that allegedly 280,000 Albanian nationals  and an even greater number of their followers live on Serbian  territory.</p>

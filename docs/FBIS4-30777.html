			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A cooperation agreement between the Interior  Ministries of the Russian Federation and the Slovak Republic was  signed in Moscow today by Ministers Viktor Yerin and Ladislav  Pittner. [passage omitted]    Our correspondent Jan Smihula interviewed Ladislav Pittner  shortly before the minister's departure from the Russian  capital. [passage omitted]    [Begin recording] [Smihula] Mr. Minister, your talks with  your Russian counterpart lasted 30 minutes longer than  originally planned. Does this mean that some disagreements,  problems have emerged? How do you assess today's talks?    [Pittner] Our talks lasted longer not because of  disagreements, but because of discussing further spheres of  cooperation on which agreements are being drafted by our experts  for signing. Above all, this concerns the issue of police  attaches who are to work in our two countries. A Russian police  attache based in Bratislava will probably be accredited to also  work in other countries of Central and Eastern Europe.  Regarding our police attache, I was promised that he will be  given opportunities to widen his activities to reach other  former Soviet republics.    The other issue concerned archives and we received full  support from the minister for gaining access to the archives to  see, for instance, files on people taken against their will to  Russia. [passage omitted]    We were also promised help in searching for one part of the  President Jozef Tiso [World War II pro-Nazi leader] archive.  [passage omitted]</p>

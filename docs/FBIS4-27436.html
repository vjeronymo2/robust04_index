			<p>BFN     [Text] It was disclosed on 30 May that an interparty  policy group of liberals will be formed in June at the  initiative of the Minshu no Kaze [Democratic Wind], a group of  four defectors from the Japan New Party [JNP]. Members of the  Minshu no Kaze intend to gather about 60 Dietmen from such  parties as the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], the  Sakigake [Harbinger], and the Group Seiun. Hokkaido Governor  Takahiro Yokomichi, who recently announced his decision not to  pursue his third reappointment as the governor, is also invited  to the group to encourage his return to the Diet. The group  probably intends to receive Yokomichi as a leader of liberals.    The policy group is expected to be called the "Council on  Concept of Democrat Government" (tentative name), and the first  preparatory meeting will be held on 1 June. Members of the  Minshu no Kaze and SDPJ Deputy Secretary General Masanori Goto  have informally asked Governor Yokomichi to join the group.  Some of them want to receive Yokomichi as the leader of the  group when he comes back to the Diet. Asked about this at the  Hokkaido Prefectural Government on the morning of 30 May,  Governor Yokomichi avoided making clear comments on his own  position in the group, saying: "They are not asking me to  become the leader (of the policy group). Since the group is  designed as a gathering of Diet members, I am not going to do  something special in the group."</p>

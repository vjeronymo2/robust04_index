			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Brazil's Cardoso wins the fight but not the spoils: Finance minister gets budget reform through congress but may miss run at presidency Brazil's economic restructuring programme is back on its rather shaky course after congressional approval on Tuesday night of an emergency fund to help balance the budget. This marked a significant victory for the programme's helmsman, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the finance minister, who threatened to resign if the fund was blocked. But Mr Cardoso's victory may mean he has to remain in government rather than resign to run for president later this year. 'As finance minister he won. But maybe from his personal perspective he lost. Implementing the rest of the plan will not be easy,' said Mr Jouji Kawasaki, vice president of Banco BMC. The emergency fund is meant to give the government control of about Dollars 15bn (Pounds 10bn) of tax increases and spending programmes which would otherwise be immediately due to the states or government agencies. With this control, and other tax increases, the government will be able to claim it has balanced a budget otherwise projected to show a deficit of Dollars 22.2bn. Balancing the budget was the first and most important step in Mr Cardoso's package. In the past, the government financed its mounting deficit by issuing short-term securities at very high interest rates, thereby further fuelling inflation. Mr Cardoso needed to claim a balanced budget to push ahead with the rest of his package, which includes launching a new currency untainted by past inflation. He also needed to show he was tackling the roots of inflation, now running at more than 40 per cent a month, for Brazil to gain an accord from the International Monetary Fund as part of the country's private bank debt renegotiation. 'This was a significant and sweeping victory,' Mr Pedro Simon, the government leader in the Senate, told reporters. Technically speaking, the emergency fund needs two more votes before it becomes law. Predictions are dangerous when dealing with Brazil's congress, but finance ministry officials hope the remaining votes will be largely symbolic. Further, the budget is still only balanced in theory. Negotiating the fund has already forced a number of government compromises, including a last-minute climb down on military pay. Some analysts question whether the already weak coalition government of President Itamar Franco can hold off other spending demands, especially in an election year. Nevertheless, Mr Cardoso plans to move quickly to the next stage of his programme and launch a new index, known as the URV, which will measure present rather than past inflation. In Brazil's highly indexed economy, the government hopes the private sector will use this index to calculate its price increases. Existing indices measure past inflation and therefore can themselves be inflationary. After the congressional vote Mr Cardoso said he may be ready to introduce the URV at the beginning of March. He is under mounting pressure to act from businesses who say uncertainty about the economy is leading suppliers to increase prices above inflation. 'The pressures are enormous. Our costs increased by above 40 per cent in January, and February is not any better,' said a director of one of the country's main carmakers. Even if the URV goes ahead quickly, Mr Cardoso is running out of time in relation to the presidential election. Under Brazilian law he would have to resign by April 2 to run for election in October. But his victory with the fund deprived him of an excuse to quit. Further, according to his opponents, he cannot resign before inflation starts to fall. Since he became finance minister last year inflation has increased from 23 per cent to more than 40 per cent a month, hardly a campaigning theme tune. A constitutional revision which is under way may review the law on ministers resigning to contest elections. It is possible, but by no means certain, that the April 2 deadline will be extended and allow a late challenge. But this would also rely on an understanding, which has so far looked remote, between the main left-of-centre parties. They would need to unite behind Mr Cardoso and confront the present election front runner, Mr Luz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers party. But according to one finance ministry official, Mr Cardoso already appears to have decided to wait: 'The minister is only 62 this year. He can stay and guide in a successor and would then be ready for the next presidential elections.'</p>

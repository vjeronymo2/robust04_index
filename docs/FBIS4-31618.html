			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Milorad Vukasinovic from Banja Luka -- recorded] </F>   [Text] The formation of the Socialist Party of Serbia in  the republic of Srpska does not mean the beginning of disunity  but reflects peoples' need for the activity of a political party  that favors the creation of a humane and democratic society on  these territories, it was stated at the gathering of the Young  Socialists in Banja Luka today.    Greeting all present in the name of the large delegation of  the Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS], Federal Human Rights  Minister Margit Savovic expressed the belief that the left wing  in the republic of Srpska holds the future. It was emphasized  that freedom, just peace, and the right to self-determination  for the Serbian people are the fundamental program goals of this  party which expects to become a significant political factor in  the republic of Srpska in the coming period.    [Dragan Ilic, president of the SPS in the republic of  Srpska]  The socialist ideal and the ideal of social justice has existed  among these people for eons. Therefore, a political  organization that embraces this idea, manifests it further  politically, and places it at the service of the nation, had to  appear.    [Sasa Cudic, president of the Alliance of the Young  Socialists in the republic of Srpska] Above all I would  emphasize that the strengthening of the SPS in the republic of  Srpska has resulted in the strengthening of its progeny -- the  Young Socialists. I would emphasize that young people on the  territory of our republic during the war and in bleak times that  have lasted for three years have had some difficult moments  trying to find perspective for their lives.    Summing up today's promotional gathering, I can single out  several basic values: Just peace, freedom, democracy, and the  unity of the Serbian people. [end recording]</p>

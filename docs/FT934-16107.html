			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Barclays taxation hearing opposed THE Clinton administration has urged the US Supreme Court not to hear an appeal from Barclays Bank of the UK against California's unitary taxation system. Mr Drew Days, solicitor general, argued in a brief filed yesterday there was no longer any need for the court to review the case since California had already changed its tax law to meet the objections raised by Barclays and other foreign companies. If the Supreme Court takes the administration's advice - which reverses the position of the Reagan and Bush administrations - it would leave standing a decision by the California supreme court in favour of the state and against Barclays. Although the UK bank's appeal specifically involves a Dollars 150,000 tax bill from 1977, the accumulation of interest on this and similar cases brought by other foreign companies means a total of Dollars 900m is at stake for California. Cases involving US-based multinationals cover a further Dollars 3.1bn in disputed tax assessments. Mr Brad Sherman, a member of the California Franchise Tax Board, the state body involved in the Barclays case, hailed the solicitor general's brief as 'a much-needed economic boost for California' and said it 'virtually assured a victory for California over the multinational corporations'. Barclays argues that California's system of unitary assessment is unconstitutional, because it conflicts with the norms of international taxation and so interferes with the federal government's sole right to regulate foreign commerce. Under the unitary taxation method California assesses taxes on a proportion of a company's worldwide income, rather than on income earned in the state. Barclays and the UK government will file briefs next week, and a Supreme Court decision on whether to hear the case is expected at the beginning of November.</p>

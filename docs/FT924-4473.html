			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Arts: Don't let Auntie take a retrograde step - Christopher Dunkley writes an open letter to Peter Brooke Dear Mr Brooke, When you presented your green paper on The Future Of The BBC to Parliament last week you called for a wide ranging debate and invited listeners and viewers to write to you. My first suggestion is rather personal. You must have heard of the pillow-banging method of auto-persuasion, you know, thumping your head on the pillow just before going to sleep and saying 'I will not overspend my credit card' or whatever. Since you are now the key person as regards the future of the BBC, I think you should establish a little bedtime routine which goes 'The status quo is an option', thump, 'The status quo is an option', thump, 'The status quo . . . ' Surely that should not be too difficult for someone who is supposed to believe in conservatism? To me it looks urgently necessary because it seems that all the most important parties, including yourself and the BBC, have already accepted, before the debate has even started, that, whatever else may happen, the BBC must be transformed. In your foreword you say 'The BBC cannot remain unchanged', section 1.1 says 'we should be ready to contemplate radical changes', and the BBC describes its own discussion document, Extending Choice, also published last week, as being 'about adaptation and change'. Clearly it would be absurd to suggest that this one organisation should be set in amber and preserved forever as it is today. However, the danger seems quite the reverse. Having persuaded yourselves that change is inevitable as a reaction to predicted developments in the broader world of broadcasting, the BBC looks set to pre-empt its competitors and make retrograde changes which will then, but only then, create precisely the hostile conditions anticipated. For example, the people at the top of the BBC seem to have resigned themselves already in extraordinarily fatalistic fashion to losing about one third of their audience in the next few years. They talk about the advances being made by satellite and cable predicting that most households will have access to 20 television channels and 15 radio stations within seven years. I doubt the inevitability of that, given that all the billions spent so far on satellite and cable have produced an audience share of less than six per cent. But one way to help bring it about is for the BBC to start planning now for a reduction in its audience from a 45 per cent to a 30 per cent share which is precisely what it is doing. Not only does that depress the staff, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Throughout Extending Choice the tone suggests a willingness to move wherever commercial media barons or market forces may push, rather than setting out determinedly to lead from the front. Anything that cannot be judged 'distinctively' BBC will be abandoned to the commercial sector. The current police drama series Between the Lines on BBC1 is excellent but is there anything 'distinctively BBC' about it? How do the programmes in BBC2's social affairs series Public Eye differ 'distinctively' from ITV programmes on the same subjects? It looks as though your predecessors in the Thatcher years were so successful in their attacks on the traditionally diverse centres of influence in this country (the universities, trade unions, local councils and so on) that there is nobody left, not even the supposedly arrogant BBC hierarchy, with the confidence to dissent. Everywhere 'the market' is accepted as rightfully triumphant. Why is everyone so insistent that such great changes must be made to the BBC? If it was a crumbling organisation, making programmes that nobody wanted to hear or see, out-shone by its commercial competitors, pumping out old fashioned material, disliked or ignored by the public, it might be understandable. But the fact is that British broadcasting is one of those rare things in Britain at the end of the 20th century, a national success story, and to a large extent the BBC is responsible for that. In all areas the BBC has repeatedly proved its expertise and its appeal, from Attenborough's Life on Earth to Only Fools and Horses, from Bookmark to Have I Got News for You. Does it really make sense to set out so resolutely to fix it when it ain't broke? The British consume more broadcasting than their continental neighbours, and virtually all of them turn to the BBC at some time every week. Most of them believe, as they always have, contrary to the assertions of certain political ideologues, that the licence fee delivers good value for money. Of course it may be that you do not really want to change Auntie very much, that your green paper is mostly a formality and that, after a suitable show of public tussling, matters will proceed pretty much as before. Certainly there are people who have read your paper and are complaining heatedly about your lack of 'zeal'. They are making bitter comparisons with the radical treatment so recently handed out to ITV. It is clear that you are better disposed than some towards the BBC. Yet to assume that the ideas in your paper were mere debating points - slimming the BBC, restricting its output to material which will not make a profit for commercial broadcasters, cutting its television channels to one and its radio networks to three - would, I suspect, be a terrible mistake. The most powerful argument on the side of the BBC is that it has proved itself over decades, and shown that a large multi-purpose broadcasting organisation with a big 'critical mass' of talent, can and will produce programmes throughout the spectrum, from highbrow to mass appeal, from Civilisation to Steptoe and Son, from Clarissa to Waiting for God, in a way that commercial broadcasters will not unless you force them by law. Since your party has recently arranged to introduce far greater commercial pressure to ITV and simultaneously reduced the regulatory impositions on ITV to a 'light touch', we are going to need the BBC more than ever before, not less. Under the rules your party has introduced, commercial broadcasters are not going to be able to afford to cross-subsidise programmes of a highbrow or minority nature. Who gives us an excellent late-night run-down on the day's events? The BBC in Newsnight and not the commercial services. Who gives us a culture magazine four days a week? The BBC in The Late Show and not the commercial services. Which channel manages regularly to get special interest series on topics such as science, cookery and driving into its Top 10 with audiences of four or five million? Not Channel 4, but BBC2. And what has that got to do with making EastEnders? Everything. If you fall back on the old shibboleth 'Do what you do best, old boy' and insist that the BBC merely fill in the gaps where commercial broadcasters cannot turn a quick penny - educational programmes, Shakespeare, serious current affairs and minority interests - you will transform the BBC into a British version of America's Public Broadcasting Service. And you know better than I do that as soon as that happens your colleagues in Parliament will refuse to sustain the licence fee: QED BBC RIP. The BBC must remain in popular broadcasting if we are to continue to benefit from its specialist broadcasting. If it can sustain its popularity while ridding itself of Australian soap operas, embarrassment series and the more gormless game shows (which is what John Birt, the director-general in waiting, seemed to be suggesting last week) well and good. In the end the BBC stands or falls according to its abilities as a public service broadcasting organisation, a concept which some members of your party seem to find utterly baffling. All it means, surely, is an organisation with the sole purpose of providing a broadcasting service for the public. Commercial broadcasting has as its first object the payment of profits to shareholders, as its second object the delivery of audiences to advertisers and, as a means to those two ends, thirdly the creation of programmes. Remember: 'The status quo is an option', thump . . . Yours sincerely</p>

			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES TO POST 4TH-QUARTER LOSS  </P> <P> Traditional Industries Inc., an Agoura Hills firm that markets camera and film  processing packages, said it expects to report a loss for the fiscal fourth  quarter. Meanwhile, the company said its financial report for the fiscal year  that ended June 30 has been delayed, and it expects to report its results  within 45 days. The delay was partly caused by the settlement Traditional  recently reached with the Federal Trade Commission, which alleged that the  company made false claims in advertising its photographic packages.  </P> <P> The FTC said in August that Traditional could lose up to $50 million in sales  as the cost of complying with the agreement. Traditional said the impact would  actually be far less than that, although the company also said it was seeking  new financing alternatives.  </P> <P> In a separate matter, a group led by the New York investment concern Allen  Holding Inc., cut its stake in Traditional to 54,378 common shares of stock, or  1.5% of the company's total, according to a filing with the Securities and  Exchange Commission. The group, which includes Allen's executive vice president  Harold M. Wit, previously held the equivalent of a 7.6% stake in Traditional.  </P></p>

From  September 1984 to October 1988, chief of staff and first deputy  commander-in-chief of troops of the Western Sector. Presently  retired.    "Dear Editor,    "Could you provide any information on the history of  the establishment of the sector main commands, their missions  and their fate? In the 1980's, the whole country knew about such  sector main commands, but unfortunately the crazy secrecy in  which our society was living deprived us of the most elementary  official information.    "[signed] A. Palitsyn (Saratov)"    Major transformations consisting of a complex of measures  were undertaken in the Soviet Armed Forces in the second half of  the 1970's and in the early 1980's. The plan was to transform  the main command of the ground forces into the directorate of  the commander-in-chief's reserves, and to subordinate civil  defense and the military commissariats to him; to establish  sector main commands; to form separate army corps of brigade  composition (as a resource for actions in the enemy's  operational depth); to create air forces in the military  districts while simultaneously eliminating air armies; to  organize air defense on the territorial principle, where each  military district would be responsible for air defense within  its administrative boundaries. An attempt was made to draw a  clearer dividing line between the functions of the General  Staff, the main commands of the armed services, and sector  troops and military districts.    This process was a long time in coming. The increasing scale  and rate of military preparations by the opposing blocs--NATO  and the Warsaw Pact, their creation of the latest resources of  armed conflict, and chiefly for a first nuclear strike, as well  as the desire of Western countries to break the  military-strategic parity that had evolved by this time,  motivated the Soviet leadership to take effective steps both to  improve organizational structures and to fundamentally change  the forms and methods of command and control. In the postwar  years the activity of commanders and staffs in troop command and  control continued to grow more complex. Command and control  became the most important component of the combat readiness of  troops and naval forces, and one of its decisive factors. This  necessitated a constant search for effective ways to improve the  entire system of command and control, especially of large troop  (force) groupings in theaters of military operations (TMOs).    With regard for this, in September 1984 a new link of  operational-strategic command and control of troops and naval  forces--sector main commands--was brought into the command and  control system.    The Soviet leadership undertook this action in retaliation  to  similar actions by the leadership of the NATO bloc. Back in the  early 1950's the member nations of this bloc created coalitional  elements of operational-strategic leadership of troops in  Europe. In this case the Supreme Main Command in Europe assumed  a central place in the overall system of the Joint Armed Forces  of the NATO bloc. Its zone of responsibility included the  territories of all of the bloc's European member nations (except  Great Britain and Portugal) and Turkey, as well as the  Mediterranean Sea. Three main commands of the Joint Armed Forces  were established simultaneously: In the Northern European (a  staff of up to 700 persons), Central European (up to 2,000  persons) and Southern European (over 1,500 persons)  TMOs.[.sup]2[/]    The block's leadership made a particular effort to train and  set up command and control posts and to organize communications.  The main commands were in a high state of readiness, and they  could assume control over forces allocated to them in short  time. Modern communication resources and automated command and  control systems were present at control posts for this purpose.    Thus, the leadership of the NATO bloc managed to acquire  certain advantages in troop command and control by this time,  and it possessed a workable system of command and control for  both peacetime and wartime. The Soviet Armed Forces were  significantly behind NATO in this area (by more than 30 years in  time, and hopelessly behind in organization and equipment).    The idea of transforming the system for controlling Soviet  forces was based on the experience of the Great Patriotic  War[.sup]3[/] and operational-strategic exercises. The  process of creating the main sector commands in a sense went  through two phases.    The first phase embraced the period from November  1978 to September 1984. During this period the main commands  were foreseen as coalitional elements of operational-strategic  leadership of troops and naval forces of the Joint Armed Forces  of Warsaw Pact states in the Western and Southwestern TMOs, and  only in wartime.[.sup]4[/]    The main commands owed their creation both to the essence  itself and the complexity of the problem of providing for the  collective security of Warsaw Pact states, and to the volume and  rate of military preparations of the NATO bloc, as well as the  nature of possible warfare. It was felt that without unified,  centralized leadership of troops and naval forces of the Joint  Armed Forces at the scale of TMOs, it would be impossible to  hope for success in war, were it to be initiated by the  aggressor.    One of the forms of conducting military operations in a  possible war--the TMO strategic operation, in which large troop  (force) groupings of all armed services could participate--was  theoretically recognized, and perfected in operational  exercises. The organization and conduct of such an operation was  an exceptionally complex and difficult task, requiring strict  centralization of command and control of troops and naval  forces. It was assumed that success in such an operation would  be possible only on the condition that command and control of  the troops (forces) was highly competent, efficient and unified,  for which reason the elements of leadership had to be  established ahead of time, while still at peace.    Considering this, the Staff of the Joint Armed Forces of  Warsaw Pact states was adopted as the basis for establishment of  main sector commands in the Western and Southwestern TMOs. It  was transformed from a wartime military-political element into  two operational-strategic elements of leadership of troops and  naval forces in theaters of military operations. Establishment  of a unified Supreme Main Command was foreseen for centralized  leadership of these forces,[.sup]5[/] and the General Staff  of the USSR Armed Forces became the command and control element.    The administration of the commander-in-chief of sector  troops  in a TMO consisted of deputy commanders representing each allied  army, a staff, a political directorate and the following  directorates: Missile forces and artillery, air forces, air  defense troops, engineering and chemical troops, and armament  and rear services.    The main element of command and control was the staff of the  main command, headed by a chief of staff, who was also the first  deputy commander-in-chief. Deputies representing each of the  allied armies were foreseen under the chief of staff, as well as  under the chief of the political directorate. The troop staff  and all directorates were manned by generals, admirals and  officers from all of the allied armies on a proportional basis,  including generals and officers who served in the Staff of the  Joint Armed Forces of Warsaw Pact states in peacetime.    Command and control of troops and air defense forces in the  TMO was to be provided by a joint air force and air defense  command post under the leadership of the air defense commander,  who was also the deputy troop commander for the TMO.    The system for command and control of joint naval forces was  organized on an entirely different basis. The commander of such  naval forces became the deputy troop commander-in-chief for the  TMO, and he essentially had to manage all of the naval forces.  After all of the necessary documents were drawn up (regulations,  basic missions and functional responsibilities, organizational  structure), and the corresponding decisions were made, the main  command of the Joint Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact states and  the national commands and staffs embarked upon the practical  work of forming the Western and Southwestern sector main  commands. Much work was done in this aspect by the main command  of the Joint Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact states, and  primarily by Commander-in-Chief Marshal of the Soviet Union B.  G. Kulikov and Joint Armed Forces Chief of Staff Army General A.  I. Gribkov, by defense ministers, and by general and main staffs  of the allied armies. It should be noted that  operational-strategic exercises such as Soyuz, Granit and Shchit  played a special role in this. They were conducted according to  plans of the joint and national commands of the allied armies.    Exercise Soyuz-83 under the leadership of Marshal of the  Soviet Union V. G. Kulikov was the most typical exercise of this  scale. In it, the administration of the main command for the  Western TMO was fully manned by generals and officers from four  allied armies (the East German Army, the Polish Forces, the  Czechoslovak Army and the Soviet Army) as well as from the Staff  of the Joint Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact states, and the  staffs of the fronts, armies, troops and naval forces were  included.    These actions were approved by the leadership of all Warsaw  Pact states, and they were made necessary, as was noted earlier,  by the complexity of the military-political situation in Europe  at this moment in time, and by the importance of the European  theater of military operations in the plans of the North  Atlantic bloc. It was difficult not to agree with such a step  then.    However, for the sake of justice it should be emphasized  that  not all of this was taken to its logical conclusion. First of  all, problems associated with the composition of the unified  Supreme Main Command of the Joint Armed Forces of the Warsaw  Pact states were not resolved, which had a negative effect on  the solution of other problems. Nor can we ignore the special  position taken by the Romanian leadership, which proposed an  entirely different system of command and control of troops and  naval forces in the theaters of military operations.    Back when the documents on the main commands were being  drafted (chiefly the draft of the Regulations), the Romanian  Ministry of National Defense, while not entirely rejecting the  need for creating sector main commands for the Joint Armed  Forces (in the TMOs), stated a special opinion, the essence of  which reduced to the following:     -  The Political Consultative Committee should be the supreme  main command of the Joint Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact  states, because only it is an authoritative body capable of  carrying out major military-political tasks;    -  the main command of  the Joint Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact states and not one of  the general staffs of the allied armies should become the  working element of the Supreme Main Command in wartime;    -  generals  from each allied army serving in the rank of TMO first deputy  commanders-in-chief had to be present under the  commander-in-chief of sector troops (in the TMO). Being a  collective and coalitional element of leadership, the military  council had to make the decisions on all of the basic questions  of organizing and carrying out operations and controlling the  troops;    -  the commander-in-chief of sector troops (in the TMO)  needed to control the troops through his first deputies from the  allied armies, and through the military council, and not through  the staff of the sectors troops. Only the first deputy  commanders-in-chief had the right to issue directives, orders  and instructions, and thus provide for troop command and  control;    -  generals, admirals and officers from all allied armies  needed to be appointed to positions of leadership in all of the  directorates and departments, proportionately and on a rotating  basis;    -  there was no need for creating a political directorate.  Each country's party could carry out political work in the  troops through its own political apparatus, in close cooperation  with their armies.       Obviously, little more needs to be said about these  conclusions, except that they clearly manifested the desire of  the Romanians to dilute the main sector (TMO) command of the  Joint Armed Forces, make it amorphous and incompetent, and in  short, to remove national troops from its control. This was  unacceptable. This is why the fundamental documents on the  sector (TMO) main commands of the Joint Armed Forces were  adopted by the Committee of Ministers of Defense and the  Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Pact states  without regard for the conclusions of the Romanian side.  However, as a rule, during exercises and other operational  measures these and other wishes of the Romanians were accounted  for to the extent possible.    Such are the main landmarks in the first phase of  establishment of the TMO main commands of the Joint Armed  Forces. In my opinion this system of troop leadership satisfied  the requirements of development of the Joint Armed Forces of the  Warsaw Pact states in that situation.    The second phase embraces the period since 1984,  when the Soviet leadership unilaterally, and contrary to  decisions of the heads of Warsaw Pact states, raised to a  practical plane the issue of creating sector main commands in  peacetime, and only for Soviet troops. This decision was  dictated -- besides by the arguments presented above -- by the  Soviet Union's geopolitical position, the great dimensions of  its territory, and the fact that the situation necessitated  immediate improvement of troop leadership in the most important  strategic sectors. It was felt in this case that creation of  sector main commands would be a new important step forward on  the road of development of the entire system of command and  control of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, and would bring  the leadership directly in touch with the troops, which would  facilitate the command activities of the highest military bodies  -- the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff of the USSR  Armed Forces.    Thus, in September 1984 the main command of troops of the  Western Sector was created and the composition of troops and  naval forces subordinated to it was determined.[.sup]6[/] On  24 September Marshal of the Soviet Union N. V. Ogarkov assumed  the position of the commander-in-chief of sector troops. A  military council consisting of Chairman N. V. Ogarkov and the  following council members was formed simultaneously: B. P.  Utkin, the political directorate chief, the chief of staff --  the author of this article, and the first deputy  commander-in-chief -- Army General M. I. Sorokin. The following  deputy commanders-in-chief were designated as members of the  military council later on: for air forces--Colonel General of  Aviation S. V. Golubev, for armament--Lieutenant General A. A.  Ivanov (as of 1985, deputy commander for combat training), and  deputy commander for rear services--Lieutenant General G. P.  Pastukhovskiy.    The following were subordinated directly to the troop  commander-in-chief of the Western Sector: Two military districts  (Belorussian and Carpathian), three groups of forces (the Group  of Soviet Forces in Germany and the Central and Northern groups  of forces); the following were operationally subordinated: The  Baltic Fleet, one air army of the Supreme High Command and one  air defense army (the 2d Separate Air Defense Army). The  composition of the troop groupings and naval forces was  approximately adequate to the NATO troop (force) groupings  stationed in this sector.    By the nature of his position (but more in formal terms) the  commander-in-chief of sector troops was endowed with full power  of leadership over subordinated troops. He was given the  responsibility of solving practically all problems associated  with the life and activity of the troops: Ensuring the constant  combat readiness of troops, naval forces and staffs; operational  planning; organization of operational, combat and political  training of troops and staffs; conduct of operational exercises,  including with the participation of troops, fleets and staffs of  the allied armies; implementation of measures to tighten  military discipline, to provide material and technical support  to the troops, and to establish operational materiel reserves;  solution of problems concerning operational preparation of the  TMO; creation of a system of communication, command and control.    The commander-in-chief of sector troops resolved the issues  of operational planning and joint exercises that concerned the  allied troops through the General Staff of the USSR Armed  Forces, and coordinated directly with the military leadership of  the allied countries (in the West--with the general staffs of  the Polish Forces, the Czechoslovak Army and the main staff of  the East German Army).    Such a broad declaration of the rights of the  commander-in-chief of sector troops did not enjoy any practical  support. The difficulty was that the center (represented by the  main commands of the armed services) did not want to concede its  unshared leadership of troops and forces subordinated to it  (this was manifested especially strongly by the main commands of  the air forces and air defense forces). The intermediate  link--the military districts (groups of forces)--felt that the  sector main command would usurp their authority in many issues,  and therefore they did not wish to have this intermediate  element of command and control above them. As far as the  leadership of the armies and divisions is concerned, it  expressed gratitude for the work of officers of the main command.    Note that for practical purposes nothing changed at that  time  in the work of the main commands of the armed services and the  staffs of the military districts and groups of forces; the  entire system that had been honed over the years remained in  place. The leadership of the military districts (groups of  forces) not only retained the right of direct communication with  the minister of defense, the General Staff and the main commands  of the armed services, but it was even encouraged. Still, the  range of issues that had to be resolved through the sector main  commands was clearly defined. This was also reinforced by the  fact that all problems of material support and personnel issues  were resolved centrally, chiefly in the administrations of the  main commands of the armed services.    All of this led to parallelism in work, and to reduction of  the role of sector main commands and the main commands of the  armed services. This practice automatically created conditions  for various conflicts.    Strange as it may seem, with the appearance of the sector  main commands the main command of the Joint Armed Forces of the  Warsaw Pact states, which was one of the initiators in creation  of sector main commands, began doing everything it could to  block their contact with the leadership of allied armies. This  position had a negative effect on the work in general. And the  General Staff of the USSR Armed Forces had not developed clear  directives regarding this matter by this time, occupying a kind  of dualistic position in relation to the new elements of command  and control. Nor did creation of these sector main commands have  the needed impact as a retaliatory measure to the military  preparations of the NATO bloc, as the leadership of the USSR  Ministry of Defense simply hushed up their existence.    None of this provided for normal work.    At that time the administration of the sector main command  included: A staff consisting of operational, naval, intelligence  and organizational-mobilizational directorates, a communications  directorate, and the following departments -- ECM, topographic,  political, troop services, special services, supply, financial  and others; directorates: missile forces and artillery, air  forces, air defense forces, combat training, political,  engineering and chemical troops, armament and rear services; a  construction inspectorate, a messing inspectorate; a financial  service; communications, security and support units.    In this variant the staff of the main command of sector  troops was the main element of command and control. It carried  the responsibility for the entire volume of tasks determined for  a main command, and in addition: Evaluating the  military-political situation, organizing reconnaissance,  developing proposals on the mobilizational readiness of troops  and on improving their organizational and staffing structure,  organizing troop services, creating and improving the  communications and command and control systems in the TMO,  supporting the conduct of operational training and exercises,  performing monitoring functions, and studying, generalizing and  bringing progressive experience and new training methods and  techniques to the awareness of the troops.    The chief of staff provided leadership to the work of the  staff of the main command of sector troops. (He was also the  first deputy commander-in-chief and a member of the military  council). He had the right to issue orders on behalf of the  commander-in-chief to subordinated troops, and he coordinated  the activity of all elements of command and control. The chief  of staff personally participated in solving the most important  problems pertaining to troop combat readiness, operational  planning, exercises and training. Establishing and maintaining  close business contacts with the leadership of the general  staffs of allied armies was a special concern of the chief of  staff. And there were many difficulties in this area.    A political directorate headed by Lieutenant General V. P.  Utkin, deputy chief of the Main Political Directorate of the  Soviet Army and Navy, was formed to organize and coordinate  political work in the troops and Navy. The political directorate  was granted the rights of an element of leadership, which was  not received well by the political directorates of the armed  services and military districts (groups of forces).    This structure of the administration of the main command  (numbering 500 persons) was believed to be fully acceptable for  carrying out its tasks. But it must be recognized that the  administration of the main command of the Western Sector was  created in haste, for all intents and purposes between September  and October 1984, while its overall establishment proceeded in  two phases: September-December 1984, during which time it was 40  percent manned, and from 1 March 1985, when it was manned to its  full complement.    The staff directorates were headed by experienced generals  such as Lieutenant General V. G. Maganov (operational), Vice  Admiral P. F. Sharov (naval), Lieutenant General V. A. Kartashov  (intelligence), Lieutenant General P. F. Ponomarev  (organizational-mobilizational), Lieutenant General G. F. Mishin  (communications directorate). Lieutenant General D. G.  Shkrudnev, a participant of combat operations in Afghanistan,  became the first deputy chief of staff.    The missile forces and artillery directorate was headed by  Lieutenant General N. A. Mikhaylov, the air defense forces  directorate was headed by Lieutenant General V. V. Litvinov, and  the air force staff was headed by Lieutenant General of Aviation  M. M. Kuznetsov.    On the whole, the directorates and departments of the main  commands were staffed by experienced, well-trained generals,  admirals and officers. These were specialists in their areas,  who possessed considerable practical work experience in their  corresponding positions.    Nonetheless, mistakes were made in personnel. Many officers  came up from positions at division and army scale, did not have  work experience in higher staffs, and knew little about the  peculiarities of the Western TMO. These and other mistakes  necessarily impacted upon the style and results of the work,  especially during initial establishment of the main command's  administration. The desire of the leadership to immediately  begin practical work in the forces, without any kind of  preparatory period, also had a negative effect. After all, every  officer needed time to assimilate his functional  responsibilities and the peculiarities of the life of the  troops, and to study the peculiarities of the theater of  military operations.    Direct work in the troops, in the Navy and in the staffs was  the principal method of leadership of the main command and of  the administration as a whole. The work was organized on a  principled but benevolent basis, and it was oriented on  fulfilling the requirements of directives (orders) of the  minister of defense and the General Staff of the armed forces.  The principle of teaching the troops what they needed in war was  introduced into troop and staff training practice for real.    I feel it my duty to give credit in this regard to the  ability and tactfulness of the troop commander-in-chief of the  Western Sector, Marshal of the Soviet Union N. V. Ogarkov. Being  one of the initiators of creating the sector main commands, he  invested a great deal of work into forming and initially  developing the administration of the main command of troops of  the Western Sector. Possessing a broad outlook, a knack for  creative operational thinking, considerable experience in the  troops and work experience in higher positions, he was able to  teach commanders and staffs patiently and objectively. And not  only teach them but also to demand the same kind of relationship  to subordinates on the part of generals and officers of the  administration of the main command, requiring them to provide  specific assistance to subordinates locally.    This practice and style of work made it possible to reach  one  of the objectives--bringing the leadership directly in touch  with the troops. In this aspect the sector's main command became  for practical purposes the executive element of the central  leadership in the forces. The leadership of the Ministry of  Defense only needed to rely a little more actively on it, which  is something it did not do in practice. Advances were also made  in reaching the objective of improving the system of command,  control and communications in the TMO, which was practically  nonexistent at that time. It had to be created anew.    Under these conditions it was extremely important to  maintain  firm control, guaranteed to be reliable, over the men and  equipment of air defense and air forces in the TMO.    In this connection it was believed that air defense should  be  organized within the TMO (within the sector) on the territorial  principle, assigning responsibility for its organization within  the boundaries of the TMO to the commander-in-chief of sector  troops (by this act, a new level of authority was introduced to  assume responsibility over air defense); and within the  boundaries of the military district, to the corresponding  district troop commander. This was recognized to be a more  flexible, dependable and easily controllable system, capable of  successfully carrying out its missions.    However, it was impossible to carry out all of the plans in  their full volume, because soon after, the entire air defense  system was once again rigidly centralized under the sole  leadership of the commander-in-chief of air defense forces.    And so, radical reforms of a major scale were not carried  out  in the Army and Navy in those years--the conservatism of the  center prevailed. Almost all organizational measures carried out  in the armed forces, mentioned at the beginning of this article,  were rescinded, and everything was pushed back to square one.  This was a huge mistake. Before dismantling the organisms that  had evolved and been perfected by the second half of the 1970's,  a fully adequate replacement for them should have first been  prepared. Paradoxical though this may be, this is precisely what  was absent. The dismantling of many structures that took decades  to evolve, often hastily, with major mistakes and without  adequate foresight, did harm to the Army and Navy. Their  development was set back many years.    The almost simultaneous replacement of the leadership of the  sector main commands and numerous reductions of their numerical  strength, as well as recision of direct subordination of  military districts (groups of forces) to them transformed the  administrations of the main commands into formal elements of  leadership in subsequent years. And with the disintegration of  the strategic grouping of Soviet and allied forces in Eastern  Europe, the administration of the main command of forces of the  Western Sector was abolished.    I feel that it would be pertinent to cite here one of the  statements made in this regard by Marshal of the Soviet Union S.  F. Akhromeyev. In 1991, assessing the suitability of creating  sector main commands, he said: "Main commands of sector troops  were not created before the start of the Great Patriotic War,  but all attempts to create them during the war ended in failure.  It is too difficult, and practically impossible, to create such  a large element of operational-strategic command and control and  the corresponding contingent of administrative forces for it  when already at war. Our opponents demanded immediate  dismantling of both the structure and the system of command and  control of the armed forces, including the main commands of  sector troops (emphasis mine.--M. T.). ...The system for  the country's postwar security, upon which so much energy and  resources had been expended by our people,  collapsed."[.sup]7[/] Such is the bitter conclusion.    In may be said in conclusion that being a new form of  leadership of troops and naval forces in peacetime, the sector  main commands were felt to be fully capable of carrying out  their missions, and they doubtlessly played a certain positive  role.    What was negative in this was, obviously, the fact that the  sector main commands were created in the absence of a deep  assessment of the military-political situation, in haste, and of  course, without adequate foresight. Their operation over the  course of approximately eight years turned out to be an  expensive measure, even for those times.    The imposition of a wide range of tasks upon the sector main  command, with emphasis on the functions of controlling the  military district, and the unjustified demands for fulfilling  these tasks dispersed the efforts of the leadership and  distracted it from more-objective execution of the main tasks.  The low manning of the organizational structure, which was more  than anything a copy of the administrative staff of the military  district, and not even of the Group of Forces in Germany of that  period, was no help either.    Presence of such intermediate elements of troop leadership  in  peacetime (in the 1970's-1980's) may have been more effective  had the rights and responsibilities in relation to subordinated  troops been truly complete and harmoniously interrelated. In  order to carry out all of the assigned tasks of leadership of  troops and naval forces, the administration of the main command  had to be larger in structure and operational composition,  especially in the Western Sector (an example would be the main  command of NATO Joint Armed Forces).    The growing rate and scale of the present military reform  and  development of a new Russian Army as the heir to the best  traditions of the Russian Army and Navy require new qualities on  the part of command and control elements, ones which would  encourage them to continually improve the style, forms and  methods of command activities.

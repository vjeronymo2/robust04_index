			<p>BFN     [Text] At the invitation of the President of the Republic  of Bulgaria Zhelyu Zhelev, the President of the Republic of  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  Kiro Gligorov arrived on a two day official visit to Sofia  yesterday, heading the Macedonian delegation.    The official welcoming ceremony with all state honors was  held at the "Hall 1" of the residence "Boyana." After the  intonation of the hymns of both countries, President Gligorov  addressed the honorary guard. Immediately following this, the  talks between the two presidents, in four eyes [as published],  began. That same afternoon, the talks between the two  delegations also began. After the talks, the two presidents  gave short statements for the press:    "I feel that what was written in the press, that a historic  meeting should not be expected, was not confirmed. I believe  that this meeting is of historic character," Bulgarian President  Zhelev said. "Not only because this is the first official visit  of President Gligorov, but also because this visit opens a new  era in the development of relations between the two countries."  The Bulgarian President assessed the talks as fruitful, as  "there literally is not one field in which the two countries  cannot cooperate." Reminding that there is excellent  cooperation in the sphere of economy, Zhelev said: "If we sign  an agreement on mutual cultural cooperation, it will be even  better."    On the same note as President Zhelev, President Gligorov  said: "We also discussed many other questions of bilateral  character, for example, the linking of the energetic systems,  the gas line, etc." Gligorov informed that military issues, that  is, military cooperation was also included in the talks, adding  that the two defense ministries might soon sign an agreement.  They also discussed the connection in the processes of European  integration and initiative, the NATO "Partnership for Peace"  project, for which Macedonia is showing particular interest, and  the two sides exchanged views on issues of international  character, particularly the Balkans and the Bosnian crisis.  President Gligorov insisted on the definition of the principles  of good neighborly relations, as, according to his estimation  "Macedonia's independence is connected with the identity of the  people."    The two statesmen also talked about the problem that  developed with the failure to reach the agreement on scientific  cooperation between the two countries. According to reports,  the Bulgarian side says that it was emphasized during the talks  that conditions for a bilateral agreement had been created. It  was even proposed for this agreement to be expanded and to  encircle certain open questions, which would finally be solved.  The Macedonian side accepted this idea. However, no details  were mentioned in the talks.    According to protocol, today morning President Gligorov is  expected to meet with Prime Minister Lyuben Berov. However, as  it has been found out, due to the health condition of the prime  minister, Gligorov will most probably be received by his deputy  Evgeni Matinchev.</p>

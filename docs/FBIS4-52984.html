			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 14 (KNS-KCNA) -- A Kinki District meeting  of Koreans in Japan was held in Osaka on May 13 to denounce the  suppression of the Osaka organisation of the General Association  of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and national  persecution by the Japanese authorities.    Addressing the meeting, vice chairman of Chongnyon O  Hyong-chin said that the recent outrage is part of the anti-DPRK  campaign of the U.S., Japanese and South Korean reactionaries  over the fictitious "nuclear suspicion" against the North and an  attempt to destroy the patriotic activities of Chongnyon.    "It cannot be overlooked that the Japanese reactionaries,  far  from repenting of their past Asian aggression, are trying to  turn Japan back to the road of militarism and purposefully  inciting among the Japanese people national chauvinism and ill  feelings against the Koreans in Japan," he said.    He strongly demanded that the Japanese police immediately  stop unreasonable political suppression of Chongnyon and  apologize for it.    At the meeting Japanese guests made speeches of solidarity  and participants delivered indignation speeches.    A letter of protest was adopted and a protest group was  formed to hand it to the Osaka prefectural police headquarters  and the Higashi police station.    After the meeting the participants staged a powerful street  demonstration.</p>

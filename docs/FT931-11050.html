			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: No referral for Dobson Park deal Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, has decided not to refer the proposed merger of the mining equipment division of Dobson Park Industries with Meco International to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Between them, Dobson Park and Meco supply all of British Coal's hydraulic roof supports and 80 per cent of its conveyors, used to carry the coal away from the face. Both companies have shed about 1,000 jobs over the past three years, and Mr Heseltine's pit closure programme has added to the speculation about further job losses.</p>

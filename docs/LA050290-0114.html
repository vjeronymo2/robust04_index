			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> CUTBACKS AFFECT NEEDY CHILDREN  </P> <P> Thousands of needy Orange County infants may be deprived of nutritional  assistance as a result of cutbacks in a county-administered food program,  officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Program directors on Monday began turning away hundreds of babies of low-income  families -- including those babies judged at medical risk -- who might  otherwise have been eligible for the Women, Infants and Children Supplemental  Food Program. Known as WIC, the 16-year-old, federally funded program provides  food and educational assistance.  </P> <P> Infants already enrolled in the program will be able to get assistance until  their first birthday, said Michelle van Eyken, program coordinator.  </P> <P> Van Eyken said the cutbacks were made because funding has not kept pace with  the steep increase in the number of women and children using the program.  </P> <P> The WIC program, administered by the County Health Care Agency, is contracted  to serve 15,500 participants a month. However, caseloads have averaged  significantly more than that, Van Eyken said. Last month more than 15,800  participants were enrolled, she said.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of low-income people in Orange County and the numbers are  going up, not down," she said.  </P> <P> As a result, the state Department of Health Services, which disperses federal  funds for the program, told Orange County officials they would have to reduce  services.  </P> <P> Monday's cutback was only the latest in a series of restrictions in the program  in Orange County.  </P> <P> Under WIC guidelines, eligibility extends to all low-income women who are  pregnant, breast feeding or who have delivered within the last three months.  Children under 5 who are undernourished are also eligible. However, in Orange  County, postpartum women who are not breast feeding became ineligible last  year.  </P> <P> In April, the county stopped serving all children. Only medically at-risk  pregnant women will now be allowed to enroll.  </P> <P> Social welfare officials said the cutbacks could have a dramatic impact on the  health of poor families which already have limited health and food options.  </P> <P> The prospect of a statewide funding shortfall in the WIC program prompted a  meeting among state officials Tuesday to consider possible alternative sources  of funding to prevent further cutbacks.  </P> <P> Officials with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which provides the funding,  said a higher-than-expected inflation rate for food prices in California,  combined with increased participation in the program statewide, contributed to  a shortfall of $14.5 million for the current fiscal year.  </P> <P> "We are looking at our options right now, trying to determine if we can  readjust some other funding mechanism," said state Sen. Marian Bergeson  (R-Newport Beach), who in February -- before the current funding crisis --  introduced a bill that would supplement the WIC program with $4 million in  state money.  </P> <P> The bill, SB 2038, passed the Senate's Health and Human Services Committee last  week.  </P> <P> WIC is one of the few social welfare programs proven to be cost effective,  Bergeson noted, citing a Harvard University study that found that every dollar  spent in the program means a savings of $3 in future health care costs.  </P> <P> "That is why the cuts in Orange County are drastic and will have a severe  effect, especially on children," Bergeson said.

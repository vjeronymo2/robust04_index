			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILKEN'S GUILTY PLEA;  </P> <P> FOR LOWELL MILKEN, MICHAEL'S BROTHER, THE CASE IS CLOSED  </P> <P> Michael Milken, 43, may go to prison. Lowell Milken, 41, will go home.  </P> <P> The government will drop two charges of racketeering and 11 counts of fraud  against the unassuming family man who was indicted along with his famous older  brother.  </P> <P> The fate of Lowell apparently played a central role in the final negotiations  between Michael Milken and federal prosecutors. Michael, reportedly incensed  that the government was using his brother as a bargaining chip, demanded that  any plea agreement provide that all charges be dropped against Lowell.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, the government reportedly insisted that Lowell plead guilty  to at least one misdemeanor. His brother stood firm: Lowell's record had to be  clean.  </P> <P> Friends and associates of the Milkens believe that Lowell was indicted in the  first place only to put pressure on his brother.  </P> <P> "Mike is a very loyal person and very family oriented," said one source. "He  convinced his brother to leave a promising legal career and join him at Drexel  (Burnham Lambert). He obviously feels somewhat responsible for what happened."  </P> <P> Another investment banker who worked with the brothers said he was  "flabbergasted" that Michael Milken would agree to such stiff penalties.  However, some said he might have been willing to pay more in order to get his  brother's off.  </P> <P> "It is hard to know how much pain and exhaustion he and his family have  suffered through," said another Milken friend.  </P> <P> Michael and Lowell Milken are very little alike. Michael has been the grand  thinker, the creative genius, the one who brings in the clients. Lowell has  remained in the background, working out the details that his brother left  behind.  </P> <P> Lowell Milken, 41, graduated summa cum laude from UC Berkeley and was editor of  the law review at UCLA law school. He went to work for the Los Angeles law firm  of Irell &amp; Manella in the early 1970s, where he specialized in business and  tax law.  </P> <P> But in 1978, he left the law firm to join his brother at Drexel's fast growing  Beverly Hills junk bond department. There he originally managed the investments  that Michael had been making for himself, Lowell and other Drexel employees. He  eventually became Michael's right-hand man, advising his better-known brother  about the finances and the risks of potential deals.  </P> <P> "He was very important to Mike because he was somebody Mike trusted  completely," said another investment banker.  </P> <P> However, Lowell never traded any securities; he wasn't licensed to do so. The  government alleged in its indictment that Lowell was involved in racketeering  and fraud in other ways.  </P> <P> According to the indictment, Lowell engaged in securities fraud by helping to  conceal Drexel's interest in Mattel securities when the Hawthorne-based toy  maker was involved in a financial overhaul.  </P> <P> He also participated in a "stock parking" scheme involving stock speculator  Ivan Boesky, the government alleged. Stock parking is an illegal arrangement in  which one party agrees to temporarily buy stock from another with the  understanding that the seller will not only repurchase the shares, but will  indemnify the buyer from loss on the transaction.  </P> <P> The government contended that Michael Milken "parked" 4 million shares of  Phillips Petroleum stock for Boesky in order to inflate the level of capital  Boesky was reporting. Lowell Milken was allegedly part of a 1986 conference  call where the illegal arrangement was discussed, according to the indictment.  Other charges against Lowell related to the Milken brothers allegedly meeting  with Boesky to discuss ways to reconcile their losses on the stock parking  arrangement. The indictment also charged that Lowell later lied to cover up the  transaction.  </P></p>

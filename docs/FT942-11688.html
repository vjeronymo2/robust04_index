			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of Greater Philadelphia (7): Bell Atlantic eyes multimedia - The region is home to some of the most famous corporate names in American business. FT writers discuss the progress of four of them The 53-storey, four-year-old Bell Atlantic Tower is a dominant feature of the Philadelphia skyline and a permanent reminder of the importance to the city of this innovative local telephone giant. Bell Atlantic is one of the seven 'Baby Bells' - the regional phone companies spun off from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph in 1984 under an anti-trust court settlement. It is the dominant telephone company in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia and Washington DC. Not only is its headquarters, the Bell Atlantic Tower, in Philadelphia, but so too is the headquarters of its local telecommunications operating company for the state, called Bell Atlantic, Pennsylvania. The company has gained a reputation under Raymond Smith, its chief executive since 1989, of being the most entrepreneurial of the Baby Bells. But radical change is sweeping through the US telecommunications industry as the boundaries which divide it from the cable television and computer industries blur. This is eroding the local monopolies as new rivals, such as cable companies, start providing telephone services. The change is also opening up huge new opportunities for the Baby Bells, which can play a leading role in the provision of inter-active multimedia - combining traditional telecommunications and television-based services - to the home and office. In addition, they should eventually be allowed to enter the long-distance telecommunications market, an area from which they are barred under the AT&amp;T break-up agreement. Bell Atlantic is at the forefront of this revolution - though it suffered an embarrassing setback this year when it had to call off a merger with Tele-Communications Inc, the largest cable service provider in the US. The deal collapsed in February, ostensibly because the Federal Communications Commission ordered the cable industry to make big cuts in the basic rates it charges consumers, which in turn upset the terms on which merger had been agreed. However, other factors may have been involved, including a clash of culture between the racy, entrepreneurial TCI and Bell Atlantic, which, for all Mr Smith's changes, retains a somewhat conservative culture deep down. The chief executive is a native of western Pennsylvania who joined the local AT&amp;T operating company, then called Bell of Pennsylvania, in 1961. He became president of the company in 1983. When he became chief executive of Bell Atlantic six years later he moved quickly to cut costs, and the group is now the slimmest of the Baby Bells, ranked by number of employees relative to phone lines. Despite the collapse of the TCI deal, Bell Atlantic will still be a major force in multimedia; but, as Mr Smith said recently, it will now pursue a more flexible strategy on a 'market by market, partner by partner basis'. This suggests that it will take the company substantially longer to build up a significant presence outside its own operating area. Within its operating area, it is pressing ahead with several important inter-active initiatives. In August it won a landmark court victory which has freed it to provide its own inter-active video service down its phone lines, an area from which it was barred under 1984 cable television legislation. It has been testing such a service in Northern Virginia, and in July will open a new digital production centre in Reston, Virginia, where its interactive services will be created and packaged for delivery to consumers. Its other initiatives in this area include: joining with a small New Jersey company to blanket the New York area with an inter-active wireless television service to compete with cable TV; and teaming up with companies in two areas of New Jersey to deliver cable television programmes over modernised phone lines. Although the company has no large-scale multimedia experiments under way in Pennsylvania, the state expects to get its fair share in future. Bell Atlantic expects to will spend Dollars 80m on new plant in the region around Philadelphia this year, and intends to make ISDN - an intermediate technology which increases the capacity of an ordinary phone line - available throughout the area this year. As for community activism, Tony diGioia, executive director for external affairs, Bell Atlantic, Pennsylvania, says the company's main thrust is in the areas of economic development and education. Some Dollars 3.5m of the subsidiary's Dollars 5.7m state-wide contributions budget is committed to the Philadelphia area, with about Dollars 1.5m of the total going on educational projects. The company's activities include a programme to help reduce the school drop-out rate, by sending employees into schools to talk about career choices; and mentoring, under which staff members adopt a school child and give him or her guidance. Bell Atlantic has also adopted two schools in the troubled inner-city area, and tries to give them extra help. As for economic development, it is a partner in a scheme which helps small businesses across Pennsylvania identify problems and expand, and it has also been involved in the creation of a computer model which will identify what businesses can best be recruited for particular areas of the state. Within Philadelphia itself, the company is one of 21 organisations involved in Strategy 21, a partnership working to improve the industrial competitiveness of the city in the 21st century.</p>

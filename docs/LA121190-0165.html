			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GM PLANS TO ADD MINORITY DEALERSHIPS  </P> <P> General Motors Corp. plans a 40% boost in the number of minority-owned  dealerships over the next three years, the auto maker announced today.  </P> <P> The company plans an additional 76 minority-owned dealerships by December,  1993, said GM President Lloyd Reuss and Tony March, chairman of the 11-member  GM Minority Dealer Advisory Council.  </P> <P> GM has 192 black, Hispanic and Asian dealers, making up 2% of its about 9,600  dealers.  </P> <P> "Increased minority participation in our dealerships is vital to achieving GM's  prime objective of the 1990s -- satisfying car and truck owners better than any  other manufacturer," Reuss said.  </P> <P> GM has conducted a minority dealer-training program since 1972. But March, one  of GM's leading black dealers, said the new agreement went an important step  further.  </P> <P> "There is no doubt in my mind about the commitment of Lloyd Reuss and (GM  Chairman) Bob Stempel," said March, a Buick dealer from Hartford, Conn. "We are  talking about a commitment from the largest corporation in the world."  </P> <P> GM intends to increase the number of minority dealers in cities with relatively  large minority populations, according to a GM statement. Those cities include  Detroit, where four black-owned GM dealerships folded this year, leaving no  black-owned GM franchises in the metropolitan area.  </P> <P> At Ford and Chrysler, minorities make up 5.7% and 2.5%, respectively, of dealer  ranks.  </P></p>

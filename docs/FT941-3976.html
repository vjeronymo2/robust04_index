			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Accountancy agreement brings merger closer The UK's six leading accountancy bodies have agreed in principle to a radical restructuring of their operations in a move that could lead to merger. This would give more than 200,000 members of the profession the right to call themselves chartered accountants. In a statement expected next week, the six professional bodies plan to announce principles leading to rationalisation. Details of the agreement, developed by a sub-committee chaired by Mr David Bishop of KPMG Peat Marwick, are still being finalised. Worries about smaller bodies being swallowed by larger ones, and concerns about variable quality and strategy have prevented significant mergers since the 1950s. The idea of reducing the number of bodies was given renewed emphasis last week when Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said fewer accountancy organisations would better serve members' interests and make them more effective in lobbying government. When the last radical proposals to merge the professional bodies failed in 1970, they created the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies, which has proved unsatisfactory. The present accountancy bodies' sub-committee, chaired by Mr Bishop, has agreed 14 principles of rationalisation, which will be tested on a sample of the bodies' members. The statement is expected to say that all the bodies accept the need for change, and to set out a series of objectives for the accountancy profession into the next century. Until now, it has only been possible for members of the three chartered institutes of accountancy to call themselves 'chartered accountants'. More detailed debates about the structure of a rationalised profession will begin, including the way in which education and training will be provided, and the structure and governance of any merged bodies. One of the more likely outcomes would be a federal structure, with separate bodies representing all accountants in Scotland, Ireland, and England and Wales. Each of the three bodies would include divisions catering for the different interest groups, such as small and large firms, public practice and accountants in business, and the public sector. A small, central body with elected or co-opted members from the regional institutes would deal with issues such as ethics, regulation, auditing standards, international liaison, and some lobbying. Jobs would be lost among the 1,200 staff of the different bodies. Those most cautious about rationalisation are the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland and the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, which have stated their preference for an intermediate stage of 'harmonisation' before considering whether to permit full rationalisation.</p>

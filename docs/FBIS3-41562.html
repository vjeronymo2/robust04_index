			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Dec 3 KYODO -- A survey showing higher levels  of acid rain on the Sea of Japan side of the country than on its  Pacific coast proves Japan should cooperate with countries on  the Asian mainland as possible sources of the contaminants,  scientists said Friday [3 December].    Environmental divisions of local government administrations  throughout Japan cooperated on the survey, the first of its kind  to collate data from 158 sites between Hokkaido in the north and  Okinawa in the south.    National surveys conducted by the environment agency since  1983 have been more limited in scope, including data from only  29 sites.    The new survey findings clearly show higher levels of acid  rain on the Japan sea side of the mountain range which runs  through the center of Honshu Island compared to areas on the  Pacific coast side.    The findings show that northern Japan and mountainous  regions  experience an ``acid shock'' in spring when snows melt and  release highly acidic substances into streams and rivers.    The results point to a need to document the effects of this  on the environment.    A total of 63 environmental centers cooperated on the survey  between April 1991 and March 1992.    They sampled acid levels and amounts of sulphuric acid and  nitric acid content in rain and snow.    Average pH levels, a measure of acidity and alkalinity,  ranged between 4.3 and 4.9. Numbers from 7 downward on the  scale indicate increasing acidity, while numbers upward from 7  indicate increasing alkalinity. A figure of 5.6 is accepted as  normal.    Among 39 sample sites which could not be expected to receive  any pollution from domestic urban areas, the Hokuriku region  around the Noto peninsula in particular experienced more than 15  millimeters of sulphuric acid-containing precipitation per  square meter over a 30- day period in the winter.    This was more than three times the lowest levels in the  survey, which were found in Hokkaido.    With the exception of parts of Aomori Prefecture, other  areas  from the Tohoku Region in the north and stretching across to the  Sanin region, central Kyushu and the western part of Shikoku  Island, all received large amounts of rain containing higher  than normal levels of sulphuric acid.    The high sulphuric acid content in rain in Kyushu is  attributable to volcanic activity, but scientists who conducted  the survey said that on the Japan sea side of the country in  particular, there is a strong likelihood the acid has been  brought by prevailing westerly winds.</p>

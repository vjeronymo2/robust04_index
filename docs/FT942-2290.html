			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / The Markets: Aluminium figures awaited - Commodities The aluminium market is anxiously awaiting today's production statistics from the International Primary Aluminium Institute to make sure that the voluntary cuts in output agreed by the big producing countries earlier this year are continuing to bite. It is widely anticipated that the IPAI figures will show production in May, in countries outside the former Soviet Union, fell by about another 600 tonnes a day. This follows a drop of 570 tonnes a day in April and one of 632 tonnes in March. By April the annual production rate had fallen to 14.4m tonnes, a drop of 3.2 per cent and equivalent to 486,000 tonnes of aluminium. Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, says further falls in the daily output rate can be expected in June and July. Nevertheless, he suggests that there will be no substantial fall in the highly-visible London Metal Exchange stocks - now standing at more than 2m tonnes - this summer. Although the aluminium industry has started on the road to recovery, he recalls that when aluminium seemed to be recovering from the last recession in the 1980s LME stocks stopped falling and prices slumped again. Mr Stewart Spector, who produces the Spector Report on the aluminium industry, says the IPAI statistics show that many smelters have not cut output as quickly as their formal announcements suggested. 'However, because production is declining and demand is rising faster than anticipated, the end results will be the same. There will be a full industry recovery in 1995 and production in 1996 will be nearly 100 per cent of capacity.' Also today in Moscow the second round of negotiations will take place between De Beers, which controls 80 per cent of the uncut diamond market, and Russian officials about a new contract with the cartel organised by the South African group. Some Russians are seeking large changes and it is unlikely that agreement will be reached quickly.</p>

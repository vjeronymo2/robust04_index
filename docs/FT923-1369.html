			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / International Company News: Valeo rises 63% on weak demand VALEO, the leading French maker of car components, yesterday reported a 63 per cent rise in net profits to FFr408m (Dollars 75.55m) in the first half of the year, from FFr250m in the first six months of 1991. Like Michelin, the French tyre-maker which unveiled a sharp earnings recovery yesterday, Valeo owes much of the improvement to lower production costs and finance charges in a poor economic climate. Demand from the car industry continues to be weak, reflected in an 8 per cent rise in turnover from FFr10.3bn to FFr11.1bn over the same period. Operating profits after finance charges rose by 64 per cent to FFr702m. However, Valeo booked FFr218m in restructuring costs in the first half as it intensified its cost-cutting drive in the face of tough international competition. Investments, by contrast, rose by 25 per cent to FFr708m, reflecting the completion of an electronics plant in France, an engine cooling plant in Italy, and a UK factory to make climate controls. This spending came out of cash-flow, but Valeo still managed to reduce its debts by FFr685m over the period, to FFr2.26bn by the end of June, which represents 30 per cent of shareholders' funds.</p>

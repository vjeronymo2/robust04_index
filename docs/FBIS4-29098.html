			<p>Liabilities   Said Growing   <F P=102> 942A0150A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 13, 14 Apr  94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 942A0150A </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article in two installments by Akio Yamamoto, reporter of </F> NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Tokyo Securities Department: "Growing Risk  of Personnel Liabilities"]  <H5>  [13 Apr 94 p 17] </H5>   [Text] Companies have begun facing the problems of  "labor liabilities" such as retirement benefits and pensions for  their employees. With their employment adjustments, payments to  those retiring are growing sharply and generating huge special  losses. Until now, they have gotten by somehow by disposing of  assets or borrowing from banks, but there is no guarantee that  those methods will work indefinitely. It is time to pay the  piper for the contradictions of lifetime employment and the  seniority pay system that had been put off to the future.  <H5>  Companies That Have Been Lucky </H5>   Since the end of 1993, president Kenji Kano of the big  software developer INES has repeatedly been told, "I want to  know why you have cut your staff back so much."    In November 1993 the company sought voluntary resignations  and 302 persons responded. Before that 250 people had resigned  for their own reasons, and by the start of the first quarter of  1994, one-fourth of its staff of 2,067 had left the company.    The reason such a large staff cutback possible is that  average employee age is a young 30 years. Employees who resigned  were mainly those in their 20's who had been with the company  two to four years. Including bonuses, total payments for  resignation allowances came to 1.44 billion yen (2.6 million yen  per person). One can see how light that burden was if it is  compared to the total of 3.6 billion yen (12.2 million yen per  person) that Shokusan Jutaku Sogo Co., Ltd. paid last June after  soliciting 250 voluntary resignations among those mainly in  their 50's.    It was also lucky that much of the 14.3 billion yen procured  in a publicly offered new stock issue in March 1990 still  remained as current deposits and had not been put into  facilities investment under the business recession followed  immediately.    Listed firms that have cut staff by more than 100 by  soliciting voluntary resignations exceeded 20 in fiscal year  1993 alone, but few companies covered resignation bonuses from  funds on hand as INES did. Even in the software industry, where  it is said that "some 10 percent of employees have no work,"  making up funds for resignation bonuses is a bottleneck and one  sees no firms resolutely cutting back staff.    How do companies that have solicited voluntary resignations  usually cope with the financial aspects? A typical example of  that is Tamura Electric Works, Ltd., which solicited voluntary  resignations in the summer of 1992.    This company paid out a total of 7 billion yen to 698  persons  resigning voluntarily (36 percent of its total staff). To cope  with this, it raised 3 billion yen by selling off land, golf  course memberships, and borrowed the remainder from a number of  banks including its main-force Fuji Bank.    The handling for accounting purposes is that 3 billion yen  in  normal resignation bonuses is written off as resignation payroll  reserves. The extra 4 billion yen in resignation bonuses is  counted as a special loss, taking the form of a partial covering  of losses by extra profits from the asset disposal gain.    Ordinary resignation fund reserves, which are an item on  balance sheets, also have not actually been secured as funds on  hand. Therefore, says General Affairs Division Chief Minoru  Takahashi, it was necessary that "with deciding to solicit  voluntary resignations, our officers went around" seeking the  cooperation of the banks at the same time.    Denki Kagaku Kogyo, which October 1993 solicited voluntary  resignations (382 persons), and Sankyo Seiki Manufacturing,  which made a solicitation January 1994 (297 persons), procured  their resignation bonus funds--2.2 and 1.8 billion yen  respectively--by selling off idle assets and getting the banks'  cooperation.  <H5>  Hard To Borrow From Banks </H5>   Lately, cases have begun emerging in which companies are  being forced to do last-resort fund procurement to pay  resignation bonuses. To cover the procurement for, and special  losses accompanying its solicitation of 178 voluntary  resignations, Orient Watch Co., Ltd. sold off its main factory  in Hino City, Tokyo, March 1994. It sold its storage area,  amounting to one-third of its acreage to Seiko-Epson, its  number-two stockholder, for over 3.1 billion yen (a disposal  gain of 2.9 billion yen), and by leasing this back it has  continued operations. The company holds 5 billion yen of its  stock by book value, but as of late September 1993 was holding  1.7 billion yen in latent losses. Even as it defers personnel  adjustments, its asset value is dropping and a company executive  says, "In a situation where we have no prospect for earnings  recovery, it is hard to borrow even from banks."    There are more companies which, separately from the firms'  own finances, hold in trust as "pensions" the funds for needed  for future resignation bonuses. Yet, the problem of operating  stagnation even in company pensions is quite onerous. The totals  for company pensions grow year by year and had reached a scale  of 50 trillion yen at the end of fiscal 1993. However, if  adjusted for market price, some 2.8 trillion yen is gone with  the wind due to the effects of stock-price stagnation.  <H5>  If Environment Deteriorates... </H5>   Nagasakiya Co., Ltd., whose unprecedentedly expensive  resignation bonuses were so much discussed, seems currently to  be carrying latent losses close to 10 percent in qualified  pensions accumulating to 19 billion yen. With a total of some 10  billion yen in resignation funds, including pensions, to be  disbursed by 17 April [1994], the company will be drawing down  over 2 billion yen in pension assets. But it is also possible  that it will force loss- cutting on its stock, and if it tries  to avoid that, its latent loss would expand even more.    Although a glimmer of light has become visible in the  business climate, few forecast a rapid recovery in business  earnings. It even seems likely that there will be more  corporations unable to come back without restructuring that  includes employment adjustments. Unprepared firms are raising  the funds after undergoing great difficulty, but if the  environment worsens, it may even become an actual matter of not  meeting "labor liabilities."  <H5>  [14 Apr 94 p 17] </H5>   [Text] In the December quarter of 1993, Japan IBM  effected a personnel reduction of some 3,000 persons, amounting  to over a 10 percent of its whole staff. Its total payout of  resignation funds, including the portion for pensions, is  unknown; but under special losses in the name of resignation  funds, it tallied 45 billion yen. This is mainly payments of  extra retirement bonuses and payments to employees under 50  years of age who are not eligible for qualified pensions.  <H5>  "Total Amount From Current Deposits" </H5>   Its allowances for resignation bonuses are under the same  dual system as other Japanese firms: resignation payment  reserves and pensions. "We are guided by our parent company in  the United States and do the management of resignation expenses  strictly, having kept a setup for covering the total amount by  drawing it down from current deposits," says Katsunori Asakura,  deputy chief for financial fund planning. The company made no  asset sales in the previous quarter, and its long- and  short-term debts are being reduced so that it takes the form of  internal procurement which copes by making a 35.7 billion yen  cut in inventory.    In general, U.S. firms have larger allowances for  resignation  expenses than Japanese firms. the U.S. Financial Accounting  Standards Board (FASB) requires for fixed-benefit type pensions  that differences between the current valuation of pension assets  and the amount payable, which estimates future pay raises also,  be accounted as that quarter's pension expenses. When the actual  contributed amount exceeds the pension expenses in the account,  the difference is added to assets as a prepaid expense.  Conversely, when a sum less than pension expenses is  contributed, the shortfall is added to liabilities as an unpaid  expense. In corporate accounting, obligations to employees are  actively maintained.    When Japanese firms make employment adjustments, one reason  for their cash position troubles is their inadequate  accumulation of resignation payment reserves. Certified public  accountant Ikuo Nishikawa criticizes that inadequacy, saying,  "Japanese resignation expense reserves do not make a projected  calculation using actuarial statistics but have merely gone back  to current values under a set discount rate for the sum needed  for payment at quarter's end."    In actuality, too, there are many companies which adopt, as  is, the tax law standard that accepts as a loss up to 40 percent  of the amount to be paid at quarter's end. This is calculated by  postulating the sum to be paid should all employees resign at  the end of a certain quarter with 12 years of remaining service,  discounted at a rate of 8 percent. The possibility is high that  accumulations will be inadequate simply from not considering  such things as future pay increases.    Limitations have also been pointed to in the aspect of  securing funds accumulated in readiness for future payments.  Professor Aishi Imafuku of Nihon University says, "The funds  reserved are directed into one investment or another; and, with  reductions in the investment value of land or stocks, instances  are emerging of the basic assets of resignation funds becoming  inadequate."    Managing Director Yoichi Sugimoto of the Japan Securities  Industry Welfare Pension Fund, controlling the pension assets  for some 150,000 persons working in securities firms, asserts,  "The biggest issue for Japan's company pensions is asset  management by book value." Not a few pension funds even carry  latent losses.    Over the past several years, U.S. companies have tallied  huge  deficits and pushed forward with bold restructuring. The U.S.  IBM's fourth-quarter 1992 operating deficit was about $8.2  billion and its final deficit for the year went above $4.9  billion while its costs related to restructuring rose to $11.6  billion.    It effected staff cuts of 32,000 persons, equivalent to  nearly 10 percent of its total work force. Its supplementary  resignation costs covering extra resignation funds were $2.3  billion and totalled $5.4 billion when the share due in the  following fiscal year are included. Yet, its pension expenses  were $838 million, growing by no more than just over $300  million above the previous quarter. It is a big contrast to the  dire distress which Japanese firms go through even in paying out  ordinary resignation funds.  <H5>  Great Difference Between Japan and the United States </H5>   Where Japan differs greatly from the United States is not  merely in the sense of obligations owed to employees and their  security. For the size of liabilities a firm will carry forward  into the future, its liabilities still to be accumulated for  pensions and its expenses in a period are vital information for  investors, but in Japan these are not adequately disclosed.    In the United States, not only are shortfalls in  accumulations of pension assets added into the balance sheets,  but such items as the market value of pension assets and pension  expenses are also entered. In statements of cash-flow accounts,  cash appropriated for pension funds is disclosed. In Japan, once  an appropriation is made to a pension fund outside of the  company, it becomes an off-the-book asset and only the book  value of pension assets is disclosed. Pension expenses also are  lumped together as legal welfare expenses and become unknown to  anyone on the outside.    The Hitachi, Ltd.'s total of pension assets and resignation  payment allocations as of the end of March 1993 was about 725  billion yen. That differs greatly from the approximately 570  billion yen at Toshiba, where the scale of staffing and average  age are not very different. On the grounds that "We have no  obligation to disclose it," expenses for the quarter are not  revealed; however, cumulatively a gap in expenses of about 150  billion yen would have existed in the past.  <H5>  Era for Deferrals Is Passing </H5>   The era is passing in which under the systems of lifetime  employment and seniority wages premising a high growth rate  firms could defer expenses, and the need is growing to set up  conditions for corporate ratings that even allow global  comparisons. The issue of "labor liabilities," while subsuming  complex elements tied to the social system, is a topic that  makes it urgently necessary to take up a clarification of the  obligations and security measures that companies owe their  employees as well as disclosure of information to  investors.</p>

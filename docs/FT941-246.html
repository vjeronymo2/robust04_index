			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Case closes French plant in shake-up JI Case, the US manufacturer of farm machinery and construction equipment, yesterday announced plans to restructure its French and UK operations to improve efficiency and respond to depressed market conditions. The measures will involve the closure of a plant in central France and job losses at other French and UK sites. Case, a unit of US-based Tenneco, said that faced with the current European environment 'it cannot envisage a substantial natural improvement in activity'. It outlined a series of restructuring measures to cut costs, improve productivity and ensure 'long-term economic viability'. The proposed measures, which the company said were the next steps in a three-year restructuring programme, affect the group's French and UK operations. The Vierzon plant in central France, which employs 270, will be closed and assembly of loader backhoes will be transferred to the company's plant in Crepy en Valois, north of Paris. Some jobs will be transferred from Vierzon to Crepy. The company's Doncaster plant in northern England, which will become Case's single European tractor assembly plant following the closure of a plant in Germany, announced last year, will cease its component manufacture and machining activities. Jobs will be lost at the Doncaster plant, which currently employs about 1,400, although the number of positions affected is still unclear. Foundry activities at Doncaster and St Dizier in eastern France will be closed if alternative solutions, such as joint ventures, partnerships or sales cannot be arranged. These activities employ 160 and 250 respectively. The manufacture of backhoe transmissions at St Dizier will be replaced by out-sourcing of these products. Mr Steve Lamb, managing director of Case Europe, said that the steps were necessary to assure the company's future.</p>

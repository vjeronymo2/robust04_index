			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Taiwan tycoon sets off court skirmish Mr Oung Ta-ming, a Taiwanese tycoon suspected of illegal share dealings, provoked a courtroom skirmish between his bodyguard and the bailiff when he refused to pay TDollars 1m (Pounds 24,200) bail set by the Taipei district court to which he was subpoenaed for questioning yesterday. Friends of Mr Oung rallied to meet his bail as he resolutely denied that he had played any role in the share speculation case which led to a chain of share payment defaults and rattled the Taiwan stock market early last month. As an elected member of Taiwan's Legislative Yuan, or parliament, Mr Oung may not be arrested or detained without the permission of the legislature unless caught in the act of committing a crime, under the country's constitution. Mr Oung apparently sought to force the court into the position of having to secure approval to arrest him. During questioning, Mr Oung, effective chief of Hualon-Teijran Corp, a listed textile concern, blamed the Taiwan Stock Exchange for the incident that sparked a 14 per cent plunge in share prices in one week. He said the exchange's failure to enforce a newly instituted 'self-protection clause' made financiers refuse to continue backing his chief aide, Ms Li Hsiu-fen, thus precipitating the defaults crisis. Earlier this year, Hualon-Teijran committed to invest Pounds 160m to build a textile plant in Northern Ireland with Pounds 61m in subsidies from the UK government. The Taipei district attorney's office is believed to have documented evidence of financial links among Mr Oung, Ms Li and other unnamed providers of funds to speculation in shares of Imperial Hotel. But Mr Oung denied such links, saying it was a mistake to take evidence of financial flows as proof of his role in deals involving the share price. He was simply helping his friends and employees, he said. 'For several years now I have entrusted all funds to Ms Li Hsiu-fen, including even my cheque-book,' he told the Taipei district attorney, asserting: 'I stopped paying attention to these matters long ago.' Ms Li, also brought in for questioning yesterday, tearfully told prosecutors that although she had traded heavily in Imperial Hotel shares, she did not rig the share price. Ms Li has been in detention since early October. No date was set for further proceedings.</p>

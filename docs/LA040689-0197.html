			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BOTHA SLATES SOUTH AFRICA ELECTION IN '89;  </P> <P> AFTER PARTY STRUGGLE, HE ORDERS DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT IN MAY  </P> <P> President Pieter W. Botha announced today that general elections will be held  this year and ordered Parliament dissolved at the end of May, signaling the end  of his 10-year reign after a power struggle within the ruling National Party.  </P> <P> Botha, 73, issued the announcement in his first address to a joint session of  Parliament since suffering a stroke Jan. 18 that forced him to surrender  leadership of the National Party, and ultimately prompted demands that he step  aside as president to make way for a younger leader.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Will Pick 'Appropriate' Day  </P> <P> He said he will order Parliament dissolved "on an appropriate day" at the end  of May, setting in motion the process for general elections.  </P> <P> According to the constitution, an election must be held within 180 days of the  dissolution of Parliament -- a tricameral body that has separate houses for the  white, mixed-race, or colored, and Indian populations but excludes the black  majority.  </P> <P> The life of the present Parliament expires in September, and Botha indicated  that an election will be held about that time.  </P> <P> At the first session of the newly constituted Parliament, a state president  will be elected. Assuming that the National Party, which has ruled the country  for 40 years, wins a majority in the election, the next president is expected  to be Frederik W. de Klerk.  </P> <P> De Klerk, elected National Party leader Feb. 2 after Botha's resignation from  the post, mounted a strong challenge to his decision to retain the presidency  and separate the two most powerful positions in the land.  </P> <P> Botha bucked the challenge and last month ruled out an early election. He  retreated only after a unanimous endorsement of De Klerk's bid by the National  Party -- the architect of the apartheid laws in South Africa that have denied  27 million blacks a voice in the affairs of government.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Open-Minded  </P> <P> De Klerk, 53, has yet to break with any of Botha's major policies, but he is  widely considered more pragmatic and open-minded than the president and thus  more likely to initiate negotiations with major black leaders.  </P> <P> In a speech to Parliament after becoming party leader, De Klerk called for a  South Africa "free of domination and oppression."  </P> <P> However, he has also reaffirmed the party's commitment to segregated schools  and neighborhoods for whites who want them.  </P></p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Markets: Charter free to start spending - The Bottom Line although the UK industrial group needed more than one bound to achieve independence from Anglo American Corporation, the South African mining group. Charter took the biggest step in February by selling its 38 per cent holding in Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group, which is part of the Anglo American 'family' of companies. Jeff Herbert, Charter's chief executive, completed the process this week by announcing plans to buy out the 36 per cent stake in his company held by Minorco, Anglo American's Luxembourg-based investment company. After receiving Pounds 342m for the Johnson Matthey stake and paying Minorco Pounds 236m for its own shares, Charter will be left with about Pounds 200m in net cash, borrowing facilities of Pounds 300m and the ability to issue its own paper. What will the group do with its new-found freedom, apart from dropping the 'Consolidated' from Charter's title? Herbert is keen to build by acquisition. He says there could be 'one big hit' in the Pounds 500m range, but it seems much more likely that the group will make a series of smaller purchases in areas close to its present businesses. Charter's existing operations - rail and mining equipment; building products; quarrying and mining - reported an 11 per cent increase in operating profits in what the group described as 'a very difficult year when many of our competitors struggled to stand still.' In spite of the depressed trading conditions Herbert is confident there are good buying opportunities 'partly because of how we run our businesses, partly because some sectors are now moving ahead.' The group will favour UK-based companies with an international spread of businesses. As a former director of GEC and Jaguar Rover Triumph, Herbert admits: 'My natural background is making things.' Charter would like to increase its exposure to Continental Europe, which currently accounts for only 15 per cent of group sales, and is also interested in the opportunities offered by the Far East and Eastern Europe. However, the group has little track record in making acquisitions and is thought in the City to have overpaid for its last big deal, by spending Pounds 54m for the Hargreaves quarries operations in 1989. Herbert remains confident of being able to make earnings-enhancing acquisitions, even although the market as a whole is on a high rating: 'Some prices are still unrealistic, but pain does tell. There are people out there who are really hurting.' It should be relatively easy for Charter to buy companies which offer a better return than cash in the bank, thus increasing group earnings. But unless a rising share price maintains Charter's rating, it will subsequently become more difficult for the group to issue paper without diluting earnings. It is not easy to arrive at a fundamental valuation of the new-look Charter. Its shares are currently trading on a multiple of 17.5, a 20 per cent premium to the market that reflects the amount of cash in the group. But analysts estimate that the group's underlying business should probably be on a prospective multiple of about 12.5, a 14 per cent discount. Just how the shares perform is therefore likely to depend on both the speed and success of Charter's acquisition plans. The shares rose from 634p to 648p when the deal was announced on Wednesday, but fell back a little to close the week at 639p. Analysts feel the existing operations are unlikely to sparkle, although the Cape building materials business did well to increase operating profits by 5 per cent and has considerable recovery potential. Investing in the shares really comes down to backing the judgment of Herbert and his team. They are acknowledged as good managers and have some solid businesses, such as the Anderson mining equipment operation. Charter looks an interesting long-term bet for those attracted to less glamorous industrial stocks.</p>

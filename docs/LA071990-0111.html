			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 23 LOCAL TEAMS TO VIE IN STATE SOFTBALL EVENT  </P> <P> Twenty-three Valley-area girls' teams will descend on three Southern California  sites this weekend to compete in the Amateur Softball Assn. Major Travel State  Championships.  </P> <P> More than 150 teams will take part in the tournament, which begins Friday and  ends Sunday. The 14-and-under championships will be held in Riverside, the  16-and-under tournament will take place in Escondido, and the 18-and-under  championships will be in Anaheim.  </P> <P> The champions of the three divisions advance to the national championships,  Aug. 8-12. The 14-and-under tournament will be in Fort Worth, Tex.; the  16-and-under national championships will take place in Garland, Tex.; and the  18-and-under tournament will be contested in Lodi, Calif.  </P> <P> "Most teams play six to eight tournaments in preparation for this," said Dick  Siegel, coach of the West Valley Hot Shots, who are entered in the 16-and-under  division.  </P> <P> "You must attend (a minimum of) two tournaments to attend the state  championships, which explains the great number of teams that are going."  </P> <P> The Hot Shots include players from Agoura, Calabasas, El Camino Real, Canoga  Park, Taft, Reseda, Thousand Oaks, and Paraclete highs. Most members started on  their high school teams this year as freshmen.  </P> <P> Major Travel is one of the divisions of the Junior Olympic program, which  features 700,000 youths throughout the United States.  </P> <P> "It's a very competitive atmosphere," Siegel said. "We face people like Kym  Weil (Southern Section 4-A Division Player of the Year from Hart) all the time.  Every team has huge tryouts every year."  </P> <P> He added, "Anyone who is anyone in softball these days has gone through  tournaments like the one (this weekend)."  </P> <P> Four of Siegel's players -- Heidi Crocker of El Camino Real, Keri Borzello of  Taft, Heather Siegel of Calabasas, and Jacquelyn Stafford of Canoga Park --  will travel to Detroit for the Youth Maccabiah Games, which begin Aug. 18.  </P></p>

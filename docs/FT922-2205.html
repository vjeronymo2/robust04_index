			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: Skis Rossignol registers FFr54m loss THE SKI industry's revival will strengthen this year, according to Skis Rossignol, the leading French producer of skis, tennis rackets and golf clubs. The group yesterday announced a larger-than-expected loss for last year, but expects to be profitable in the current 12 months, thanks to strong growth in ski equipment sales. The Grenoble-based group also expects to benefit from improved productivity and lower costs. Net losses in the year to end-March were FFr53.9m (Dollars 10.22m), slightly above earlier company forecasts of FFr35m to FFr40m. But this was less than half the previous year's loss of FFr140.8m, due to recession and shortage of snow in the Alps. Since then, weather, if not economic conditions, have improved. Skis Rossignol's turnover rose by 6.1 per cent to FFr1.48bn last year.</p>

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Germany faces more pressure to ease interest rates THE DECISION by the Bundesbank last week to lower the discount rate by half a percentage point, to 6.75 per cent, will ease the pressure from its disgruntled partners. But the summit meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries in Tokyo this week is still likely to be an uncomfortable occasion for Germany. Everyone will want to see more easing soon. This is quite understandable, since the easing so far has not been all that substantial. This may seem surprising when the discount rate has been cut by two percentage points since last September, and the repurchase or 'repo' rate has fallen 2.4 percentage points over the same period. Yet, by one important measure, German monetary policy has hardly eased at all. As the chart shows, D-Mark three-month interest rates have remained above the yield on long bonds since shortly after German monetary union. France is the only other country shown in the chart for which this has also been true. In virtually all market economies, central banks work by changing the price of money, rather than its quantity. When a central bank makes short-term interest rates higher than long rates (that is, creates a negatively sloped yield curve), it normally pushes the exchange rate up. But it also squeezes financial intermediaries. The mechanisms through which this works include: Elimination of the profitability of borrowing short and lending long at fixed rates of interest; Pushing creditworthy clients to borrow in bond markets instead of from banks; Reducing the incentive to borrow at short-term rates of interest and the profitability of those who must do so; Lowering desired holdings of inventories. In the end, traditional credit-creating institutions are by-passed, lending is reduced, monetary growth falls and the economy goes into recession. The charts trace the relationship of two significant points on the yield curve since 1989. They demonstrate how far the monetary policies of the US, Japan and Germany diverged after 1990. The US eased first, the maximum degree of easing being reached in the months preceding 'black' Wednesday, which was also the period of maximum German tightness. As for Japan, it not only started to ease a year and a half after the US but, judged by the shape of its yield curve, by rather less. The divergence between US and German monetary policy, along with the tightness of the latter, were the main reasons for the months of chaos in the ERM. The chart shows how the UK was unable to ease monetary policy from mid-1991, while Italy's policy was sharply tightened in mid-1992. As for France, it not only suffered tight monetary policy before September 1992, but tight and highly unstable monetary policy thereafter, reaching relative calm only in April 1993. Even so, its monetary stance remains far tighter than those of Italy and the UK today. This makes little sense. France has low inflation. As the table shows, it also has a serious industrial recession and rising unemployment. Germany has experienced a still deeper industrial recession, though it does suffer from uncomfortably high inflation. As for Italy and the UK, their dismal industrial performances in 1991 and 1992 show they did need monetary easing. G7 monetary policy is still in disarray. US monetary policy has been skilfully handled by the Federal Reserve over the last few years. The same cannot be said of anyone else's. The Bundesbank's sins, though real, are at least venial compared to those of the politicians in Bonn. But the determination of the rest of the EC to stick to unchanged ERM parities after German unification was a signal error, one the French seem determined to persist with to the last gasp. As for the Bank of Japan, its policies were eased too late and too little. It would be good to think this week's meeting of the G7 will mark the start of common sense on monetary policy. Unhappily, the chances are close to zero.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all data for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100. Quarterly and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production show the percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The unemployment rate is shown as a percentage of the total labour force. Figures for the composite leading indicator are end-period values.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UNITED STATES                    Retail

Includes mining, manufacturing, gas, electricity and water supply industries except Japan (mining and manufacturing only) and UK (also includes construction industries). Unemployment rate: OECD standardised rate which adjusts as far as possible for the different definitions of unemployment used in official sources. Vacancy rate indicator: relevant vacancy measure divided by total civilian employment, expressed in index form. Derived from OECD series. US - help-wanted advertising, Japan - new vacancies, Germany and France  -all jobs vacant, Italy - no data available, UK - unfilled vacancies. Composite leading indicator: OECD data. Each is a combination of series. Cyclical fluctuations in the composite leading indicator usually precede cyclical fluctuations in general economic activity.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The extended council of the opposition Ukrainian  people's movement, or the Rukh, decided at the session on Sunday  to form a shadow Cabinet.    A shadow government will work out alternative programs for  the country's development and carry out constructive opposition  activities towards the present Cabinet, said the movement's  leader, Vyacheslav Chornovyl in an interview to Interfax-Ukraine.    The Rukh council also decided to "denounce even more the  Communist ideology and carry out a resolute struggle with the  ruling party which tries to stop the economic reforms".    The movement's leadership recommended that primary  organizations focus efforts on local elections which will take  place on June 26 alongside the presidential ones. Chornovyl  believes the Rukh may win the mayors' elections in over 20 large  cities and try to win the elections in another 700  constituencies.    The council confirmed the intention to vote at the  presidential elections against former prime minister Leonid  Kuchma and the current parliament speaker Aleksandr Moroz  because it believes they pose danger for sovereignty and  independence of Ukraine.</p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAA TO GIVE BUSIEST AIR CONTROLLERS BIG RAISES IN BID TO IMPROVE SAFETY  </P> <P> More than 2,000 air traffic controllers and other Federal Aviation  Administration employees will receive pay raises of up to 20% under a program  that Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said Thursday is aimed at  increasing air safety.  </P> <P> The additional pay is to take effect on June 1 at 11 of the FAA's busiest  facilities -- those that monitor air traffic over the New York, Chicago, Los  Angeles and Oakland areas. FAA officials say they have had difficulty staffing  their most complex facilities.  </P> <P> The increases, called "retention allowances," will go to 2,100 controllers,  inspectors and technicians for a five-year experimental period and may be  extended to other FAA operations, a Transportation Department news release  said. The FAA has about 19,000 controllers and other personnel working in air  safety at more than 460 sites.  </P> <P> "Facilities which have the most complex operations, the most chronic staffing  difficulties and the most impact on the overall national aviation system are  included in the demonstration project," Skinner said.  </P> <P> He said that the additional pay "will help us achieve our goal of a safer and  more efficient national aviation system."  </P> <P> A majority of the affected employees are air traffic controllers. Others are  aviation safety inspectors and technicians who service computers and other  equipment used to monitor air traffic.  </P> <P> Facilities where the increases will take effect are the Air Route Traffic  Control Centers in Aurora, Ill., and Ronkonkoma, N. Y.; the Chicago O'Hare and  Los Angeles international airports; the Oakland and Santa Ana, Calif., and the  Westbury, N. Y., terminal radar approach control facilities, and the flight  standards district offices in Los Angeles, Teterboro, N. J., and Farmingdale  and Valley Stream, N. Y.  </P></p>

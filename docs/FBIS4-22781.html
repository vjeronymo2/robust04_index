It includes research results, developments,  roundtable statements, and analytical comments.    "Unfortunately," the author believes, "a great deal of what  was written in the book was confirmed by actual 1993 results--by  the drop in production, inflation, and the collapse of the  financial system and monetary circulation."</p>

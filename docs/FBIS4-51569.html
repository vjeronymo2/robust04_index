			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh 30 Apr (AKP) -- Prince Krompreah Norodom  Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen, respectively first and second  prime ministers, have indicated that the roundtable meeting to  take place from 2 to 7 May cannot be postponed as has been  proposed by the nominal Khmer Rouge Leader Khieu Samphan.    At an audience on Friday, 29 April, with a French delegation  led by Francois Fillon, minister for higher education and  research, the two government leaders also underlined that in the  event of the failure of the roundtable meeting, the government  should submit a draft law outlawing the Khmer Rouge for the  National Assembly's adoption.    In a message addressed to His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk on 27  April, Khieu Samphan asked for "a neutral place" due to the  country's security problem and "an appropriate date."    "The Khmer Rouge are not able, no matter what, to occupy a  region totally," reaffirmed the Cambodian prime ministers,  adding that the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] has mapped  out "a complete plan" to defend security and the country.    Prince Ranariddh and Hun Sen appealed to foreign investors  not to worry about security problem and pointed out that the RGC  has legislations to guarantee their interests in Cambodia.</p>

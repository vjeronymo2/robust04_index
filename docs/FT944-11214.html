			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (24): New business clubs prove popular Business club elitism seems to be an idea that goes down well in nominally socialist China where access and contacts are the keys to success, writes a correspondent in Beijing. Twenty business, private and country clubs are either open or in the works in Beijing, all of them vying to raise membership among foreign executives, Chinese tycoons and even government officers forced by official rules to enrol under the name of their wives or relatives. The Chinese press estimates that 60 business and golf clubs are under construction across the country. New clubs market their prestige and facilities fiercely, advertising in print and on the radio, offering such incentives as free trips and pitching enrolment in limited memberships as an investment that will pay off handsomely in the future. 'I am besieged with calls from these clubs, I refuse to speak to them any more,' says an executive with an American bank. Perched on the 50th floor of Capital Mansion near a north Beijing diplomatic enclave, the Capital Club is the latest entry, boasting a panoramic view of the smoggy Chinese capital and a board of governors that is a mini Who's Who of Beijing government and business. A joint venture between the China International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic) and the Club Corporation of America, the club will soon fill its 400 capacity membership roll. In addition to a wood-panelled corporate ambience and dining areas designed like boardrooms, the club also has a recreation centre with a glass-domed swimming pool, bowling lanes, billiard tables and a golf simulator. The membership fees of Dollars 7,500 for corporations and Dollars 5,000 for individuals include access to 200 associated private and country clubs in 14 countries. 'We are trying to provide better opportunities for each member to do business and for foreign and Chinese businessmen to exchange views,' says Robert Dedman, chairman of Club Corp. of America, operator of two other clubs in the southern Chinese cities of Zhuhai and Zhaoqing. Other facilities in Shanghai and Guangzhou are planned. In December, the Changan Club - entrance fees are Dollars 28,000 for corporations and Dollars 20,000 for individuals - with private tennis courts, saunas, gymnasiums and dining rooms, will open not far from the walled citadel of China's Communist leadership, Zhongnanhai. The club is a venture between the Beijing Sports Commission and Fu Wah International Enterprises of Hong Kong. Some business sceptics question whether the plethora of planned private clubs will attract the gilded ranks of China's new millionaires - 'Beijing citizens still don't understand the concept of the business club. 'It's the same old problem here: the old culture could go on for another 25 years,' comments one club manager.</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PETER'S PRINCIPLES  </P> <P> I want to thank Peter S. Greenberg for his open letter to Allen H. Neuharth,  who had not flown here commercially for 19 years. It was an excellent response  to Neuharth's antiquated, sexist attitude!  </P> <P> Flight attendants for too long were seen as glamorized waitresses when the  emphasis needed to be put on their ability to handle safety and emergency  situations. Thank goodness that attitude changed, even though the airline  companies are still behind the times in offering salaries that would compensate  for the harsher conditions these service-oriented workers face today.  </P> <P> In the future, when Neuharth wants to see scantily dressed women who exhibit  "peppy playfulness," he should visit entertainment emporiums where "pretty,  young females" are paid to perform these duties!  </P> <P> MARTHA ABELL  </P> <P> Seal Beach  </P></p>

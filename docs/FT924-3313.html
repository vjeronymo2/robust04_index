			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Casino's change in tactics proves a winner: A company's fight for licences TO the great relief of its bankers and investors, and even more so its croupiers, London Clubs International has made a clean sweep in securing new gaming licences for its London casinos. Last week the company was granted a new licence for the Sportsman in Tottenham Court Road, having previously won new licences for its four Mayfair casinos - the Ritz Club, Les Ambassadeurs, the Rendezvous and the Palm Beach, plus the Golden Nugget in Piccadilly. Together, the six casinos account for about two fifths of the drop (money wagered) in the capital's casinos, which totals more than Pounds 1bn a year. As it happened, those events coincided with the arrival of a new chairman at the Gaming Board, Lady Littler, formerly an assistant under-secretary of state. A new phase appears to be dawning in British gaming. The London Clubs case is significant in that a new procedure has been introduced in casino regulation. In nearly all previous cases when casino management was judged by the police and Gaming Board as 'not fit and proper' - the verdict on London Clubs in March this year after an earlier raid on its Mayfair casinos - the company went out of business. Its assets were sold or transferred to a new operator. London Clubs found a different way to play the hand. The company decided to seek new certificates of consent after talks between the company's non-executive directors - who were anxious to save the banks' and other investors' money - and the Gaming Board. If successful, it could apply for new licences, while agreeing, at the same time, to relinquish its existing - allegedly tainted - licences. The licensing hearings were informed that London Clubs had been completely restructured, with a new chairman - Sir Gordon Booth, a former diplomat - new directors, new shareholders, new managers and new methods of compliance. In due course, new licences were granted. Other operators in the gaming industry are interpreting the case as a precedent, but that is not the view of the Gaming Board. Its officials maintain that they were 'very confident' of their case against London Clubs and were prepared to substantiate charges against the company, had the licensing justices so ruled. The issue may yet go to court if Mr John Aspinall, the rival casino owner, succeeds in his appeal to the High Court that granting new licences in this way was an evasion of the Gaming Act. Lady Littler says the board will not hesitate to attack casino licences where necessary and justifiable. But she adds that the board 'does not seek the closure of casinos, with all that that would entail, merely as a punitive measure, if problems can be eliminated effectively and propriety restored by less draconian measures'. London Clubs is delighted to retain its position as the capital's leading casino group; the board is satisfied it has achieved its regulatory objectives in full; and casino staff are relieved to keep their jobs.</p>

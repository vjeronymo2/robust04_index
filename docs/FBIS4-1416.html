			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by IEC Chairman Justice Johann Kriegler at </F> IEC headquarters, Gallagher Estate --live, broadcast in progress]    [Text] [Unidentified announcer] Right now, we are going to  a press conference at the Independent Electoral Commission  [IEC]. I am sorry that we have to interrupt you, but we are  going to the IEC headquarters at Midrand, Gallagher Estate.    [Kriegler] ... valid ballot paper, however, when it became  apparent yesterday already that there were certain voting  districts where the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] stickers had not  arrived in time, we had to deal with the situation as best we  could, and I want to read to you the instruction that was given.  Voters wishing to cast their votes for the IFP, where no  stickers were provided for the ballot papers, have been marking  their preference in writing on the ballots. The IEC will deal  with such ballots in due course, in terms of Section 47 of the  Electoral Act which deals inter alia with voting irregularities.    This section empowers the commission to make such  determinations and adjustments in respect of the counting of  irregular votes as it may consider appropriate in the  circumstances. Two, the commission has decided that it will  print additional ballot papers locally as they are required.  This process has already begun and so forth. Now what that  means is the following: In respect of yesterday's special votes  those special votes will be separately kept at the voting  station. Spoilt papers, spoilt as a result of the non- affixing  of a sticker, will be included in that bundle. Those ballot  papers will be counted in the sense that we will have a full  tally, counting station by counting station, as to how many  ballots were spoilt for this reason.    Likewise, in respect of the lesser number of voting stations  where stickers were not available today a similar procedure will  be applied, and I should add, and I think this should make Chief  Minister Buthelezi's heart a little happier, in respect of  foreign votes, where people have written in the IFP a similar  procedure will be followed. Then we cannot, in terms of the  Electoral Act, count those ballots, that is technically count  them, but when ultimately we weigh up the total number of ballot  papers in respect of which this shortcoming manifests itself,  and the areas in which the shortcomings were prevalent, the IEC  will be empowered in terms of the section that I have mentioned,  Section 47, to take those technically spoilt ballot papers into  account nevertheless. Whether that means that they will be  taken at full count value or at a lesser value, I cannot tell  you. That will depend upon the circumstances as we find them  towards Saturday or Sunday this week, and in the second instance  it will also depend upon the spread and the distribution of such  spoilt ballots. I don't think I can make the point clearer than  that and I hope it is now fully understood.    [Unidentified official] First to Kaiser, then to that lady,  as I have said. I have noted your hands.    [Kaiser] Mr. Justice Kriegler, Kaiser from THE STAR. Now you  told us yesterday that you had been in contact with Chief  Minister Buthelezi virtually, in your words, on an hourly basis  and that you have also spoken to the ANC's Cyril Ramaphosa and  Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer and they had  raised complaints with you. You had also spoken to the  Democratic Party. Have these parties been in contact with you  today as well and have they also raised other complaints with  you, which in your words, would seek to assail the integrity of  the election?    [Kriegler] Well, can I deal with the two barrels of the  question separately? In the operations room or in a room  adjacent to the National Operations Center of the IEC, in the  building where I am sitting, there is a permanent representative  body of the political parties with whom we are in continuous  contact. They have the information that comes into the  operations center at their disposal and I spent several hours  with them during the tense period this morning. During the rest  of the morning other representatives of the IEC are there. I  have seen or spoken to, on the telephone today -- I would think  probably half a dozen political leaders -- and generally, the  communications have been concerns or complaints, if you wish,  with regard to particular voting stations, particular features  at particular voting stations, and that's the very purpose of  having this continuous consultation. The complaints are noted.  They will be taken into account in the eventual evaluation as  to whether the elections were substantially free and fair, and  of course, on the more immediate scale they are addressed as a  matter of urgency by our operations center and our special  emergency task force.    [Official] I will now go over to the lady then I will come  on  this side on my right hand side.    [Correspondent Marion Wilkinson] I'm Marion Wilkinson from  THE AUSTRALIAN newspaper. Judge, just going back to the question  of potential interference in the distribution of the ballot  papers. You said that you had called in the Commissioner of  Police. Could you tell us: Was there any specific evidence  that prompted you to bring in the commissioner and was there any  evidence of a criminal matter involved?    [Kriegler] There was no evidence of any kind indicating a  possible crime, save that one of the inferences that could be  drawn from the shortage of ballot papers on such a widespread  scale, was obviously that somebody had tampered with the  supplies and that is why we, in consultation with the parties,  decided: call in the most expert investigative branch in the  country, namely the police, and ask them to pursue the matter.  There was no clue, no specific pointer to criminality at all,  let alone any particular kind. [sentence as heard] It was just  one of the possible inferences to be drawn from the totality of  the facts.    [Official The gentleman here, second row.    [Correspondent Sonny Raboch] Yes, I'm Sonny Raboch of Radio  Nigeria. The events that....[pauses] In view of the number of  ballot papers being printed now, is there likelihood that by  tomorrow voting will not have stopped and looking at the  situation where the IEC might say: Voting should continue on  Friday. Will that be public holiday? [laughter] To what extent  will the need to carry on voting affect the due process of  electioneering here?    [Kriegler] Well, you asked me two questions and the first is  based on a premise with which I do not agree. I do not agree  that there is any necessity to consider Friday as an additional  voting day. The evidence as it stands at the moment indicates  that the overwhelming majority of voters presented themselves at  the voting stations today, and it is a question of supplying the  ballot papers in sufficient numbers and speeding up the process  sufficiently and stretching the hours sufficiently to  accommodate them. With regard to the possible prejudice to the  freeness and fairness of the election, the only feature that I  can see is that possibly, electoral officers and presiding  officers and other agencies of the IEC may become very tired but  that's just the price we've got to pay for wanting to be part of  this glorious experiment in democracy.    [Official] The gentleman there.    [Correspondent Enoch Sexwale] I'm Enoch Sexwale of NEW  NATION. Judge, you've been saying all along that all was okay,  you're ready for elections, and now we have this problem of the  Inkatha sticker. Surely it's going to raise dust. It's amazing  that in Katlehong where I now come from there are no ballot  papers as yet. Can you be more specific? What went wrong?    [Kriegler] Let's get a couple of things clear. I have made  it abundantly clear from day one that this is a very, very  difficult exercise. This election is unique in world history in  that we are trying to conduct elections for an unknown number of  people with an unknown distribution, any of whom can arrive at  any voting station of their choice. We were certainly not so  stupid as to think that that wasn't a very, very difficult  exercise. Moreover, we had to provide infinitely more voting  stations than this country has ever contemplated before and we  had to do it largely with part-time, short-term employees. We  never promised anybody a rose garden. I said from day one we  will give you an adequate, respectable, election, not a 12  cylinder, super-charged election, you may remember my saying  that. That still is the position. We have achieved an over 80  percent success rate as of today. I am satisfied with that  although I readily accept and acknowledge that the millions of  people who have not yet been able to vote may have a very, very  different view on the matter. With regard to Katlehong your  information is not up to date. They are voting in Katlehong  right now.    [Official] The lady at the top there, then I'll come down.  I've noted your hands.    [Correspondent Mel Jones] Judge Kriegler, it's Mel Jones  from CBS News. In the districts where there were problems with  the sticker for Inkatha, what was told to the voters in those  districts, firstly. And secondly, is there any indication of  how widespread this problem actually is?    [Kriegler] I cannot tell you as I sit here what was told to  the voters in any particular voting station. The presiding  officers have instructions in a case such as that to record what  their announcement was and how that announcement was carried  through. That will have to be checked once the ballot papers and  the reports from the voting stations come in. With regard to  the distribution or breadth of voting stations in respect of  which the stickers were still a problem today I cannot be  specific. I have not got all of that reporting at my fingertips  at the moment. What I can say is that is significantly less  than yesterday. But of course, still more than it should have  been. There should have been none.    [Official] The gentleman over there. I've noted your hands.    [Unidentified correspondent] Can you tell us what position  Chief Buthelezi has taken on the sticker question? Has he  threatened to pull out of the election?    [Kriegler] He may well have done so. I have heard no such  communication, and I may say that if the chief minister were to  phone me or to speak to me, I would I am sure be able to satisfy  him that the procedure upon which we have decided will not  prejudice the IFP.    [Official] The lady down here.    [Unidentified correspondent] REUTERS News Agency. Judge, can  you tell us approximately how many people have voted up to now?    [Kriegler] No, I'm sorry I can't.    [Official] The lady from SABC [South African Broadcasting  Corporation]    [Correspondent Karen Mugglestone-Melville] I'd like to know  where is the position of the IFP on this ballot paper? Is it  still at the bottom, or is it alphabetical order?    [Kriegler] No, no. It is at the foot as it will be on the  correct ballot papers bearing the affixed sticker.    [Unidentified announcer] Gentleman at the top.    [Correspondent Mike Suzman] Mike Suzman, FINANCIAL TIMES.  You were saying earlier those ballot that don't have the  Inkatha sticker properly fixed or written in will be put aside  at polling stations and counted separately and then you will  decide at a later stage how to tally those into the final count.  Do you have any even rough estimates at this stage as to how  many ballot papers that decision will affect?    [Kriegler] I have no idea at the moment. I think what I can  say with considerable confidence based on the last two days of  troubleshooting is that it is likely to be considerably less  than first alarm on the part of political parties would have one  to believe. But the actual figures we haven't got at the moment  and will not have until probably some time on Saturday.    [Official] Question?    [Unidentified correspondent] Thank you. Judge Kriegler I'm  not quite sure whether you touched on this issue, but the  likelihood that of technically invalid papers is this not going  to invite cries of unfairness? Have you consulted with the  leader of the IFP, Dr. Buthelezi, on this issue and what are his  views? The fact that these technically invalid papers can be  counted at less than full value, is that not an invitation to  cries of unfairness?    [Kriegler] Yes, and on the other hand it depends who cries  the unfairness, because the ballot paper which has IFP written  in it at the foot draws one particular party to the attention of  the voter, and in terms of the act that paper is technically  invalid. Similarly, in respect of foreign voting, where we have  accepted for the purposes of the Section 47 consideration,  ballot papers with IFP written in actually can be said to favor  the IFP. We are not trying to squeeze anybody. We are not  trying to benefit anybody. We are trying to run in difficult  circumstances the freest and fairest election possible.    [Correspondent] Has Dr. Buthelezi been consulted on this?  What are his views?    [Kriegler] No. He has not been consulted and there has been  no reason to consult him. If there is an objection from the  Inkatha Freedom Party that objection, in the terms in which it  is put, will be fully investigated and if necessary will be  canvassed with the IFP. But I suggest that we wait and see what  actually transpires eventually.    [Official] I will take one more question, ladies and  gentlemen. The lady on the left.    [Unidentfied correspondent] I would like to know how many  cases are still outstanding in the electoral courts at the  moment?    [Kriegler] No ma'am, I need notice of that question. Quite  frankly, I haven't got it at my fingertips. I think that you  could get that information from our press office quite easily.    [Offical] Ladies and gentlemen, I will give the gentleman  there, because he has been trying, and the gentleman here has  had two opportunities already. [sentence as heard]    [Correspondent Stephen Laufer] Thank you very much. Stephen  Laufer from the WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN. Judge Kriegler I  wonder  whether we can just come back to this business of the write-in  for one more minute, and stretch your patience a bit. Why is it  not possible to say immediately if there is an IFP write-in with  an X against it it is counted as a valid vote? Is this a  quantity thing? If there are a hundred thousand of these then  you will start counting, if there are only twenty thousand  they'll be regarded as spoiled papers? What is going to be the  basis of your decision?    [Kriegler] Quite clearly it isn't only a quantity thing?  It's a distribution thing. It's a percentage thing. It is a  general pattern thing. One will have to look at the thing from  various angles, statistically, analytically, and eventually in  common sense to see what does it add up to? Does it mean that  in a particular voting district where the IFP got five percent  of the votes which were not technically spoiled we should regard  those that were filled in with the IFP which add up to five  percent, as well? Do we take that as five percent? Do we look  at what happened in the district next door? Do we look at what  happened in the subregion generally? It is not a purely  mathematical exercise. In terms of Section 47 of the act we've  got to weigh a large number of circumstances. It may well be  that very large numbers come in. As you say a hundred thousand,  although I must say that would astound me. The likelihood is  that it will be a very much lesser number than that.    [Official] I would like to express our thanks to Judge  Kriegler and to all of you. Our next update is planned for 7  o'clock this evening.    [Kriegler] Thank you.</p>

It also has a retail warehouse in Tunbridge Wells, three Tesco supermarkets in Bromley-by-Bow, Finchley and Sevenoaks, a pre-let retail warehouse development in Reading and a Do It All retail warehouse in Reading. The portfolio also includes the 122,000 sq ft United Biscuits distribution centre in Ashby de la Zouch, a 77,000 sq ft industrial warehouse complex in Middlesex and the Battersea Flour Mill, a 2.2 acre development site. British Land has also announced that it would satisfy part of its payment to Royal Insurance by the procurement from the market of 2m British Land shares at a price of 413p. Completion of this share purchase is expected to take place on April 25, the same day as the purchase of the property portfolio.</p>

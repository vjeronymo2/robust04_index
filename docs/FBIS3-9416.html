			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Committee of the Patriotic League of Belgrade  University at its session today discussed the general position  of other countries, particularly the Serbian lands. It  concluded, among other things, that it should address the Serbs  in the republic of Serbian Krajina and the Srpska republic. The  address, which was signed by student Bratislav Zarkovic on  behalf of the committee, states the following:    In the negotiations on territorial demarcation currently  under way, the representatives of the Serbian people must not  and cannot make under any conditions territorial and other  concessions that would in any way harm the interests of the  [Serbian] lands. Regardless of the pressure that the Serbian  people are being subjected to by the international community  during these negotiations, territorial concessions cannot be  allowed because the territories on which the Serbs live are  historically theirs. Therefore, this generation of negotiators  has no right to give up these territories under any condition.    The address also states that it is high time for all  patriotic forces in the Srpska republic and the republic of  Serbian Krajina to unite because this is in the interest of all  Serbs in all regions and in the interest of preserving their  biological survival.</p>

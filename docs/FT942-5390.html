			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Personal allowances My daughter is a British subject, resident in the US since about 1987. She has very little income there but Pounds 8,000 a year gross income in the UK  -mostly income from rents - on which she pays UK income tax. On two occasions, I have asked the inspector of taxes if she could claim personal allowances. He replied that, as she was resident outside the UK, she did not qualify for UK personal reliefs. Some months ago, however, Barry Stillerman wrote in answer to a reader's letter that 'British citizens, no matter where they live . . . are entitled to their annual personal allowance for income tax'. Have I misunderstood his reply or is my daughter's inspector wrong? Under section 256 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (ICTA 1988), any individual who both makes a claim to personal allowances and who satisfies certain conditions is entitled to UK personal allowances. Under section 278 ICTA 1988, personal allowances are limited to individuals who are resident in the UK unless that individual can satisfy the board of the Inland Revenue that they are a Commonwealth citizen, a citizen of the Republic of Ireland, or fall within other limited categories. In addition, personal allowances sometimes are available to citizens of other countries under the terms of a double tax treaty. Assuming your daughter is still a British citizen, I suggest that she completes form FS122 and forwards it to her inspector of taxes quoting the provisions of section 278 ICTA 1988. (Answer by Barry Stillerman). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

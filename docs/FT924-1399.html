			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Factory output per head up sharply PRODUCTIVITY in manu-facturing industry increased sharply in October, reflecting a small increase in output and a big drop in the labour force during the month. The Department of Employment said yesterday that manufacturing output per head in October was 5.9 per cent higher than in the same month last year. In the three months to October, productivity was 1.9 per cent higher than in the three months ending in July and 5.2 per cent higher than in the August-October period of last year. The productivity increase combined with relatively moderate wage increases to hold down unit labour costs. Wages and salaries per unit of production in UK manufacturing industries rose 0.4 per cent in October compared with October last year. The increase in the three months to the end of October was 1 per cent compared with a year before.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 7 (YONHAP) -- The Prosecutor General's  office on Monday continued questioning Han Ho-son, chairman of  the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF) who was  arrested Saturday on suspicion of creating and misusing a slush  fund. Prosecutor-general Kim Tae-chung also wanted to know  whether Han received any bribes when appointing heads of NACF  branch offices. In addition to building up the slush fund by  misappropriating money from the budgets of NACF provincial and  city branches, the prosecutor suspects Han, 58, may have added  billions of won more to the fund by receiving commissions and  payoffs from construction companies for various NACF building  projects.    The presidential office at Chongwadae, meanwhile, brushed  aside allegations that Han was being prosecuted for political  reasons. "There was no political intention for Han's arrest,"  said one senior Chongwadae official. "It's preposterous to  suggest that Han is being made the target of an unjust  investigation." There has been speculation that Han, as the  leader of the nation's powerful farm organizations, incurred the  wrath of the Kim administration with his uncompromising stance  on opening the domestic rice market to imports and other farm  policies following the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations.    The prosecutor plans to summon officials from four to five  large construction companies, NACF accountants and heads of NACF  provincial and city branches for questioning in this connection,  sources said. "Apart from the 360 million won Han admitted to  having set aside as a slush fund, we have found that he  misappropriated about 10 million won a month from the NACF's  budget," said one investigator at the prosecutor's office. "We  plan to find out the exact size of the slush fund and its uses  by tracing his personal bank deposits," he added. The  prosecutor's office is also looking into the possibility that  Han may have embezzled public funds from the NONGMIN SINMUN  (farmers newspaper) and Nongmin Co. He is president of both  companies.    In a related development, the ruling Democratic Liberal  Party  [DLP] decided at a party postholders' meeting Monday to urge the  government to conduct a thorough investigation of Han and  possible systematic irregularities at the NACF. The NACF must be  transformed into an organization that can act as a real  spokesman for the nation's farmers, the DLP said.    "On the occasion of chairman Han's arrest, systematic  irregularities at the NACF have to be cleaned up and the current  investigation should not leave any trace of suspicion," said DLP  spokesman Ha Sun-pong after the meeting. With regard to  allegations that Han paid off more than 100 politicians, DLP  Secretary-general Mun Chong-su said, "the party will study  taking possible action against anyone who is implicated in the  prosecutor's investigation."    The main opposition Democratic Party [DP] also urged the  government to investigate Han and the NACF thoroughly, clear up  any suspicions and severely punish those found guilty of  wrongdoings. DP Chairman Yi Ki-taek said, "Since (the  government) started this investigation (of the NACF), it has to  do a complete job." The government should also take this  opportunity to investigate other organizations run along similar  lines as the NACF, Yi said. DP spokesman Pak Chi-won urged a  thorough investigation, saying: "There was an allegation that 2  million to 3 million won apiece had been offered to 110 ruling  party candidates during the last parliamentary elections, and  large amounts of political funds had flowed into the political  circle."</p>

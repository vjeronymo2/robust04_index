			<p>BFN     [Text] [Correspondent Privetera] I do not believe that the  danger will be great above all for the NATO pilots, but rather  for the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] troops on site in Bosnia.  Asked what the situation would be if, for instance, UNPROFOR  troops were attacked, Manfred Woerner told me the following  this morning:    [Begin Woerner recording] Well, it is clear that additional  risks may be associated with this. However, the contrary could  happen, too. The evidence of a strong determination and the use  of more substantial military means could persuade the Bosnian  Serbs to give up their policy of taking hostages. However, as I  have said, I do not wish to speculate on this.    What we can do is use our air force for their protection.  This will happen, too. And then, do not forget, we cannot  decide on such action by ourselves. We must do this in  cooperation with the commanders of the UNPROFOR troops, the  United Nations troops, who are the only ones who are down there  on the ground. And they will certainly be interested in  protecting their people. Therefore, only such strikes will be  carried out in which the risk is limited, at least that is my  assumption.    You know there is something I do not understand. On the one  hand, we are being accused of doing nothing, or not enough.  When we do something they say: Do you not fear an escalation?    First of all I do not believe that the measures as such will  trigger an escalation of this kind. What they will achieve is  that the price of the aggression, the price for attacking safe  areas will become higher, considerably higher. And I can  certainly imagine that the military leaders will ask themselves,  at the latest after the first two, three missions, whether this  is worth the risk. This is our chance.

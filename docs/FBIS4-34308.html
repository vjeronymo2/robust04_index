He expressed his  hope that Fidel Castro, on his own initiative, will begin the  modernization of the Cuban state.    "I hope that day is close, I hope Fidel Castro will  personally begin this modernization, this change that the whole  world is expecting in Cuba. Let the change be implemented  slowly, without trauma and without bloodshed," Wasmosy said.    He indicated that when the changes happen, Paraguay will  open  its doors to the Cuban people as a whole because the Cuban  people are dear to us all. He maintained that everything has  been done to try to bring about more freedom, a greater opening  in the Caribbean island. He expressed his sadness regarding the  blockade that surrounds Cuba. "We have asked for a program of  opening for the Cuban people," Wasmosy said.</p>

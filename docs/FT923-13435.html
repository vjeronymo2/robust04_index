			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Arts: Olof Baer recital THE programme chosen by the Dresden-born baritone for his recital with pianist Geoffrey Parsons at the Royal Opera House on Sunday night was tasteful and chronological: a brisk survey of the Austro-German lyric art (with a glance in the direction of Hungary), beginning with Mozart and Beethoven, proceeding to Schubert, Mendelssohn, Schumann and Brahms, and culminating in Hugo Wolf, with encores from Liszt and Strauss. Mr Baer's baritone is light and smooth and well-nigh perfectly formed, projecting easily into the big auditorium while still sounding intimate and suave. His enunciation of the German words was immaculate even to a fault - his diction had a shapeliness that sometimes seemed self-regarding. Just as his stage manner is sweetly pleasing, so his way with these Lieder too often seemed like prettification rather than interpretation. His approach was seldom searching and his considerable beauty of tone was more dutiful than original. The critic Roland Barthes listened always for the 'grain' of an art-singer's voice, its trace of individuality or eccentricity, its cutting edge, even its flaw. Mr Baer is a singer pretty well devoid of this quality, though an occasional excess of vibrato in the voice might count as some kind of flaw, while at the end of Schubert's haltingly rapturous Dass sie hier gewesen, on the word 'Tranen' (tears), he wittingly or no came out with a quivering or weakening of tone that had a certain 'granular' force. But nearly all his items passed by as the merest diversions of a genteel summer evening - Mendelssohn's Heine settings, Brahms's Hungarian folksong adaptations, even Schumann's Widmung (Dedication). One did prick up one's ears a little at Beethoven's Adelaide and a little more at Wolf's Eichendorff settings, particularly Verschwiegene Liebe, in which Mr Baer gave evidence of a more commanding artistry. However, as is frequently the case with song recitals, it was in the very last encore, Strauss's Zueignung (another Dedication), that the singer really came into his own. This had abruptly gripping conviction and power. Mr Parsons was more consistent: he had supplied accompaniments of quiet mastery throughout.</p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / International Company News: Fokker set to cut prices by 30% Fokker, the Dutch aircraft maker controlled by Deutsche Aerospace of Germany, plans a 'drastic' reorganisation in 1994 that would lead to a return to profit in 1995. Mr Erik Jan Nederkoorn, chairman, said in the company magazine the aim of the reorganisation was to cut the cost price of Fokker's aircraft by around 30 per cent over the next three years. He said the world's airlines were demanding lower aircraft prices as part of their attempt to survive the fierce competition in international aviation. Mr Nederkoorn cited the US car industry as a sector which had successfully carried out an extensive reduction in production costs. 'It is unrealistic and very dangerous for the continued survival of the company to wait for the market to produce miracles,' he said. Fokker did not say how many jobs would be lost in the latest restructur-ing round, but details are expected to be released before the end of February. The company recently reduced its workforce to around 10,000 people from more than 12,250 at the end of 1992. Dutch trade unions said they expected several hundred job losses at Fokker. Earlier this year Fokker said its results were expected to swing into a net loss of Fl 150m (Dollars 79m) in 1993 from a net profit of Fl 120m in 1992, partly due to the one-off costs of laying off staff. Mr Nederkoorn said that 1994 was expected to be a 'difficult' year for Fokker.</p>

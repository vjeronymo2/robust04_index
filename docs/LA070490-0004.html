			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIANTURCO ON PROPS. 111, 108  </P> <P> In response to "On the Road Again With Props. 111, 108," by Adriana Gianturco,  Commentary, June 25:  </P> <P> Gianturco's comments were interesting in that she and Gov. Jerry Brown combined  to "strangle" our state transportation system with their moratorium on new  highway construction during their years in office.  </P> <P> The freeway ramps in progress you pictured are probably the ones being  completed that Brown and Gianturco left hanging eight years ago. Gianturco was  referred to as "Giant Turkey" during her tenure as director of Caltrans. The  name still fits. Props. 111 and 108 will be good for all Californians.  </P> <P> JOHN MALLOY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

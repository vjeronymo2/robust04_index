			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Tecs under fire for 'basic deficiencies' Training and Enterprise Councils, set up by the government to spearhead training improvements and stimulate local economies, will drift into a secondary role unless reforms are made, says a study led by Professor Robert Bennett of the London School of Economics, published today. It is the first significant independent examination of the 82 employer-led Tecs and their Scottish equivalents, Local Enterprise Companies. Tecs, and to a lesser extent Lecs, are criticised on a number of fronts including widely differing financial management. The National Audit Office is looking at the effectiveness of the Department of Employment's action to improve Tecs' financial control systems. Tecs are also criticised in the LSE report for a lack of skilled staff. Many staff are civil servants on secondment and the study recommends an immediate end to this practice, which is not due to finish until 1996. It also identifies 'fundamental deficiencies in the structure of Tecs'. The study says the government has given the councils an unclear job. The original mission for Tecs was to foster local economic growth and strengthen the UK's skills base. Yet most of the government's finance for Tecs is earmarked for training the unemployed. Tecs play only a small part in local economic development, and have few opportunities to become more involved. Others recommendations made by Prof Bennett, including the suggestion that Tecs could merge with chambers of commerce, are likely to be controversial. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, and Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, are to decide shortly whether they will approve such moves. Several Tecs would like to merge with chambers while others are strongly opposed. The proposal that the new combined Tecs and chambers should be more independent of the government, and that they should be able to receive a levy from the non-domestic rate, is likely to be politically unacceptable. Prof Bennett, who believes chambers of commerce have more legitimacy because of their local business membership and the democratic election of their councils, is an advocate of Continental-style chambers. These have substantial regulatory relationships with local employers. He said yesterday: 'The government has not given Tecs the means to achieve the grand vision.' Mr Edward Roberts, chairman of the Tec National Council, said: 'There are no quick fixes. Tecs have been set up over the past three years. We need a serious sustained effort over the next decade. Some of the issues raised by the study are being dealt with.' Local Empowerment and Business Services. Britain's Experiment with Tecs. UCL Press, Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT. Pounds 45.</p>

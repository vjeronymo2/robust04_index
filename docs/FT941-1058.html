			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Despatches: Tokyo village is fun city Apart from being the size of a small house, it looked like a white-mantled sumo wrestler, round haunches hunkered down on the pavement. It was a gigantic snowman with neon lights flashing around its head as children tumbled over its ample lap. A fine mist slid from the shoulders, for the air was not only humid but unbearably hot. For this was no Alpine mid-winter festival but a late summer street party in central Tokyo to celebrate o-bon, when the Japanese are supposed to worship their ancestors - and have a good knees-up at the same time. The snowman had spent the past few months preserved, doubtless at huge cost, in an underground freezer in the mountains. That morning, it had made the journey to Tokyo in the back of a van to advertise the ski resort where it had been made the previous winter. A few hours later, it had melted, the only trace a muddy puddle reflecting glimmers of neon. What does this tell you about Tokyo? It told me, a new arrival after four years in Paris, that certain French politicians have got it all wrong about the Japanese - or, at least, about the Tokyo-ites. On first meeting, the people of Tokyo do not resemble an army of worker ants, as one former French prime minister maintained. On the contrary, this is a capital that knows how to have fun, even in the middle of recession. A look at Tokyo's ever-changing skyline, only slightly more enduring than summer snowmen, proves that this city has a finely developed sense of the eccentric. Here, for example, are some landmarks on the drive from my flat into central Tokyo: a mock Tuscan palace (which does double duty as a wine bar and coffee centre; a two storey advertisement hoarding of a silhouetted face with electric flashing eyes; and a galleon stranded on top of an office block. If I continue to the flesh-coloured, condom-shaped building that advertises a brand of rubber, then I have gone too far. Quite a change from the Champs Elysees. This is no ant heap; far from it. In fact, Tokyo is not even a city. It is more like an agglomeration of thousands of small villages, bound together loosely by expressways. In between these, there is a hopeless maze of tiny, one-way lanes. It makes for pleasant residential living - so long as you can find the way to your flat. Some critics claim that the road system is a hidden trade barrier to keep foreigners at bay. The problem with that theory is that many of the road signs are in English (not much help), and even Tokyo taxi drivers find it seriously difficult to get around. My own guess is that the road system is an industrial policy in favour of telecommunication companies. Visitors are routinely sent faxes showing the route. Rich Tokyo-ites take a mobile telephone in the car, head in the general direction of their meeting and ring for directions once in the area. The telecom companies must make a fortune. Whatever the explanation, why change? Tokyo-ites appear to like their village life - and with reason, because Tokyo's village qualities make it what must be one of the least threatening cities in the world. The local newspapers carry little few stories about traditional big city problems such as Aids, drugs and violent crime. I am told this is because they hardly exist in Tokyo, despite the fraud and corruption surrounding national politics. In fact, some people are worried that the new government's clampdown on corruption could break up the cosy friendship between the yakuza gangster clans and the police, so tempting the yakuza to turn to drug peddling. For now, though, the yakuza stay off the front pages. Instead, an endearing debate on waste disposal has been a big running story lately. It began with a fumbled attempt by the city council to force people to put out rubbish in personally-named transparent plastic bags. The aim was to ensure that residents bagged burnable and non-burnable rubbish separately, a laudable but little-obeyed rule. This provoked an outcry on two fronts. Residents did not want to be identified individually with their empty take-away tempura boxes, while bag-makers complained that they could not switch production from black to transparent sacks in time. The city council climbed down and gave residents three months before they had to buy new sacks, showing that consensus, that vital ingredient of village life, is still alive in modern Tokyo. Of course, Tokyo has a fair sprinkling of its own brand of urban vices. An example is a distressing recent development in the Japanese fondness for vending machines (from which most necessities and some non-necessities, ranging from compact discs to fresh flowers, can be obtained). Used female underwear, sold at Y3,000 (Pounds 19) apiece, is the latest marketing trick devised by a vending machine owner in Shibuya, apparently with great initial success. That is, until the local authority clamped down after complaints from residents. Nothing in Japanese laws on public morality outlaws such trade. But that did not deter the local council. It turned, successfully, to a law which outlaws the sale of used goods without a permit. The vending machine scandal tells you another useful truth about Tokyo and, perhaps, Japan. The often criticised Japanese way of tackling problems from oblique angles can be effective. It could even be an ingredient in Japan's success.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Jan 11 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs on Tuesday  [11 January] dismissed NATO's latest warning that it might bomb  Serb positions in Bosnia to break the siege of Sarajevo and  other threatened areas as "unworkable" and a "storm in a teacup."    "We have been threatened for two years and these threats are  unworkable," General Manojlo Milovanovic, chief of staff of  Bosnian Serb forces, told AFP. "Before bombing the Serbs, they  would first have to distance them from Moslem positions," he  said, stressing the close proximity of Moslem and Serb positions  on the ground in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA meanwhile said as long as  French peacekeeping forces are in Bosnia, "we can say with  certainty that the French will not support any military  intervention" against the Serbs. "These new NATO threats of  bombing are a storm in a teacup," the agency said.    The North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Brussels on  Tuesday said the Alliance was ready to launch if necessary --  under the authority of the UN Security Council -- air strikes  against Bosnian Serbs, notably to open up the airport in Tuzla  in the northeast and to give tactical support to allow some 300  Canadians blocked for six months by Serbs in the eastern Moslem  enclave of Srebrenica to be relieved. A NATO bombing would  force the Serbs to "re-examine all concessions made to the  Moslems," Bosnian Serb strongman Radovan Karadzic had said  Monday [10 January]. The speaker of the Bosnian Serb  self-proclaimed parliament, Momcilo Krajisnik, meanwhile hailed  NATO's decision to "give priority to the negotiating process" on  Bosnia, without even bothering to comment on the new threats of  bombing.    Though NATO has on earlier occasions threatened possible air  strikes to free surrounded civilians, get through humanitarian  aid or protect UN troops, the Alliance has never carried out the  threats. On each occasion, Karadzic has reported that any  foreign bombing in Bosnian would turn each UN soldier into a  potential target for Serbian reprisal attacks. There was no  immediate reaction from Belgrade Tuesday on the NATO warnings  against its allies in Bosnia. But it was seen among Belgrade  circles as new pressure on Serbs prior to the negotiations on  Bosnia-Herzegovina due to resume on January 18 in Geneva with  the Moslems, Serbs and Croats to try to reach agreement.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tiraspol BASAPRESS, 10/6/1994 -- A meeting of the  Union of Veterans of the Afghanistan War was held yesterday in  Tiraspol. The meeting was attended by representatives of the  Afghanistan war veterans' unions of Moldova, Ukraine, and  Russia. The participants criticized the Tiraspol authorities  for leaving the veterans and the families of Afghanistan war  victims without social protection. Aleksandr Karaman, the vice  president of the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic declared at  the meeting that due to a very severe economic situation, when  internal production has fallen by 26 percent, the leadership of  Tiraspol is forced to make cuts in some social assistance  programs. Aleksandr Lebed, the commander of the 14th Russian  Army [currently stationed in Dniester], who also took the floor,  declared that the leadership of Dniester is made up of swindlers  who pretend that certain social organizations, including the  Union of Afghanistan War Veterans, are taking an active part in  the political life -- especially in the future elections to the  leadership [sentence as received]. The meeting adopted a  declaration which announces its intention to take part actively  in the political life and future elections.</p>

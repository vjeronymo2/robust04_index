			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN A MUSICAL FRENZY OVER ART  </P> <P> One reason some contemporary paintings sell for millions of dollars is that  most of the world's true art is not floating around in pricey auction galleries  but rather is permanently hung in the great museums. It is literally priceless,  is not for sale, and can't be purchased at any price.  </P> <P> Consequently, so-called New York intellectuals "with a little money" are forced  to bid on whatever is leftover -- that leaves contemporary art, which is a dime  a dozen. Its price can easily be manipulated by creative marketing, auction  scheduling, gallery showings, art dealers, etc.  </P> <P> As I recall, toward the end of his life, Spanish contemporary "artist" Jean  Miro was turning out six or seven pictures every day. How much thought or  talent goes into one of those million-dollar "works"?  </P> <P> JIM FUHRMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

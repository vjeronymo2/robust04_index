			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / MPs condemn handling of Pergau aid deal The government's handling of a Pounds 234m aid offer to Malaysia to help build the Pergau dam was yesterday condemned in a unanimous report by the most powerful of parliament's select committees. The Commons public accounts committee, whose members include Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, criticised many aspects of the government's handling of the dam deal in the three years to 1991. The report acknowledged that Sir Timothy Lankester, former permanent secretary at the Overseas Development Administration, had been right to seek a 'ministerial direction' to spend money on the project in July 1991, thereby absolving himself of blame for 'signing the cheques'. It also blamed the government for not using numerous opportunities to renegotiate the deal in 1989 and 1990. But the committee stopped short of condemning the decision by Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, to give final approval for the deal in July 1991, saying it could 'recognise the government's reasons for going ahead with the project'. Mr Hurd has repeatedly defended his decision to endorse the aid offer by arguing that cancellation would have damaged Britain's wider interests in the region. The Commons foreign affairs committee, which is also investigating the deal, may take a different view of the government's overall interests in pursuing the Pergau deal. Its report, scheduled for the early summer, will also judge the extent to which the deal was linked to a Pounds 1bn defence contract between Britain and Malaysia concluded at the same time. In its 30-page report the PAC says the ODA's two-day appraisal of the dam project in March 1989 was 'superficial and inadequate'. Giving evidence to the committee, Sir Timothy had said it was a 'lamentable slip-up' that a longer appraisal was not conducted. The appraisal was cut short because Baroness Thatcher, then Britain's prime minister, wanted to give Dr Mahathir Mohamad, her Malaysian counterpart, an assurance of funding at that time. The PAC also expresses 'astonishment' that British contractors for the project increased the overall cost from Pounds 316m to Pounds 397m two weeks after Lady Thatcher and Dr Mahathir approved the deal. This week representatives of the British contracting companies said the Pounds 316m figure had been based on vague estimates of cost. The PAC considers it was 'unacceptable' that the UK government should have continued to make the offer to the Malaysian government based on the lower figure. 'The government should have taken advantage of the lapses in the offer to reconsider details of the scheme and examine how the project could be adjusted,' the PAC says.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Abel Abraao in Kuito] </F>   [Text] UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola] rebels continue to shell Kuito intensely, using  long-range guns. The early hours of today were characterized by  powerful blasts from shells fired by long-range guns and  successive attacks by Jamba's men against positions held by  government forces. The aim is to take the martyred city of  Kuito by storm. Military sources with the Angolan Armed Forces  Bie Operational Command say there is a strong indication that  the war could intensify over the next few hours. The number of  dead is increasing alarmingly. Provisional figures for the past  24 hours say 16 people were killed and 52 wounded.</p>

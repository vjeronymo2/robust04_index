			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 30 Apr (INA) -- The paper AL-QADISIYAH has  said that the basic objective of U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's current tour is to impose U.S. decisions on the  countries he will stop in--Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Syria--and  to maintain pressure on Iraq, harm it, and continue the siege  imposed on it in an attempt to achieve what the military  aggression has failed to achieve.    In an article today under the headline "A New Chapter in the  Scheme of Conspiracy," the paper adds that the priority given to  discussions of the developments in the Arabian Gulf stems from  heightened U.S. interest in the situation in this region and  because Iraq has held fast in defiance of the forces of evil,  conspiracy, and aggression, rebuilding all the pillars of  advancement that the evil ones destroyed.    The paper says that recent international changes,  particularly on the part of three permanent UN Security Council  members, provide strong evidence that Iraq has an important  regional and pan-Arab role, that it is part of the real world,  and that it must be respected and dealt with seriously. It is  useless for the United States and Britain to continue to ignore  history and geography or to continue the imposition of the  blockade against the steadfast Iraqi people.</p>

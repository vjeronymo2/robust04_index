			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / International Company News: DAF expects losses to continue DAF, the Dutch truck-maker, made another 'very considerable' loss last year and will incur further losses in the first half of 1992, the company warned. However, the start of recovery in some key markets and structural cost reductions should combine to achieve a 'significant improvement' in DAF's financial performance for 1992 as a whole, said Mr Aart van der Padt, chairman. Accelerated job losses and intensified restructuring measures, against the background of a severe slump in the UK and other key truck markets, required increased financial provisions, he said. As a consequence, it was too early to indicate the precise extent of the 1991 losses. DAF, in which British Aerospace has a 16 per cent stake, plunged into a net loss of Fl 179.1m (Dollars 102.9m) in the first six months of the year, from a loss of Fl 32.1m in the corresponding 1990 period. It has had to raise Fl 250m in new equity to strengthen its balance sheet. The slump in European truck sales - with the notable exception of Germany - has changed its fortunes with bewildering rapidity. DAF's net loss for 1990 reached Fl 227.6m, including restructuring costs of Fl 78m, and it failed to pay a dividend. Yet in 1989 it had made a record net profit of Fl 172m. At the operating level, the second-half performance was improved compared with the first half and the corresponding period of 1990. It was only in December, however, that DAF made good its half-year forecast of reaching break-even point in the final quarter. The stringent rationalisation and productivity measures being taken throughout the company mean that DAF will have shed some 4,600 jobs worldwide by 1993.</p>

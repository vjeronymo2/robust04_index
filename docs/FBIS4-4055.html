			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, April 26 (XINHUA) -- In an effort to further  tighten the management of foreign investment assets, China will  enact new methods of their appraisal and management from May 1,  according to a national conference held recently in Wuhan,  capital of central China's Hubei Province.    The methods were jointly stipulated by the State  Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export  Commodities and the Ministry of Finance.    In recent years, foreign investment in China has risen  rapidly. By the end of 1993, China had approved 170,000  foreign-funded enterprises, involving 210 billion U.S. dollars  in contracted foreign funds, 60 billion U.S. dollars of which  were finally put to use. Eighty percent of the investment was  in the form of machines and equipment and margins existed  between their value and evaluation.    In 1993, the State Administration for the Inspection of  Import and Export Commodities re-evaluated 2,121 cases of  foreign investment assets, claimed by owners to be worth more  than 965 million U.S. dollars, and found that they were worth  slightly over 800 million U.S. dollars.    The appraisals to be adopted will cover variety, quality,  quantity, value and losses. Appraisals of variety, quality and  quantity will cover the assets' names, types, quality, quantity,  size, trademark, rate of obsolescence, date of production,  nation of origin and manufacturer. Value appraisal will cover  the contemporary evaluation of foreign investment assets and  loss appraisal will cover the reasons and degrees of losses  caused by natural disasters and accidents, cost of clearing up  losses and remaining value of the assets.    The State Administration for the Inspection of Import and  Export Commodities will take charge of the nationwide appraisal  of foreign investment assets and its local bureaus will take  care of the local appraisal work.    To deal with the examination of foreign investment assets,  an  accounting office must hold a value appraisal certificate of the  State Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export  Commodities or other relevant organizations, the "methods" said.</p>

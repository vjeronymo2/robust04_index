			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ATTORNEYS IN CAMARENA CASE TRADE CHARGES OF DISTORTION IN CLOSING ARGUMENTS  </P> <P> U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents seeking "vengeance" for the murder  of fellow agent Enrique Camarena used overly zealous tactics in pursuing his  killers and ensnared innocent men, defense lawyers charged in closing arguments  Friday.  </P> <P> "The righteous desire for vengeance does not justify twisting the evidence and  convicting by innuendo," said lawyer Mary Kelly, who represents Juan Jose  Bernabe Ramirez. Bernabe, who faces life in prison if convicted, is one of four  men on trial in federal court for their alleged involvement in Camarena's 1985  slaying.  </P> <P> In his rebuttal argument, Assistant U.S. Atty. Manuel A. Medrano accused  defense lawyers of distorting the evidence in the case and trying to create "a  smoke screen" by their charges against DEA agents.  </P> <P> "The conduct of DEA agents in this case always has been aboveboard," Medrano  declared. At another point, the prosecutor said "the DEA agents want the  truth."  </P> <P> After three days of closing arguments, which ended Friday afternoon, U.S.  District Judge Edward Rafeedie told the six-man, six-woman jury that he would  give them formal instructions Monday morning and then begin their  deliberations.  </P> <P> Earlier Friday, Kelly told the jurors that the government had neglected to tell  them that Bernabe had responded "No, no," when an undercover DEA agent posing  as a drug dealer had asked her client if he was present when Camarena was  interrogated and tortured at a Guadalajara house in February, 1985.  </P> <P> She played an enhanced version of the tape and used a slide projector to show  the transcript on a courtroom wall.  </P> <P> Referring to Operation Leyenda, the special DEA unit that has been  investigating Camarena's murder for five years, she told jurors: "I'm not  saying they are bad people, but they see with Leyenda eyes and they hear with  Leyenda ears."  </P> <P> She and her co-counsel, Michael Meza, had an uphill battle. Bernabe, a one-time  bodyguard for Mexican drug kingpin Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, who is now  imprisoned in Mexico for his role in Camarena's murder, boasted on secretly  made videotapes that he had been at the house where Camarena was tortured and  that he had helped Mexican drug kingpin Rafael Caro Quintero escape from the  Guadalajara airport after Camarena was murdered.  </P> <P> Meza tried to explain this away by saying his client hadn't really been at  either place and fabricated this story in an attempt to con someone into paying  him $10,000 for information he didn't really have.  </P> <P> Medrano urged the jurors to review all the tape transcripts, saying that such a  review would show that Bernabe was at the house and the airport and was guilty.  He reminded the jurors there also had been eyewitness testimony that Bernabe  helped Caro escape.  </P> <P> The prosecutor attacked the closing argument delivered Thursday by Edward  Medvene, the attorney for defendant Ruben Zuno Arce.  </P> <P> Referring to 38 charts that Medvene had utilized in court in an attempt to  demonstrate that his client was innocent, Medrano characterized the move as  "one of the most overwhelming dog-and-pony shows I have ever seen in a  courtroom."  </P> <P> Martin R. Stolar, an attorney for defendant Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, also  attempted to persuade the jurors that DEA agents in their hunger for  convictions had utilized a dubious operative who should have been indicted for  Camarena's murder rather than being put on the federal payroll.  </P> <P> He asserted that Antonio Garate Bustamante, a former commander with the  Guadalajara riot police, should have been indicted because he participated in a  December, 1984, meeting where plans to kill Camarena were discussed, according  to a prosecution witness. Instead, Stolar said, Garate became "a government  witness factory" and produced three key government witnesses in the trial, all  of whom Stolar said were untrustworthy.  </P> <P> Prosecutor Medrano said Stolar had mischaracterized the testimony about the  December, 1984, meeting and steadfastly maintained that the three witnesses  were reliable and had held up on cross-examination.  </P> <P> He acknowledged that the government had relocated the three witnesses and their  families from Mexico to the United States. He said this had to be done because  if any of the three men returned to Mexico, they would be killed.  </P> <P> Medrano also contended that the funds spent by the DEA on the case were paltry  compared to the billions in profits raked in by drug traffickers.  </P> <P> Medrano referred to Matta and Zuno as "the Lee Iacoccas of their (drug)  corporation." And he concluded his argument by quoting William Shakespeare on  the subject of cowards.  </P> <P> In turn, Kelly, a veteran criminal defense lawyer, described a scene from the  1957 movie "Twelve Angry Men" in trying to hammer home to the jurors the  meaning of the presumption of innocence. In the film, all the jurors except  one, played by Henry Fonda, start their deliberations thinking the defendant is  guilty.  </P> <P> At one point, an exasperated juror turns to Fonda and asks, "Why are you  convinced he's innocent?" Kelly told the jury that Fonda responded: "I'm not  convinced he's innocent; I'm just not convinced he's guilty." And she reminded  the jurors that the government had to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt  to secure a conviction.  </P></p>

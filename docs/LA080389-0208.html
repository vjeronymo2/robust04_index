			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> RELEASE OF AIR CRASH TAPES OPPOSED  </P> <P> The National Transportation Safety Board voted today to oppose the public  broadcast of airline cockpit voice recordings after crashes and indicated that  it will support legislation to keep the tapes secret.  </P> <P> The board said it was in the interest of safety to keep the tapes confidential  and not made available for what one member called "the lurid entertainment of  the public."  </P> <P> The five-member board voted unanimously to support the position of the Federal  Aviation Administration and the Air Line Pilots Assn. in deploring the  court-ordered release of a recording from a Delta Air Lines plane that crashed  in Dallas a year ago. That tape captured the voices of crew members joking  about politics and airliner accidents and also screaming just before the crash.  </P></p>

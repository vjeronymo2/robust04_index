			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / International Company News: NBH warns of downturn North Broken Hill Peko, the Australian resources group, has warned shareholders that it expected a fall in profits in the current year, due to lower iron ore prices and the absence of any early improvement in the uranium market, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. Mr Michael Deeley, NBH Peko chairman, told the company's annual meeting that the Northparkes mine would not start copper production until 1995-6. Meanwhile, he said, exploration expenditure would be rising. He conceded that group sales would strengthen generally as economic growth picked up in the industrialised world, but said that the group expected operating profits to be 'slightly below' those of 1993-4. 'We do not expect significant abnormal profits to arise during the year,' he added. In the year to end-June, North Broken Hill Peko made an operating profit after tax of ADollars 185.3m, (USDollars 136.2m) which included net abnormal profits of ADollars 65.2m.</p>

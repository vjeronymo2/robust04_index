			<p>Language: <F P=105>Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Our sources in Iraqi Kurdistan have obtained  reliable information, affirming that Saddam's criminal son  'Udayy is imposing his control on all sources of local and  foreign trade in Iraq through a network of merchants directly  connected to intelligence organs.    In the past few months, the number of merchants who could  deal in the Jordanian markets was specified. The list contained  merchants known for their links with Saddam's intelligence  organs and 'Udayy himself. The reports add that a large number  of wholesalers who supply the Iraqi market with food, clothing,  and other consumer goods were excluded and replaced by others  who are closely linked to the ruling family.    In another development, the money-changing market in Baghdad  was recently the scene of a large-scale arrest campaign. The  campaign was launched by the security agencies at 'Udayy's  orders. A total of 15 money changers were executed. This led  to an increase in the hard currency rates against the Iraqi  dinar.</p>

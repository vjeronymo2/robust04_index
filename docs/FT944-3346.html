			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Biotech sector urged to seek partners Biotechnology companies should abandon hope of becoming large pharmaceuticals companies and concentrate on becoming niche players with links to big partners, a Financial Times conference on biotechnology heard yesterday, writes Daniel Green. The sector had been through a difficult year in terms of investment said Mr Frank Baldino, chief executive of US biotechnology company Cephalon. This was because the successes of companies such as Amgen and Genentech had not been repeated since the early 1990s. He said each biotechnological advance added to the risks and newer companies therefore faced greater risks than their predecessors. 'Biotechnology companies should define themselves not on a technology but on a corporate and marketing strategy and therefore companies should spread the risk at the research stage,' he said. Mr Peter Fellner, chief executive of UK biotechnology company Celltech, warned delegates in London that 'equity capital (alone) cannot fund the industry'. 'Most biotechnology companies,' he said, 'would need marriages of convenience' with pharmaceuticals industry partners. The loss of potential profits when biotech companies dealt with pharmaceuticals companies could be minimised through 'many devices', such as giving rights in some geographic areas but retaining rights elsewhere, he said. His company has a series of partnerships with pharmaceuticals companies but 'retains 25 per cent to 45 per cent on the net profit'. Large pharmaceuticals companies could benefit too from such partnerships, said Mr John Keller, associate director, technology evaluation at SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals. He said that the pharmaceuticals industry was being hurt by downward pressure on prices from customers in government and the private sector, and the expiry of patents on many of its best-selling drugs. The industry's response included mergers with rivals, buying over-the-counter (non-prescription) medicines businesses, and signing deals with biotechnology companies whose research expertise supplemented the pharmaceuticals companies' own development pipelines.</p>

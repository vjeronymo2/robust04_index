			<p>BFN     [Text] UN officials say Rwanda's rump government has moved  to the northwestern town of Gisenyi, the Hutu ethnic heartland,  and will move on as far as it can go to escape advancing rebels.  The UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda military spokesman Major  General Jean-Guy Plante, told reporters in Kigali that the  president and some ministers went three or four days ago.  Gisenyi is the birthplace of the late President Juvenal  Habyarimana whose death in a rocket attack on his plane on 6  April sparked mass killings of Tutsis and the resumed civil war.  Maj. Plante said government officials had said they would stay  in Gisenyi for a week but it is not clear where they could go  after that. Many top Army officers, including the Presidential  Guard, come from Gisenyi.    [Bukavu Voix du Zaire in French at 1630 GMT on 12 June in a  related report adds: "The Rwandan Patriotic Front has now  managed to open another front to the southwest of the town of  Gitarama."]</p>

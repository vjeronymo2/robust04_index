			<p>BFN     [Text] Yasir 'Arafat has officially asked the Jordanian  Government to allow hundreds of his supporters to escort him in  a festive march on the day he visits Jericho. According to  Palestinian sources, the visit will take place on 7 June, the  day on which the West Bank was occupied in 1967. Interviewed by  IDF Radio this morning, Knesset Member [MK] Hanan Porat of the  National Religious Party said he would welcome any attempt to  assassinate 'Arafat when he visits Jericho. Porat was  interviewed by our correspondent Itay Engel.    [Begin recording] [Engel] Hanan Porat, would you not like  to meet Yasir 'Arafat?    [Porat] No, absolutely not. I would not like to meet him.  I do not think he is a partner or interlocutor of Israel. He  is a man of terror whose hands are tainted with blood. A man  who continues to talk about a jihad for Jerusalem is not my  interlocutor. I am prepared to meet him only looking down the  barrel of a gun.    [Engel] Should I infer from your remarks that if a gun sight  were aimed at this man when he arrives in Jericho, you would  find it acceptable and would even encourage it?    [Porat] I would congratulate anybody who does it, and I am  saying this with the utmost resolve. You know, sometimes we  tend to behave like doormats. If you ask me, however, what is  the proper and deserving thing to do to this man called Yasir  'Arafat, he deserves a bullet in the head. [end recording]</p>

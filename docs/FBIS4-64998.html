			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Beppe Severgnini: "How They Will See Us in </F> America"]    [Text] Over the last few months there has been much  discussion as to how the world would react to "a Berlusconi  government." However, the assessments often revealed what the  English call wishful thinking. To all effects and purposes,  many confused their own hopes with reality: The supporters of  the "new Right" gave assurances that the government would be  welcomed everywhere, while those who had no liking for it  forecast years of embarrassment and ostracism for Italy.    Now that the Berlusconi government is no longer a mere  hypothesis, the question arises once again. How will the new  Italian government be received abroad, and in the United States  in particular? The following are five scenarios, unencumbered  by wishful thinking.    Number one: Deprived of the compass offered by the Cold War,  the United States is steering by the stars; it is still in  search of a foreign policy, and it has serious and urgent  problems (Bosnia, Korea, Haiti) to face. Italy, whoever is at  the helm, is not a problem. Whatever we like to think, the  Clinton Administration will devote relatively little attention  and limited time to our country. The Ukraine, as of now, is  much more worrying (and therefore more important) than we are.    Number two: A number of Italian intellectuals, and some of  their American counterparts, maintain that Silvio Berlusconi's  unusual position (prime minister-publisher-industrialist) will  have a detrimental effect on our country. They say that the  United States leadership, which has always been sensitive to  conflicting interests, regards Italy as democratically sloppy  and vaguely unpresentable. Unfortunately, or fortunately  (depending on one's point of view), this is not how things  stand. The U.S. Administration is aware of the "Berlusconi  issue," but will regard it is an internal matter as long as it  does not reflect on the stability of the country. To put it in  a nutshell, it is our own business.    Number three: After complaining for decades that Italian  foreign policy was so cautious that it bordered on indolence,  the Americans will discover that the new government intends to  take action. Some of its initiatives will be welcomed, whereas  others have to date been feared (everything with a bearing on  our eastern border, for example, is studied with great  attention). Anything may be expected, even that Washington ends  up by regretting the passing of Christian-Democratic inertia.    Number four: While the American Administration will pay  attention to matters of substance (and expediency), the press  and television will be seeking stories and headlines. The  National Alliance's entry into the government will give them  plenty of these: Fascism and postfascism are immortal topics for  a public that knows little about Europe and learned what little  it knows 50 years ago. The President's two visits to Italy (in  June, for the commemoration of the liberation, and in July, for  the G-7 summit in Naples) will do the rest. Only if the  American public were to become alarmed would Bill Clinton, after  duly consulting his opinion poll experts, pretend to be worried.    Fifth and final scenario: Silvio Berlusconi will enjoy  considerable personal success. More in some countries than in  others. The British may smile a lot before judging him on  performance, but the Americans will think they are dreaming: An  Italian politician who talks straight and smiles a lot (facing  the right television camera) is an unprecedented novelty.  However, the new prime minister must avoid making one mistake:  displaying excessive enthusiasm once he is standing in front of  the White House. They have seen a lot of enthusiastic Italians  walk across the lawn there, and they have learned not to take  them very seriously.</p>

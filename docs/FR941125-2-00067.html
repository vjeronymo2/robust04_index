			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There were several comments that Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 has revised the public participation requirements in Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program. Under 40 CFR 233.16(d)(3), changes in public participation requirements must be considered to be substantial changes. These commenters, therefore, believe that Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 has effected a substantial revision in Michigan's wetland program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public participation requirements for state Section 404 wetland programs are set forth at 40 CFR 233.32&hyph;34. These provisions contain specific requirements regarding the need for, timing of, information contained in, method of providing, and persons to be provided public notice of permit applications, draft general permits and consideration of major permit modifications (40 CFR 233.32); the need for and method of conducting public hearings (40 CFR 233.33); and the manner in which public comments must be considered and included in the official record in making permit determinations (40 CFR 233.34). Michigan, in its October 26, 1983 program description, demonstrated that the MDNR had authority to comply with all of the above requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described above, MDNR is still the authority responsible for processing and making determinations regarding wetland permit applications in Michigan. None of the public participation requirements that were applicable to MDNR in processing and making determinations regarding wetland permit applications have changed as a result of Executive Order 1991&hyph;31. Therefore, EPA did not receive any comments that suggested that the public participation requirements applicable to MDNR in the processing and issuance of wetland permits had been changed or were in any way not in compliance with the requirements of the Clean Water Act and the public participation requirements of 40 CFR 233.32&hyph;34. Instead, the comments on public participation focussed on three other issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, one commenter stated that public participation in the development of administrative rules implementing Michigan's wetlands program has changed in that the Director of the MDNR now establishes the administrative rules by which the program is administered rather than the Michigan Natural Resources Commission (``MNRC''). This commenter stated that the Director of MDNR, unlike MNRC, is not subject to Michigan's Open Meetings Act and therefore the Director can make final decisions on administrative rules pertaining to the wetlands program in closed meetings and the substance of those meetings need not be recorded. The commenter suggested that this represents a significant change from the way in which MNRC developed administrative rules for Michigan's wetlands program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA does not agree that this apparent change in the manner in which administrative rules are developed represents a change in Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program. A state's federally authorized Section 404 wetlands program consists of the statutes and rules which govern the state's program. EPA has no role to play in overseeing or dictating how those statutes and rules are developed. Instead, EPA's role is to determine whether the statutes and rules which comprise the program comply with minimum federal requirements for authorized programs, regardless of how the state has developed those statutes and rules. If the state desires to change those statutes or rules, EPA has no role in determining the manner in which those statutes or rules are changed, so long as the state submits the proposed changes to EPA for review. Consequently, the applicability or inapplicability of the State's Open Meetings Act to changes in administrative rules does not represent a change in Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second reason suggested by commenters that Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 effected a change in public participation requirements pertains to changes involving the manner in which Michigan ``assure[s] that any state *&blank;*&blank;* whose waters may be affected by the issuance of a permit may submit written recommendation to the permitting state'' and ``assures continued coordination with Federal and Federal-State water related planning and review processes'' as required by Sections 404(h)(1)(E) &amp; (H) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C.&sect;1344(h)(1)(E) &amp; (H). In Michigan's original program description submitted to EPA on October 26, 1983, Michigan stated that it could assure such coordination because ``[t]he broad powers that were statutorily allotted to Michigan's Water Resource Commission [``MWRC''] are more than sufficient'' to provide such assurances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters noted that Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 abolished MWRC and transferred its responsibilities and authorities to the Director of MDNR. These commenters claimed that MWRC was subject to the Open Meetings Act while the Director of MDNR is not. Consequently, these commenters suggest, there has been a change in the opportunities for public participation in the ``Federal and Federal-State water related planning and review processes.'' These commenters go on to suggest that, because Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program must assure coordination with these planning processes, a change in the public's opportunity to participate in those planning and review processes constitutes a change in the wetlands program's public participation provisions. EPA does not agree that changes in Federal and Federal-State planning and review processes in the State of Michigan are changes in Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

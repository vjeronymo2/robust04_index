			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Import regulations issued under the Act are based on those established under Federal marketing orders. Thus, they also have small entity orientation, and impact both small and large business entities in a manner comparable to rules issued under such marketing orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 20 handlers of dried prunes produced in California subject to regulation under the marketing order, and approximately 1,360 producers in the regulated area. In addition, at least two importers of dried prunes are subject to import regulations and will be affected by this action. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of handlers and producers of California dried prunes may be classified as small entities. The majority of the importers of dried prunes may also be classified as small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule revises &sect;993.601 of Subpart_Grade Regulations and is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Committee and other available information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraphs (a) and (b) of &sect;993.49 of the marketing order provide the Secretary the authority to modify the minimum standards for natural condition prunes received from producers and dehydrators (inbound inspection). Likewise, paragraphs (a) and (b) of &sect;993.50 provide the Secretary authority for the modification of the minimum standards for prunes that are shipped or otherwise disposed of by a handler (outbound inspection). Whenever a regulation is established that increases grade requirements, it normally applies to both natural condition (unprocessed) prunes and processed (cleaned or treated with water or steam) prunes. Minimum grade standards are specified under &sect;993.97 and have been modified in the rules and regulations under &sect;&sect;993.149 and 993.150. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under current procedures for handling and scoring (inspecting) prunes, clusters of brown rot affected prunes are removed from inbound samples during the initial grading process and are not scored against the lot. However, single prunes affected with brown rot are often not removed during initial grading and are subsequently scored as defective during inspection. For both incoming and outgoing prune inspections, the combined defect allowance, which includes mold, imbedded dirt, insect infestation and decay, cannot exceed 5 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There has been a high incidence of brown rot infection in the 1992 and 1993 California prune crops. Brown rot is caused by two closely related fungi in the blossoms and fruit of prunes and other stone fruits. Success of treatment varies, making control of brown rot very difficult. Previously infected orchards are more susceptible to re-infection, and, thus, a reoccurrence of brown rot in the 1994 prune crop is expected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Harvested prunes affected by brown rot cannot be marketed as prunes and, thus, have no value to handlers, since even blending them with good prunes for the manufacture of prune products, such as prune juice and concentrate, yields an unacceptable flavor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the expected high incidence of prunes affected by brown rot in the 1994 crop, the Committee met on December 8, 1993, and unanimously recommended establishing a separate defect tolerance of 3 percent for brown rot to be included in the current 5 percent combined defects tolerance for mold, imbedded dirt, insect infestation and decay. Finally, the Committee recommended that the new tolerance be applied to both inbound and outbound inspections. This rule will have the effect of lowering the brown rot tolerance from the current maximum of 5 percent (assuming no other defects) to a maximum of 3 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee believes the addition of specific brown rot tolerances will encourage growers to improve their cultural practices to reduce the incidence of brown rot in their 1994 crops. In addition, notification of the new requirements early in the growing season would provide growers with sufficient time to implement cultural practices that should reduce the incidence of brown rot in their prunes. The California prune industry will benefit through increased sales, which is expected to improve growers' returns. Handlers will benefit by paying for fewer prunes that have no value and by lowering their sorting costs. Finally, this rule will result in a consistently higher quality product being shipped, which will benefit consumers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This tolerance also applies to imported prunes. Section 8e of the Act requires that whenever grade, size, quality or maturity requirements are in effect for dried prunes under a domestic marketing order, imported dried prunes must meet the same or comparable requirements. Because this final rule establishes an additional tolerance for dried prunes under the domestic handling regulation, a corresponding change to the import prune regulation [7 CFR part 999.200] is also included in this rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee recommended that this rule become effective by early July 1994, to ensure that implementation be in place by the beginning of the 1994&hyph;95 crop year, which begins August 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule concerning this action was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 18, 1994, [59 FR 25841]. Comments on the proposed rule were invited from interested persons until June 17, 1994. No comments were received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all available information, it is found that the action, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the United States Trade Representative has concurred with the issuance of this final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  because: (1) This action was unanimously recommended by the Committee; (2) the 1994&hyph;95 crop year begins August 1, 1994, and this rule should be effective promptly to cover as many of the 1994&hyph;95 season prunes as possible; and (3) the proposed rule provided a 30-day comment period and no comments were received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

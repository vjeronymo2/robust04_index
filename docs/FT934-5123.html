			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Economy expected to show gradual recovery - Forecasts for next year A picture of an economy picking up steam slowly but perhaps unevenly next year was painted by the government yesterday in forecasts accompanying the Budget statement. The forecasts also suggested a slight rise next year in inflation, chiefly caused by tax rises, and a significantly lower public sector borrowing requirement. The government also predicted that the current account deficit will be more comfortably under control than had been envisaged in its previous forecasts issued in March. Inflation was seen as remaining subdued, however. The retail price index - excluding mortgage interest payments - was forecast to rise from 3 per cent this year to 3 1/4 per cent next. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, predicted 1994 growth of 2 1/2 per cent - at the bottom of the range expected by most private forecasters  - after an expected growth rate this year of 1 3/4 per cent. This year's growth has been faster than the 1 1/4 per cent forecast by the Treasury in March. Excluding expanding oil output from the North Sea, 1994 growth was forecast at 2 1/4 per cent. The economy has grown steadily - by 2 1/2 per cent - in six successive quarters since the trough of the recession that the Treasury now says occurred in the first quarter of 1992. That was, Mr Clarke noted, well before sterling's departure from the Exchange Rate Mechanism in September last year. However, this picture of steady recovery might change. 'While the recovery so far has been remarkably smooth, it would not be surprising if the profile of output were more uneven from now on,' the Treasury said in the Red Book which goes with the Budget. Next year, as in this, consumers will continue to play a key role in the continuation of economic expansion. Consumer spending should expand 2 1/4 per cent in the coming year, after its expected 2 per cent growth this. Government consumption - flat this year - should grow by 1 per cent, while investment is predicted to grow by 3 per cent next year after its sluggish expansion this year of  1/2 per cent. Robust export growth - 5 3/4 per cent against 4 per cent this year - is also foreseen in 1994, while the pace of import expansion should pick up to 5 1/4 per cent compared with 2 per cent. The Treasury left unchanged its estimate for the normally-volatile public sector borrowing requirement for the current financial year at the Pounds 50bn forecast in March. However, there was a marked drop forecast in the PSBR for 1994-5: as a result of Budget measures and the economic recovery, it is seen as likely to fall to Pounds 38bn in 1994-95. Many economists in the City of London viewed Mr Clarke as having credibly paved the way for a significant drop in government borrowing while managing to avoid puncturing a fragile economic recovery. Mr Neil Mackinnon, of Citibank, said the tax increases proposed in the budget 'can be absorbed by the economy without undermining the sustainability of the recovery'. Inflation also looked encouraging, given that there was no extension of the scope of value added tax. Others, however, saw the budget as implying a significant tightening of fiscal policy, which suggested the government was too sanguine about growth prospects - unless further interest rate cuts were on the way. Mr James Barty, chief UK economist at Morgan Grenfell, cut his forecast for 1994 growth to 2 per cent, saying that yesterday's budget and the previous one in March had together 'designed a headwind for the UK economy'. That would be surmounted only by further cuts in interest rates and a competitive exchange rate. Mr Roger Bootle, economist with Midland Global Markets, concurred that 'the Bank of England might want another half per cent cut in interest rates . . . soon.' The government forecasts show the Treasury was unduly pessimistic in March in predicting a current account deficit of Pounds 17 1/2 bn for the current year and of Pounds 18 1/2 bn (annualised) for the first half of 1994. The deficit for 1992 was revised down to Pounds 8bn (from the Pounds 12bn in March). 'Despite a fallback in the invisible surplus and stronger growth in the UK than in Continental Europe, our main export market, the current account deficit is expected to increase only slightly in 1993. It is forecast to be Pounds 9 1/2 bn in both 1993 and 1994.' The numbers may also have been influenced by a newly-introduced system of recording trade with the European Union. The Budget measures included spending cuts for the coming year of more than Pounds 3 1/2 bn, Mr Clarke said. Mr John Shepperd, UK economist at Yamaichi, the Japanese investment bank, described the Pounds 3.6bn cut as a 'rabbit out of the hat but one has to ask whether it is achievable.' Mr Richard Jeffrey, head of research at Charterhouse Tilney, said the spending reductions were credible in that 'government expenditure is more cyclical than had been allowed for in March.' For example, unemployment had fallen faster than expected. The Treasury said the recovery so far has been accompanied by a labour productivity performance 'which was abnormally strong for a cyclical downturn, perhaps reflecting the effects of labour market reforms.' While the recent drop in unemployment was associated with slowing productivity growth, non-oil productivity was still 3 3/4 per cent up on a year earlier, and manufacturing productivity in the third quarter was 5 per cent up. 'As the recovery becomes more established, annual productivity growth could fall further from its recent high rates,' the Treasury said. The Chancellor outlined two main risks to what he described as encouraging prospects for 1994. The first was continuing weakness of world economic activity, particularly in Europe. 'What manufacturing industry needs most is a pick up of activity in the rest of Europe', he said. The second major risk was the public finances. 'The overriding need is to place the public finances on a sound footing. That is the immediate task of the government and the main theme of my Budget today,' he said. The government forecasts assume oil prices are assumed to average Dollars 17 a barrel.</p>

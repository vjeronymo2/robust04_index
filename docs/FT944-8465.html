			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Anyone for a nervous breakdown? - Wall Street / After this week's events, Patrick Harverson finds that something soothing is needed Thomas Gallagher, the head of trading at New York broking firm Oppenheimer, puts it succinctly: 'It's absolutely crazy. This market needs some Prozac.' As an assessment of Tuesday's events on Wall Street, this was not an especially helpful comment. But as a vivid description of stock market sentiment, it hit the nail firmly on the head. Judging by the response of share prices to the latest interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve, the market does indeed seem close to a nervous breakdown. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 20 points immediately after the rise was announced, then fell 40 before ending the session flat, only to jump almost 19 the day after but fall 16 the day after that. A prescription to calm everyone's nerves might not be such a bad idea at that. This was certainly the kind of week designed to test nerves to the limit. Trading on Monday was dominated by the expectation that the Fed would announce a tightening of monetary policy after the Tuesday meeting of its open market committee. The solid gains in share prices on Monday reflected confidence that the rate rise would be well-received by the bond market and would probably be the last increase for at least this year, if not longer. Tuesday dawned sunny and bright but investors' confident mood did not last long because, when the Fed announced its rate increase early in the afternoon, it managed to catch the market on the wrong foot. It announced a larger-than-expected three-quarters of a percentage point increase in two key short-term interest rates: the federal funds rate and the discount rate, which moved from 4 3/4 per cent to 5 1/2 per cent and 4 per cent to 4 3/4 per cent, respectively. The initial reaction from both stock and bond market was positive; the Fed was seen to be taking tough pre-emptive action against inflation, and that was good news. But it was not long before doubts began to set in. Had the Fed moved too aggressively? Would the largest increase in the discount rate since 1981, coming on the heels of five earlier rate increases, slow down the economy too much? And was this really likely to be the last tightening for some time? The former question haunted the stock market which knows that, at some stage in the next 12 months, the string of rate increases this year will begin to take their toll on economic activity and corporate earnings. Amid a deteriorating interest rate environment, the only support propping up share prices this year has been earnings growth. Remove that earnings growth from the picture and the market suddenly looks exposed. The latter question troubled investors in bonds, who know that the severe bear market in government securities will not end until the cycle of Fed tightenings has peaked. Few investors will want to buy bonds if they believe that more rate increases are on the horizon - and the Fed conspicuously declined this week to comment on the outlook for monetary policy. (By contrast, when the Fed last raised rates in August, it hinted that its policy was approaching a neutral position that would preclude the need for further tightening. The subsequent unexpected strengthening of the economy quickly made that judgment redundant and, ultimately, prompted this week's move). Although the mood on Wall Street had calmed down by Wednesday, aided by some encouraging news on inflation (consumer prices up just 0.1 per cent in October), Thursday's declines proved that the stock market remained vulnerable. They also showed that stocks are still hitched to a bond market bandwagon which continues to roll down the hill. The rosy scenario being discussed before the Fed tightened this week was that a sixth and final rate increase would finally bring peace to the beleaguered bond market, ushering in a new era of stable bond prices. This would allow a much-needed decoupling of stocks and bonds, leaving share prices free to pursue their own course. There was even talk of a year-end stock market rally that would return the Dow to the highs it enjoyed earlier in the year. The roses, however, suddenly do not smell quite so good. The bond market - fearful that the Fed will raise interest rates again soon, possibly before or at its next open market committee meeting on January 31 - shows no sign of breaking out of its slump and share prices are unlikely to go anywhere while bonds remain depressed. The Dow now seems trapped in the 3,800 to 3,900 range where it has been trading since mid-August - a depressing prospect for those who thought, optimistically, that this week would herald the dawn of a new phase for the stock market. Gallagher was right: break out the Prozac.  ---------------------------------------------- DOW JONES IND AVERAGE  ---------------------------------------------- Monday            3,829.73      +28.26 Tuesday           3,826.36       -3.37 Wednesday         3.845.20      +18.84 Thursday          3,828.05      -17.15 Friday            3,815.26      -12.79  ----------------------------------------------</p>

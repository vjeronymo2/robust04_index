			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Technology: Worth its weight in gold - A 'fingerprint' test for substances is beating fraudsters, thieves, and money launderers They jumped for joy in Kalgoorlie, centre of the new Western Australian gold rush, when owners of the Karpa Spring mine announced that test results showed its ore contained nearly 10 times more gold than usual for mines in the state. Joy soon turned to shock when the fraud squad was called in. Karpa Spring had been sold and drilling by the new owners, Noranda, Canada's biggest natural resources group, and a small Australian company, Perilya, showed the mine had scarcely any gold. Three people eventually appeared in court. Some vital evidence for the successful prosecution case was provided by John Watling. His analysis showed that the first sample from Karpa Spring - with the high gold content  -contained gold from two sources. One must have been added artificially. 'Salting' a gold mine, by adding precious metal from elsewhere, is a confidence trick as old as the industry itself. But it will be much more difficult to avoid detection from now on, thanks to Watling and his colleague, Hugh Herbert, scientists at the Western Australian Department of Minerals and Energy's Chemistry Centre in Perth. They have developed an analytical process that gives every mine a unique 'fingerprint'. Its basis is the fact that each of the earth's geological regions has unique characteristics in terms of the minerals present and the pattern of their association with other minerals. Gold from a particular region, sometimes even from a particular mine, has its own identity. And, as with human fingerprints, the technique can be used in a courtroom to show a jury patterns on a sheet of paper to compare one gold sample with another. This technological breakthrough affects not just salters of mines and gold thieves: it will make life much more difficult for fraudsters and drug barons too. Watling hopes that the work will result in much of the world's gold being fingerprinted so that its origins can be pinpointed with certainty. It will cease to be an untraceable international currency. This could, for example, make laundering illegal drug receipts more difficult. One way in which illegal drug rings move their money into the banking system is to buy exhausted gold mines. Stolen gold is bought with the illicit cash and mixed with dirt and possibly some metal. The metal goes to a local refinery, which has no way of knowing it is not newly-mined gold. When it leaves the refinery, it has become 'legal.' Watling, a British geologist and geo-chemist, first successfully put his theory to the test in 1975 when four tonnes of gold were found at Heathrow airport in London, disguised as a consignment of lead. Watling was working in Johannesburg at the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. He showed that the gold came from a mine near Welkom in South Africa and the owner, Anglo American Corporation, eventually got back its precious metal. It is only recently that he and Herbert perfected the technique, using an ADollars 600,000 (USDollars 425,000) laser ablation, inductively coupled, plasma spectrometer. Only a tiny trace of gold is required. The sample is cut by a laser linked with the spectrometer which identifies the trace elements present. Today, defence lawyers in Western Australia no longer question the validity of the technique. Watling and Herbert have been asked to give evidence in 20 gold theft and fraud cases in the past two years, but most defendants changed their pleas to guilty once the scientists showed their evidence. Twenty gold-producing countries around the world have asked Watling to carry out work for them. The technique can be applied in many other ways. Cannabis can be traced to where it was grown through the nutrients in the water and fertiliser - the plant's 'signature' is determined by what has sustained it. Also, where routine blood testing of employees has to be carried out at mines or process plants for such substances as lead, cadmium, mercury and arsenic, the technique could be used by a nurse who would take only 20 microlitres of blood (a pinprick) instead of the 10 millilitres usually needed. Watling was asked to fingerprint the artefacts at the Angkor Wat and Preah Khan temples in Cambodia. Artefacts are stolen at ancient sites all over the world, but where, for example, a head has been cut from a statue and definitive fingerprinting could prove which statue it came from, 'collectors would not be so willing to buy and it might not be so worthwhile for such things to be stolen', says Watling. He worked with the Australian pearl industry which was worried about the way some cultured pearls were discoloured. This project cost ADollars 3,500 and in the past 14 months has saved the industry ADollars 1.5m, equivalent to 2 per cent of annual production. Now, Watling is fingerprinting diamonds. De Beers, which dominates the industry, last month delivered a consignment of uncut diamonds from around the world to test whether the technique can be used to distinguish them. However, all this work must be completed by July 1, when the Chemistry Centre becomes a profit centre and it will be impossible for him to carry on as before, doing much of the work in his free time but using the centre's equipment. He hopes to find sponsors to take the technique into the private sector. It would, he suggests, require ADollars 3m to buy a plasma spectrometer, rent some space, hire three people - and himself, full-time - to take the new business through its first 18 months. Apart from building up a library of gold fingerprints, Watling has been working on a computer programme that could take over from him the job of interpreting data from the spectrometer. When that is perfected, he says, there could be a number of linked gold fingerprinting centres around the world.</p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: PARIS;  </P> <P> FARM UNION TEST AHEAD  </P> <P> French farm union leaders will be trying to simultaneously control angry  militants in their ranks and protect their public image as protests spread  against lower-priced, imported livestock.  </P> <P> Since June, angry French farmers have hijacked at least 19 trucks carrying  British and East European lambs. Last week, they slaughtered 386 live lambs on  a truck from Scotland, throwing the carcasses into the yard of a local  government office. But such violence has alienated celebrated animal rights  advocate Brigitte Bardot and others. "This business of killing live animals for  the television news turns people off," a union spokesman said.  </P> <P> A big test comes Thursday in the central French city of Nevers, where union  organizers plan a peaceful demonstration.  </P></p>

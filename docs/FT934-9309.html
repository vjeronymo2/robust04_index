			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Famous faces fit the bill - American Express has launched its first global campaign for five years The film shows Anita Roddick, Body Shop founder, striding around the jungle, discussing her way of doing things: 'Trade not aid for us is a real symbol. It's about trading in the developing world, setting up commercial initiatives with indigenous peoples. We don't change the environment, we don't touch the culture. I'd rather promote human rights . . . than ever promote a bubble bath.' Misty rainforest shots are interspersed with indigenous peoples going about their business, ethnic music and then - shock - Roddick starts talking about her American Express card. 'I travel a lot, I'm in bizarre places, I'm in unsafe places, I need to get in and out. What I use for that is American Express. There is no option, there is no debate.' It is comforting to know that even in the depths of the rainforest one need never be embarrassed by a shortage of cash or having the wrong piece of plastic. The 60-second, lavishly shot Roddick TV film, which is initially being shown in the US, is part of a vast global advertising campaign - the first by American Express for five years - currently being unleashed on the world. In the UK alone, Pounds 10m has been earmarked for the advertising, which is already under way; by next year the ads will be showing in up to 30 of Amex's main markets. Overall costs are not being disclosed - all the company will say is that 'investment is very large'. Currently, the American Express card is placed well behind the two leaders globally, Visa and MasterCard, in charge volume - value of sales and cash advances made on the cards. Each of the ads - there will be about 50 in all - follows an identical format but the national content is different in each case. Amex has selected people it considers to be recognisable 'local business heroes'. They each talk to an unseen interviewer about their achievements, vision and how their businesses are run. Snatches of film, clearly shot on no-expenses-spared locations, illustrate their points. It is only towards the end of the films  -which are closer to 'advertorials' than conventional ads - that the heroes explain their attachment to American Express and the card makes its appearance. Noticeably absent is information about membership fees and the like. According to Aldo Papone, special adviser and a director of the company: 'We have always built on who has it, rather than its features.' In view of the current heated competition between card-providers in the US, which is being mirrored elsewhere, this is perhaps just as well. The latest feature of the card wars is a flurry of 'customer loyalty' schemes. In the UK, for example, where Amex has 1m of its almost 37m cardholders, the company last month launched an air travel and hotel accommodation points scheme. The scheme will cost Pounds 20m over the next three years in marketing and administration in the UK. That came within a few days of the first launch by a UK manufacturer (Vauxhall, the General Motors subsidiary) of a mass-market credit card, which also provides discounts on the purchase of Vauxhall cars. Save and Prosper, the financial services group, is another to have recently offered a new, low-interest card. Papone lists the qualities Amex was seeking in their 'local heroes' as including: conviction, pursuit of ideals, learning from failure, hard work and success - in terms they define for themselves. They must be able, of course, to sing the praises of the American Express card through personal experience, as well as recommending it as a way to pay in their establishments. The whole thrust of the campaign is away from former elitist images and towards what Papone calls the gentler 'emerging value of the 1990s'. Amex's choice of the heroes is weighted towards restaurateurs and hoteliers and includes, in the UK, Richard Shepherd and the ghost of the late Peter Langan of Langan's restaurant, and Mike Gooley, founder of the travel company Trailfinders. Most familiar is Sir Terence Conran, the eclectic designer, who is filmed cooking, cycling and at his London restaurants before giving his endorsement to the 'classic green card'. Besides Roddick, the US advertisements feature Charles Lazarus, founder and chief executive of Toys R Us, and Jean-Louis Dumas, chairman of luxury goods company Hermes. The latter is seen surrounded by the luxury materials of his business as he extols the virtues of his products. 'I'm embarrassed to speak about a scarf like a still-life piece. A scarf is only good when it moves around,' he intones to the sound of violins. 'We give birth to the product, the customer gives life to it.' For the benefit of those who can afford it, he concludes: 'American Express, it is a very good way to pay at Hermes'. Italian advertisements feature Roberto Scio, from Il Pellicano, the Portofino hotel, and Ninetta Ceccacci Mariani, owner of the Rome Checchino restaurant. German local heroes include Ruediger Kowalke from the Hamburg Fischereihafen restaurant and, in Japan, Kyoichi Egashira from Royal Host restaurants. All the ads, says Shelly Lazarus, president of Ogilvy &amp; Mather New York, the advertising agency which has been responsible for the campaign, were unscripted. They were also unpaid - an arrangement which is not likely to have left the heroes dissatisfied, given the massive plugs they received for their businesses.</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Bank silent on action against loans row man AN ASIAN businessman whose 'interest-free loan' dealings are being investigated by police was the subject two years ago of a Bank of England injunction restraining him from taking deposits. Yesterday the Bank could not say whether Mr Mohammed Ramzan's subsequent business activities had been monitored or why the injunction had been sought. An official said: 'We are constrained in talking about our activities in supervision in relation to any specific individual or institution.' She confirmed that Mr Ramzan's company Moslem World Finance is not, and never has been, an authorised institution under the Banking Act. Moslems in many parts of England fear they have lost substantial sums invested in the Bradford-based company, whose interest-free loans seemed to satisfy the Koran's ban on interest-bearing dealings. Mr Ramzan closed his Bradford office and disappeared about a month ago, leaving behind many clients who claim he owes them substantial sums of money. Moslem World Finance appeared to offer Moslems a solution to their dilemma of trying to reconcile the practices of western financial institutions with the Koran. The company promised that investors depositing an interest-free lump sum for one year would then receive their money back, plus an interest-free loan of three times that amount, which could be used to pay off their mortgages. Some clients remortgaged their homes to raise the lump sum; several now face repossession. It is unclear how many people invested in the scheme. Mr Ramzan consented to the terms of the Bank's injunction obtained in the High Court in August 1990. West Yorkshire CID have sent an initial report to the Fraud Squad. Police sources say inquiries are at an early stage but that the total sum involved is likely to be more than Pounds 1m. Mr Liaqat Hussain, president of Bradford's Council for Mosques, said he feared the amount invested could be much higher. Mr David Musa Pidcock, leader of the Islamic Party of Britain, and of a committee formed by 34 investors who deposited between Pounds 5,500 and Pounds 31,000 each, confirmed that Mr Ramzan had received lump sum deposits in 1991 and this year. The Central Register of the Securities and Investments Board said yesterday that MWF's activities came to its notice in 1990. It decided it did not need SIB registration as it did not appear to be an investment business. SIB referred the case to the Bank of England, which regulates deposit-taking business. The telephone at MWF's office rang unanswered yesterday. Earlier this week Mr Ramzan rang the Telegraph and Argus, Bradford's evening newspaper, saying he was in fear of his life, but he declined to be interviewed.</p>

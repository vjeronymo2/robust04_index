			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Arts: Dancing with the wind - Joan Acocela explains 'Butoh' and the work of Eiko and Koma Practitioners of Butoh, the 'dance of darkness' that arose out of the rubble of postwar Japan, periodically tour the US, their naked, twisted bodies moving with infinite slowness in an atmosphere of unnamed anguish. American audiences tend to view these performances with awed respect. At the same time, Butoh shows often have a certain gun-to-the-head quality as if, were you to prefer something else - something with music, something with clothes, on your night out - this would prove you a person of low character. Eiko and Koma, a Japanese husband-and-wife team, received their early training form Butoh masters, and they have much in common with Butoh. They are primitivist; they are slow; their limb sockets look as though they have been rearranged. But Eiko (the woman) and Koma (the man) are so riveting that, in watching them, you forget to say to yourself: 'This is good for me.' Eiko and Koma are both in their 40s. They met at the University of Tokyo where they were studying law and political science, and moved to the US in 1976. They generally give one show a year in New York, and the shows are much the same. The title is usually organic - past works include Grain, Night Tide, Tree, Rust, Land - and the element named is often part of the show. The couple has done whole dances in pools of water and piles of leaves. What the dance involves is some exceedingly slow transaction - for example, Eiko and Koma move toward one another, reach one another, then part. Basically, the organism reaches for the thing it needs. Nothing could be more natural and, as their titles indicate, these shows are about nature. But by virtue of the extreme slowness and detail of the movement, and also the dislocations of the body - at times you do not know what is an arm, what is a leg - all is translated into a luminous unnaturalness, in which the smallest action carries a huge rhetorical force. This is Eiko and Koma's formula. They never change it; they never cheapen it. Actually, they have altered it a bit recently. With the collaboration of the American Indian composer Robert Mirabal they have begun using music in a more conventional way. And whereas before, all their work was performed by them alone, their last two shows have included their son Yuta Otake. He is only eight, but he too can now move in slow motion. Eiko and Koma's most recent piece, Wind, had its New York premiere in December at the Joyce Theater. No, it does not use wind machines. Instead, feathers fall slowly, two or three at a time, onto the stage, and as they float and twist in the air, the air becomes an actor in the drama. Meanwhile, below, the dance takes the form of passages: first Koma, then Eiko cross the stage and vanish, their spirits presumably carried away in the air. At the end, Yuta is left on the stage, seemingly dead. But at the very last moment, he begins to move. He is being born, or reborn. In the middle of the piece, there is a blackout, and when the lights go on again, we see a tang1ed blob on the stage. It is Eiko and Xoma, naked, locked in an embrace. But like all sex scenes in their work, this one is sexy only in a rather dire way. At one point Eiko, lying on her side, arches her body into the air. We see her whole trunk - full frontal nudity. But it does not look like a nude woman. It looks like a sting ray, or a bearded face, or God knows what. And that is the force of Eiko and Koma's work: to use only the body, but generalise it, so that it becomes Nature, and make it strange, so that it becomes theater. Koma is the more poignant of the two. He is humanity, struggling. As for Eiko, her face is a mask, her every limb-rotation an eerie drama. She seems to have died and returned. She is one of the most thrilling artists on the New York stage. Together, she and Koma are giving primitivism a good name.</p>

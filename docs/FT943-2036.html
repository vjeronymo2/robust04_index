			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hays expands to Pounds 87.8m - Personnel recruitment in the UK and Australia give profit boost A sharp rebound in profits from personnel recruitment agencies helped Hays, the business services group, increase pre-tax profits by 32 per cent, from Pounds 66.6m to Pounds 87.8m, in the year to June 30. Operating profits from the personnel division, which mainly supplies accountancy staff, jumped from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 16.4m as continuing economic recovery in the UK and Australia brought increasing demand for staff, said Mr Ronnie Frost, executive chairman. Hays' biggest business sector, distribution, increased operating profits by 29 per cent to Pounds 49.1m, helped by a strong performance on Continental Europe. The group said that Fril, the French distribution company it bought in 1992, increased profits substantially in spite of the background of the continuing recession in France. It had also won a number of new contracts with food retailers and manufacturers. Mordhorst, the German distributor acquired last year, exceeded expectations in 'very competitive' trading conditions. Group operating profits from Continental Europe more than doubled, from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 17.4m. In the UK both the dedicated distribution and specialist distribution divisions increased their profits. Network distribution - the multi-user arms which serves manufacturers - made especially strong progress. New contracts with a total annual sales value of Pounds 20m had been won. The bulk products division of chemical distribution saw a decline in profits as the worldwide pressure on caustic soda prices continued throughout the year. Both the packaged products and specialist chemicals divisions increased profits substantially. The group's commercial businesses increased operating profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 27.3m. Earnings per share rose by 28 per cent to 14.7p (11.5p). A final dividend of 4.15p gives a total for the year of 6.1p (5.3p), an increase of 15 per cent. COMMENT These better than expected results were an impressive way to mark what is nearly the fifth anniversary of Hays' flotation - a period that has seen the group's market value nearly treble, in spite of a recession which damaged the reputation of many other business services and logistics companies. The bounce in profits from personnel caught the eye, but the strong performance by the core distribution activities was less predictable. Although spending Pounds 100m on acquisitions and capital expenditure has pushed up gearing from 13 to 44 per cent, strong cash generation means the group still has scope to make further acquisitions, particularly in Europe. Forecast profits of Pounds 105m put the shares, up 6p yesterday to 287p, on a prospective multiple of 16.4 - a 15 per cent premium to the market. That does not seem unreasonable for shares that have outperformed the FT-A All Share Index by 91 per cent since flotation.</p>

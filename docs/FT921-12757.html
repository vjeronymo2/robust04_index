			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Fayeds fail to halt disciplinary move THE Fayed brothers yesterday failed in the High Court to block disciplinary proceedings started against them by the Takeover Panel over their controversial acquisition of the House of Fraser stores group. Lord Justice Watkins rejected their judicial review application, saying their case was 'unarguable'. The Fayeds are considering an appeal. Mr David Oliver QC, for Mohammed, Salah and Ali Fayed, had argued that the disciplinary hearing should be adjourned until after the conclusion of a legal action against them by Mr Tiny Rowland's company Lonrho, loser in the 1985 takeover battle for House of Fraser, which includes Harrods.</p>

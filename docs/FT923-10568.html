			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Latin America Debt Crisis: Bouncing back from disaster in tigerish style - A revived inflow of investment has reinvigorated the region Ten years ago next month the Latin American debt crisis broke - and threw the world financial system into turmoil. On these pages writers who followed the story for the Financial Times from the outset analyse how the crisis was handled. And they pose the question: Is there life after debt? SELDOM have economic fortunes changed so rapidly. From being regarded as a financial disaster zone two or three years ago, Latin America has emerged as hot financial property. Some Latin countries are now regarded as the likely economic 'tigers' of the 1990s. Capital has started to flow into the region again for the first time since the 'Mexico weekend' put a sudden stop to capital inflows 10 years ago. Net inflows were estimated last year at Dollars 36bn-Dollars 40bn, three times the level of the previous year. This year, the figure is expected to be considerably higher. Latin stock markets put on record-breaking performances last year, while the region's governments and companies have found once more that they can raise money on the world's bond markets. Multinational companies in Europe and the US have begun to increase their direct investment in the region. Most important, the inflows have helped rekindle economic growth, stunted during the decade of debt. Much of this money is responding to changes in government economic and trade policy. Governments have welcomed international capital, opened their economies to outside influence by lowering trade barriers, and slimmed bloated and inefficient public sectors. In part, these shifts reflect the transformation in the global ideological map after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Mostly, however, the shift has represented a pragmatic, rather than an ideological, response to the debt crisis. In the early stages of the crisis - viewed initially as a balance of payments phenomenon - governments suppressed imports, then tried to expand exports, in order to create current account surpluses. This led to trade liberalisation and export promotion policies. The problem was that the current account surpluses were being chalked up by the private sector, which thus owned the foreign exchange, while the debt was owed by the public sector, which needed the foreign exchange. Governments were limited in their ability to secure that foreign exchange. The debt crisis had more or less cut off external finance, and the tax systems in most Latin countries were so inefficient that most governments could not secure domestic funds with which to buy foreign exchange. Some resorted to issuing domestic debt or printing money to obtain the foreign exchange. Both courses had inflationary consequences, since domestic government debt often became regarded as a liquid asset and was soon treated like currency. The 'successful' Latin governments of the late-1980s have been those that have put their fiscal houses in order, through tax reform, through cutting out subsidies to state-owned industries, and through privatisations. This allowed non-inflationary service of the foreign debt, while the burden of servicing that debt fell in most countries. With exports rising, debt service became a smaller and smaller proportion of foreign exchange receipts. Furthermore, the Brady initiative from the US in 1989 paved the way for negotiated reductions in national foreign debts. The debt service savings Brady has brought about have been modest (except for Costa Rica, where a deep discount was negotiated), but the initiative has provided an important stimulant to economic and financial confidence in the big debtor countries. This has been enough to confirm an end to the debt crisis, although - in part because Brady addressed only the bank debt and some countries owe most debt to other governments and the multilateral institutions - not to confirm an end to every country's debt problem. This more optimistic outlook, however, owes a significant amount to the rapid fall in US interest rates over the last two or three years. This has dramatically reduced debt service burdens, since a large portion of the debt remains in US dollars at floating interest rates. Low US interest rates have had another effect. With deposits in US dollars earning only 4 per cent, against 9 per cent two years ago, investors have been forced to seek the higher returns available in the capital-starved region to the south. So far, much of the returning money has been 'hot' - footloose capital often parked short-term in banks or triggered by companies borrowing abroad rather than in their more expensive domestic markets. A lot of money is also going into the region's stock markets - hence an explosion in stock market values, to the benefit of a narrow group of speculators. But, with the notable exception of Mexico, Latin American countries have not yet been able to raise much new equity capital. In the international market for shares, some investors have also begun to express concern about the low standards of disclosure of Latin companies while, in the bond market, some corporate and bank borrowers have been distinctly second-rate. Mr Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, a former minister of mines and energy in Peru, is among those who believe that the owners of this capital will not repeat the banks' mistakes of the 1970s. Because it is in private hands, it gives 'some protection to the always present risk that governments will repeat in the 1990s the mistakes of the 1970s'. However, the challenge is to attract some of this capital into productive investments in the region - such as rebuilding infrastructure which has fallen into disrepair in the 1980s, so that growth is not restrained by bottlenecks. This dilapidated infrastructure is part of Latin America's so-called social debt that emerged in the 1980s. In the 'lost decade', per capita income in the region fell by close to a fifth (albeit from unsustainable debt-inflated levels at the start of the decade). The pressure poverty places on the governments of what is now, more or less, a democratic continent is extraordinary. Governments, even in their new, slimmed roles, are essential to solving these social problems, but there are questions about how well-equipped they are for the task. Most Latin American governments have now come to terms with the need to encourage both foreign and domestic investment as the main stimulus to economic growth. Growth, as the World Bank's chief economist, Mr Larry Summers, has pointed out, 'can raise a lot of boats'. As reminders of the fragility of Latin American democracy, Venezuela suffered a coup attempt in February, from which the government is still rocking. Faced with a destructive guerrilla war, the Peruvian president suspended Congress in April, in effect appointing himself dictator. Brazil, whose economy makes up half of Latin America's, is suffering a political crisis, its president beleaguered by corruption allegations. The new love affair between international finance and Latin America may prove to be more than just a brief flirtation, bound to end in tears, but it is by no means certain that it represents the start of a long relationship that will benefit both parties. History suggests caution. Mr Victor Bulmer-Thomas, a historian of Latin America at London University's Queen Mary College, points out that the region has suffered debt crises at approximately 50-year intervals since the 1820s. Each crisis - in the 1820s, 1870s, 1930s and 1980s - triggered a tremendous shift in economic policy and, after each one, creditors were forced to recognise that the debts would not be paid in full. 'If any of my grandchildren go into banking, I shall recommend some serious reading of economic history as the year 2030 approaches,' he says.</p>

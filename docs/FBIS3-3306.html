			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Li Qingsong (2621 7230 2646) and Wang Wei (3769 0251): </F> "Law Drawn Up for the Management of Hunting Guns"]    [Text] With the approval of the State Council and the  promulgation of the order by the Ministry of Forestry and the  Ministry of Public Security, the "Procedures of the PRC for the  Management of Hunting Guns" have come into force as of 1 March  1994.    After the founding of new China, in order to protect  wildlife  in keeping with the relevant state provisions, the Ministry of  Forestry, along with the Ministry of Public Security and the  other relevant departments, have gradually tightened management  on the production, sale, and use of hunting guns, thus promoting  the development of undertakings to protect wildlife.    Being a special product, hunting guns can inflict  casualties,  however. There is not an accurate statistical figure on the  number of hunting guns across the country, but the actual number  of hunting guns in the hands of the people is quite  considerable. Data from the public security departments show  there are well over 300,000 hunting guns in Hunan Province and  approximately 110,000 in Hainan Province. The management of  guns used for hunting involves a wide range of issues and is  very difficult. This, plus the lack of perfect rules and  regulations to manage hunting guns in the past, has led to many  problems in the production, sale, and use of these guns. There  have been frequent cases of wanton killing and hunting of  wildlife involving hunting guns. In 1989, the Dongfanghong  Forestry Bureau in Heilongjiang Province killed a male  northwestern Chinese tiger with a refitted hunting gun. In the  same year, Gao Guanghua and three other peasants from Mayingzi  township in Luanping County, Hebei Province, killed a leopard  with hunting guns in Beijing's Miyun County.    After conducting extensive investigation and study, the  Ministry of Forestry and the Ministry of Public Security jointly  drafted and formulated the "Procedures of the PRC for the  Management of Hunting Guns." The promulgation and  implementation of these procedures indicate that China has begun  the process of institutionalizing the management of hunting  guns. The procedures have great significance for the normal  production, sale, and use of hunting guns and for preventing  their use in illegal and criminal activities, for protecting  wild life resources, and for safeguarding public order.</p>

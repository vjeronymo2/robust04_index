			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Yasuo Okumura: "Economic Sanctions </F> Against North Korea -- China's Moves Are the Focal Point"]    [Text] With the United States, South Korea, and Japan  affirming their concerted action to deal with the issue of North  Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons, the UN  Security Council is expected to carry out full-fledged  discussions on ways to impose sanctions on the DPRK unless North  Korea relents. China, which holds the key to economic  sanctions, is still taking a position against economic sanctions  while distancing itself from those nations. How will the  economic sanctions be dealt with in the future? Will the  economic sanctions be effective without China participating in  them?    As is seen in the DPRK's past diplomacy, North Korea has  frequently changed its stand, and the possibility still remains  that North Korea will seek compromise through dialogue. If the  United Nations is to impose economic sanctions on North Korea or  a group of nations is to impose them, they will adopt the method  in which economic sanctions were imposed on South Africa and  Iraq. The economic sanctions are primarily aimed at halting the  flow of "money," "goods," and "personnel." Measures considered  to be effective as part of economic sanctions are a trade  embargo, a ban on capital transactions, a freeze on assets and  means of payment, and the halt of remittances to the DPRK by  ethnic Koreans residing in Japan.    North Korea's trade with China, Russia, and Japan accounts  for more than 60 percent of its total trade. The DPRK's imports  from the three nations account for 73 percent of its total  imports.    North Korea has increased its dependence on China for its  imports of energy resources such as oil and coke since the  Soviet Union disintegrated. The DPRK's imports of energy  resources from China make up 80 percent to 90 percent of its  total imports. In particular, North Korea imported 1.006  million tons of oil from China in 1992. The DPRK, which is a  state of economic devastation, is suffering from a sharp fall in  its food self-sufficiency rate. North Korea has boosted grain  imports from China since 1991, and its grain imports from China  account for nearly 80 percent of its total grain imports. North  Korea imported 650,000 tons of grain from China in 1992.    If China abstains from voting or exercises its right to veto  the economic sanctions at the UN Security Council, the  effectiveness of the economic sanctions is expected to be very  low. There is also a question of how to block the flow of goods  into North Korea through third nations. While the United States  is continuing its efforts to garner international support for  the economic sanctions, China is still taking a position against  economic sanctions being imposed on the DPRK.    Commenting on China's recent moves, a diplomatic source  said,  "It is highly possible that China will seek to maintain the  status quo and refuse to join other nations in imposing economic  sanctions." In explaining the reasons for China taking such a  stand, the same diplomatic source said: 1) If economic  sanctions cause the Kim Il- song regime to collapse, China would  be flooded with a huge number of Korean refugees; 2) If the DPRK  is absorbed by South Korea, the United States would then extend  its influence to the Yalu River (the Chinese-North Korean  border), and it is conceivable that a unified Korea will inherit  North Korea's nuclear development program; and 3) The DPRK's  development of nuclear weapons would not only pose a threat to  China but would also give Japan an excuse to arm itself with  nuclear weapons [point 3 as published].    In order to avoid facing this situation, China has no choice  but to take a stand against the economic sanctions that could  pave the way for North Korea's collapse. China's calculation is  that if it joins other nations in imposing economic sanctions,  this would harm its economy.    Will the economic sanctions be ineffective if China does not  join other nations in imposing them?    Mr. Masaki Yabuuchi, a member of the China and North Asia  task force in the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO), has  said otherwise: "Even if China does not join other nations in  imposing economic sanctions on the DPRK, the sanctions will  gradually have an effect. If Western nations such as Japan,  Germany, and Australia stop their exports of machine tools,  transportation equipment, and other products to North Korea, the  export embargo will force the DPRK to halt its construction  projects and will make that country unable to retain its  production capabilities in the long run, even though these  sanctions will not generate immediate effects, as would oil  sanctions. The economic sanctions will slowly affect North  Korea economically."</p>

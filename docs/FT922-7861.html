			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Observer: Rice whine If Tokyo-touring Dan Quayle has time between visiting factories, negotiating the new world order and such, he'd do well to watch a video called Imported Rice is Dangerous, just produced by the well meaning if protectionist Japan Offspring Fund. The video traces the tragic lives of weevils in three containers of rice. One houses the home-grown product, the next imported Australian rice, and the third the good old American rice that the US vice-president no doubt insists is served with his curries and chop suey. A flourishing family of 50 weevils was added to the American rice and, allegedly owing to the effects of insecticides, 10 were dead within four days. The fate of the weevils in the Australian rice was still sadder: all 50 perished within a week. Of course, the weevils in the Japanese rice lived happily ever after.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Australia highly  appreciates the role Japan played in helping bring the Uruguay  round of global trade talks to a successful conclusion,  Australian Deputy Prime Minister Brian Howe said Monday [20  June].    Howe, who doubles as housing and regional development  minister, made the remark in a meeting with Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata, a Foreign Ministry official said.    Howe reportedly said Australia gives high marks to Japan's  painful but courageous decision last year to partially open its  tightly controlled rice market to foreign competition as part of  its efforts to conclude the global trade negotiations.    The Australian minister also voiced hope Japan will  participate in an international conference planned for November  in Melbourne, the official said.    The "international conference on cities and new global  economies" will be co-hosted by the Australian Government and  the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).    Hata briefed Howe on the major tasks his administration is  currently tackling, the official said.    Howe asked Hata to convey views of the Asia-Pacific region  when he attends this year's summit meeting of the Group of Seven  major industrialized economies in Naples in July.    As he was leaving the premier's official residence, Howe  described the meeting with Hata as "very good."    Howe arrived in Japan on Friday for a weeklong stay to hold  talks with Japanese Government officials on regional development  and ask for Japan's participation in the conference. He met  with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa on Monday morning.</p>

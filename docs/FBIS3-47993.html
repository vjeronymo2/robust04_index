			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 20 (YONHAP) -- Deputy Prime Minister Yi  Yong-tok said Thursday that he expects a turning point for  improvement of inter-Korean relations this year.    He expected progress in inter-Korean dialogue, exchange and  cooperation this year, although it depends on what North Korea  does to solve its nuclear problem, Yi told President Kim  Yong-sam in a briefing on New Year's programs of the National  Unification Board (NUB).    Yi, who is also national unification minister, told Kim that  the government will hold fast to its principles, including  solution of the North Korean nuclear problem, before seeking  practical progress in inter-Korean relations.    The government will actively seek to solve the problem of  separated families through international organizations such as  the United Nations and to discuss with the North sending a  unified team to the Hiroshima Asian Games.    "If the government finds a breakthrough for solution of the  North Korean nuclear problem, it will allow businessmen to visit  North Korea and actively participate in North Korea's plan to  develop the Najin-Sonbong region," he said.    "It is inevitable for North Korea to change its policy  toward  openness because Pyongyang has to find a way out of the crisis  caused by economic difficulties, diplomatic isolation and  people's skepticism about the North Korean system.    "North Korea will agree to inter-Korean dialogue in a bid to  have access to the United States," he added.    Yi said that the NUB will improve its organization to play  its role fully in controling and adjusting unification policy as  well as working out a measure in preparation for an exchange of  special envoys.    The board will give concrete shape to its three-stage  unification plan this year, he said.    In the first stage of the plan (reconciliation and  cooperation), the two Koreas implement the basic agreements and  joint declaration for denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.    In the second stage, they organize a South-North  confederation.    In the third stage, the nation is unified under a new  constitution and general elections are held.</p>

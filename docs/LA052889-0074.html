			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BITTER AFTERMATH OF A RECALL;  </P> <P> OUSTED BY 9 VOTES, BLASZCAK WANTS A RECOUNT, AND BOTH SIDES ARE STILL FIGHTING  </P> <P> The votes have been counted, but neither the bruising recall campaign against  Vice Mayor Frank Blaszcak nor its accompanying atmosphere of recrimination is  over.  </P> <P> Blaszcak, who lost his City Council seat by nine votes out of almost 3,800 cast  in last week's election, announced Thursday that he will formally request a  recount.  </P> <P> And as the rancorous political fight wound down, there were these other  developments:  </P> <P> Each side charged the other with campaign violations.  </P> <P> Blaszcak supporters said there may have been irregularities in the  vote-counting process, which was conducted by city officials.  </P> <P> Members of the divided City Council talked wistfully about finding a new unity  and getting back to work.  </P> <P> Of the four remaining council members, two worked for the recall, one worked  against it and one remained neutral.  </P> <P> "We've lost almost a whole year on this," said Councilman James Castaneda, a  former Blaszcak ally who has since distanced himself from the vice mayor but  took a neutral position in the recall fight. "A lot of time, energy and money  has been wasted on this."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Barred From Running  </P> <P> With the continuing controversies, no one was speculating last week about  possible candidates for Blaszcak's seat, which will be filled in a special  election in September. Blaszcak is barred by law from running.  </P> <P> Blaszcak supporters said reports of voting irregularities are being gathered.  </P> <P> "We have a witness who's willing to testify that there was electioneering going  on at one of the polling places," Blaszcak said Thursday, one day after the  last ballots were counted. "In another instance, two people came in and  misspelled their own names."  </P> <P> He said he and his supporters were also concerned about the "chain of control"  over ballots on Election Day, suggesting that votes could have been tampered  with. "There were times when the ballots could have been changed," Blaszcak  said.  </P> <P> "It's hard for them to accept this," said Deputy City Clerk Cindy Bookter,  inviting a challenge to the tally. Bookter, who insisted that the count was  conducted with strict attention to state law, led the team that recorded the  3,797 votes cast last Tuesday.  </P> <P> The final count was 1,903 for recall and 1,894 against. The voters opted, by a  ratio of almost 3 to 1, for a special election to fill Blaszcak's seat rather  than allow the council to appoint a successor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Out of Envelopes'  </P> <P> According to witnesses, Blaszcak said, some ballots had been opened before they  arrived at the City Council chambers, where the tally was being conducted. "We  suspect that some ballots were sent from the precincts in envelopes, but they  resurfaced in the council chambers out of their envelopes," he said.  </P> <P> Bookter said a recount could be conducted within a few days of the election's  certification, scheduled for Tuesday's City Council meeting. Blaszcak must pay  the recount costs of about $1,000, she said.  </P> <P> Recall proponents aired some allegations of their own last week, charging that  there had been at least one instance of a Blaszcak supporter trying to  intimidate a voter. They presented Police Chief Don Tutich with an affidavit  from Alfredo Fernandez, who claimed that a Blaszcak supporter had shown him a  badge and ordered him to remove a pro-recall lawn sign from his property.  </P> <P> Fernandez said in an interview that he took the sign down and did not vote in  the election. Tutich said an inquiry is being made.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Looking for Explanations  </P> <P> Meanwhile, leaders of both factions were sifting through the remains of the  campaign, seeking explanations for the results.  </P> <P> Mayor John Tapp and City Councilman Sabino Cici, both leaders in the recall  effort, contended that the deciding factor had been hard work by pro-recall  volunteers. "People just got in and gave it all they had," said Cici.  </P> <P> "We had a little bit more desire maybe than they did," said Tapp.  </P> <P> Both acknowledged that a strategy of encouraging many voters to apply for  absentee ballots had provided the deciding votes. Although Blaszcak ran  slightly ahead at the polls, he lost the absentee balloting by a margin of more  than 150 votes.  </P> <P> "We encouraged people that it was easy to vote that way," said Cici, who added  that the recall committee had printed and circulated 3,000 applications for  absentee ballots to known recall supporters. He said the absentee strategy  emulated other successful campaigns, such as a winning slow-growth initiative  campaign waged last March by PRIDE (Pasadena Residents In Defense Of their  Environment).  </P> <P> One recall leader, who asked not to be named, said a list of voters who had  signed recall petitions was used so that get-out-the-vote efforts could be  focused on residents opposed to Blaszcak.  </P> <P> The issue of Blaszcak's character also played well with the voters, Cici and  Tapp said. Blaszcak's critics alleged that, 10 years ago, he had offered to  procure $60 worth of cocaine for a Santa Ana police officer. Despite police  allegations, Blaszcak was never charged by the Orange County district attorney,  because of insufficient evidence.  </P> <P> Blaszcak vehemently denied that he had ever offered to procure cocaine.  </P> <P> "People didn't vote yes or no based on that," contended Tapp, "but they used it  as background information."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Overconfidence Acknowledged  </P> <P> Members of Citizens for Responsible Development (CFRD), the slow-growth group  that provided most of Blaszcak's volunteers, acknowledged that they had been  overconfident.  </P> <P> "I can't believe we were that out of touch with the way people were voting,"  said Gary Meredith, one member of the group. "We thought we were going to win  this one."  </P> <P> The discrepancy between the expectation and the outcome has prompted concerns  about the legitimacy of results, said Meredith.  </P> <P> In a pattern that one Blaszcak supporter described as "like the Civil War --  North versus South," the vice mayor carried most of the southern precincts  while losing most of those in the more affluent areas, north of the Southern  Pacific Railroad tracks that bisect the city.  </P> <P> But Blaszcak also lost narrowly and unexpectedly in two southern precincts,  including one that voted strongly for him in last year's City Council election.  </P> <P> That area, the so-called San Gabriel Village, a neighborhood of meandering  streets and single-family cottages, has been "a CFRD stronghold," said  Meredith. But in the precinct that includes San Gabriel Village, recall won,  114 to 109.  </P> <P> "We're going to challenge that in every way possible" because CFRD leaders  believe that Blaszcak should have easily carried that precinct, Meredith said.  </P> <P> Blaszcak had portrayed himself in earlier statements as an underdog from the  southern part of the city facing "the old guard oligarchy" from the north.  </P> <P> "The north is the stronghold of the oligarchy that has always controlled the  city," he said. "I think that's a very telling thing."  </P> <P> Cici dismissed such a view as another example of Blaszcak's divisiveness.  "Frank has never had anything good to say about this city," Cici said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOW THE VOTE WENT  </P> <P> 16 of 16 precincts. 27.9% turnout  </P> <P> Shall Frank Blaszcak be recalled from the City Council?  </P> <P> </P> <TABLE CWL="1.45IN:1.67IN:1.56IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Vote  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C">  %  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Yes  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,903  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 50.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> No  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,894  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 49.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> If the recall prevails, shall the City Council fill the vacancy by appointment  or call a special election for that purpose?  </P> <P> </P> <TABLE CWL="2.33IN:1.67IN:1.56IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Vote  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C">  %  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Election  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,402  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 73.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Appointment  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 851  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 26.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

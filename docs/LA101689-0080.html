			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Q&amp;A: THOMAS T. HAMMOND;  </P> <P> HOUSING MARKET MAKE-OVER;  </P> <P> LOWER RATES, BIGGER ROLE FOR MORTGAGE BANKERS FORECAST  </P> <P> Since a federal law restructured the savings and loan industry in August,  industry experts have debated its effect on mortgage interest rates.  </P> <P>  Some have argued that S&amp;Ls, the major home lender nationwide, would raise  loan rates and fees as they try to meet new requirements for higher capital  levels.  </P> <P>  Others have argued that competition from banks and mortgage companies would  prevent S&amp;Ls from changing their rates much.  </P> <P>  Thomas T. Hammond figures the era of the mortgage banker is upon us, and that  S&amp;Ls no longer enter into the home loan equation.  </P> <P>  As chairman and president of the Hammond Co., a Newport Beach mortgage banking  firm operating in four states, Hammond sees some new trends in the mortgage and  housing markets.  </P> <P>  Hammond is an outspoken industry executive who has wrangled with S&amp;L  regulators during his aborted effort to buy a Riverside thrift last year. He  also is keeping an eye on Fidelity National Financial Inc., an Irvine title  insurer that has been gobbling up so much Hammond Co. stock that it has become  the second-largest shareholder with a 23.6% stake.  </P> <P>  In an interview last week with Times staff writer James S. Granelli, Hammond  discussed what he believes is happening in Orange County's mortgage and housing  markets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Q. In what direction are mortgage rates likely to go in the next few months?  </P> <P> A. Well, it's difficult to forecast interest rates, but I think in the  intermediate term, say, to the end of the first quarter, rates are going lower.  But it appears there's a very good bull market in bonds -- in the 30-year fixed  mortgage markets -- so I expect rates will be sliding down a little.  </P> <P> Q. Under the S&amp;L bailout bill, mortgage companies were expected to turn up  the heat, forcing savings and loans to hold mortgage rates down, or, at least,  not increase them very much. Has that happened?  </P> <P> A. It's beginning to happen. You have to understand that mortgage bankers have  had between 25% and 35% of the residential loan origination market in this  country. During the last five years, until the bailout bill, mortgage bankers  have had a tougher road. Their share of the market dropped because the thrifts  could lend money -- and did lend money -- without regard to capital market  rates, without regard to what they were going to do with these assets and  without regard to their net worth requirements. That explained why the thrifts  dramatically increased their assets over the past five or six years. It was  their attempt to get well. Obviously the plan failed. Now they're in a  retrenching situation.  </P> <P> Q. So now you're gaining the upper hand.  </P> <P> A. As the mortgage industry starts coming closer together with respect to  rates, mortgage bankers have a distinct advantage. As a mortgage banker, I  consider our primary competition in the next period of time not to be the  thrifts -- they're done and gone, with respect to being competitors of ours --  but the commercial banks. Just this past quarter, for the first time in a long  time, the commercial banks originated more mortgages than the thrifts. So the  commercial banks are going into the mortgage business in a big way. In fact,  our company now finds itself selling to some of these major commercial banks.  But it's our time now, and I think our share of the market has gone up in the  past year, and I think it will continue to increase.  </P> <P> Q. How much?  </P> <P> A. Well, we'll probably get up to 35% or 40% of the market.  </P> <P> Q. Is your competition from commercial banks coming mainly from the large banks  or from the local banks?  </P> <P> A. Bank of America, Citicorp, Chase Manhattan. They are the players today.  </P> <P> Q. Didn't the bailout law affect mortgage rates by rather quickly moving them  up?  </P> <P> A. Yes it did. There was an immediate impact when it became clear that thrifts  would need much more capital. It was interesting that the big California  lenders were the dominant ARM (adjustable-rate mortgage) lenders and were  really succeeding because of teaser (introductory) rates and fees. They were  killing the rest of the industry, dominating it. The minute it became clear  what the capital requirements for S&amp;Ls were going to be, they knew they  were not going to be able to sell these below market mortgages. They instantly  raised their rates and fees. That put them in an extreme competitive position  with everybody else. This was certainly the case with Home Savings and, to some  extent, Great Western and the other major thrifts that were the power players  in the teaser rate ARM business.  </P> <P> Q. There doesn't seem to be such a thing as teaser rates any more. Aren't  introductory rates for adjustable-rate mortgages almost the same as fixed rates  right now?  </P> <P> A. Yes. We can't sell an ARM loan. I don't think last month that we did more  than a handful of ARM loans, and I don't know why we did those. They're not  competitive.  </P> <P> Q. Is the lack of low teaser rates a major reason for the slowdown in buying?  </P> <P> A. I think not. Housing cycles have definite characteristics. One must remember  that from 1980 to 1985 we had very little new supply of housing coming on the  market. The people who did avail themselves to housing during that period, both  new and resale, were buried in high-rate loans. They really needed to buy a  house. There was a move or some compelling reason. The discretionary buyer left  the market during that period of time. Interest rates fell dramatically  beginning in 1986. And we had a tremendous pent-up demand from people who  hadn't made a housing decision for four years. Plus, we had a whole group of  families buried in high-rate mortgages. So, 1987 was the highest year ever for  residential mortgages. It's the only time America has had $450 billion in  mortgages. This year we'll do somewhere between $325 billion and $350 billion,  to give you an indication.  </P> <P> Q. So we created a tremendous housing boom.  </P> <P> A. Yes. We had this pent-up demand, plus we've had a very strong California  economy -- new jobs, new migration, immigration, Pacific Rim business and so  forth. It appears to me now that two things have happened. We've sort of  satisfied the demand and the economic job creation that's been going on is  still going on, but not at the accelerated rate we have had in the past three  years. So this housing boom may be maturing, and that's part of a normal  process. I don't think it's going to collapse and I don't think it's going to  become as bad as '82, '83, '84. But it certainly has matured and it's running  out of steam.  </P> <P> Q. If adjustable loans were used in the last five years to make it easier for  people to qualify for loans, is it harder now?  </P> <P> A. You have to understand the way the balance sheet of the typical American  family has changed over the past five years. I'm not sure it's harder. It's  just the reflection of the new realities of what a family's financial situation  is today. Those basic changes are that it's almost unusual today that we have a  family with a single income. We have two incomes in every household -- that's  almost universal. The second thing that we've found -- and we operate in four  states and we do between 300 and 500 single-family home loans a month -- is  that 30% of all of our loans have non-married co-borrowers; that is, people  cannot afford these houses without a parent, an uncle, a friend or somebody  else coming into the deal. I would say that five years ago, we would not have  had 5% of our mortgages like this.  </P> <P> Q. So the loss of teaser rates isn't affecting home buyers' ability to qualify  for loans?  </P> <P> A. Perhaps. Housing is taking on different aspects and characteristics than it  has in previous periods. The ARM business -- the cheap teaser rate business --  allowed people over the last four or five years to get into housing they  otherwise could not afford. This was just another way of the lending industry  turning its back on underwriting. It was just a rationalization to get more  business. In some regions of the country, it's been an economic disaster  because the people who qualified on teaser rates have turned out to be unable  to pay at higher rates. What we really should be concerned about is that  there's a general deflation under way.  </P> <P> Q. Aren't some places going down in value already?  </P> <P> A. In California, we have a very odd situation. It's hard to say whether our  prices have leveled or are falling. Between 1981 and '83-'84 we did have very  definitive deflation in housing. It caused tremendous delinquencies, previously  unheard of in California. I don't think we're to that stage yet, but we  certainly have been through it before and we're seeing symptoms on the East  Coast now, certainly in the Southwest, certainly in many parts of the Midwest.  We're seeing tremendous problems in Arizona -- real genuine deflation going on  there with falling house prices.  </P> <P> Q. Even in California, there are reports of home prices declining. Are prices  able to fall without genuine concern over deflation?  </P> <P> A. This is the way I would characterize it. In Orange County, August last year  to August this year, the number of new and resale houses sold, according to  your paper, is down 28%. That's a significant drop. As I recall, the '87 to '88  numbers were down 16%. So we've had two years of declining units despite this  seemingly extraordinary housing boom. What's happening is that we have an  imbalance in the housing market. What we've really enjoyed is a new-home sales  boom.  </P> <P> Q. What do you mean?  </P> <P> A. Prices in the resale markets in Orange County and most areas of Southern  California are much lower than in the new home market for a couple of reasons.  As we've developed this tremendous economy in Southern California, we've  developed affordability bands. If you have a house listed today in Orange  County in any reasonable area at, say, $200,000 or below, the market is fairly  brisk. If you're in the $250,000 to $400,000 range, we are accumulating  inventory at the moment. The higher end of the market, above $400,000, always  seems to have a life of its own. It sort of defies trends.  </P> <P> Q. Have housing prices peaked right now?  </P> <P> A. At this point, I think we have brought just enough product to the market. I  think we've sort of met supply and demand. If we keep bringing new $350,000  houses on the market in South Orange County at the rate we have for the past  three years, yes, we will have surplus supply and we will have some softening.  In fact, we're now figuring out ways to help our builder customers subsidize  mortgages to get people into homes at these higher prices. That is the biggest  product we are selling right now.  </P> <P> Q. Could you explain that product?  </P> <P> A. People all want 30-year fixed loans today. So builders will prepay interest  to lenders to provide mortgages that will have, say, a 2-percentage-point lower  interest rate for the first year, then 1 point lower for the second year and so  on. There's a variety of combinations that they use, but it's a discount they  offer to people to buy their houses.  </P> <P> Q. Aren't the builders just asking more for the houses to cover the discounts?  </P> <P> A. One never knows if that's coming out of their profit or they're raising the  prices to get it back.  </P> <P> Q. Rather than moving, are people refinancing or taking out home equity loans  to put on additions or refurbish their current homes? And are we seeing people  sell their homes, buy lower-priced homes and put the difference into remodeling  the new homes?  </P> <P> A. Yes. Absolutely. What is unique about the '88 and '89 housing cycle is that  we don't have the house flipping that we used to have. Families used to pack up  and move for a school district, for an extra bedroom or whatever. They would  move up. We're not seeing that now because we've had this extraordinary  inflation.  </P> <P> Q. And moving usually means buyers will pay higher taxes too.  </P> <P> A. Yes. We have this damnable Proposition 13 tax (limitation) situation that is  now a deterrent to moving. It used to be when your house inflated 20%, the  difference in your property taxes was not a driving motivation. When your house  is now worth 100% more than when you bought it, you're facing a major monthly  cost increase if you sell and move. And that has now put a bite on families.  Families will settle down and expand their houses. They all of a sudden get  content with their local school districts. They're not moving. We used to think  in terms of a 3-to-1 new market to resale market. Three resales for every new  house. That is stretching out now, because people are not moving up.  </P> <P> Q. What do you think the ratio is now -- 5 or 6 to one?  </P> <P> A. It's approaching that. Just look at the realty board statistics in our  communities in Orange County that are reported every Sunday in your paper and  you'll see that these numbers are not like they were. And there are more people  and more houses and more housing stock in these communities. The number of  resales is declining despite an increase in housing stock.  </P> <P> Q. Developers would say their costs are rising faster, causing this wide gap  between new and resale house prices. Is that a major factor?  </P> <P> A. Of course it is. But, and I'm not going to become political, it's becoming  apparent that one of the worst things we did was enact this Proposition 13, and  the irony is that builders and Realtors were real advocates of it. But now  what's happened is that we've reorganized our tax base in this state. And the  local communities and the local school districts are scrambling for revenues.  They do not have the revenue base to provide the infrastructure to allow these  communities to grow. So the result is that if the community wants to expand, it  must sock the new home buyers -- they're not socking the builders -- with the  cost of this infrastructure. The municipalities have been permanently impaired  by this tax limitation. There's going to be more and more awareness of this  problem.  </P> <P> Q. You think we'll see a Prop. 13 change some day?  </P> <P> A. Absolutely. We must.  </P></p>

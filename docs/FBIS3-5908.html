It has been pointed out that domestic industrial firms have  excessively relied on borrowing from financial institutions and  their capital structures are a far cry from being as strong as  foreign firms'. The more they borrow from financial firms, the  more they have to pay in interest, which results in blunting  their competitive edge against foreign counterparts.    As financial liberalization rolls on, firms will be given  more diverse opportunities to raise funds at cheaper costs than  before. As the government is moving to give more opportunities  for firms to raise funds by issuing bonds and stocks, it is  predicted that they will continue to increase their dependence  on direct financing, refraining from borrowing from banks and  short-term financing firms.    At present, domestic industrial firms are relying heavily on  borrowing from banks and nonbanks to raise funds as they are  relatively restricted in doing so overseas and by issuing  shares. Out of total funds raised by firms, an average of about  40 percent has come from borrowing from banks and nonbanks since  1990, according to statistics furnished by the Ministry of  Finance and Economic Planning Board. For 1993, enterprises  borrowed 16 percent of their total outside borrowings including  direct and indirect financing from banks and 25 percent from  nonbanks. It shows they are more dependent on nonbanks than on  banks when they borrow. By comparison, their indirect financing  ratio against outside borrowing was 38.4 percent in 1990, 43.7  percent in 1991 and 38.2 percent in 1992.    The direct financing ratio against outside borrowing sharply  rose last year. It was 42.4 percent in 1990, 37.3 percent in  1991 and 37.6 percent in 1992 before it rose to 50 percent last  year. But the direct financing ratio is still far lower than  that of economically-advanced nations, indicating that domestic  firms should further be encouraged to raise more funds by  issuing stocks and bonds, and increasing loans in overseas  financial markets.    In particular, the ratio of overseas borrowing against  outside borrowing remains at a negligible degree. Many domestic  enterprises have enhanced their credit ratings in overseas  financial markets so they can raise funds overseas taking  advantage of their high credit ratings.    But they are heavily restricted from doing so by the  government's tough stance against borrowing overseas. The  government has banned industrial firms from getting commercial  loans overseas in order to counter the surge in foreign capital  inflow.    Against this backdrop, the ratio of overseas borrowings to  outside borrowings was 6.8 percent in 1992 and a meager 0.8  percent last year.    By comparison, domestic companies are more heavily dependent  on indirect financing than Japanese firms, according to a survey  compiled by a research institute affiliated with Citizens  National Bank. Japanese firms are increasing their dependence  on direct financing as they raised 57 percent of their outside  borrowings through direct financing in 1990 and 69.7 percent in  1992. The ratio for Korean firms was 42.4 percent in 1990 and  37.6 percent in 1992.    The research institute said Japanese enterprises maintained  close relations with banks and relied heavily on bank loans  until the 1970s but they continued to reduce their borrowings  from banks since the 1980s. The report said that since the  first oil-shock, companies had to be active in reducing their  borrowings from banks because of the sharp drop in their  earnings in the wake of the oil-shock. Japanese firms were  freer than Korean firms in borrowing overseas, thanks to the  financial market deregulation there and the promotion of their  credit ratings in world financial markets. Japanese firms were  able to raise their dependence on direct financing by increasing  issuance of additional shares, acumulating profits and issuing  bonds overseas, it said.    The report said that Japanese banks tried to increase their  capital by attracting outside funds through issuing additional  shares and were able to reduce their funding costs by tapping  foreign loans through floating bonds overseas.    According to the report, Japanese firms mobilized all  possible measures to cut their funding costs as much as possible  by analyzing foreign exchange rates and interest rates overseas.    Despite the Korean firms' smaller dependence on direct  financing, it is expected that they will be able to raise more  funds through direct financing methods in the years to come. In  a recent report, the Economic Planning Board forecast that  domestic business concerns will rely more on direct financing  than indirect financing and will increase borrowings overseas  due to the on-going financial market liberalization. It  predicted that companies listed on the Korea Stock Exchange will  be able to issue additional shares and a growing number of  companies will be allowed to go public as Seoul stock market  conditions improve despite ups and downs in the stock index.    The government announced a series of measures to cool down  the stock market last month that included an increase in supply  of stocks in the market. Thus it will be a lot easier for firms  to issue additional shares on the Korea Stock Exchange this year.    The prevailing perception in the financial market is that  firms will have to reduce their borrowings from banks partly  because the financial authorities are calling on banks to  refrain from extending excessive loans to firms in order to  control growth in the total money supply.    Accordingly, bank loan operations are changing. In the past,  banks passively waited for borrowers to come to them but now  they go out to find borrowers. Banks are moving to offer new  financial services in which they give financial information to  enterprises about the best methods to raise funds at the lowest  possible interest rates after analyzing foreign exchange rates  and interest rates. A banker said that what bank employees are  doing now is making phone calls to big business groups to entice  them to use funds, a turnaround from their past loan operations.  Banks have to double their efforts to develop new promising  companies as their major clients as big business groups, which  are major clients for them, will continue to shun them as  financial market liberalization gains momentum.    It is desirable for industrial firms to increase their  dependence on direct financing because it will strengthen their  financial and capital structures, many central bank officials  said. In order to increase their dependence on direct  financing, they will have to scrap past business styles in which  they increased facilities to the extent that the supply of goods  surpasses the demand. When they keep increasing investment in  facilities or plants without sufficiently reflecting market  conditions and their financial status, they will have to  continue to increase their dependence on indirect financing,  which will result in worsening their capital structures.</p>

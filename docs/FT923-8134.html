			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / UK Company News: CMW tries to bolster share price CMW GROUP, the USM-traded architect and interior designer, yesterday tried to bolster its share price and said it continued to cut costs and was seeking a renegotiation of its head office lease. The shares, which collapsed from 80p earlier this year following pre-tax losses and the departure of two senior directors, were unchanged at 8p. CMW rents its London head office from the BWJD pension scheme, which was set up as a private pension fund for five people, three of which are directors of CMW. The lease on the office is BWJD's sole asset. The company is now 'in discussions' about reducing the rent of Pounds 305,000 a year, or Pounds 37 per sq ft. Mr Peter Denner, chairman and a beneficiary of the pension scheme, said the trustees had agreed in principle to a 'significant' rent reduction, the write off of part of the balance due and the conversion of some debt into equity.</p>

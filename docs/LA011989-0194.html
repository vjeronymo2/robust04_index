			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEROT TO INVEST MILLIONS IN ARCHIVE CORP., BECOME PART OWNER OF ITS NEW  PRODUCTS  </P> <P> Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot will invest millions of dollars in Costa Mesa's  Archive Corp. in return for the right to buy more than 1 million shares of  common stock and part ownership of any new products developed by the  manufacturer of computer tape drives.  </P> <P> Under terms of an agreement announced Wednesday, Archive gets to use Perot's  cash to develop new products so the company does not have to spend some of the  $28 million of its own money that it has stockpiled to buy other technology  companies.  </P> <P> The infusion of cash also comes just before Archive must face a potentially  costly lawsuit by another tape drive manufacturer, alleging that Archive  infringed on its patent.  </P> <P> Neither company wanted to say much about the complicated deal Wednesday or  disclose how much money Perot is investing. Perot's company, the Dallas-based  Perot Group, said only that Perot was introduced to Archive management in July  "through a mutual friend."  </P> <P> If Perot buys all 1 million shares that Archive has agreed to issue, he would  own about 7% of the company.  </P> <P> Eight-year-old Archive said it wants to perfect new types of tape drives to  help the company maintain its leading share of the $400-million market for  5.25-inch tape drives.  </P> <P> Tape drives convert information stored on magnetic tapes into signals that can  be used by a computer. Archive has about 20% of the market.  </P> <P> Such technology investment deals were common in the high-tech industries in the  1970s, when investors could get tax write-offs for investing in research and  development.  </P> <P> Since the tax laws changed, however, such deals are less common. In fact, this  is the first such deal Perot has entered, said Steve Blasnik of Perot Group.  </P> <P> "If we could find more of them as attractive as this one, we'd do them,"  Blasnik said.  </P> <P> The way the deal works, in broad outline, is that Perot will probably sell his  share of any new technology the company develops to Archive, possibly in return  for more stock.  </P> <P> "We want to end up being a part owner of Archive, not of a specific  technology," Blasnik said.  </P> <P> Perot is a colorful, opinionated, influential executive. He started Electronic  Data Systems in 1962 with $1,000 and is now worth $3 billion, the third-largest  private fortune in the nation. After selling EDS to General Motors, he  quarreled publicly and bitterly with the giant auto maker from his seat on the  GM board.  </P> <P> Perot has been increasingly involved in investing venture capital in new  companies in return for company part-ownerships. Perot recently plunked $20  million into Apple Computer founder Steve Jobs' NeXT computer company.  </P> <P> But lately, some of Perot's ventures have missed the mark. His new  data-processing company, Perot Systems Corp., recently lost out on a Postal  Service contract and a bid to handle the Texas Medicaid program.  </P> <P> Archive, meanwhile, has its own problems. Cipher Data Products Inc. of San  Diego has accused Archive of stealing some of its technology and incorporated  it in Archive's own tape drives.  </P> <P> Archive denied that and targeted two lawsuits of its own against Cipher.  </P> <P> The Cipher suit could come to trial as early as May. Analysts said Cipher's  case was bolstered last year when it won a similar suit against Wangtek, a unit  of Culver City-based Rexon.  </P> <P> Wangtek agreed to pay damages and royalties, which add to a company's cost of  production and make it less competitive.  </P> <P> Archive has been consistently profitable in the last few years, reporting  profits of $10.5 million on sales of $122.7 million for its latest fiscal year,  ending in September.  </P></p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / US Election (Changing of the guard): Battle of ideas set to absorb the GOP IT IS not going to be easy for the Republican party after holding the White House for 20 of the last 24 years. It will not even have the consolation the Democrats had for most of their years in the executive wilderness of running Congress, the legislative arm of government, writes Jurek Martin in Washington. Yet the GOP future is by no means bleak. The internal forces that would tear it apart are strong. There are serious differences of opinion between the socially exclusionary ideological right, conventional moderates, and the new strain of conservatism, which combines economic tightfistedness with a liberal approach to social problems. But, offsetting this, should be the twin realisation that out of division comes new strength of purpose and that the party lacks not in distinctive leadership material. Now that Mr George Bush is heading into retirement, the nominal titular head is Vice-President Dan Quayle. Undoubtedly he has his eye on the party's nomination in 1996 and his faithful performance in this campaign, much better than his underwhelming national debut four years ago, will have won him support. For the moment Mr Quayle is the standard-bearer of the ideological right, more so than Mr Pat Buchanan, the polemicist who challenged Mr Bush in the primaries. But his handicap remains the perception, reinforced by the election results, that he is still not intellectually worthy of the presidency. That cannot be said of some other challengers. Mr James Baker will probably not be one of these. His distaste for electoral politics is palpable. He might not turn down a nomination handed to him, but it is difficult to see him seeking it out aggressively, not least because he will be in his late 60s by the time 1996 comes round. The younger Republican generation looks more ambitious. Mr Jack Kemp, the housing secretary, had a good election, proving himself faithful to his president but distinctive in his advocacy of greater government and private-sector involvement in inner-city problems. Mr Dick Cheney, the widely respected defence secretary, was also conveniently above the fray of a losing campaign. A moderate in most matters, which is not true of the enthusiastic Mr Kemp, and with few political enemies, he looks more able than most to reconcile the party's factions. Governor Bill Weld of Massachusetts and Mr William Bennett, the former education secretary, represent best the new strain of conservatism, with Mr Weld, because of his greater exposure, the more advantageously placed. But all will have to reckon with the grass roots force of the Christian right and its skilful political mastermind, the Rev Pat Robertson, who has an extensive agenda for the future. If the Republicans follow the Clinton model, there will soon be a mini-proliferation of new think-tanks, trying to win the party's battle of ideas. It could prove fascinating.</p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> THE WORLD SHOULD FEAR BITTER-ENDERS;  </P> <P> EVEN AS MANDELA QUESTIONS SANCTIONS, THERE ARE THOSE WHO SEEK ONLY VENGEANCE.  </P> <P> On Nov. 27, Michael Johns, the policy analyst for Third World and African  affairs for the Heritage Foundation, testified before the U.N. Committee on  Apartheid. He did not meet with a critical reception because Johns has for many  years been a voluble critic of apartheid, so that it was not thought necessary  to pass much time on the disavowalist rituals. What Johns pleaded for, and  flatly predicted, was that the West would remove its sanctions against South  Africa "as early as in February or March."  </P> <P> This would have sounded very rash, except that from inside South Africa we hear  now from Nelson Mandela, widely accepted as the patron saint of economic  sanctions. What Mandela is saying is that perhaps the time has come to  "reconsider" their appropriateness. For him to say even that much dilutes the  moral absolutism of the call to sanctions, the kind of thing that Bishop Trevor  Huddleston of Britain has made his militant cause for many years.  </P> <P> Johns recited statistics that were not effectively challenged by the U.N.  committee. He said that "combined unemployment and underemployment figures for  South Africa's black majority now stand at 47%, largely because South Africa --  an export-driven economy -- has been denied access to many foreign markets." He  then went on to cite the latest Gallup poll addressed to South Africa's black  majority: Do you oppose sanctions as a means for ending apartheid? Opposed:  82%.  </P> <P> In South Africa today, most political forces are harnessed to move toward a  general election. The exact shape of the new constitution is not yet  established, but President Frederik W. de Klerk has said that it will include  "a universal franchise: No domination (of one race by another); equality before  an independent judiciary, (and) the protection of minorities as well as of  individual rights."  </P> <P> It remains to be seen whether the Boer voters of South Africa, who are the  backbone of what is left of apartheid, will feel that the new constitution will  secure their lives, liberty and property. There will be heavy debate within the  white community when the time comes.  </P> <P> This much we know, but we have not reflected on the debate that is bound to  engage the black community. And that community's two principal leaders are  Nelson Mandela of the African National Congress and Zulu Chief Mangosuthu  Gatsha Buthelezi of the Inkatha movement. And obviously Mandela is asking  himself whether he wishes to engage in a voting contest against a black leader  who opposes sanctions at a time when almost one-half of the black population is  unemployed or underemployed.  </P> <P> The events of the past year or two in South Africa have been almost as dramatic  as those in Eastern Europe, and they are by no means unrelated to those events.  As long as the ANC was thought by the white population and the white government  to be the arm of a Soviet state systematically engaged in oppression, violence  and subversion, the congress was rightly suppressed. The decision to free  Mandela coincided with the conviction that the steam had run out of the  communist revolution and that the ANC's continuing link to international  communism was something on the order of sentimental historical formality,  unrelated to any potential to do revolutionary damage. It could be said that  when the wall went down in Berlin, so it did in South Africa, between the  government and the primary black party of dissent.  </P> <P> What we have to fear is the bitter-enders who would really prefer a  non-peaceful end to the South African story. Three years ago in London, Bishop  Huddleston, the honorary chairman of the anti-apartheid movement, said, "I  would never suggest civil war is welcome; I say it is inevitable." The hatred  of apartheid and of its sponsors has not been entirely appeased by the collapse  of apartheid. There is sentiment among such as Bishop Huddleston for vengeance.  One way in which that vengeance could be satisfied is by a constitution that  has the effect of jeopardizing the security of white-owned property. Another  would seek that civil war of which the bishop spoke.  </P> <P> In the next months, the debate will open on sanctions. It will be interesting  to see how the fundamentalists react. Will Harvard reinvest in South Africa?  Will the Third World powers in the United Nations heed the revised judgment of  Mandela? Or will he be branded an opportunistic Uncle Tom? Worth watching,  particularly by those who do not believe that a civil war in South Africa would  please anybody this side of the good bishop.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHE'S WORKING OUT WITH A VENGEANCE  </P> <P> Twenty-mile runs, 100-mile weeks, the blast-past-everyone pace . . . . Kathleen  Smith stopped in mid-description of her recent marathon training program and  nearly laughed out loud.  </P> <P> "Twenty-milers, three (Sundays) in a row," Smith said. "Can you believe that?  Isn't that stupid?"  </P> <P> To those who tend to run on the conservative side, it might well be. But to  Smith, a 24-year-old Balboa Island resident, pressing her luck by pressing the  pace is the ideal way to prepare for her latest venture, Sunday's Long Beach  Marathon.  </P> <P> Smith is one of several elite runners expected to challenge for Long Beach's  $100,000 in prize money. The first-place award, for both men and women, is  $25,000.  </P> <P> "The money's not the important thing," said Smith, who works at a Newport Beach  athletic apparel store. "I like to race. I'd race if it were for nothing."  </P> <P> Three years ago, in her third year at Stanford, Smith was not so enthusiastic.  She was a prized recruit, having placed fourth in the Kinney National  Cross-Country Championships as a high school senior in San Antonio. But she  became increasingly frustrated with injuries and illnesses and quit the  Cardinal.  </P> <P> After a six-month break from running, Smith restarted gradually. She entered  her first 26.2-mile race, the hilly Napa Valley Marathon, and placed third in 2  hours 54 minutes.  </P> <P> Months later, she moved to Orange County and started training under the  guidance of UC Irvine Coach Vince O'Boyle.  </P> <P> Last December, in her second marathon race, Smith placed fourth in the San  Diego Marathon in 2:45. At mile 13, she took the lead on the women's field,  holding it until the 22-mile mark.  </P> <P> "Then I crashed and burned big time," she said.  </P> <P> In Smith's view, her late-race slump was due to a lack of strength. The remedy,  she believes, is an increase in her weekly mileage. About mid-March, she set  off on her first of five 90- to 100-mile weeks.  </P> <P> "But don't write that!" she said. "Or all these people will try it, go out and  get injured."  </P> <P> Which is exactly what some people expected to happen to Smith.  </P> <P> Bill Sumner, a competitive masters runner who began training with Smith a few  months ago, said he finally had to quit running with her because she always ran  too hard, no matter what the distance.  </P> <P> "Yeah," said Smith, who admitted to pushing the pace. "I kind of felt sorry for  him."  </P> <P> O'Boyle, an adviser to Smith's club team, Nike Coast, said he certainly hopes  Smith does well at Long Beach, but that he can't exactly condone the intensity  of her training program. Smith said he would rather have her doing a few  training sessions on the track, along with more moderate mileage on the roads.  </P> <P> But Smith said she has managed to fend off injury and burnout. And she feels  great.  </P> <P> "I know I did a lot, but I'm pretty confident that it worked," Smith said. "I  had to test it and see if it would work for me."  </P> <P> After the marathon, Smith plans to take a rest, cut back on her mileage and  train for the summer track season.  </P> <P> "At this point, sure I could look back and say I could have done this better or  that better, but I feel I've done what I planned on doing. At this point, no  matter how I do (Sunday), it's more like a celebration now. The hardest part is  over."  </P></p>

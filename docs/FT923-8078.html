			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / US denies Iraqi troop build-up REPORTS from an Iraqi opposition group that President Saddam Hussein was again massing troops on the border with Kuwait were denied yesterday by the US. The Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq issued a statement from its Damascus office claiming that tank, artillery and infantry battalions of the Republican Guard had been deployed in the Safwan area of the border. 'Our position is that the story is untrue,' a spokesman for the Defence Department said in Washington. Up to 5,000 US marines and other troops this week began manoeuvres with Kuwaiti forces expected to last for up to two months, with some of the war games taking place just to the south of Safwan. If the reports from Damascus had been correct the opposing forces would be almost within sight of each other. Earlier, Maj Gen Robert Frix, the commander of the US forces in Kuwait, said the military strength available to him was more than enough to deal with any threat from Iraq. President Saddam Hussein promised great efforts yesterday to improve Iraq's sanctions-ravaged economy and warned that corrupt officials would be dealt with harshly, apparently meaning they could be executed, AP reports from Nicosia. In a speech broadcast on radio and television, he criticised the performance of his ministers in dealing with Iraq's plight under the two-year UN embargo.</p>

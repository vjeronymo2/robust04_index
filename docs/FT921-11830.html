			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Russia to step up supplies of gas to Poland RUSSIA has agreed to increase natural gas deliveries to Poland from Monday following a sharp drop in supplies which caused heavy industry to cut output severely. After meetings in Moscow with Polish officials, the Russians confirmed that 5m tonnes of oil would be delivered this year. Gas deliveries would reach 6.6bn cubic metres, but the Poles want to match last year's deliveries of 7.1bn cu m. The break in supplies occurred after a decree by President Boris Yeltsin invalidated a Dollars 2.8bn barter agreement signed on December 24 between the two nations.</p>

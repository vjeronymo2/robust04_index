			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SEAL BEACH;  </P> <P> FREEWAY SNARLED AFTER CORVETTE, BIG RIG COLLIDE  </P> <P> A Huntington Beach man was injured and morning traffic on the southbound San  Diego Freeway was stymied for 2 hours Friday after a tractor-trailer rig and a  car collided in Seal Beach.  </P> <P> The 5:45 a.m. crash forced police to close all but the slow lane and a car-pool  lane that is under construction.  </P> <P> California Highway Patrol Officer Bill Jacques said a Camaro sideswiped the  rear of the truck as it entered the freeway from the San Gabriel River Freeway.  The 65-foot truck swerved across three lanes and collided with a Corvette,  which was crushed beneath the big rig's front end and caught fire.  </P> <P> The Corvette driver, Gary Hedge, 27, of Huntington Beach, escaped the fire but  suffered a 6-inch gash on his head that required 30 stitches. The truck driver,  Charles Loquet, 60, of La Puente, doused the flames with a fire extinguisher.  </P> <P> Several other minor accidents then occurred on the northbound and southbound  sides of the freeway because of sudden stops from rubbernecking, CHP Officer  Leslie Hill said.  </P> <P> The Camaro's driver left the scene and has not been identified.  </P></p>

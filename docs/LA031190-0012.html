			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: AT HOME ESSAYS 1982-1988 BY GORE VIDAL (VINTAGE: $9.95)  </P> <P> It's hardly news that Gore Vidal can write brilliantly when he chooses to, and  some of these essays reveal him at his best.  </P> <P> With frightening clarity, he strips away the patriotic rhetoric of Oliver  North's defenders and exposes the threat the Iran-Contra affair poses to  constitutional government in the United States in "Ollie."  </P> <P> Unhappily, Vidal rarely chooses to exercise his formidable talents, preferring  to fritter away the reader's time with rambling, self-indulgent pieces  attacking writers he describes with such coy circumlocutions as "Crier From the  Heart." A very uneven book from an obviously gifted author who seems bent on  preserving his reputation as America's foremost literary gadfly.  </P></p>

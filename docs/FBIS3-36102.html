			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav </F> Shushkevich, by Uladzimir Samoilaw, in Shushkevich's summer  house; date not given: "I Am Not Going To Put a Period to My  Political Career"]    [Text] [Samoylaw] It is three days since you were  recalled. How do you feel; was this scenario a surprise?    [Shushkevich] I am feeling well. I think that should have  happened a year and a half ago; it is strange that it did not.    [Samoylaw] Why?    [Shushkevich] A legislative chairman whose views differ  categorically from the views of an organized majority of  lawmakers cannot expect to work long.    [Samoylaw] What kinds of views?    [Shushkevich] First of all, views on Belarusian statehood  and the development of the national economy. No matter how much  they talk about reforming the economy, they are doing nothing.  This is why the nation is standing on the verge of a grand  collapse. This collapse has begun in industries and may gravely  afflict agriculture, which would be very dangerous.    [Samoylaw] The common belief is that there is just one way  to save the situation -- by merging Russian and Belarusian  monetary systems. Will this merger become a panacea or do we  pin too many hopes on it?    [Shushkevich] I would also like Belarus and Russia to sign a  sound agreement in the sphere of monetary relations. However, I  believe that the most important issue is parity of prices for  power resources. This is very relevant to our economy.    [Samoylaw] Still, it seems that there are many issues on  which the sides cannot reach accord, for instance that of  exchange rates.    [Shushkevich] I am not worried by exchange rates; let  experts resolve that. I am worried about prices. If we  continue to pursue the same silly policy as in 1993, paying $128  for a tonne of oil that cost $90 in Rotterdam material  exchange.... Where will it bring us? It is impossible to find  out who is to blame; who is responsible for this kind of  silliness. Nobody was found and punished. A system of  responsibility does not exist here.    When 70 percent of the enterprises close down and people are  paid two-thirds of their wages, what kind of state can put up  with this? The tragedy is that the policy of wasting what our  fathers and grandfathers earned is continuing. All measures  must be taken to change this trend, but I do not believe that  the government is capable of doing this.    [Samoylaw] In light of this, do you think that we will never  introduce our national currency?    [Shushkevich] There are many reasons for introducing the  national currency. Yet, there are enough reasons not to do so.  The main factor is the industrialists' persuasion that it is  more convenient to use Russian rubles. In fact this makes  absolutely no difference because money is just a measuring  device. No matter if we measure with a wooden or a metal ruler  -- one meter will remain one meter.    [Samoylaw] Did you personally make any mistakes when in the  post of Supreme Soviet chairman?    [Shushkevich] I cannot be blamed for strategic mistakes. I  wanted to do many things differently but under the circumstances  I could not. It is understood that nobody is perfect, but I  have no grounds for blaming myself for any political drawbacks.    [Samoylaw] However, you were accused of serious  shortcomings, including the destruction of the legislature's  work.    [Shushkevich] The point is that those who accused me were  experts in a centrally administered economy. Market mechanisms  have not been launched in our country yet; they simply do not  exist. At the same time, our laws do not permit properly  managing the national economy. This is very dangerous.    We lack courage and consistency to pursue a declared policy.  This is a proper policy but nothing is being done to implement  it. We are not moving toward privatization or even simple  commercialization.    [Samoylaw] Is it true that you have been proposed for a post  in the CIS leadership?    [Shushkevich] This post can only be proposed to a  legislative chairman.    [Samoylaw] What are you going to do in the future?    [Shushkevich] I have already received written offers of  employment.    [Samoylaw] What are they?    [Shushkevich] It is still a secret, because I have not made  a final decision yet. Believe me that the offer is very serious.    [Samoylaw] What about your legislative duties?    [Shushkevich] I will actively work, although frankly  speaking, I see no chance of changing anything. I could not  change anything being the chairman. I will probably work on the  educational or cultural committee.    There is still much obscurantism in our economy. I want to  point out that I do not feel myself a dilettante in the sphere  of macroeconomics. I am proud that I have received an  invitation from abroad to deliver a lecture on this subject.    [Samoylaw] Do you believe that the new Supreme Council will  be more economically educated?    [Shushkevich] This is what bothers me. I do not know  whether it will be more educated, but I believe that it will be  more intelligent.    [Samoylaw] Will you participate in the new legislative  elections?    [Shushkevich] I am not going to finish with politics.    [Samoylaw] What can you say regarding Lukashenka's  accusations?    [Shushkevich] Believe me or not, but neither me nor my  family will ever stoop to abuse a position for profit. In this  summer house I made everything with my own hands, and I turned  to repair companies only when I could not do something.  However, I paid for everything. Lukashenka could have come and  seen for himself -- other people would have done this.    Before you, a foreign correspondent visited me here. He  thought he would see a palace and was very surprised that the  former Supreme Council chairman has such a "ranch."    [Samoylaw] What advice would you give to NARODNAYA GAZETA  readers? What should they anticipate and hope for?    [Shushkevich] I am a NARODNAYA GAZETA reader myself. Press  should exist for those who are ruled and not for those who rule.  Your newspaper is that kind. I want to tell readers that they  should count on themselves, sow, and work. Frankly speaking, I  do not expect any improvement soon. I wish our readers had a  government that would do what it promises. Unfortunately, I  cannot say anything cheerful. Still, man cannot live without  hope.</p>

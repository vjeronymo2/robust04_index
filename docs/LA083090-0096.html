			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> AQUINO WILL CONSIDER PEACE TALKS WITH REBELS  </P> <P> President Corazon Aquino, who has ignored calls for a cease-fire with  guerrillas in the Philippines, said Wednesday she was considering Senate  proposals for peace talks with both leftist and rightist rebels.  </P> <P> Aquino said in a statement that she has directed her security advisers "to take  up and consider the Senate resolution calling for support to peace initiatives,  reconciliation and peaceful dialogue on all fronts."  </P> <P> The proposal was advanced last week, amid a rash of bombings in the capital --  17 since Aug. 13. The attacks were viewed as threatening another uprising  against Aquino, whom the rebels have accused of inefficiency and corruption.  </P></p>

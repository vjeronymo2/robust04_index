			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: Marsh &amp; McLennan buys rest of Faugere MARSH &amp; MCLENNAN, the world's biggest insurance broker, yesterday announced the acquisition of Faugere &amp; Jutheau, a family-owned company and the dominant force in French insurance broking. New York-based Marsh &amp; McLennan, which already owns one-third of Faugere, paid Dollars 105m in cash to secure the deal, which is still subject to formal approval by the French government. In 1991, Faugere's profits after tax were Dollars 6.51m on revenues of Dollars 125m. A joint venture between Marsh and the family of the chairman, Mr Robert Husson, is being formed to manage Faugere's African businesses, which generated revenues of Dollars 21m of the total in 1991. Europe has generated faster growth for Marsh than any other territory; the completion of a continent-wide network has been a priority for the group, according to Mr Robert Clements, Marsh &amp; McLennan chairman. 'France was the missing link,' he said. The Marsh network in Europe - which covers 16 countries - also includes the Lloyd's broker, CT Bowring, in London and Germany's largest broker, Gradmann &amp; Holler, which was acquired in 1989. Marsh has had a correspondent relationship with Faugere since 1969, and acquired its original one-third interest four years later. But hitherto the French group had been unenthusiastic about sacrificing full control. Mr Robert Husson accepted yesterday that closer collaboration had always been on the cards. 'You have to become international or you are lost,' he said. Marsh's acquisition of Faugere comes at a turbulent time for the French insurance industry. The state-controlled insurers - Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), Assurance Generales de France (AGF), and Groupes des Assurances Nationales (GAN) - will see part of their equity sold in the government's partial privatisation programme.</p>

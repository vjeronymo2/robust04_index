			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Zhang Junsheng Says Sino-British Cooperation on </F> Hong Kong Issue Has Been Ruined by Chris Patten"]    [Text] Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the XINHUA News  Agency Hong Kong Branch, has said the Chinese side hopes that  China and Britain can maintain a good cooperative relationship  between them as Hong Kong is now in the late transitional  period. However, he added, it is a pity that this cooperative  relationship has been ruined by Chris Patten.    Zhang Junsheng made the above statement to reporters  yesterday evening when attending the founding ceremony of the  Hong Kong Society of Creative Photographic Art. He was asked by  reporters to comment on remarks by the British Foreign Office  minister Alastair Goodlad that Sino-British relations at present  are not too bad.    Zhang Junsheng said: "I wish it were true. However, now the  problem is that the very important part of Sino-British  relations, that is, the cooperative relationship between China  and Britain on the Hong Kong issue, has been ruined by the  British side, and by Chris Patten in particular. The Chinese  side, of course, hopes China and Britain can maintain a good  cooperative relationship between them, but for the moment  Sino-British relations have actually been greatly impaired."    Zhang Junsheng said: China and Britain should cooperate more  closely in this late transitional period to ensure prosperity,  stability, and a steady transition, which is the goal clearly  laid down in the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Now, the  problem is that the British side has ruined cooperation despite  the Chinese side's wish for cooperation. In this case, what can  we do on our part? Now that the British side refuses to  cooperate, the Chinese side cannot stand by idly doing nothing  but waiting for the British side to return to cooperation.    A reporter mentioned that a couple of days ago Chris Patten  had accused the economic subgroup of the Preliminary Work  Committee [PWC] of nursing ulterior motives in inviting Hong  Kong Government officials to visit Beijing to explain a bill on  the Airport Corporation's articles of association. Zhang  Junsheng asked: Then what is the motive? Chris Patten did not  specify it at all. A few days ago, Chris Patten said he would  not restrain British Hong Kong Government officials from  contacting members of the PWC. But now he has categorically  rejected an official invitation from the PWC. In fact, the PWC  economic subgroup's letter of invitation very expressly states  that the PWC needed to study the issue, and its purpose in  studying this is to give advice to the Chinese representatives  on the Airport Committee before further negotiations with their  British counterparts. What is wrong with doing this?    Zhang Junsheng said: Some members of the PWC, when studying  the case, have found that they do not understand or are not  quite clear about some articles in the bill; therefore, they  have asked Hong Kong Government officials to explain the bill to  them. The purpose is very clear, and it has been stated very  clearly in the invitation letter. Should there be any doubts  about this?    A reporter said to Zhang Junsheng: Referring to the  reorganization of the three-tier assemblies in 1997, some PWC  members have suggested that the nonpolitical assemblies be  allowed to switch over by means of endorsement and reappointment  rather than reelection. The reporter asked Zhang whether he  agreed with this idea. Zhang Junsheng said: In principle, all  assemblies should be dismissed and reestablished. However,  before a final decision is made, everybody is welcome to air his  views on the reorganization of these assemblies. Now that PWC  members are voicing their opinions on this issue and are  discussing it, this shows that they are very seriously and  responsibly considering the case of Hong Kong's transition.  With a smile he said to the reporters: "You may express your  opinions as well!"</p>

They said Deng, who has reportedly been staying in Shanghai  since December for relaxation, arrived by car at the hotel where  Chen, who has often taken a cautious stance toward reform, was  staying.    This was Deng's third reported outing since the 89-year-old  architect of China's economic reforms moved to the Chinese  coastal commercial city.    Chen, a long-time economic leader and later chief of the  party's Central Advisory Committee in the 1980s, has been  staying in the metropolis from around summer last year.    A Beijing-funded newspaper in Hong Kong reported Monday that  Deng had made a rare public appearance on New Year's day,  visiting a five-star Shanghai hotel and chatting with foreign  guests.</p>

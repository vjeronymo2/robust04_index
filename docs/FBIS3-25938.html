They have taken a firm and clear stand and acted  promptly to deal with such problems with good initial results.    Through the investigation of indiscriminate fee collecting  and other problems, it was learned that there are 177 kinds of  fee at the regional level and 1,337 rules governing their  collection. Various units have discovered a number of cases of  indiscriminate collection of fees, fines, retention of fees, and  misappropriation of public funds involving a total of 1.761  million yuan. All of this has now been delivered to the state  treasury.    As of end of 1993, the autonomous region announced the  cancellation of 20 kinds of unreasonable fee, and various  prefectures and cities announced the cancellation of 216 kinds  of unreasonable fees. Most departments and units in the  autonomous region also checked on the matter in a serious manner.    The Regional Education Commission checked on 13 kinds of  fees  and has now canceled six kinds of unreasonable fee. The  Regional Foreign Affairs Office has stopped seven kinds of fee  which were collected in addition to the standard fee for issuing  passports to people wanting to go abroad. The Regional  Agricultural Commission checked on 13 kinds of fee which add a  burden to peasants and herdsmen. The Lhasa City Public Security  Bureau checked on 118 kinds of fee and canceled seven and  temporarily stopped 25 others with the approval of the Lhasa  City party committee and the city government. The city public  security bureau also checked on fines, household fees and car  deregistration fees. It discovered 300,000 yuan in fees which  should not be collected. This has now been handed to the city  financial authority. Meanwhile, some units have corrected the  situation in which supporting fees [zan zhu fei] were collected  from enterprises and institutions by staff members and workers  of those units.</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Strong start to second big Italian sell-off Italy's second big public privatisation was closed ahead of schedule last night after heavy oversubscription for shares in Istituto Mobiliare Italiano. According to the Rome-based financial services group, about350,000 applications were received from Italian investors on Monday and Tuesday, the first two days of the public offer. The demand covered about 350m shares - almost five times the amount of stock offered to domestic retail investors, who have been been allocated 75m of the 200m IMI shares being floated. The demand is well ahead of the first day's response to the sale of shares in Credito Italiano last month, and suggests the government's privatisation drive is gathering momentum. The response to the IMI issue belies initial doubts among ministers that the company would be hard to sell to retail investors because of its relative unfamiliarity and lack of a big branch network.</p>

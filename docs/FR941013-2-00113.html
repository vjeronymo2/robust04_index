The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Funds are registered management investment companies. Some of the Funds (the ``Portfolios'') issue shares to other Funds that invest all or substantially all of their assets in the Portfolios. Eaton Vance Management (``Eaton Vance'') currently serves as the administrator or investment adviser for each of the Funds, except the Portfolios. Boston Management and Research, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eaton Vance, serves as investment adviser to each of the Portfolios. Eaton Vance and Boston Management are each registered under the Investment Advisers Act. Eaton Vance Distributors, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eaton Vance, serves as the Funds' principal underwriter. Applicants request that the proposed relief apply to the funds and any requested investment companies that in the future are advised by Eaton Vance or any entity under common control with or controlled by Eaton Vance. The proposed relief would not, however, apply to any investment company that is a money market fund that relies on rule 2a&hyph;7 under the Act. Any relief granted from section 13(a)(3) of the Act would extend only to named Funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The Brevel, intended for  the operational needs of the French and German Armies, has been  in development since October 1992 under an overall contract  worth 1400 million FF [French Francs] (approximately 400 million  DM [Deutsche Marks]), for a six-year period. Several technically  ambitious subassemblies have already been developed for the  program by MATRA DEFENSE and STN Systemtechnik Nord and are  being tested intensively. The Brevel is an observation system  built around drones (small pilotless aircraft) carrying IR  camera and transmitting images of the area covered to a ground  station in real time, during the day or at night. The ground  reception station controls the drones and image processing.  Because it is small, stealthy, easy to handle and move and  highly reliable, the Brevel is ideal for executing dangerous  reconnaissance missions with maximum precision and without  involving a threat to the life of a pilot. The current  political situation in Europe requires means for coping with  crises, particularly, surveillance systems capable of providing  civil and military authorities with data on which to base  decisions. Because of its stealth qualities and resistance to  all types of jamming an because it is remote guided, the Brevel  is ideal for such missions.</p>

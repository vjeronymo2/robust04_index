			<p>BFN     [Text] Alma-ata [Almaty], April 26 (XINHUA) -- Chinese  Premier Li Peng today stated a six-point proposition for  developing China's economic cooperation with Central Asian  nations.    Li made the statement to about five hundred business people  in Kazakhstan, the last of four Central Asian countries he has  visited in the past nine days.    The six principles are as follows:    Firstly, cooperation should be based on equality and mutual  benefit, and conducted according to the economic law. In  specific terms, the two sides should help supply each other's  needs, stick to the principle of exchange at equal values, and  maintain balance of trade, which should be regularized. The  setting up of joint ventures should benefit both or all parties,  with the purpose to help develop the national economies of  relevant countries.    Secondly, cooperation should be developed in diversified  forms. While exchange of commodities takes up a big portion in  bilateral trade at present, cash payment represents the trend of  development. For that, means of banking settlement need to be  improved. Also, the Chinese Government fully agrees with the  Central Asian nations' hope to develop economic cooperation with  different parts of China, in addition to the nearby Xinjiang  Autonomous Region.    Thirdly, economic cooperation should proceed from the actual  conditions, with full use of local resources. Also, market  prospect should be taken into full consideration from the very  beginning of joint ventures, which need to bring in good  economic returns with competitive products.    Fourthly, communications and transportation need to be  improved, with a view to building up a new "Silk Road." China  and Kazakhstan have reached an important agreement in this  regard. The two sides should strive to ensure smooth traffic  through the Euro-Asia continental bridge, to bring benefits to  all countries concerned.    Fifthly, the small amount of economic assistance China has  provided the Central Asian nations within its means is only a  symbol of friendship from the people of China, which itself  remains a developing country and faces an arduous task of  economic development.    Sixthly, China is willing to develop multi-lateral  cooperation to promote common development. China's open policy  is meant for the developing countries as well as the developed  nations, particularly the neighboring countries. While China  will work for the expansion of cooperation with the Central  Asian nations, it is also willing to see the growth of their  trade, economic cooperation and friendly contact with other  countries. China is ready to participate in equal and fair  competition.    "China seeks no spheres of economic or political influence  in  Central Asia," he asserted, in ending the speech.</p>

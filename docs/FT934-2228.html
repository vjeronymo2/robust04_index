			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Generators to learn their fate: Electricity regulator may refer two leading power companies to MMC early next year Professor Stephen Littlechild, electricity industry regulator, is expected to make a long-awaited statement today on the UK's two largest power generators but is unlikely to reach a final decision on whether to refer them to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Although he has previously promised to make a decision on National Power and PowerGen by the end of the year, it is likely that he will give them about a month to respond to demands in his statement. That would open up the possibility of a referral to the commission in the early part of the year. Any delay will deepen the uncertainty over the government's plans to sell its 40 per cent stakes in the companies in the next financial year. The holdings are worth in excess of Pounds 3bn. Prof Littlechild promised in the summer to make a decision on referring the generators after sharp rises in prices in the electricity wholesale pool through which power is traded in England and Wales. He had already been examining their costs and profit margins. The regulator's action followed widespread criticism from large energy users. The users, who suffer the most from the price rises, buy their power supplies directly from the pool rather than from an electricity supplier. Prof Littlechild said that referring the generators would be one of several options if he found that the prices they charge for running their generating sets are unacceptably high. He has also been considering whether to introduce price controls to limit the charges that the generators levy or whether to reach an agreement with them on the sale of some of their plant. The generators have been arguing that either option would be unacceptable because the prices they charge provide them with only a reasonable rate of return. Some analysts believe the generators would prefer to risk the consequences of a commission reference rather than accept price controls or agree to voluntary disposals. Prof Littlechild's statement today is one of several expected within the next few weeks. He is also considering an appeal by large energy users over proposed reforms to the bidding process in the electricity pool. In addition, Nuclear Electric has asked him to give it a licence to allow it to sell power directly to industrial customers. Today's statement on the generators is expected to be given to the Stock Exchange early this morning.</p>

Yang Zhou, 49, told KYODO NEWS SERVICE in a telephone  interview that he was taken into custody in Beijing on November  14 and held through December 31 at detention centers in both  Beijing and Shanghai. He said he was treated badly at both  centers.    Yang was among nine people taken into custody after signing  the draft charter intended to stimulate a national dialogue on  bringing democracy to China.    All were released the following day except for Yang and  another dissident Qin Yongmin. Qin, from the central city of  Wuhan, gained attention earlier for campaigning against  Beijing's bid for the 2000 Olympic Games. His whereabouts are  unknown.    Yang said the charter aims to promote nonviolent political  reform in China in contrast to some pro-democracy groups that  advocate violent revolution to achieve their goals.    The charter advocates nonviolence and cooperation with the  Communist Party, which it describes as the only force capable of  leading a peaceful transition to democracy.    It also calls for increasing individual rights, striking  political crimes from the legal code and releasing political  prisoners.    Yang, who is from Shanghai, was previously jailed for three  years for his role in the democracy wall protest movement of the  late 1970s.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Geologists have discovered an "inactive" fault near the Savannah River Plant  nuclear weapons complex in South Carolina, according to a report by the Energy  Department. The Pen Branch Fault runs within half a mile of the K-Reactor and  the site of a proposed reactor scheduled for construction beginning in 1991 or  1992, according to Steve Wright of the department. He said the other two  reactors on the site, the P-Reactor and the L-Reactor, are several miles from  the fault, a fracture or zone of fractures in rock strata where pressure and  displacement can cause earthquakes.  </P></p>

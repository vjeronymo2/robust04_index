			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Selection of the most important parts of the Slovak </F> Government Policy Statement and paraphrasing of some other  chapters," prepared by the NARODNA OBRODA editorial team:  "Calming Down Emotions, Setting the Economy in Motion"]    [Text] In an extensive introductory part of the  Policy Statement, which will be discussed by the National  Council of the Slovak Republic tomorrow, the government sums up  the reasons that led the National Council to pass a vote of  no-confidence in Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar. These  included, among others, the confrontational manner of political  communication, lack of concept in economic policy, the  politicizing of the economy, the delaying of transformation, and  the deterioration of economic and social indicators. In the  present, difficult situation, the government wants to seek  optimal and pragmatic solutions to unpostponable problems. It  intends to continue all the positive steps taken by the previous  government. It regards as the most important tasks stabilizing  the political, economic, social, and security situation, warding  off the collapse in health care, education, culture, and the  judiciary, and completing the drafting of conceptual documents  and legislative norms. With regard to foreign relations, it  wants to effectively defend the interests of Slovakia and tackle  existing problems in a professional way.  <H5>  Risks of the Starting Position of the Economy </H5>   In 1993, the first year of the existence of the independent  Slovak Republic, the development of the economy deteriorated  once again, particularly in the first half of the year. This  was caused by the previous government's lack of concept in  preparing the independent existence of the Slovak economy, gross  shortcomings in its economic policy, and the slowing down of the  transformation process and privatization, in particular.    This found expression in another decline of real GDP by 4.1  percent, in a decline of industrial production by 13.5 percent,  and in a drop of construction output by almost one-fourth.    The conditions of internal and external balance  substantially deteriorated compared with 1992. The deficit of  the state budget, which increased to 23 billion Slovak korunas  [Sk] (6.8 percent of GDP), not only contributed to further price  growth but, by siphoning off credit resources, also had an  extremely adverse influence on the development of the  entrepreneurial sphere. The increase in the budget deficit  was accounted for, apart from the decline in GDP, also by  shortcomings in preparing the introduction of the new system of  taxation and insurance. In spite of the Sk's devaluation,  exports declined sharply (11.5 percent compared with 1992),  while imports grew at a relatively rapid pace (15.4 percent),  which resulted in a Sk26.7 billion deficit in the foreign trade  balance.    At the same time, the clearing account registering trade  with  the Czech Republic showed a deficit of Sk5.8 billion, which,  while representing an extraordinary boost to budget revenues in  1993, aggravated, on the other hand, the starting position for  budget management in 1994.    The starting position of the state budget for 1994 is  also made worse by the unresolved liabilities of public sector  branches -- health care, transportation, education, and others  -- which were not included in the 1993 state budget deficit.  These represent an additional burden of more than Sk6 billion  for the 1994 budget.    As a result of deficit financing, which assumed unrestrained  dimensions toward the end of 1993, the net debt indebtedness of  the government sector rose to Sk60.0 billion. This  substantially increased the debt servicing burden for the state  budget in 1994 and the subsequent years.    The price level went up 23.2 percent in 1993, more than  double the 1992 price growth.    The unfavorable development of the Slovak economy in the  years 1992 and 1993 also found expression in growing  unemployment and in the social situation of the population. By  the end of 1993 the rate of unemployment increased to 14.4  percent.    The preceding government did not take resolute steps to  stabilize the conditions for the development of the  entrepreneurial sphere and in support of its development. This  was reflected in another increase in the number of companies  operating at a loss, the proportion of which reached 57.5  percent by the end of 1993, with their aggregate loss amounting  to Sk42.5 billion. This further aggravated companies' inability  to pay their bills and acted as a brake on monetary flows.    Our predecessors are accountable for the -- by  international standards -- low inflow of foreign investments,  primarily because they failed to ensure essential political and  economic stability and because the government's low credibility  deterred foreign investors. This is reflected in the fact that  the overall volume of foreign investments reached only Sk10.8  billion by the end of 1993, which was Sk4.2 billion more than at  the end of 1992, but, when Czech investors' capital is  subtracted, the increase represented only Sk3 billion. The  inflow of foreign capital had a declining tendency in the course  of 1993.  <H5>  Economic Intentions and Targets </H5>   In contrast to the preceding government's program, our  program proceeds from the longer-term aims of the Slovak  economy's development. On this basis, during our term of  office we want to lay the foundations for new dynamizing  [dynamizujici] elements, regardless of the fact that their  effects will make themselves felt only later.    The government's unequivocal intention is to speed up the  embarked-upon process of transforming the economy and ownership  relations, in particular. We will set the process of  privatization in motion again, with respect to which we will  return to the tried-and-tested method of coupon privatization,  which had in the past won citizens' trust. We regard successful  transformation as the prerequisite for the development of a  modern and efficient economy that will enable the Slovak  Republic to join the league of economically advanced countries  and to raise the living standards of the population. We  pledge to retain the social tolerability of transformation. We  will conduct social dialogue to achieve generally acceptable  solutions in the interest of maintaining social peace. We will  devote particular attention to the socially weakest strata of  the population.    The government realizes that at the root of the development  of society lie the initiative and responsibility of every  individual and every economic and non-economic organization.  The government's task is to act as the catalyst of this  initiative.  <H5>  Points of Departure of Macroeconomic Policy </H5>   The government considers macroeconomic stability to be one  of  the basic features determining the development of the Slovak  Republic's economy. The attainment of this stability is  conditional on the implementation of prudent budget, tax, wage,  price, subsidies, and customs policies. This means  drawing as close as possible in 1994 to zero-growth of GDP,  maintaining price growth in the range of 10 to 13 percent,  keeping unemployment under the 17 percent limit, and meeting the  commitment [not further specified, referring possibly to the  commitment to keep budget deficit under 4 percent of GDP as  recommended by the IMF]) in budget management.    In budget policy, the government will focus on closing the  unfavorable budget management for 1993 and the preceding years.  It will have to resolve the high deficit of the state  budget for 1993 bequeathed to it by the previous government.    To prevent the situation of 1993 from recurring, the  government will focus in 1994 on securing revenues for the state  budget. It will implement measures to mobilize budget  resources and, in strictly defined cases, reduce budget  expenditures and will strive, in general, to bring about order  in finances. It will adopt measures to prevent tax evasion,  reduce outstanding tax arrears, unblock claims abroad, and  address the issue of debts stemming from the pre-1993  period.    We will establish conditions for a more extensive  utilization  of the financing of development targets from foreign resources.  At the same time we want to make transparent the existing  system of obtaining foreign credits and assessing their  effectiveness. We will therefore tighten the criteria governing  the assumption of liabilities vis-a-vis foreign partners. We  consider it essential that every credit taken abroad should  establish prerequisites for its repayment and strengthen the  economic position of the Slovak Republic.  <H5>  Macroeconomic Policy </H5>   The government will adjust macroeconomic policy with a view  to attaining its macroeconomic targets. Without bringing about  a fundamental turnabout in the company sphere, we will not only  fail to achieve the set macroeconomic targets but the  unfavorable tendencies will continue to intensify. The  government's attention will center on speeding up the  commercialization [komercionalizacia] and transformation of  state enterprises in terms of ownership in order to finally  resolve the institutional vacuum, in which companies have  found themselves in the last four years and to shorten the  intolerably long pre-privatization agony of companies. With  respect to commercialized state enterprises, the government will  make use of the motivating function of managerial contracts and  will limit its interference to rigid financial control.    By its economic policy the government will establish  prerequisites for eliminating the causes of the intolerable  growth of company indebtedness and will take specific steps in  the legislative sphere, and to secure the course of court  proceedings in commercial matters and bankruptcy proceedings,  which will help speed up the financial restructuring of  companies. It will speed up negotiations on obtaining a loan  for restructuring the company and banking sphere (EFSAL)  [expanison unknown].    We will orient our efforts also toward improving the  competitive environment and finalizing the system, and  intensifying the activity, of institutions charged with  promoting the development of businesses, such as the National  Agency for the Support and Development of Small and Medium-Sized  Businesses, consultancy centers, Slovenska Zarucna Banka [Slovak  Guarantee Bank], and the like. In this process we will  cooperate with entrepreneurs's associations and with the Slovak  Chamber of Commerce and Industry.    We regard a strong private sector, operating on the  basis of market principles and private ownership, as the source  of Slovak economic prosperity. Therefore, we want to  expeditiously eliminate obstacles and restrictions to the  development of the private sector in the legislative and  administrative spheres and help tackle the financial  prerequisites for the further development of private  entrepreneurial activities.    We will support private activities even in those sectors of  public services that have until now been the exclusive domain of  the state.    Foreign investment, which should help eliminate the acute  shortage of capital, will represent one of the dynamizing  elements of the economy. We want to create a stable and  favorable entrepreneurial environment that will be attractive  also for foreign investors and take specific steps to facilitate  their becoming involved in the economy of the Slovak Republic.  We will establish conditions to substantially improve and  increase the flow of information to foreign investors and will  give support to those, whose entry will accelerate the  development of the economy.  <H5>  Privatization </H5>   One of the most serious causes of the intensification of  negative tendencies in the development of the economy was the  slowing down, and virtual halting, of privatization. Lack of  concept compounded by lack of transparency and exceptionally  hasty privatization in the closing days of the previous  government's term of office have brought about loss of  confidence [in privatization] among citizens. We consider it  our priority to restore the confidence of citizens and foreign  investors alike in the process of privatization in Slovakia. In  this spirit we are taking measures to speed up the privatization  process in such a way that, by the time the second wave of  coupon privatization is concluded, more than one-half of all  property in state ownership should get into private hands. At  the same time we will establish conditions for effective control  of privatization by the public.    The government will secure the equality of  privatization methods and the equality of participants in  privatization. It will consistently attend to making  privatization transparent and will prevent political  deformations of this process. In contrast to the preceding  government, which considered coupon privatization a residual  method and was deferring its preparation, this government will  approach it as an equal method and, within the  framework of its mandate, will also secure the commencement of  the second wave of coupon privatization.    We will speed up the realization of already prepared and  undisputed privatization projects by means of standard methods.  We will offer certain enterprises, or their parts, to domestic  and foreign interested parties who will demonstrate their  credibility and will submit the most interesting projects,  interesting not only in financial terms but also from the  viewpoint of entrepreneurial plans.  <H5>  Sectoral Policy </H5> <H5>  Industry, Construction, Trade, and Tourism </H5>   The government's priority in industry will be, above all,  raising the ability of Slovak products to compete. We consider  support for the restructuring and revitalization of industrial  companies to be the foundation of sectoral policy. We  will speed up the privatization of arms companies, which was  kept being delayed thus far, while at the same time securing the  state's adequate participation so as to be able to preserve the  strategic interests of defense and security.    In the sphere of energy, the government will draw  up a proposal for the organization, restructuring, and gradual  privatization of enterprises that are now in state ownership,  providing for well-considered participation by foreign capital.  Based on foreign experience, the government will proceed  particularly circumspectly in the process of transforming and  privatizing the energy sector in order to preserve the state's  energy sufficiency. It will prepare regulatory measures to  prevent unwarranted price increases in this sector.    Our main target in the construction industry, apart from  giving support to small entrepreneurs, will be to establish  conditions for the utilization of our large-scale capacities to  build transport infrastructure and complete unfinished  apartments and energy projects. We will take the necessary  steps to make possible the export of construction capacities.  We will speed up negotiations on the completion of the Mochovce  nuclear power plant.    The preceding government did not make use of the dynamizing  potentials of tourism for the development of the  Slovak economy. In contrast to the preceding government, we will  focus on the development of tourism with a view of increasing  its share in the generation of new jobs, revitalizing individual  regions, and increasing foreign exchange earnings.    We will speed up the privatization of companies engaged in  tourism, will prepare the institutional framework for tourism  promotion and a law on tourism, will intensify the promotion of  Slovakia, and the like.  <H5>  Transport, Communications, and Public Works </H5>   In the sector of transport and communications, we will  replace by pragmatic solutions the previous practice of  unsuitable interventions and statements, which brought about  stagnation in those areas and met with unfavorable response  abroad.    The government will draw up and submit to parliament for  discussion, still during its term of office, a draft amendment  to the Law on Railroads, a Bill on the Health Insurance of  Railroad Employees and the Railroad Employees' Health Insurance  Company, a Bill on Road Transportation, as well as a Bill on  Telecommunications.    It will follow up on all legislative and preparatory work  and  all studies and blueprints aimed at the development of  infrastructure in transportation, postal services and  communications, and the institution of public works and will  secure a more distinct progress of all those projects.    The need to take care of the citizens' housing  situation was not fully appreciated in the preceding period. We  will draw up, and will begin to implement, our own concept of  housing policy, including the completion of unfinished  apartments and infrastructure and amenities. We will  initiate and speed up the launching of privatization of the  housing stock and an increase of investments in the housing  economy. We will clarify the legal framework regarding  expropriation for projects in public interest.  <H5>  Agriculture </H5>   In agriculture, the government will orient its activities  toward meeting the basic strategic targets adopted by the  National Council of the Slovak Republic. We consider  agriculture to be one of our priorities. Establishing  prerequisites for stabilizing agriculture, halting a further  production decline, securing continuity of agricultural  production, and ensuring conditions for its qualitative growth  remain the primary tasks. We want to clarify the  arrangement of property relations and claims in agricultural  cooperatives, speed up the transformation of proprietary  relations with regard to soil, particularly the  privatization of state farms, and establish conditions for  agricultural enterprises' faster adaptation to the new  conditions.    Following up on the transformation of proprietary relations,  we are planning a new organizational arrangement of the forest  economy. The implementation of the program of remedial  measures in forests damaged by pollutants will continue by  drawing on domestic as well as foreign financial resources.  <H5>  Development of the Financial Sector </H5>   The government is interested in the formation of a  competitive commercial banking sector. In the endeavor to  contribute to this process, we will support measures designed to  continue the privatization of banks, improve the banks'  portfolio, and reinforce the banks' capital stock, including  reinforcement from outside capital resources. One of the aims  of this support is to significantly raise the level of Slovak  banks' international acceptance and to integrate them into the  international banking system as fully fledged members.    We will also devote attention to the expansion of  insurance services mitigating entrepreneurial risks,  particularly to insuring export credits. We will also give  consideration to a system of insuring citizens' bank  deposits and to the formation of credit cooperatives.  <H5>  Foreign Economic Policy </H5>   Some areas of foreign economic policy remained unresolved in  the preceding period. Essential measures designed to  protect the market in the transitional period, as well as  exceptionally needed export-promoting measures, kept being  delayed, which caused a further intensification of external  disequilibrium and economic decline.    We will therefore strive, above all, to give finishing  touches to export-promoting policy and to implement it  across-the-board in order support the export potentials of  Slovak companies. In justified cases we will also secure an  adequate protection of the internal market.   <H5>    Ecology and Economic Policy </H5>   In this chapter the government expresses its intentions to  separate the protection of natural resources from their  utilization, to distribute resources from the State  Environmental Fund not only from the viewpoint of the priorities  of individual districts but Slovakia as a whole, to consolidate  the Slovak Environmental Agency, and to complete legislation  related to the environment.  <H5>  Social Sphere </H5>   The rate of unemployment reached almost 14.8 percent in  February 1994, which represents almost 380,000 unemployed  registered with labor offices. In February 1994 the rate of  unemployment exceeded 20 percent in 14 districts, with the  district of Rimavska Sobota reporting a rate of unemployment of  26.7 percent. The growth of long-term unemployment (the average  period of registration represented 229 days at the end of 1993),  as well as the fact that, by the end of 1993, the category of  young people under 25 represented almost one-third of all  unemployed, must be regarded as a particularly negative  phenomenon.    Apart from the growth of unemployment, the  deterioration of the social situation and the living conditions  of the population in 1993 was also caused by another increase in  the cost of living, which went up 22.8 percent compared with the  preceding year, and by a 2.6 percent decline of real  earnings. Single-parent families, families with several  children, and pensioners are the worst off. The proportion of  households with children whose income in 1993 was lower than 1.5  times the subsistence minimum reached 61.9 percent, with 15.2  percent of households with children finding themselves below the  subsistence level. The unfavorable social situation of citizens  was tackled by means of the provision of welfare payments. A  total of 239,000 recipients of these payments were registered in  1993, more than 140,000 of whom were long-term unemployed.  Welfare payments were collected by 8.6 percent of households  with dependent children.    From the viewpoint of the situation in the sphere of  employment, the government will reassess, on the basis of a  thorough analysis of the labor market, the instruments of active  employment policy, while respecting the demand that financial  resources be spent rationally and effectively and while  respecting the situation on regional labor markets. It will  place particular emphasis on active employment  policy, on reassessing the provision of material benefits  also from the viewpoint of the gradual transfer of this care to  the insurance system, as well as on expanding the  possibilities for our citizens to assert themselves in the work  process, and protecting the labor market, by means of  bilateral contracts with other states.    The transformation of the existing systems of pension  schemes, health insurance, state social payments, and welfare  payments into systems of social insurance, state social support,  and social assistance remains the government's basic conceptual  intention in the sphere of social security.    From the viewpoint of topical tasks in the sphere of social  security, we consider it necessary:    -- to tackle the issue of child allowances as the key form  of  state transfer payments for families with children,    -- to analyze the functionality of the National Insurance  Company,    -- to create legislative foundations for a system of  supplementary pension insurance,    -- to continue to gradually create conditions for humanizing  the care of physically and mentally severely disabled persons  and elderly citizens, with particular emphasis on the actual  guarantee of their rights,    -- and to gradually establish conditions for the activity of  non- state entities in the social sphere.  <H5>  Health Care </H5>   The present unfavorable situation in health care results  from  the disrupted continuity of the 1992 health care reform and from  the introduction of some incorrect systemic steps, compounded by  a drastic cut in financial resources.    As of 31 December 1993 health care establishments  reported unpaid bills of Sk1.8 billion, of which bills for  medical drugs account for Sk1.2 billion. The remainder is made  up of bills for energy, fuel, and food supplies and  reconstruction and modernization projects.    Health care has found itself in a critical financial  situation, as a consequence of which one can also speak about a  high level of hidden indebtedness (which is estimated at Sk50  billion).    In 1992, 17.1 billion Czechoslovak korunas were spent on the  operation of health care facilities, in 1993 Sk16.2 billion,  and, disregarding inflation and the introduction of systemic  measures, the use of only Sk14.2 billion was projected for 1994.    The government's main aim in the sphere of health care will  be to deal with the financial crisis, which directly threatens  the provision of health care and slows down the transformation  process. The following measures are inevitable to ward off an  imminent collapse:    -- to quantify and specify the justified demands of health  care on the state budget for 1993 and determine the method of  settling the liabilities of health care facilities,    -- to find ways of alleviating the budget deficit in health  care for 1994,    -- to carry out changes in the existing system of payments  for health services.    In the sphere of financing health care and health insurance,  the government will strive to establish conditions to  financially secure the provision of basic health care, support  the development of the Health Insurance Fund, and secure its  independent operation.    The system of assessing the value of health services  introduced as of 1 October 1993 will have to be replaced by a  new solution that will be more effective, simpler, less  demanding administratively, and less costly. The new system  will have to be prepared in a differentiated way, separately for  individual types of health care providers.    We will continue to privatize health care facilities,  using publicly controllable criteria. In the course of April we  will ensure the drafting and publication of conditions for the  privatization of pharmacies and health spas. Changes in  ownership must not jeopardize the therapeutic functions of  natural springs spas. A majority participation by the  state in the privatization of key spa facilities is  foreseen. By the end of June 1994 we will prepare  documents for the privatization of primary health care  establishments.    In connection with the implementation of essential changes  to  the existing system of payments for health services, the  government will establish conditions for a solution to the wage  conditions of health care employees.  <H5>  School System, Education, and Science </H5>   High educational and cultural standards of the population  represent the basic source of a state's wealth. Advanced  countries pursue the strategy of growth of investments into the  sphere of education and science. In defiance of this worldwide  trend, both the conceptual and the everyday issues concerning  the development of education, science, and research have been  neglected in our country of late.    The budget of the department of education and science has  been cut by Sk2.795 billion over the last two years. The  already low budget for 1994 is further reduced by a debt of  Sk298 million stemming from the year 1993. The situation  is so grave that, if education retained all its functions at the  level of 1993, the budget resources allocated for education and  science would be exhausted in the 9th month of 1994, even if the  price level remained constant. The situation is compounded  by the fact that no legal norms have been drawn up and  introduced into practice that would make it possible to  introduce progressive forms of management into schools and  educational establishments.    As a result of the grim situation in the sphere of education  and science, which is documented, for example, by the breakup of  kindergartens, school catering, and school accommodation, the  government will pay particular heed to ensuring a calm  completion of the 1993/94 school year and preparation of the new  1994/95 school year.    For this reason we consider it unavoidable to write off  the 1993 debts of schools and educational establishments, to  adequately amend the state budget for education and science for  1994, and to reassess the existing structure of revenues and  expenditures in the department of education. We will  explore additional sources of revenue at home and abroad.    The government regards as one of the decisive tasks the  formulation of the republic's strategic interests in the sphere  of education and training and the commencement of work on  drafting the National Program of Education and  Training.    The government will ensure the drafting of the Concept  of Developing University Education in the Slovak Republic Until  the Year 2010 and the transformation of the existing system  into a system that will flexibly react to the needs of the labor  market and will be compatible with the system of education in  the countries of the European Union. Based on experience from  the implementation of the law on higher educational  establishments, the government will establish prerequisite for  the drafting of a new law or for amending the existing law.    We want to consistently support the development of science  and technology in the directions designated as priorities as an  important prerequisite of economic, social, and cultural growth  under the conditions of an unfolding market economy. We  will submit to the National Council of the Slovak Republic for  adoption a law on state support for science and technology.  We will propose the establishment of the Slovak Republic State  Fund for Science and Technology as well as an independent Slovak  Republic Grant Agency for Science and Technology, which should  help preserve and develop the intellectual base of the state and  prevent academics and researchers from leaving universities and  research institutes. The government will also ensure a regular  and consistent process of mutual recognition [akreditacia] of  universities and the research and development base.    Based on a realistic assessment of the present situation in,  and standard of, physical education and sports, we want to  establish the necessary institutional, legislative, and economic  conditions for the development of physical education and sports,  with emphasis on financing them from central sources through the  medium of the State Physical Education Fund. By giving  support to top-performance sports, we will contribute to the  successful representation of the Slovak Republic in sports.    For the needs of public administration and division of  powers  between state administration and self-administrative bodies, the  government will draft an optimal variant of management and  administration of primary and secondary schools, providing for  the gradual transfer of some of the powers of central bodies of  state administration to local state administration and  self-administrative bodies.  <H5>  Culture </H5>   The government will draft a basic concept of  long-term strategy for developing culture under the conditions  of the transformation of the economic and social system.  It will also prepare a basic model of the organizational  arrangement and financing of culture, a model that will ensure  functional ties in the emerging market environment.    The government's basic aim is to establish legislative  prerequisites for the transition from the central financing of  culture toward providing incentives, and introducing  preferences, for investments in this sphere. At the same time,  it is necessary to retain the possibility of supporting  directly, by means of the state-run PRO SLOVAKIA [capitalization  as published] fund, those areas of culture, in which the market  instruments do not assert themselves. We will support the  drafting of an analysis of the functioning of this fund, with  emphasis on the attainment of the expected targets and its  position. [sentence as published]    We will continue our efforts to finalize the legislative,  political, and social scope for the functioning of media at the  level of the European standard. The law on the mass media, now  in preparation, and the law on economic support for the  periodical press will lay the groundwork for this.    Complicated problems arise from the failure to approve the  license for the second channel of Slovak Television. This issue  will have to be resolved as soon as possible.  <H5>  Ethnic Policy </H5>   We would like to achieve social consensus that will  guarantee  the stability and peaceful coexistence of all citizens of the  Slovak Republic, regardless of nationality and the color of  their skin. A prerequisite for this necessary consensus is the  mutuality of rights and duties, combined with the civic  principle. The government is prepared to provide all necessary  guarantees of rights to persons belonging to ethnic minorities.  On the other hand, it expects the fulfillment of constitutional  civic duties, which is an important prerequisite for ruling out  instances of ultra-nationalism, irredentism, and separatism.    Instead of confrontation, we will introduce the mechanism of  permanent dialogue as a method that promotes cooperation and  seeks consensus in generating and exercising rights of citizens  belonging to ethnic minorities.  <H5>  State, Democracy, Law, and Public Order </H5>   In this extensive chapter the government pledges to continue  to devolve powers to the community self-administration bodies.  It will explore the possibilities of introducing the  institution of the ombudsman. It will strive to eliminate  shortcomings in state administration resulting from  procrastination, incompetence, and the like. It will continue  to implement the concept of stabilizing the judiciary and the  long-term program of combating crime, particularly organized  crime and the legalization of income originating from organized  crime.   <H5>    Aims and Tasks in Legislation </H5>   In this chapter the government undertakes to speed up the  adoption of legislative norms compatible with laws of the  European Union. It is determined to pass in the National  Council of the Slovak Republic a law on the conflict of  interests in the performance of duties, pertaining to  constitutional officials and higher-level state administration  officials. It will prepare a law on the obligation to prove the  origin of financial resources used in privatization. The  government wants to improve the legislative conditions for the  functioning of the entrepreneurial and non-profit spheres.  <H5>  Security and Defense of the State </H5>   In this chapter the government undertakes to finalize  conceptual documents pertaining to the Slovak Republic's  security and defense policy and to submit to the National  Council of the Slovak Republic a document specifying cooperation  with NATO. It wants to get ahead with the transformation of the  army and make a more efficient use of resources.  <H5>  Foreign Policy </H5>   The basic principles of foreign policy, approved by the  National Council of the Slovak Republic when the Slovak Republic  was founded, do not change with a change in government. The  present government wants to build on the results achieved  heretofore, even though it has its own ideas about  non-confrontational methods and about creating a more positive  image of Slovakia abroad.

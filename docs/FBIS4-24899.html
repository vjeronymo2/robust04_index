			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Tao Tao: "$6b Investment for Post, Telecom"] </F>   [Text] China will invest a record of 53.6 billion yuan  ($6.2 billion) into the post and telecommunications sector this  year to expand and modernize the country's communications  network.    Part of the investment will be used to transform microwave  lines from analog to digital ones, said the Ministry of Posts  and Telecommunications.    Of the more than 55,000 kilometres of microwave links,  nearly  30,000 kilometres of analog microwave lines need to be  digitalized to increase their transmission capacity.    Although China can manufacture digital microwave equipment,  foreign products are more competitive with sound technology,  reliability and stability.    The ministry is also speeding up the construction of  high-capacity fibre-optic cables and a nationwide optical cable  network will be completed by the end of the century.    Fibre-optic cables will be the main lines of transmission in  the country with a planned eight north-south and eight east-west  lines to be completed in the next six years. By then, more than  300 cities above prefecture level will be linked up with the  network.    After the committee on the control of exports to communist  countries was abolished last year, the ban on the export of  high-capacity optical cables was also lifted by Western  countries.    The ministry is planning to import optical cables, and more  than 10 foreign companies are competing to sell their products.  More than 30,000 calls can be made simultaneously on a pair of  fibre-optics.    At present, China can manufacture less powerful fibre  optical  cables.    And the construction of satellite earth stations are also  planned by the ministry. It is hoped that each provincial  capital city will have a satellite earth station by the end of  the century.    The bigger the level of investment and the greater the  expansion of the nationwide telecommunication network, the more  opportunities will be available for foreign countries and  companies to supply their products to China.    According to the ministry's plan for this year, another 12  million telephone lines will be added to the exchange capacity,  bringing the total switch capacity in the country to 52 million  lines by the end of this year.    There are also plans to install 9 million new telephones,  compared with 5.9 million new ones added last year.    And the ministry aims to push the telephone switch capacity  to more than 110 million by the end of the century. By then,  China will have one of the world's largest telephone systems.    The rapid expansion of China's telecommunications network is  expected to continue to benefit overseas partners because a  large percentage of equipment is imported.    To meet the huge domestic demand, a number of joint ventures  with foreign telecom giants, such as NEC, Siemens and Motorola,  have been established to manufacture the urgently-needed  equipment. But further imports of equipment are still needed  for the domestic market.    Although the expansion of the telephone network requires a  lot of equipment, the ministry will not approve the sale of  switch equipment to China by new foreign telecom manufacturers.  At present, the main foreign suppliers of telephone switches  and joint ventures are Fujitsu (F-150), NEC (NEAX-61), Siemens  (EWSD), Alcatel (E-lOB), Ericsson (AXE 10), Northern Telecom  (DMS 100), AT&amp;T (5 ESS) and Shanghai Bell (S-1240).    The more competition among the foreign manufacturers, the  more opportunities and benefits for China, analysts said.    Ministry officials said that only digital or stored  programme  controlled telephone switches will be imported in the future.    On the other hand, the ministry is keen to attract foreign  loans to assist the development of the sector.    A total of $5.1 billion in foreign loans have been used in  the past decade. And it is expected that more and more foreign  loans will be used in the future.</p>

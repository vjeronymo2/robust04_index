			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The San Diego Housing Commission on Monday unanimously endorsed the concept of  establishing a Housing Trust Fund and authorized a task force to conduct a  $50,000 study of methods of raising money for the fund.  </P> <P> Proposed by Evan Becker, the commission's executive director, the fund is  envisioned as a method of raising revenue from sources other than the federal  government, which has dramatically reduced contributions to affordable housing  over the eight years of former President Reagan's Administration.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, so-called "linkage fees" on commercial development, taxes,  license fees, charitable donations and unclaimed lottery winnings might be used  to pay for home construction and rehabilitation, rent subsidies, home buyer  assistance or homeless programs.  </P> <P> The task force will report to the commission within six months.  </P></p>

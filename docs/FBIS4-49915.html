			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] The UN Security Council yesterday unanimously  adopted a resolution on imposing further economic sanctions  against Haiti. The resolution will come into force at 0000 on 22  May. The resolution calls on various countries to forbid all  imports from and exports to Haiti with the exception of food,  medicine, and items for humanitarian purposes. It also calls  for banning air and sea transportation to Haiti except scheduled  transportation for passengers. The resolution emphatically  points out that the UN Security Council will remove all  sanctions against Haiti only when Haiti's military rulers step  down and the executive power of Aristide, the democratically  elected president of Haiti, is returned and restored.    The UN Security Council resolution was proposed by the  United  States, France, Argentina, and other countries.    China maintains its reservations, although China voted for  the resolution. Chen Jian, deputy representative of China's  permanent mission to the United Nations, emphatically pointed  out in his speech that China's persistent stand is not in favor  of using sanctions as a method to resolve conflicts. The  sanctions measure included in the resolution is a special  measure to be taken under the extremely special situation in  Haiti at present.</p>

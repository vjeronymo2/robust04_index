			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Baker poised to take over re-election campaign THE TRANSFER of Mr James Baker from the US State Department to effective control of President George Bush's re-election campaign may be announced within the next 24 hours. Mr Bush refused to confirm or deny what he called 'press speculation' about his secretary of state and long-time confidant in a television interview on Tuesday night. But several officials said yesterday the announcement could come today or tomorrow. It is not clear whether Mr Baker will resign as secretary of state formally, or merely step aside for the duration of the campaign. In either event, it is likely that his deputy, Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, will take over the formal reins of foreign policy. No confirmation hearings by Congress would be required for this move until after the election. It is increasingly assumed that Mr Baker will operate from the administration, probably as a special counsellor, rather than the campaign organisation. This would get round a provision of the 1989 Ethics Act that restricts communications between past and present members of the government. Mr Lloyd Cutler, a prominent Washington lawyer and political insider, noted in a column in the Washington Post this week that the provision could have prevented Mr Baker from talking to other cabinet members about policy issues.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text]  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   In the past, the ashing machines used in mass production  operations were primarily of the batch processing type capable  of processing numerous wafers at the same time. However,  recently, semiconductor manufacturers have been using batch-type  ashing machines and/or single-wafer ashing machines, depending  on the process involved, as a means of maximizing efficiency.    This is the result of the problems encountered in trying to  rely solely on batch-type ashing machines to remove the  photoresist used in masks for high energy ion implantations  during the diffusion process now that wafers are getting larger  in diameter and manufacturers are switching from specific CFC  agents to halogen-type gases in the etching process as a means  of eliminating CFCs from that process altogether.    The manufacturers of ashing machines are carrying out  development work aimed at responding to these new requirements,  and in practically every case, they are focusing on single-wafer  ashing machines capable of accurately controlling process  conditions. Although single-wafer ashing machines offer the best  processing and status control for individual wafers, they suffer  from low throughput when processing wafers that are not capable  of being processed at high temperatures.    In this report, we study techniques for high-speed ashing  with the goal in mind of enhancing the throughput of  single-wafer ashing machines.  <H5>  High-speed Ashing </H5>   The ashing rate is largely dependent on the temperature of  the substrate during processing. Heating the stage that the  substrate is loaded on to 200xC or higher enables an ashing  throughput rate of between 2-3fm/minute. However, since there  are those substrates that cannot be subjected to such high  temperatures, the definition of high-speed ashing will differ  for different types of substrates.    That is, as long as the substrate undergoing the  single-wafer  ashing process does not contain metal, such as aluminum  conductors, conventional processing can be readily applied since  the substrate can be processed at high temperatures, and  throughput will be higher than that for batch-type ashing  machines. However, when the substrate contains aluminum or other  metal conductors, the task is to see how far reaction efficiency  can be raised while maintaining the actual temperature of the  substrate at under 200xC. And in the case of the resist used in  ion implantation masks, the task is to strip the resist from the  surface without bursting the hardened surface layer, and to see  how much processing time can be shortened in the process.    Whatever the situation, the key is to facilitate the control  of the actual temperature of the substrate while seeing how  efficiently the reaction can be advanced. And it must be a  process for which charge-up and irradiation damage, and  contamination are minimal.    The following is a list of the capabilities that must be  developed to realize each of these requirements.    Those capabilities related to the plasma source are as  follows:    [1] The ability to supply stably and with high efficiency  active species (primarily neutral particles) to the substrate to  achieve a high rate of processing and process repeatability;    [2] The ability to confine to a certain extent charged  particles to the plasma generation region without the use of  grid electrodes or magnetic fields so as to achieve a high rate  of processing with low damage;    [3] A heating system that readily controls the actual  temperature of the substrate and a means of eliminating thermal  factors other than the heat of reaction.    Those capabilities that will have to be developed for  processing substrates containing aluminum conductors and other  metals are as follows:    [1] The ability to achieve a practical ashing rate (goal is  more than 2.0fm/min for 8-inch wafers) at the mass production  level while maintaining the actual temperature of the substrate  at under 200xC during the separate oxygen plasma processes;    [2] The ability to clear each of the target values in the  various damage evaluations (non-volatile memory evaluation, and  BT and other contamination evaluations).    And the capabilities needed to remove the resist used on  high-concentration ion implantation masks are as follows:    [1] The ability to strip at high speeds the resist from the  hardened surface layer with minimal ion collision (ion dose);    [2] The ability to process at high speed and with little  damage the internal unaltered layer after stripping the resist  from the surface layer;    [3] The ability to achieve homogeneity (in-plane) of less  than q5%.    Development items related to other processes are as  foillows:    [1] The ability to remove polymers following various etching  processes utilizing halogen gas;    [2] The development of conveyance mechanisms that will make  it possible to get the most out of process performance.    Although the thinking at the various ashing machine  manufacturers differs as to how to accomplish it, they are all  studying ways to create processes and hardware capable of  satisfying the above-described requirements for single-wafer  ashing machines.  <H5>  Current State of High-speed Ashing </H5>   Figure 1 shows a diagram of a basic ashing machine chamber.  The process data put forth below gives characteristic data  obtained from Tokyo Oka Kogyo's new single-wafer ashing machine  ``TCA-3822'' as reference values.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-36A>      Figure 1. Diagram of TCA-3822 Plasma Chamber </FIG>     It was initially assumed that a high ashing rate  (2.0fm/min.)  with low damage could be achieved using an oxygen plasma alone  while maintaining actual substrate temperature at under 200xC if  we established a reaction system comprised primarily of neutral  particles (radicals and oxygen atoms in a normal state) and  carried out process control using the hardware.    However, we found that a high ashing rate could not be  achieved with a reaction system comprised solely of pure neutral  paticles, and that minute amounts of oxygen ions would also be  required. We also realized that to keep damage to the minimum,  it would also be necessary to distribute this minute amount of  oxygen ions (and electrons) uniformly on the surface of the  substrate.    Based on these discoveries, we (Tokyo Oka Kogyo) took the  measures discussed below, and by so doing, reached the  conclusion that a practical ashing rate of around 2.0fm/min. can  be achieved even when substrate temperature is held to below  200xC.    First of all, in addition to efficiently supplying active  species (mostly neutral particles), we also adopted a large  capacity (3.0slm) high-speed evacuation structure capable of  evacuating the reaction-producing gases in a short period of  time.    Next, we developed a plasma source capable of stable  discharge under a wide range of pressures.    We are designing an electrode structure that will enable the  direction of the high frequency field of the new plasma source  we developed to remain constantly fixed, and by comparing ashing  operations using this new electrode with those using our own  conventional electrodes, we are steadily improving discharge  stability. Improved discharge stability suppresses the effects  of the process parameters, and makes it possible to achieve wide  process margins. Furthermore, emission spectrum comparisons of  the reaction region showed that even if high output is applied,  the oxygen ion dose is roughly 1/5-1/8 or less of the  conventional dosage. We have also been able to confirm the  outstanding effects of stable discharge on the confinability of  charged particles in the plasma generation region1).    Figure 2 shows the results of comparisons of emission  spectrum data obtained using the company's conventional  electrode and the new electrode we recently developed.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-37A>      Figure 2. Comparison of Emission Spectrum Data </FIG>     Thirdly, we controlled process conditions in the downstream  region (transport process) so that the traces of oxygen ions and  electrons that reached the substrate without completely  vanishing cannot cause a large potential distribution.    By taking the above-described measures, we were able to  achieve an ashing rate of better than 1.8fm/min on 8-inch  wafers, which was close to our goal of 2.0fm/min., and in-plane  homogeneity of less than q5%.    The actual temperature of the silicon substrate during this  ashing process was less than 200xC. Figure 3 shows related  measurement data. This data was obtained by applying resist to a  special temperature measurement substrate with a thermocouple  embedded directly into it, and measuring the substrate  temperature during the ashing process. The temperature of the  substrate rose during the ashing process as a result of the heat  of reaction, but dropped again as soon as the ashing process was  complete.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-37B>      Figure 3. Temperature of Si Substrate (Under 200xC) </FIG>     Figure 4 shows measurement data on a substrate whose  temperature was held to less than 250xC during ashing. This  process achieved an ashing rate of less than 4.0fm/min. and  in-plane homogeneity of under q8%, indicating that it would be  beneficial for ashing processes where processing temperatures  are not restricted very much.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-37C>      Figure 4. Temperature of Si Substrate (Under 250xC) </FIG>     Next, Figure 5 provides data on plasma damage measured using  the SCA method. This method measured as Qox values the amount of  surface charge increase resulting from plasma processing.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-38A>      Figure 5. Plasma Damage Measured Using the SCA Method </FIG>     This data indicated that the new high-speed single-wafer  ashing machine exhibited smaller damage values than the coaxial  batch ashing machine so widely used in mass production  operations at present (the high-speed single-wafer ashing  machine also achieved very favorable results when subjected to  evaluation methods using non-volatile memory.).    Next, a physical reaction accompanied by ion collision is  essential to the high-speed stripping of resist used in  high-concentration ion implantation masks. And damage should be  slight if the process can control, uniformly and to the lowest  limits, the ion energy irradiated on the wafer separate from the  plasma generation mechanism.    There have been a lot of papers written in recent years on  the removal of dopant that accumulates on substrates in the form  of oxides following the removal of ion implantation resist2). In  tests carried out by Tokyo Oka Kogyo, we were able to confirm  that after-treatment or post-processing using plasma directly  following the ashing process was effective against inorganic  residue (See Figure 6).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-38B>      Figure 6. Plasma Post-processing Directly Following Ashing </FIG>     In addition, from the standpoint of improving total  throughput, to include derating wet-stripping processes, we will  talk briefly about sidewall removal following dry etching.    The residue left following metal etching in particular,  because it contains metals among its constituents, is difficult  to remove completely using dry-stripping processes involving  oxygen alone, giving rise to studies aimed at adding a gas  process (right now, this residue is being removed by the  combined use of an alkaline solvent in the wet-stripping  process.)3).    The development task is to determine how much the  ``roughness'' and ``cracking'' in the bed caused by an  additional gas process can be held in check, and how well  processing can be achieved with ordinary cleaning without using  alkaline solvents. The target is a completely dry-stripping  process.  <H5>  Conclusions </H5>   Future ashing machines will be required to achieve faster  total processing times, which means it will be necessary to  develop high-speed processing capabilities that include the  development of processes that meet all requirements and  improving the hardware aspects of these processes, such as  shortening conveyance and stand-by times.    Ashing machine manufacturers will have to be persistent in  their development operations, and the development of rational  machines will be an absolute condition for accurately meeting  users' needs. Here at Tokyo Oka Kogyo, we intend to strengthen  our development and commercialization efforts even further to  enable the provision of more advanced machines that meet our  customers' expectations.

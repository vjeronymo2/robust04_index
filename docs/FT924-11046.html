			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Russia says IMF talks may be postponed TALKS scheduled for mid-November between the Russian government and the International Monetary Fund are likely to be postponed until next year because of the worsening political climate in the country. Mr Alexei Mozhin, head of the department for relations with international financial institutions, said yesterday that 'normally we would have a timetable fixed for negotiations with the fund - but the political uncertainties in the country now make it impossible'. The IMF negotiating team is scheduled to return to Moscow on November 10 for the talks, which are critically important for the Russian economy. Mr Mozhin said the government still 'would like to have an agreement with the IMF as soon as possible'. So far, only Dollars 1bn of a promised Dollars 24bn package of support has been released by the IMF. A further allocation of Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn can be paid only when the terms of a standby agreement have been reached. Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister with responsibility for foreign economic relations, said yesterday that the monthly inflation target agreed with the IMF earlier this year, of 9 per cent, was unlikely to be reached, and that actual inflation could be double that. He warned that if the government was forced to index pensions and stipends and double the minimum wage, as decreed by the Russian parliament earlier this month, then 'we could slide into hyperinflation'. Talks will start today in Paris on the former Soviet debt, variously estimated between Dollars 70bn and Dollars 80bn. The Russian side will say that it has practically no hard currency reserves, and that it can pay only between Dollars 2.5bn and Dollars 3bn next year, with even that dependent on the receipt of credits. Mr Mozhin said the expected financing gap for next year, worked out by the IMF and the government, was 'dozens of billions of dollars'. It included the scheduled debt repayments for 1993 of Dollars 20bn, arrears from this year estimated at around Dollars 8bn and a widening trade gap. The rouble again plunged in trading in Moscow yesterday, losing 25 points from Thursday's level to stand at Rbs393 to the dollar. It now stands at a little over a third of its rate in July of 135 per dollar.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Havana Cuba Vision Network in Spanish at  0200 GMT on 24 March carries live its "Open Agenda" program with  host Antonio Resillez and his guests Ambassador Eumelio  Caballero, chief of the Foreign Ministry's multilateral  department, and Ivan Mora, a specialist of the Foreign Ministry.    Resillez begins the program by noting that many Cubans  believe that the only thing discussed by the UN Human Rights  Commission is the so-called Cuban case. He goes on to point out  that the Human Rights Commission discusses other things related  to political and social issues, such as child pornography,  trafficking of children, etc.    In that sense, Caballero says: "I am very happy that this  has  been brought up in this program for our viewers -- the work  carried out by the Human Rights Commission. I myself have  sometimes had the perception that the Human Rights Commission is  related to the Cuban case only, when that is only a small part  of the work that our delegation does in Geneva."    In reviewing some of the issues discussed at the Human  Rights  Commission, Mora says: "Cuba is not sitting on the stand as a  defendant regarding Human Rights. When we talk about human  rights we must talk about human rights violations that are  taking place around the world." Mora goes on to say: "Small  countries, like Cuba, are developing different initiatives in  defense of the interests of the World, the Third World,  defending the interests of the greater populations of the Third  World. Cuba has been making headway in this area every year. As  a matter of fact, Cuba has received the recognition from the  Third World for the sacrifices that Cuba has to face."    Answering Resillez's question on how many propositions and  resolutions Cuba participated in during the 50th session, Mora  notes: "Cuba was the delegation that presented the largest  number of initiatives at the 50th session. They totaled 10, six  of which were discarded despite the large support by the Third  World. Some were even adopted by consensus, such as the issue on  the environment, which is an issue of great concern among many  countries of the North as well as of the South. Cuba sponsored  amendments to approximately 20 resolutions, and cosponsored  another 25 resolutions."    Mora goes on to say: "We are talking about space gained by  Cuba on the international scene, which represents a great deal  of respect in the international arena."    Resillez asks about the vote on the special rapporteur for  Cuba to which Caballero responds: "Something important happened  at the session. The fact is that the United States, despite all  its capacity to apply pressure and being the power that leads  the unipolar world, lost three votes in favor while the number  of abstentions rose from 15 to 20. In UN terms, this sends a  message. This means that this year, the majority of the  commission of 53 members was not dragged by the United States  into this vendetta against Cuba. If we add the abstentions, of  which there were 20, with the votes in favor of Cuba, in this  case against the resolution, which totaled nine, this means that  29 countries, more than half, pronounced themselves against it.  I believe this is significant because the United States reached  the highest point it could reach on the manipulation of the  issue against Cuba, and now the retreat has begun. That is the  best reading or analysis."    Resillez asks about reaction from other delegations to the  secret U.S. Interest Section document. On this topic, Mora  responds: "I believe this document favored the vote. In other  words, it was an element that supported something we had been  saying for several years, which is also recognized by the great  majority of the members of the United Nations. The document  caused a great deal of bewilderment among the U.S. delegation.  It was a scandal where they had been caught red-handed in their  action of condemning alleged human rights violations in Cuba,  when it was demonstrated through the document that it was all a  great lie."    In that sense, Mora goes on to say that the document was  important because it characterized those people and groups in  the United States who are interested in subordinating the  revolution to the will of the empire.    Regarding the special rapporteur Caballero says: "The Cuban  people should not feel complexes or be worried about the fact  that there is a special rapporteur or that the Cuban case is on  the agenda of the Human Rights Commission." He goes on to say:  "The international community, including countries allied with  the United States, understand that in Cuba there is no  systematic violation or problem with human rights. That is well  understood by the international community. Sometimes -- Ivan has  seen this -- after voting against us many of these delegates  approach us to excuse themselves and to say that they are sorry  that they voted that way, but that they had been forced to do  so. In other words, there is an understanding on the  international arena that we do not have this type of problem in  Cuba."    Caballero adds: "The most important thing is that just a few  days ago, in New York, the Latin American group endorsed Cuba's  reelection to the Human Rights Commission."    Answering Resillez's question on the group of Nobel Prize  Winners who will visit Cuba, Mora remarks: "The Foreign Ministry  is studying the composition of the group that will visit us. We  reject the imposition of the special rapporteur since it was  done violating all the procedures established by the United  Nations, but at the same time we have absolutely nothing to  hide. That is why we want international personalities, Nobel  Prize winners, to see what our actual situation is. It will be a  good opportunity for them to see the effects of the U.S.  blockade against Cuba."</p>

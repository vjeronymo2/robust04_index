			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / London forecast to attract foreign companies CHANGES TO advance corporation tax that were proposed in the March Budget will make the UK a more attractive location for foreign-owned multinational groups to locate their European headquarters. That is the conclusion of a report by the City Research Project, a three-year study into London's competitive position in international financial services. Mr Stanislas Yassukovich, chairman of the project, said that before the Budget a number of foreign-owned financial services companies based in the UK had been considering relocating to other European countries. US banks in London, for instance, are disadvantaged under the present ACT regime if they remit profits from European operations through a London headquarters to their US parents in the form of dividends. They cannot reclaim or offset ACT payable on dividends. Mr Chris Higson of the London Business School, one of the authors of the report, said that under current ACT rules companies located in London suffered a 7 per cent tax disadvantage compared with those located in the Netherlands, the country regarded as the most tax-advantageous in Europe. He said under the proposed rules companies which chose to locate in the UK would have a 3 per cent advantage over those in the Netherlands. The Budget proposed a system of 'foreign income dividends' under which dividends paid out of non-UK income would not be liable to UK ACT. Mr Higson said the benefits of the proposed changes were much smaller for multinational companies with UK parents than for those with overseas parents. Commenting on the City's new security cordon, Mr Yassukovich said there was no anecdotal evidence to suggest that security issues were much of a determinant in companies' decisions to locate in London. He said all countries faced some security problems. Implications of Surplus ACT for the Location of Financial Services. Corporation of London, PR Office, PO Box 270, Guildhall, London EC2P 2EJ.

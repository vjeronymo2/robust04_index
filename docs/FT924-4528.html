			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Mexico City suffers worst air pollution MEXICO City has the most polluted air of any large city, according to a report published yesterday by the World Health Organisation and the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep). The report, which looks at 20 of the world's 'megacities' with populations of about 10m says London, New York and Tokyo have the least air pollution. The UN estimates that by the year 2000, 47 per cent of the world's population will live in urban areas. 'Air pollution is now an almost inescapable part of urban life throughout the world. WHO guidelines are being regularly exceeded' in many cities, it says. According to the study, which draws on 15 years of research, traffic fumes are the single biggest cause of air pollution in nearly half the cities. The UN expects the the number of vehicles in the world - 630m - will double in the next 20 to 30 years. The WHO and Unep warn that air pollution directly affects breathing and circulation, and can bring 'increased deaths, disease and disability'. They add that 'some of the 'megacities' have approached the same massive air pollution levels of the notorious London smogs of 40 years ago'. The study looked at six pollutants: sulphur dioxide (SO) mainly from industry and power generation; dirt particles in the air from domestic fires, power and industry; lead and carbon monoxide (CO), mainly from vehicles; and nitrogen dioxide and ozone, caused by the combination of heavy traffic and sunshine. In Mexico City, levels of SO, CO, lead, airborne dirt and ozone were more than double WHO recommended levels. Airborne dirt was also a serious problem in 11 other cities: Bangkok, Beijing, Bombay, Cairo, Calcutta, Delhi, Jakarta, Karachi, Manila, Seoul and Shanghai. Cairo and Karachi also had particularly high lead levels and Los Angeles, Sao Paulo and Tokyo had serious ozone problems. Although ozone present in the middle regions of the atmosphere protects people and crops from harmful ultraviolet radiation, when present near the ground it can cause breathing problems and headaches.</p>

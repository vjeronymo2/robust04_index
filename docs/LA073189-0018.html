			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> ORGAN TRANSCRIPTIONS OFFER MIXED RESULTS  </P> <P> While the movement for authentic performance practice may still be in full  swing, Jared Jacobsen longs for the days when transcriptions were the  organist's stock in trade.  </P> <P> On Friday night at the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, Jacobsen offered an  entire program of transcriptions on the 265-rank Hazel Wright organ. The  results were mixed.  </P> <P> Transcriptions generate a unique set of problems. If you take a score written  for the clarity of the piano, like Prokofiev's Toccata, Opus 11, and alter it  for the dramatic reverberations of a pipe organ (as in the Jean Guillou  transcription heard here), have you violated the composer's original intention?  And if so, have you spoiled the integrity of the music or created a new work?  </P> <P> Idiomatic or not, it is difficult to listen to an arrangement of a well-known  composition without imagining it in its original form. Admittedly, the  Prokofiev-Guillou toccata is an effective, hair-raising piece and Jacobsen has  the virtuosity it requires. Still, its wildness balances just this side of a  fiery blur and it is impossible to avoid comparing it to the crackling  brilliance of the original.  </P> <P> The cornerstone of Jacobsen's program, his own transcription of "Pictures at an  Exhibition," engendered its own set of problems.  </P> <P> Caught between Mussorgsky's virtuosic piano original and Ravel's oft-programmed  arrangement, Jacobsen accomplished neither the brilliance of the former nor the  colors of the latter -- and sometimes the results were downright ponderous.  </P> <P> There were interesting effects, however, such as antiphonal choirs for the  promenade that leads to "The Market Place at Limoges" and again for  "Baba-Yaga." But the most successful use of organ was in the "Catacombs" and  "The Great Gate of Kiev." Here, implied ties to Russian Orthodoxy clearly lend  themselves to this devotional instrument.  </P> <P> The power of the Crystal Cathedral's pipe organ beckons enticingly. Jacobsen  wielded that power for some deafening jolts, opening with a Guillou-Jacobsen  version of Liszt's "Fantasia and Fugue on B-A-C-H" and closing with a blustery  toccata on "Thou Art the Rock," by Henri Mulat.  </P> <P> Still, the most satisfying sections were the calmest ones. The single flute  stop for the adagio of J.S. Bach's transcription of Vivaldi's Violin Concerto  in A minor cloaked the sanctuary in introspection; the opening of the berceuse  from Maurice Besly's transcription of "Firebird" eerily re-created Stravinsky's  ominous aura.  </P></p>

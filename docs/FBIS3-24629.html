			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. A. Sokolov, Yu. V. Chuguy; UDC </F> 535.42:535.31:53.082.5]    [Abstract] Results of studies of the features of forming  the outlines of three-dimensional edges of images are offered  here for a general case, when the amplitude of the light  reflection coefficient from its internal surface has a value  between 0 and 1. This image is referred to as ``gray'' or  (opaque). The intensity profile of the image front edge outline  of the gray extended side at different reflection coefficients  r(0;0.3;07 and 1.0) is shown in graphs for different N: N=2;  N=1; N=05; N=)1, where N is the number of the Fresnel zone.  Features of forming the outline of the rear edge of the extended  side were also examined, demonstrating that in case of  insignificant volumetric effects, the image resembles the  contour of a plane edge. However, the coordinates of the  fundamental minimum do not coincide with the geometric position  of the object's boundary. With significant volumetric effects,  the reflecting properties of the internal edge have a  substantial influence on the structure of the outlined image.

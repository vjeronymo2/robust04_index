			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Claude Angeli: "Our American Friends Want to </F> Steal Iraq From Us?"]    [Text] The object of one of the least-known episodes in the  Washington- Paris quarrel is the conquest of the future Iraqi  market, the reconstruction of the country's infrastructures,  and, above all, oil exploitation.    Following a long period of sickly timidity--relations with  Saddam Husayn are bad memories on the Right and on the  Left--Paris has awakened, no doubt because it noticed the  Baghdad comings and goings of companies from the United States,  Japan and other countries.    The first sign came in mid-October 1993. Always enamored of  foreign policy, [Interior Minister] Charles Pasqua decided to  stop discreet contacts. He organized--and [Prime Minister]  Edouard Balladur did not object--the Paris visit of Tariq `Aziz,  deputy prime minister of Iraq. A police team piloted him,  protected him, and even took him to Pasqua. As a result, the  Foreign Ministry, where the interior minister's incursions into  official or secret diplomacy are not appreciated, decided that  overture must be the game to play.    All the more so since the Elysee [president's office] and  the Matignon [prime minister's office] approved of the  invitation transmitted by the Elf and Total oil companies to a  delegation of Iraqi oilmen. On 26 February of this year, these  Iraqi experts, with whom the two French companies have been  discreetly negotiating the exploitation of two huge oil deposits  in the Majnun islands and in `Nahr Umar for the past three  years, arrived in Paris.    Insisting that the meetings are symbolic, Jean-Bernard  Merimee often meets with his UN counterpart, the Iraqi Nizar  Hamdun. Finally, on 4 March, a Saddam emissary, Riad al-Qaysi,  was officially received at the Foreign Ministry, and an Iraqi  parliamentary delegation is slated in principle to visit Paris  in a few weeks.    The virtuous explanation: the French Government is  interpreting UN resolutions "juridically" and wants the embargo  against Iraq be lifted soon, an initiative Washington opposes.    The U.S. position is cynical and makes for good policy. A  high official of an Iraqi ministry summarized it as follows to a  French businessman: "The Americans are telling us: open your  markets to us, sign contracts with us and our oilmen, and the  embargo will be lifted."    For a long time now, Baghdad has become a salon where  American is spoken. Chevron and Occidental Petroleum are  interested in the same oil "sponges" as Elf and Total. Bechtel  is interested in petroleum engineering, ATT is eyeing Iraqi  telephones--to Alcatel's irritation--and in the automobile  sector, Chrysler is poised to enter the race.    Iraq is not the only battlefield. In Saudi Arabia, the  Americans are glorifying their support for the Bosnian Muslims  and Boeing is ahead of Airbus--Clinton made a point of  announcing it personally!--even if the contract was supposed to  be shared. The same is happening in Kuwait and Abu Dhabi, where  Washington is pressuring the emir to reduce the order for 390  Leclerc tanks and purchase Apache helicopters rather than the  French Super-Pumas or Tigers.    This is a generalized offensive, and everything is done to  discredit the competition. Hence the attempt by French  intelligence to monitor the commercial field and to identify  French and other "friends" of the Americans in these complicated  games. According to French intelligence, "what the Americans  want is for the only arms industry offering a complete range of  materiel that they do not control to disappear."    And, if necessary, prices are lowered. In Pakistan, American  F-16's are offered for $10 million less than the Mirage  2OOO-5's, and the F-18's for $15 million less in Malaysia.    Warlike consumers will not complain.</p>

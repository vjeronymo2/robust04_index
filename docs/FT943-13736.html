			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (8): Figure of flawless orthodoxy In the bad old days before the government of national unity, Mr Jay Naidoo had an unfortunate habit of looking like Satan, sounding like Marx and acting like Mephistopheles, writes Patti Waldmeir. But those days are long gone now, and his image has been transformed. With his well-cut suits and carefully tailored vocabulary, the new-look Mr Naidoo - formerly head of the largest union federation, Cosatu, and now minister charged with implementing the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) - is a figure of flawless economic orthodoxy. The firebrand trade unionist and militant socialist of the past has become a persuasive advocate of fiscal and financial discipline. With just a hint of American twang in his accent, he might be a missionary from the World Bank, pushing its gospel of structural adjustment - except for one crucial difference, which he highlights forcefully: Mr Naidoo believes he has society on his side. Mr Naidoo, who turns 40 this year, describes South Africa's own brand of structural adjustment, the RDP, as a 'shared partnership between government and civil society', a vision which unites all the parties in the coalition cabinet. But his commitment to the RDP, which is fervent, goes well beyond the simple intention to spend money. 'Overriding everything in this country is going to be the fact that this is how much money we have, these are the constraints,' he says. He constantly insists that it is not an 'add-on' programme: 'The RDP is. . . about how to reorganise government expenditure to meet new priorities. We are turning the ship of state around to those new priorities. . . but we must do so while ensuring that we maintain stability.' Hard choices lie ahead, he says, and conflict is probably inevitable. 'But I spent my whole professional life mediating conflict,' Mr Naidoo points out, referring to his role as Cosatu general secretary during 1985 to 1993: the toughest years of union-management antagonism. Those years honed his rhetorical and political skills to the point where he earned the grudging respect of business; they also taught him pragmatism. Nothing could have prepared him better for the difficult years to come.</p>

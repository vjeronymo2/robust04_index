			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Plea to free Conde is rejected Mario Conde, former chairman of Spanish bank Banesto, yesterday lost his appeal against a high court decision to remand him in prison on charges of fraud and misappropriation of Pta7bn (Pounds 34m). Under Spanish law, a judge can remand someone facing charges if there are reasons to suspect he will attempt to flee or destroy evidence. The judge's decision comes one year to the day after the Bank of Spain dismissed the bank's board and launched a rescue for Banesto.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (18): A demand for more user-friendly systems - Smart Phones / Telephones are starting to seem very old-fashioned compared to personal computers WHILE PCs have progressed rapidly with graphical user interfaces, telephones have remained distinctly unfriendly. Today's feature phones are not much more advanced than conventional phones. As far as most people are concerned, the last great leap forward was the replacement of the circular dial by push-buttons. Most private automatic branch exchanges (PABXs) support a number of telephone features intended to make the user's life easier, especially if he or she is a senior manager under pressure. These include liquid crystal displays giving details of incoming and outgoing calls and dedicated function and programmable keys which can store numbers for access by pressing a single' key. More numbers can be stored in the exchange and accessed by short codes. If an internal number is engaged, the exchange can be automatically instructed to call back when free. Conference calls can be set up and a built-in microphone can leave both hands free during calls. Secretaries can keep track of a group of lines to see which are engaged and alert a manager to another incoming call. But most such features are little used. According to Mr Paul Turton, a senior associate at technology consultancy CSC Index, over 90 per cent of them are never used and less than 10 per cent of people use any of them regularly, On internal training courses it often emerges that many people cannot even perform simple operations such as call transfer, pick-up, retrieval and diversion. Financial directors are reluctant to spend money on more complex equipment which staff are even less likely to use. Prices for feature phones are still high. The simplest analogue feature phones with a few basic functions cost Pounds 30-Pounds 50, compared to around Pounds 10 for the most basic telephone on the market. Digital feature phones are in the range of Pounds 200-Pounds 300, so they will not be spread around unless there is a good reason. The problem is partly one of training. Senior staff who could most benefit from knowing how to use their telephones fully are the most reluctant to go on training courses. But the main reason is that the machines are still too hard to use. Manufacturers have crammed in too many features without adequate instructions and users are not surprisingly confused. Ms Susan Dark, group product manager for Mercury Communications, thinks that many more types of telecommunications services will be used once the telephones themselves become more user-friendly. 'Telephones need to become much more like personal computers,' she contends. They are about to do so. The next generation of smart phones may reach the European market next year. These devices with built-in microprocessors and much improved displays are now being tested by a number of manufacturers around the world. ONE of the most important trials is to be conducted in the US by AT&amp;T later this year with Huntington National Bank, a regional bank based at Columbus, Ohio. The service is aimed mainly at home banking and home shopping applications. AT&amp;T envisages that the services on which users will be most keen will include transferring cash between accounts, reviewing their cheque payments, paying bills and checking investment rates. The prototype of AT&amp;T's smart phone - the name is generic and attempts to trademark it have been blocked - has an angled touch-screen measuring 6 ins. by 4 ins. and plugs into the telephone line through a transformer to provide the power to light up the screen. Its internal memory maintains programs for a year, in the event of a power cut. Inside, the smart phone is said to look almost exactly like a PC. The touch-screen displays columns of autodial button images which form a menu-driven system similar to that of a PC. For instance, an autodial button might call up a range of pre-set services, ask the user to choose one and then automatically call that number. The touch-screen can also be configured as a keyboard in several formats for entering data. The smart phone will also offer the range of facilities that are provided by today's feature phones in a more accessible format. It will be able to store over 200 telephone numbers. AT&amp;T's version has a built-in modem which allows the phone to communicate via a service platform of hardware and software with the computers of a bank, travel agency or other service provider. A key element is the protocol for communication between the smart phone and the service platform. AT&amp;T says it is considering placing its protocol in the public domain to encourage the development of the market. Mr Mike Grisham, AT&amp;T's strategic planning manager at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, has been leading the company's smart phone project since the early 1980s. He believes that AT&amp;T will be first to market with the new machines, but others will not be far behind. The manufacturers say it is hard to predict when the smart phone will become a mass market. The key to creating that market appears to be agreements between the manufacturers and potential service providers. AT&amp;T is at present in talks with some such companies in the US, Europe and Asia and plans to launch experiments in Europe in 1993. European manufacturers such as Philips and Alcatel are expected to join the market soon after. Their machines may well have very different designs. Far Eastern manufacturers are expected to follow and help to bring down prices, which will be crucial.</p>

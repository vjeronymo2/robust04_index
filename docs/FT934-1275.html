			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: BTR It is always unsettling to see a company's shares slip without apparent reason. BTR's fall from favour this autumn, which has seen it under-perform by 20 per cent since its peak in August, is a case in point. The immediate explanation seems to be fresh focus on the Pounds 305m provisions taken after the Hawker acquisition, and the extent of the company's short-term debt. Some Pounds 2.8bn of bank and other loans or 88 per cent of total debt was repayable within two years at the end of 1992, though the company also had cash of Pounds 1.06bn. Yet the Hawker provisions are nothing new. Nor is there any sign that debt is troubling the company. If its debts were getting uncomfortable, BTR would hardly have splashed out Pounds 550m buying Rexnord this month. BTR's short-term debt jumped after its acquisition of Hawker. It has been coming down since then. A legitimate question, though, is the pace at which it falls in the second half of the year. The company's cautious interim statement is not particularly encouraging in this regard. Weak markets, for example in aerospace, may reduce the need for working capital. But the chances are that the company may be heavily reliant on disposals, the enhanced scrip and warrant conversions. Next year, underlying cash flow should improve - not least because the Hawker reorganisation will be over. Meanwhile, by taking large provisions and running up its short-term debt, BTR has made itself vulnerable to speculation. But at 354p, its shares yield 4 per cent, and the company is much less hemmed in than Hanson after Quantum.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / International Company News: New bid to float stake in Elf Aquitaine THE French government is making a second attempt at floating a 2.3 per cent stake in Elf Aquitaine, France's largest state-owned company, with the flotation scheduled for March 13. Elf, which has extensive interests in oil and chemicals, was originally intended to float the stake, worth roughly FFr2bn (Dollars 358m), in December. However, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, decided to postpone the issue on the day of the proposed sale because of the depressed state of the Paris stock market. The Paris market has rallied in recent weeks. The CAC 40 Index went through the critical level of 1,900 in the third week of February and has since strengthened. It closed at 1,984 yesterday, up 0.2 per cent on the day. Elf's own shares closed at FFr385, significantly higher than their price of FFr350.4 on the day that Mr Beregovoy postponed the initial share sale. Yesterday, the French government said the stock market was sufficiently buoyant for it to press ahead with the Elf sale. Mr Beregovoy is expected to announce the price of the shares on March 13. After the sale, the government's stake in Elf will be reduced from 53.8 to 51.5 per cent. The Elf sale is politically significant in that it is intended to be the first of a series of partial privatisations - sales of minority holdings in state-owned companies - proposed by France's socialist government. The government has already said it will also sell off stakes in a number of other companies including the state-controlled insurance groups and several industrial concerns. The postponement of the Elf sale was seen as a blow to the government's hopes of orchestrating a successful partial privatisation programme. The response to the issue and the subsequent progress of Elf's share price will be closely scrutinised as pointers to the prospects for the whole programme.</p>

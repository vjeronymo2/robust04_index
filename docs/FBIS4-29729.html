			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likhpai predicted before  yesterday's crucial Phalang Tham [PDP] meeting that the third  largest coalition party would break up.    Asked to predict the outcome of the meeting, at which PDP  members were expected to consider pulling out of the coalition,  Chuan said tersely: "Breakup".    Chuan was speaking after lunching with the four deputy prime  ministers Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri (PDP deputy leader)  and Industry Minister Sanan Khachonprasat (Democrat).    Asked why he looked so happy even though there are problems  in the PDP, Chuan said there was nothing wrong with the PDP. He  simply smiled when asked whether he would cancel a pending visit  to South Korea.    Members of the PDP's religious faction have on several  occasions called for the party to withdraw from the government  in a bid to regain popular support. They have also threatened  to oust Deputy Prime Minister Bunchu Rotchanasathian as party  leader.    Sanan, the Democrat secretary general, said the PDP can  handle its internal problems, but he said he didn't know what  would happen in the event of the PDP withdrawing from the  government.    "The decision will rest with the prime minister," he said.    Sanan dismissed speculation that he had approached  opposition  parties to replace the PDP. He believes the PDP's internal  problems will be solved before Parliament debates the Budget  Bill for the 1995 fiscal year.    "I'm confident the government partners can stay together,"  he  said.    In the meantime, he added, there no reason for the  government  dissolve the House of Representatives -- and there would be no  problem if the PDP withdrew from the government.    Phinit Chantarasurin (Chat Thai-Lampang) said no opposition  party will join the Chuan administration choosing instead to  maintain a clear and united stance.    "Opposition parties have promised not to join the Chuan  government, but I can't do anything if one of then joins the  government," he said.    Phinit said the government should reshuffle Cabinet line-ups  so it can run the country in the interests of the people. The  opposition should have a joint resolution to file a  no-confidence motion against the government.    Deputy Solidarity leader Khanin Bunsuwan said his party has  done nothing wrong and will not pull out of the coalition. Nor  has the government any reason to sack Solidarity, he said.    If the Solidarity Party supports a motion sponsored by 21  PDP  rebels, it would have to consider the new conditions, Kanin  said. The party vowed to support the motion last week, but the  motion was not debated.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / A tiger bares its claws in southern China: Guangdong province, home of an economic reform experiment, is enjoying dynamic growth In Guangdong province, on the south-eastern coast of China, almost every day brings a big deal - often involving foreign capital and always fuelling a hectic pace of economic growth. Yesterday, the foreign participant was GEC-Alsthom, the Anglo-French group, which was awarded a Pounds 550m contract to build power stations in the province. The plants will provide energy to help sustain an expansion in which factories and office buildings are being built on every conceivable bit of spare land, and roads are clogged by an endless stream of lorries carrying goods to market. Guangdong is the laboratory for China's experiment with economic modernisation which started in 1978 after 30 years of Maoist central planning. While the province is exceptional in present-day China, it demonstrates the country's pent-up economic potential. Throughout the 1980s industrial output in the province grew on average by nearly 20 per cent a year. In 1991 it grew by 27 per cent over 1990. It now accounts for 8.5 per cent of China's total industrial production, up from 7 per cent in 1989. As a result, Guangdong has been transformed from a predominantly agricultural economy to an industrial power house, mainly producing goods such as washing machines and refrigerators for the internal Chinese market, and textiles and toys for export. Much of Guangdong's rapid growth has resulted from the programme of economic reforms implemented by the leadership in Beijing since the 1970s. In particular, Guangdong was granted two of the country's original four special economic zones, which have privileges such as the right to offer foreign companies tax holidays of up to five years and reduced taxes thereafter. The two special zones in Guangdong - Shenzhen and Zhuhai - are located on the northern borders of Hong Kong and Macao, respectively. As a result, they have easy access to foreign capital and international trading centres. Last year, Guangdong received 45 per cent of the total foreign investment which flowed into China from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and western industrialised nations. The majority was directed to Guangdong's export industries, which already account for 19 per cent of the country's total exports. Geography has provided additional advantages to the province in its process of economic development: It is situated in one of China's most fertile regions which enables it to produce two crops of rice in the summer and one of wheat in the winter. During the 1950s and 1960s, China's economic planners, fearing aggression from the US and Taiwan, located only a small part of the country's giant state-owned industries in the southern coastal provinces. As a result, the region is now relatively untroubled by the problems facing the rest of industrial China which has the Sisyphean task of reforming inefficient and indebted state-owned companies. But while Guangdong's economy is relatively free from the burden of China's industrial past, its rapid growth is presenting new problems. In particular, economic growth has unleashed forces which China's leaders may not be able to control. A hybrid form of capitalism/socialism is being created so that the Communist party's doctrine of 'Socialism with Chinese characteristics' is looking suspiciously like capitalism with Chinese characteristics. The clearest example of this is the stock exchange in Shenzhen. Some 200,000 households in Shenzhen own and trade shares. The rows of brand new Mercedes and top-of-the-range Toyotas in company car parks also attest to the new thinking that 'Socialism with Chinese characteristics' has ceased to mean even the appearance of egalitarianism. This change in attitudes is reflected in the Communist party itself. 'The role of the party is to make profit,' said one senior executive of a malting factory outside Guangzhou, the capital of the province, in a statement which would make Chairman Mao turn in his grave. One former local party secretary, who held his post between 1964 and 1984, commented: 'In 1984 I realised that all I had been doing for 20 years was mouthing empty words.' The weakening adherence to traditional Communist party doctrines has been mirrored by a reduction in Beijing's power to control affairs in the province. Having relaxed the reins of control, the central government is not going to be able to pick them up again easily. For instance, the central government's attempt to slow economic expansion during 1988-90. Although the policy of 'rectification and retrenchment' achieved its desired goals, at a national level, of bringing inflation down from 40 per cent to less than 10 per cent, Beijing's calls met with only lip-service in Guangdong. In Shunde county, one of the richest in the province and the whole of China, local authorities defied Beijing's strictures and went ahead with the construction of a refrigerator factory during 1990. Trading under the name Rongsheng, the factory's managers pushed ahead with plans to expand annual capacity from 400,000 units to 600,000 units a year. As Mr Wu Xiu Hao, a county official, noted with ill-disguised pride: 'The refrigerator factory was built during those hard years, but we built it in a secret way. When comrade Deng Xiaoping visited Shunde on January 29 he said we were right to do what we did. He appreciated how bold we had been.' Deng, the country's paramount leader, is squarely behind the economic reforms which have sparked Guangdong's development. During his journey to southern China he outlined in the starkest terms the consequences for China's political elite of going slow on reform. 'If we do not carry out reform and opening, do not develop the economy and do not improve the people's livelihood, then there will only be the road to ruin,' he wrote in what is known as Central Committee Document No 2 - a document he has used to foster speedier economic reforms throughout China. 'The common people will not allow anyone to change (these) principles and policies; those who do this may be overthrown at any time.' In policy battles since, at the top echelons of the country's ageing leadership, Deng and his reformers appear to have emerged victorious. Last week, a session of the National People's Congress endorsed plans to accelerate the process of modernisation, while party newspapers have called for '100 years of reform'. Such proclamations are music to the ears of Guangdong's provincial party and government leaders, who have bold plans to turn the entire province into a special economic zone. With economic reform again a priority in Beijing, they may be granted their wish. Guangdong would then be hard to stop in its drive to join the ranks of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, east Asia's four tiger economies.</p>

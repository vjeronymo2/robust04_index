			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Companies look to their futures: Forex hedging has a new urgency after the ERM tremors MANAGING foreign-exchange risk 'has become more complicated, more time-consuming and the costs have gone up. We have to fiddle round with bits of minor currencies. It diverts valuable time from doing deals.' This litany of complaints about the effective collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism comes from Mr Rusi Kathoke, finance director of British Technology Group, which licenses technology around the world. But it could have come from any small or medium-sized British company coping with the new currency regime. Smaller companies are not alone in suffering from currency uncertainty, but they are less likely than large ones to have the staff and the expertise to deal with it. They are also more likely to trade only within Europe, and therefore to have relied on the ERM to protect them from volatility in currencies. 'Larger companies have been hedging currencies for some while,' said Mr Robert Mapstone, a derivatives specialist at NatWest Capital Markets. However, the surge of volatility in the currency markets last summer, culminating in sterling's departure from the ERM in September, sparked a fresh wave of interest in hedging foreign-exchange risk. 'There has been a trend towards increased use of derivative instruments (futures and options contracts),' said Mr Geoffrey Isaac, chairman of MTM Partnership, a financial strategy consultancy. However, some companies only use forward foreign-exchange contracts, which involve buying a currency at a set rate in advance, rather than options, which give the holder an option to buy a currency at a set rate at a set time. This is because some companies consider forward contracts a cheaper and sometimes less risky form of hedging. But unlike forward contracts, buying an option does not lock a company into a potentially unfavourable exchange rate. Most large companies said there had been no change of policy following the ERM shake-up just over a week ago. 'We haven't seen the risks we run as being changed, but the adoption of wider bands may focus the attention of some companies (on foreign-exchange risk),' said Mr John Grout, director of treasury at Cadbury Schweppes, the food and drinks group. Cadbury already makes extensive use of options to hedge its exposure to foreign-exchange risk, mainly dollars and D-Marks. Guinness, the drinks group, is also active in hedging its currency exposure. It said there had been no action because the company's exposure is already hedged well into next year. Hedging has become a necessity rather than a choice even for companies which in the past have steered clear of the derivatives market. They feared repeating the experience of Allied-Lyons, the food and drinks group, which two years ago lost Pounds 150m from writing currency options. Companies are taking what Mr Christopher Taylor, head of foreign exchange and money markets at Barclays, sees as 'a more enlightened approach' to derivative instruments. But he says it is not only large companies which are active in hedging exposure: 'In many cases it's the small-to-medium-sized companies which have been more active because they have shorter management chains: one of the barriers in larger companies is the need for senior management approval.' Designers Guild, a designer and manufacturer of fabrics and wallpapers based in west London, recently decided to take out forward contracts to cover 60 per cent of its foreign currency exposure. 'I wish now I had taken out 100 per cent cover,' said Mr Mark Naughton-Rumbo, financial controller. The company exports more than 60 per cent of its annual turnover of Pounds 18m. It has also had to allocate one staff member to compile a report each morning on the company's foreign-exchange exposure. 'The foreign-exchange position can change overnight,' said Mr Naughton-Rumbo. 'We could not afford to take a Pounds 50,000 foreign currency loss.' But for some, the worst impact of the volatility in currencies has been the damage it had done to business confidence throughout Europe. 'The level of uncertainty won't help us out of the recession,' remarked Mr Naughton-Rumbo. Suppliers of machinery and other capital equipment, with long lead times between the order and delivery, face particular difficulties. 'How can I quote a price to a customer in France when it takes two to three months until delivery?' said Mr Fred Marshall, managing director of Speedex (Engineering), a Bradford-based manufacturer of plastics extrusion machinery with annual sales of nearly Pounds 3m. He added: 'When I talk to my customers it is not about the technicalities of our machines but about currencies. I can't understand the sense of allowing gamblers, people who don't manufacture, to dictate what a currency is worth. The ideal would be for one currency.'</p>

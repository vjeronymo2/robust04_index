			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Cuts may not be deep enough: Quentin Peel says the German government's assault on the welfare state has provoked bitter opposition It is hard to know who should be believed. Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's increasingly weary finance minister, has persuaded his partners in government to accept a painful package of cuts, mainly in unemployment and social benefits. It is intended to save DM25bn (Pounds 9.8bn) next year, and up to DM35bn by 1996, and thus keep the federal budget deficit to manageable proportions. The aim is to bring the deficit down from about DM70bn today, or 15 per cent of the federal budget, to just 10 per cent by 1996. Unemployment pay will come down three percentage points (from 68 to 65 per cent of previous earnings for a married man), and related social benefits will be cut by the same amount. A time limit will be fixed for earnings-related benefits, and a drive launched to stem social insurance fraud is intended to save up to DM6bn. No less than DM14bn of the savings in 1994 come from direct cuts in welfare payments for the needy, at a time of severe recession and rising unemployment. Little wonder that Ms Ursula Engelen-Kefer, the deputy chairman of the German trade union federation, says it is the most devastating assault on the welfare state since the early 1930s - when the harsh fate of the unemployed was a key factor behind the rise of Hitler. Yet Mr Helmut Geiger, president of the savings banks' association, fears it is too little, too late, to cure the federal government's fiscal laxity. It still leaves a 'horror scenario' of an intractable structural budget deficit from 1995, when the full burden of borrowing to finance unification will fall on the central exchequer, he says. And he doubts whether anything like DM6bn can be saved in combating fraud. Only the German Bundesbank was yesterday prepared to give Mr Waigel the benefit of the doubt. The bank indicated its modest approval by shaving its discount rate by 0.5 points. It was scarcely a vote of great confidence. And when the finance minister travels to Tokyo next week with Chancellor Helmut Kohl for the Group of Seven summit of leading industrial nations, he will almost certainly meet more of the Geiger-style sceptics among his international colleagues. If the savings plan has pleased almost no one, why is Mr Waigel forcing it through? Coming six months before the start of a mammoth election year in Germany, when 19 separate polls at national, state and local level will decide the country's political complexion for the next four years, his move looks almost foolhardy. Yet few in government doubt that the finance minister had any choice but to tackle the sacred cow of social spending. Like the rest of the industrialised world, Germany faces a demographic shift, which means that ever fewer workers are contributing to the soaring social costs of ever increasing numbers of the old, the young, and the needy. Unlike the rest of the industrialised world, Germany's problem has been massively compounded by unification. The three pillars of the German welfare state - health insurance, pensions, and unemployment insurance - have always been generous in their benefits. Unlike the British system, where social security is closely controlled by the Treasury, German insurance funds are self-financing and contribution-driven. It is only when payments outstrip contributions that the state steps in to subsidise. Unemployed workers have until now received two-thirds of their former salary for 32 months, and then a few percentage points less, indefinitely. It has always been easier to allow insurance contributions to rise as social spending has soared, rather than switch a part of the burden to the general taxpayer. The result has been a rising burden not only on individual workers, but on their employers, who share the insurance contributions for all three funds on a 50:50 basis. The proportion of gross income which the worker and the employer must jointly pay in insurance has risen from just 26.5 per cent, in 1970, to a forecast of at least 39.2 per cent next year. According to the German Federation of Industry's economy institute in Cologne, the whole gamut of extra payments, such as holiday pay, per employee amounts to 86.5 per cent of basic wages, giving western Germany the highest wage costs per hour of any industrialised state: almost DM42 per hour in 1992, compared with DM39.24 in Switzerland, DM30 in Japan, and less than DM25 in the US. German employers have complained bitterly about their social burden for more than a decade, and Mr Kohl's conservative coalition has been cautiously attempting to curb it. The advent of east Germany, with huge social needs, and very modest contributions, has turned a long-term structural problem into a short-term crisis. Social spending, which increased from DM180bn in 1970 to DM744bn in 1990, shot up to more than DM1,000bn by 1992, because of the east. And the burden has been borne by western German workers, employers, and the federal budget. The government has already started to cut social spending with health reforms agreed last year. In the health sector, doctors' prescription budgets have been capped, and the number of drugs paid for by health insurance limited. The changes have shown significant savings but these have been at the expense of German drug manufacturers and pharmacists. As for the pension funds, they cannot be touched, even by Mr Waigel. A proposal in May mooted by the finance ministry for a reduction in benefits was met with an instant denial by Chancellor Kohl. Yet the funds are transferring a net DM14bn from west to east, according to Mr Reinhold Schulze, chairman of the federal fund for white-collar workers. East Germany had inadequate funds to finance western-level pensions for its old people. The result is a forecast increase from 17.5 to 19.3 per cent of individual wages in pensions contributions next year. The only significant area of social spending left for Mr Waigel to squeeze was the unemployment funds, which finance not just dole payments, but also retraining schemes, job creation measures, and even language training for returning German emigres. To finance labour market transfers to the east, running at some DM35bn a year, the federal labour office, which administers the system, had to increase contributions from 4.3 per cent to 6.5 per cent in March 1991. Even then, the government is having to pay a subsidy of DM18bn towards its DM90bn budget this year, and a probable DM20bn out of DM100bn next year. Yet Mr Waigel's savings package is tackling only the short-term problem. His colleague, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economy minister, is equally worried about the inexorable increase in all forms of social spending in the long term, with a shrinking workforce to pay the contributions. His answer is to propose a strict ceiling on contributions, and simultaneously to launch a campaign for longer working hours, shorter holidays, and longer working lives: against all current trends. 'We will have severe problems around the end of the century,' according to a senior official in the ministry. 'If we can reverse the trend, and have longer working lives, very small changes can have a huge effect. One more month's work means one more month's contributions, and one month less of pension payments.' If Mr Waigel's savings package has caused offence to the unions and the SPD, Mr Rexrodt's proposals seem to be just as sensational. The slightest hint of returning to a 40-hour week is anathema to the trade union leadership. Yet there is one area of reform where the opposition and unions are prepared to co-operate: to take on more of the social burdens on the taxpayer, and relieve the burden of direct insurance payments. Mr Klaus Zwickel, the new leader of IG Metall, the engineering workers' union, sees such a change as justified by the new demands in the east, which should not be borne by western workers alone. Some 2m civil servants, and the same number of self-employed, make no contribution. If Mr Waigel were able to offer some sort of trade-off between capping social benefits, and a fairer distribution of the costs, he might still be able to bring the opposition and unions to a negotiating table. But for the time being, he looks condemned to force through his savings package in splendid isolation.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       SOCIAL INSURANCE DEDUCTIONS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Contributions of employers and employees as percentage of gross income  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   1970     1975    1980   1985   1990    1993   1994**  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pension contributions     17.0     18.0    18.0   19.2   18.7    17.5    19.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Health insurance          8.2     10.5    11.4   11.8   12.5    13.4    13.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Unemployment insurance          1.3      2.0     3.0    4.1    4.3     6.5     6.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total             26.5     30.5    32.4   35.1   35.5    37.4    39.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- **Forecast  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

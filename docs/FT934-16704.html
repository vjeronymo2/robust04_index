			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Gripped by the old frontier spirit Chock-full of capital and with little in the way of new loan growth to look forward to on their home turf, America's stronger regional banks have been on a buying spree lately. Their ambition: the creation of the US's first true nationwide banking groups. The hunt for higher revenues has been taking banks into new markets and new product areas. By linking their branch systems, many hope to create bigger networks selling a broader range of products. Inevitably, the demand has pushed up the price of banks with good distribution systems and sound balance sheets. The average purchase price for US banks has crept up to 2.5 times net asset value - a substantial premium over the valuation put by the stock market on the banking industry, which is below 2 times net assets, says Mr John Leonard, an analyst at Salomon. With such a premium, will the shareholders of expansion-minded banks end up disappointed? No bank has yet proved that it can make a success of running a nationwide business handling a wide range of products, says Thomas Brown, a banking analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. The KeyCorp/Society transaction, structured as a merger, does not involve the payment of a premium to either company's shareholders. However, it is based on the assumption that KeyCorp's branch network, built mainly around small businesses and individual customers, can be used to generate more business for Society's 'products'. These are based on specialised lending and asset management for medium-sized businesses. Meanwhile, there appear to be few obstacles to the quickening pace of US regional bank mergers. The biggest single obstacle remains the Southeast Compact: an agreement between 13 states requiring banks in the region to maintain at least 80 per cent of their deposits there. Some, like South Carolina-based NationsBank, have reached into other states only because the compact does not apply to takeovers of banks which are receiving federal government support. The pace of bank mergers has been picking up. Last year, bank mergers worth Dollars 8.5bn (Pounds 5.6bn) were announced: this year, the figure will be higher. 'There have been a lot of acquisitions in the Dollars 3bn toDollars 5bn range,' says Mr Leonard. NationsBank and Banc One, from Ohio, have set the pace through acquisition but there is a growing queue to follow them. The KeyCorp/Society merger will create a third geographically diverse 'super-regional' banking group. The question now: who will be next? Fleet Financial and PNC - among the US's top 15 banks in terms of assets - are most frequently singled out as likely merger candidates, either with each other or with other banks. Each has a strong local base, a healthy balance sheet and a good return on capital. Each also has a management which has expressed interest in expansion. BankAmerica, the US's second-biggest bank with an extensive presence in the west, is also waiting in the wings. However, its difficulties with swallowing Security Pacific, and the recession in California, is expected to keep it on the sidelines. With this growing list of merger candidates, it was not surprising yesterday to see KeyCorp and Society injecting a poison pill into their deal to dissuade rival suitors. Unsolicited bids among US banks have not been a feature of the latest takeover wave. But as the pace picks up and the list of attractive merger candidates shrinks, an unwanted bid looks increasingly likely.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by KAZTAG correspondent Ivan Zakharchenko] </F>   [Text] Almaty, 27 April (TASS) -- During a meeting with Li  Peng, premier of China's Council of State, here on Wednesday  morning, Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko of Kazakhstan  inquired about potentialities for China's participation in a  broadening of trade with Kazakhstan, in a joint modernisation of  the Karaganda metallurgical complex, in the establishment of  transit motor transportation routes across the Republic and  shipping along the border rivers Irtysh and Ili, and a realistic  time-frame for the establishment of a free economic area near  the border township of Khorgos.    Li said it is possible to enlarge the network of Chinese  shops in Kazakhstan and joint trading ventures only provided the  two countries make profit. He also emphasised that the quality  of commodities which are supplied directly by state producers  will be much higher and cheaper than that of those being  delivered by profiteers from China.    As far as China's possible participation in the  modernisation  of the Karaganda metallurgical mill is concerned, the Chinese  premier said it is essential at first to carry out an expert  examination to determine the economic efficiency of the mill and  gauge the competitive power of its products.    Speaking about transit transportation from Kazakhstan to  Pakistan, which is being effected via Turkey and Iran, Li  admitted that routes across China would reduce transportation  distance by half. He expressed understanding of this aspect and  suggested that the respective ministries of the two countries  examine the matter.    Li took up a similar attitude as regards shipping along the  Irtysh and Ili Rivers and the Khorgos Free Economic Area and its  status.    The premiers of Kazakhstan and China expressed satisfaction  with this exchange of views.</p>

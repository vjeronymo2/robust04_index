Speaking to foreign correspondents in  Jerusalem, Peres said Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin would  investigate ways of advancing peace talks with Damascus when he  meets in Washington this evening with U.S. President Bill  Clinton.    On talks with the PLO, Peres said Israel could not agree to  Palestinian demands for the removal of Jewish settlers from  Hebron.

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Japan wants more co-operation in Asia MR Kiichi Miyazawa, Japanese prime minister, said yesterday Japan wanted to promote co-operation and resilience in Asia and denied any plans to make Japan a regional military power. Mr Miyazawa, in Malaysia as part of a South-East Asia tour, said the continued presence of US forces in the region was vital and Japan was providing increasing support to the US military. 'We do not want to see a power vacuum in the region,' a Japanese official said. In talks with Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysian prime minister, Mr Miyazawa outlined Japan's new 'Look East' policy, which suggests a greater regional role for Japan in the years ahead. But While Mr Miyazawa said Japan wanted to create greater economic and political co-operation in the region, he declined to endorse Dr Mahathir's proposal for an east Asia economic caucus, a trading group linking the fast-expanding economies of east Asia. Malaysia feels this would be vital to counter what it sees as increasing protectionism in the European Community and Nafta.</p>

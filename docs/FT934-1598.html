			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / International Bonds: World Bank offers interest rate play The Eurobond market was enlivened yesterday by investor-driven transactions from the World Bank and Eksportfinans, the Norwegian export-financing agency. The World Bank raised DM100m through an issue of five-year notes offering investors a play on German interest rates. The proceeds were believed to have been swapped into floating-rate D-Marks. Lead manager Morgan Stanley, which has arranged three similar offerings totalling DM425m in the last week, said the notes appealed to investors who believed that German interest rates were set to fall further in the new year. During the first year, the coupon on the so-called 're-set' notes is fixed at 6 1/8 per cent. At the end of the first year the coupon will be re-calculated with reference to five-year D-Mark swap rates. Morgan Stanley said the notes were similar in structure to reverse floating-rate notes, except the coupon was only re-set once during their life. The notes, which had a fixed re-offer price of 99.45, were not freed to trade yesterday. Elsewhere, Eksportfinans raised CDollars 200m through an issue of six-year Eurobonds. The proceeds were thought to have been swapped into sub-Libor floating-rate dollars. Lead manager ScotiaMcLeod said the bonds were designed to satisfy demand for short-dated Canadian dollar paper. They were priced to yield 30 basis points over the 5 3/4 per cent Canadian Treasury due 1999. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread remained unchanged.</p>

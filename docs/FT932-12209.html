			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Honda to chase UK assembly record HONDA, the Japanese carmaker, intends that by the end of the year its UK assembly plant will rival Nissan's Sunderland operation, Europe's most productive car assembly plant. Mr Andrew Jones, manager of Honda's Pounds 300m plant in Swindon, Wiltshire, said the company aimed to achieve an assembly time of 12.5 hours a car for its large family car, the Honda Accord. The Swindon plant started production in October and aims to reach its capacity of 100,000 cars a year with two car ranges in 1995. Productivity at Japanese carmakers' new plants in Europe, mainly in the UK, is setting tough standards for European producers, whose productivity is often half the best Japanese levels. Mr Ian Gibson, managing director of Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK, said it had cut 'hours per car' for its UK-built Primera - similar in size to the Accord - to 12.5. He said 'the best of the Europeans are running at around 20 hours per car' for the same class of vehicle. European competitors in this market segment include the Opel Vectra/Vauxhall Cavalier, Ford Mondeo, Peugeot 405 and Volkswagen Passat. The hours-per-car yardstick used by Nissan and Honda measures so-called direct labour in the body welding, painting and final trim and assembly parts of the manufacturing operation. These processes are becoming established as a standard definition in measuring car plant productivity. Carmakers differ on the measurement of hours in their plants, but the size of the competitive gap has startled European producers. Honda's European sales push, Page 2</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 1 (TANJUG) -- The international  economic sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  have had the most devastating effects in the area of transport  and communications, where direct losses have reached the figure  of nearly ten billion dollars over the past 21 months, Federal  Minister of Transport and Communications Zarko Katic said in an  interview to TANJUG.    The figure does not include the losses incurred to the  neighbouring and other European countries, which had to by-pass  Yugoslavia's shortest and cheapest roads and railway lines  leading to western Europe and the Middle East.    "By sealing the Yugoslav borders, the architects of the  (U.N.) resolutions have also sealed Europe," said Katic.    A series of unilateral traffic suspensions was initiated by  Germany in December 1991, when it discontinued its air traffic  with Yugoslavia, disregarding all international norms.    Yugoslavia has been placed under a total traffic isolation  on  the basis of United Nations Security Council resolutions in May  1992 and April 1993.    Yugoslavia was forced to compensate a part of the losses  through road and navigation tolls, said Katic. Most branches of  transport and communications faced a total collapse.    Vessels of the shipping companies Jugooceanija and  Prekookeanska Plovidba - which, in cooperation with the port of  Bar, had secured one fourth of the foreign currency earnings of  the Republic of Montenegro before the sanctions - are currently  blocked in ports throughout the world.    Another example is the Yugoslav railways, which in 1993  cancelled 46 passenger and 30 cargo trains daily at the average.  The restrictions were ofter caused by problems in obtaining  fuel and spare parts, whose imports are banned.</p>

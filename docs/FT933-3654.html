			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Floating voters 'distrust Labour' FLOATING VOTERS in south-east England still do not trust the Labour party and see it as old-fashioned, research published today by the Fabian society shows, Alison Smith writes. The study, based on work by Opinion Leader Research in five marginal seats in the south-east, found that Labour as well as the government was suffering from a new contempt for all politicians, who were seen as being primarily self-interested. It highlights the prospect that at the next election the Liberal Democrats could take votes not only from the Tories but also from Labour, even where Labour is a clear challenger to the Conservatives. Such findings show that Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, must still bring about significant changes in the party's policies and values if it is to win support in the south. Mr Giles Radice, Labour MP for Durham north and the pamphlet's co-author, argues that modernising the party's links with the trade unions is a critical way of increasing Labour's appeal to white-collar and skilled manual workers. Other suggestions include the possibility of specifying how taxes would be spent on particular services such as health, and removing the party's constitutional commitment to public ownership.

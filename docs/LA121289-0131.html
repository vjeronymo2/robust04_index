			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SRI LANKAN BUDDHISTS UNVEIL STUFFED ELEPHANT  </P> <P> Buddhists today unveiled a stuffed version of Raja, a sacred elephant whose  death in 1988 plunged Sri Lanka into mourning. The grand old elephant, who  after $4,000 worth of taxidermy work looked more robust than in his last years  of life, stood majestically inside the Budhhist temple with two strings of  white flowers hanging from his tusks.  </P></p>

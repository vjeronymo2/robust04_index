			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: UK back on course for the recovery - London There is a heady feeling of 'Christmas in August' in the stock market, as signs that the worst may be over for the dollar have invited investors in the UK market to celebrate growing evidence of strong and accelerating economic growth and subdued inflation. The next round of corporate results, still more than a month away, is likely to bring further gains in dividends and earnings. This week brings little for markets to worry about, with the latest industrial trends survey from the Confederation of British Industries expected to confirm market confidence. And both the Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank have now wound down for the summer holidays. No wonder one leading analyst refers to the current UK economic experience as 'something of a Golden Age', even if he admits that a more negative interpretation is that the current scenario may not be all that different from previous cyclical recoveries. The FT-SE 100 Index is now around 9 per cent up from the low points touched at the end of last month, so it is not surprising that some of the technical chartists are becoming nervous. Derivative Securities, the futures technicians, regard FT-SE 3,135 as a 'still valid' ceiling for the market at present, although the firm is not advising clients to sell just yet. Overbought markets, which Derivative Securities judges this one to be, can persist in that state for some time when the underlying mood is confident. For the true bear case, on the global as well as UK markets scale, nervous investors must turn to Nomura Securities, which continues to express caution on equities because it believes that stronger than expected economic growth leads to higher than expected inflation and interest rates - casting doubts over the widespread optimism for corporate earnings growth. There is some support from other securities houses for Nomura's fears that the dollar remains vulnerable. 'We are still not entirely convinced . . .' says NatWest Securities. But most London-based analysts stress that last week's renewed uncertainties over the dollar and near-term prospects for US interest rates have failed to restrain bond or equity markets in Europe. De-coupling, in fact, appears to be here at least. Mr Albert Edwards at Kleinwort Benson believes there is no reason why US growth and inflation should affect non-US markets 'other than in a marginal and sentimental manner'. However, in spite of the general euphoria, there is still no rush by City analysts to upgrade UK market forecasts for the year. After a very difficult, and often painfully expensive, first half to 1994, the mood is that the market is back on course for the recovery thwarted so far this year by the savage collapse in bond markets.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Observer: Currency juggling Talent spotters at this Saturday's Lord Mayor's show in London might want to keep an eye open for exhibit number 20 - the Bank of England's horse-drawn float. The Bank, which does not normally participate in such frivolous events, is making an exception to mark its 300th birthday next year. Observer hears that the Bank's contribution to the festivities include dozens of staff who have been specially trained to juggle brightly coloured currency symbols. Would be much more fun if they were throwing away old Pounds 5 notes.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Message to the nation by President Ramiro de Leon Carpio in </F> Guatemala City -- live or recorded]    [Text] A series of events in the political arena,  especially in matters of public security worsened by an increase  in the violence that has adversely affected institutions and  persons, has obstructed the development and implementation of  the government's agenda.    The topic of violence is being handled with the highest of  priorities, the first results of which are now being observed.  We are going to continue making progress with the necessary  strength until we are able to neutralize its effects. As for  the institutionality of the country, it is completely  strengthened, and, despite ill-intentioned rumors, the  Guatemalan Army supports the democratic process and the current  government that I head. It has given irrefutable proof of that  support.    There are important topics in the socioeconomic field,  however, that cannot be postponed. The government's agenda for  1994-1995 clearly establishes our political strategy and our  actions. Such policies have been determined, and it is  advisable for us to repeat that. There will be no turns or  deviations in its drafting and implementation. In accordance  with these policies I am presenting to you the overall picture  of the government's finances, which has been dramatic since I  assumed the presidency of the Republic with a fiscal deficit of  960 million quetzals and a debt to suppliers of 1.2 billion  quetzals. Debts were owed to suppliers for school and hospital  products, among other things.    We had planned to reduce the fiscal deficit to 360 million  quetzals in 1994. Due to the Constitutional Court's ruling and  the decrease in tax revenue by 160 million quetzals during the  first quarter of the year, the deficit could increase to 1.72  billion quetzals if administrative and legal measures are not  adopted now.    Since 1993 we have been observing a weakening of the tax  structure, which we believe will continue to weaken in 1994. We  attribute such a situation to the weakness of the tax laws and  to the difficulties involved in achieving its implementation.    In view of the budget situation, we must adopt measures,  otherwise the fundamental duties of the state could experience  serious adverse effects. The government could fail to comply  with demands for investment projects in the poorest sectors of  the country, which would worsen even more the already poor  services provided to the majority of the population. If the  fiscal problem is not corrected, we could lose ground in the  stability achieved up to now because the inflation goal for 1994  may go unfulfilled.    We must not forget that the most harmful tax for the people  is inflation. Despite the improvement in the government's  revenues in 1991 and 1992, by mid-1993 when I assumed the  presidency of the Republic, we already saw a critical situation  that has been worsening mainly because the reforms that were  introduced to allow the government to effectively fight tax  evasion were not reinforced. As a result of this lack of  instruments for the application of the law, value-added-tax  [VAT] evasion was nearly 40 percent.    That means, people of Guatemala, that, for every 100  persons who consume something and pay the VAT, 40 stores collect  the tax, but illegally and improperly do not report it to the  government. Regarding income tax, evasion is close to 50  percent. As for import taxes, they do not reflect the movement  of merchandise owing to dishonest import practices. This is a  problem that demands an urgent solution, and we have started  taking the first actions.    We must keep in mind that the objective of lowering the  inflation rate and strengthening public finances is not and  should not be an end in and of itself. It is merely a necessary  condition to reinforcing democracy and achieving social equality  and sustained economic growth. Handling a coherent and  consistent social policy, within which fiscal policy plays a key  role, would foster a climate favorable to raising public  savings, lowering the inflation rate, decreasing uncertainty,  and making investment possible. It also fosters fewer changes  in prices, generates jobs, and maintains the real value of wages.    The adoption of fiscal measures will enable the government  to  avoid the inflation rate's negative distributive effect. It  will also allow it to fulfill the unpostponable task of fighting  poverty and merging economic progress with social equality.  There are contradictory situations, since we are simultaneously  seeing a drop in tax revenues and predicting a significant  growth of 5 percent in economic activity compared to the 2  percent figure of many countries.    Within the framework of fiscal and monetary policy, the  fiscal initiatives seek to achieve the following objectives:    1. (?Stabilize) prices, avoid an inflationary process with  the subsequent economic and social consequences, and eliminate  excessive indebtedness that limits the expectations of progress.    2. Allow greater availability of resources to spend them  on social development and fighting poverty, considering the life  expectancy in Guatemala is the lowest in Central America and the  illiteracy rate is the highest. In addition, the infant  mortality rate is one of the highest in Latin America, partly  because the Guatemalan tax burden is the smallest in Central  America and Latin America. Only Haiti's tax burden is smaller.    3. Correct some inconsistencies in the current fiscal laws  to achieve a sustained increase in revenues that is in step with  economic growth, allowing the strengthening of public finances.  In that respect, we have submitted law initiatives that while  not creating new taxes seek to improve a tax system that,  together with measures of administrative control, avoid frequent  changes in the tax laws and allow us to meet priority investment  expenditures. These initiatives are complemented by specific  actions that seek a restructuring of the administration to make  tax-paying easier and to modernize the tax system.    The changes apply to income tax laws, the VAT, which  remains at 7 percent, and the airport tax on passengers  traveling abroad, as well as changes to the tax code.    The changes made to the income tax code in 1992 led to a  reduction of personal income and corporate taxes. Its reduction  was clearly noticeable during the first quarter of 1994 because  a total of 41 million quetzals less than what was estimated were  collected. These changes are aimed at partially restoring the  revenues that were lost due to the impact of the Constitutional  Court ruling on account payments and retentions. The changes  are also aimed at strengthening the taxation system by avoiding  tax evasion.    The collection of the VAT dropped by 85 million quetzals  during the first quarter of 1994. Evasion takes place when  store owners do not issue receipts or proofs of purchase. It  is, therefore, important to adopt measures to prevent this type  of tax evasion. Moreover, with the purpose of solving the  problems with the VAT that have accumulated to date the treasury  intends to increase the airport exit tax to 100 quetzals, much  closer to Central American levels. The tax on those leaving the  country by land remains unchanged.    Finally, as for the tax code, it will be strengthened with  the purpose of getting an effective regimen for stronger  punishments. The application of punishments will be proposed,  and, for repeated offenders, the proper criminal court judge may  temporarily shut down the business. The treasury must  contribute all the elements needed by the courts to issue the  proper punishment. In addition, the deadlines for filing  documents are reduced.    All changes are difficult, but not making them would lead to  stagnation, inflation, and state inefficiency. History has  proven that macroeconomic disorders and instability provide no  solutions for social problems. In the 1980's the failure to  adopt timely measures brought about a reduction of real wages.  By the end of the decade 75 percent of the population was poor,  and 50 percent was extremely poor.    All changes are difficult, I said before, but not making  them  would lead us to stagnation. It is important to build an  authentic and solid social reform on the foundations of the  economic reforms. The fight against poverty is another face of  economic reform. It is necessary to include social sectors that  were never included before. It is necessary to include modern  economic sectors to allow them to participate in productive  activities. We must strengthen the activities of small  enterprises that can generate jobs for thousands of citizens.  These changes are not automatic, and they cannot appear  spontaneously. Effort and participation by the state and  society as a whole are necessary. A great effort to achieve  economic stability in the country is necessary so we can lay the  groundwork for a sustained growth that can guarantee greater  opportunities through the allocation of more resources for  investment in the social arena. For this to continue, it must  not be done by incurring greater debts. We are aware of the  challenges we are facing and the many things that remain to be  done. The principal challenge is to strengthen the social  aspects of development, and the spirit of the fiscal changes is  precisely to achieve this objective.    The price of the imbalance is too high -- hence the urgent  need to take measures. We are sure that we are on the right  track. There will be no changes in the policy we have outlined.  The situation forces us to take speedy action. The progress of  the peace process commands our attention beyond a cessation of  armed confrontation. It means attention to social development  demands. We must understand clearly that there is no true  economic prosperity without greater social justice. It is also  true that economic growth is possible in freedom. Our  government has pledged to the Guatemalan people to govern in a  different style, where national interests prevails above all  others with honesty and prioritization of expenses for social  benefits. We trust we will be able to forge ahead despite  problems. We have confidence in our principles and are sure of  our policies. We do need, however, the support and positive  spirit of all Guatemalans, because we can overcome any  difficulties if we are united. The biggest challenge is to  construct the country we desire for our children, a Guatemala  that lives in peace, prosperity, and solidarity.    People of Guatemala: In view of the government's financial  crisis, I have made decisions that help resolve it from an  administrative, institutional, and fiscal viewpoint. I fully  trust that the Congress will study and eventually approve the  proposals that have been presented. I trust all taxpayers will  conscientiously perform their legal duties. The government has  pledged to invest taxes in security, health, education, etc.  That is our duty. If taxpayers fail to pay their taxes, the  law will be strictly enforced.    If, for any reason, the proposals are not passed, I would be  forced to take other measures that would temporarily solve the  problem but could harm all Guatemalans through inflation and the  subsequent economic cost that the population would have to bear.  The Congress and the people will have to say the final word. So  will the government, regarding the part that concerns it; the  Congress, by supporting the proposals; the taxpayers, by paying  their taxes; and the government, by spending honestly the  Guatemalan people's resources. Thank you for your attention.  Good night.</p>

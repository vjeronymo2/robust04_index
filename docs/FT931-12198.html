			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Management: Spotting talent from Wyoming to London How does a holding company with hundreds of far-flung operating subsidiaries and tens of thousands of worldwide employees spot its best in-house management talent? Peter Harper, chairman of Hanson's UK industrial division, says the onus of seeking out tomorrow's high-fliers inevitably falls on managing directors and group divisional heads. In recent years, however, Hanson believes its annual Achiever Awards scheme  -whose 1992 winners were announced yesterday - has performed a valuable supplementary role. 'One of its aims is to make sure that no one slips between the cracks,' says Harper. 'MDs and finance directors get easily noticed inside companies, but we believe the award scheme is important for others, especially those in production positions, whom we might not see.' Last year's competition - which as usual was divided into UK and US sections  -attracted written submissions from almost 200 of Hanson's worldwide employees in management positions. In the UK the award rotates between 'Young Achievers' under 30, 'Middle Managers' under 40 (the 1992 target group) and 'All Comers'. Ageism is hardly a criticism that can be made of a group run by two septuagenarians, but bracketing by age group is potentially damaging to American sensitivities so the scheme there is open to everyone every year. Harper concedes it is impossible to know whether good senior management candidates might have slipped through the net without the competition, and whether the course of individual careers has been changed. Most of the previous 11 winners have been promoted, notably the 1983 victor Les Ashford who is now chief executive of Hanson Industrial Services and an associate director since last year, and the 1982 Young Achiever Chris Thomas (now chief executive of the Hanson subsidiary industries). The odds, therefore, appear to be on further promotions for the latest UK winner, Anthony Kujawa, a 38-year-old director of ARC Northern in charge of Premix, and for his US counterpart Douglas Wagner, 45-year-old manager at Peabody's Powder River Rochelle Mine. Both men were delighted by their success - and who would blame them when the prize is lunch with the boss and a two-week tour of Hanson operations on the opposite side of the Atlantic - but insistent that there is a wider value to both them and the company. Says Wagner, whose mine is in a remote location in Wyoming 65 miles from the nearest town: 'This has given not only me, but the employees who work for me, a chance to be recognised in the group for what we have done. We are part of the non-union portion of the Peabody mines, and there is not a lot of mixing between the two. 'I started the operation from bare grass and we have increased profits and beaten our budget every year.' Powder River now produces 16m tonnes of coal a year and is reckoned to be the most productive surface mine in the US. Kujawa's achievement was to pioneer environmental reviews at ARC Northern - a practice which has since spread to other parts of Hanson's UK concrete and aggregates subsidiary. His recommendations included the research for and installation of the first concrete and waste recycling units in the UK, as well as the installation of a new mixing process now claimed to be a model for high-volume developments. Kujawa says much of his work was carried out with the help of consultants - but he cautions companies against bringing in consultants on their own. 'You use their expertise but you need the commitment of your managers or the whole thing can be a waste of time.'</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Markets bank on falling rates: Bonds stronger across Europe GOVERNMENT bond prices, which rise in anticipation of a fall in interest rates, were stronger throughout the member countries of the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday. The Bundesbank decision to keep the discount rate unchanged surprised the markets. But there had been a conviction that something had to happen to help ease the high rate problem of the other ERM members. Ms Marie Owens Thomsen, an economist with Midland Global Markets in London, said: 'From a trading point of view it's not that difficult. One way or another rates are going to come down.' German debt prices shrugged off the Bundesbank's refusal to reduce its floor rate from 6.75 per cent. However, Ecu bonds, which represent the whole range of currencies in the ERM rather than just individual component parts, fell sharply. French government bonds rose about two thirds of a percentage point on a conviction that either through mutual realignment or independent easing French short-term rates will have to fall. Spanish bonds lept for the same reason. Outside the ERM, the attractions of sterling as a safe haven currency prompted buyers of UK government bonds and gilt prices rose half a point in spite of the extra supply from Wednesday's Pounds 3.25bn Treasury auction. Gilts also shrugged off nervousness surrounding yesterday's by-election in Christchurch, southern England, which was seen as an uphill battle for the governing Conservative party. Italy, also outside the ERM, saw its bond market pick up sharply.</p>

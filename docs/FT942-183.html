			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Watchdog finds failures in consultancy projects Councils, local health authorities and the National Health Service are spending more than Pounds 120m a year on management consultants - but they are not making adequate efforts to track expenditure or assess value for money, the Audit Commission says today. The public expenditure watchdog says a study of more than 200 projects found that up to 60 per cent of consultants' recommendations were ignored; most projects lacked incentives to complete the job successfully; a third of projects were commissioned without drawing up any written agreement; and the majority of assignments in health provision were not put out to competitive tender and had inadequate briefs. The commission's report echoes most of the criticisms made in a recently leaked Cabinet Office Efficiency Unit report on consultants in the civil service. This found that Whitehall departments and agencies could find savings of only around Pounds 10m a year from expenditure on consultancy running at more than Pounds 500m a year. The Audit Commission says consultants can contribute much to change in the public sector, especially by providing skills not available in-house. Many of the reforms in health provision and local government could not have been implemented so fast without their help, the report says. However, building up in-house skills might be a cheaper solution in some cases, the commission believes. There is also concern over the amount of consultancy used and some of the fees being charged. The report says the process of buying consultancy is badly managed and could be made much more effective without adding greatly to the bureaucracy. There was confusion over how projects should be put out to tender, weaknesses in specifying the task, a failure to identify all the costs at the outset, and poor management of the work, especially in monitoring results. Local authorities emerged from the study as better than the NHS and health authorities in many aspects of commissioning consultancy work. Their performance in choosing consultants and drawing up briefs reflected the experience of compulsory competitive tendering for local government services. Health authorities were better at structuring projects to achieve and evaluate results. But 70 per cent of health projects were assigned without competition, the commission found. The Management Consultancies Association reacted to the report by offering training in how to get the best out of consultancy. Reaching the Peak? Getting Value for Money from Management Consultants.

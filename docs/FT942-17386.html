			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): Strength in US should cover UK blushes - Invesco MIM Almost every mention of Invesco MIM's name in the UK last year was accompanied by references to two things: a record Pounds 750,000 fine from regulator Imro, and the saga of its involvement in the Mirror Group pension scheme - denuded by the late Robert Maxwell. The Imro fine has been digested, and in an out-of-court settlement earlier this year, Invesco paid the trustees of the Mirror Group scheme Pounds 11m, without admitting liability. Analysts say the group has now cleaned itself up - but results for last year, due on Thursday, are expected to reflect a struggle to retain institutional clients and to attract new business in the UK. At the interim stage, the European division (including the UK) had just moved back into profit. Luckily for Invesco, however, there is little awareness of or concern over these affairs in the US, the source of an overwhelming proportion of the group's funds under management. US mutual funds put on spectacular growth during 1993, and Invesco's strength in the US should mean that profits from the US division more than outweigh any weakness in the UK. Most analysts' forecasts for last year's pre-tax profits are in the Pounds 30m-Pounds 40m range, after the exceptional charge of Pounds 11m for the pay-out to the Mirror pensioners. Bolder forecasts go to Pounds 50m or more, compared with Pounds 12.6m after exceptionals in 1992. The total dividend is expected to stay at last year's reduced level of 3p, or possibly increased by 1p. But the company is thought to be too concerned with rebuilding its balance sheet to bring the dividend back to its 1991 level of 6p. Even if the results are considerably better than forecast, analysts say the share price may not be much affected because of the market downturn and fears that the boom in US mutual funds is over.</p>

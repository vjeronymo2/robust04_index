			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: MDIS buys Xerox Computer Services McDonnell Information Systems, the Hemel Hempstead-based computing services company, has agreed to pay about Dollars 30m (Pounds 20m) for Xerox Computer Services, a division of Xerox Corporation of the US which markets software for manufacturing applications. The company said the acquisition would give it a 'strong presence' in the US and expand its range of computer applications with an integrated manufacturing software package - called 'Chess' - already installed in 200 sites. XCS had revenues of Dollars 20m last year and about 200 staff will transfer under the deal. MDIS was floated on the London stock exchange in March of this year. The flotation, which valued the group at about Pounds 250m, was one of the largest in the information technology sector this year. MDIS specialises in applications software and software tools. On a post-flotation pro forma basis, the company had pre-tax profits of Pounds 21.3m in the year to December 1993. Mr Jerry Causley, MDIS chief executive, said: Chess complements our existing offerings to what we see as a global market.'</p>

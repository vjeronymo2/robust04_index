			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Frankfurt feels the chill winds of recession - Investors believe that German equities will only recover when the Bundesbank eases News yesterday that Klockner-Werke, a big steel, plastics and machinery group, had filed for the German equivalent of Chapter 11 protection from its creditors is the latest in a series of blows for the German stock market. In the past few months, one company after another has announced poor profits and plans to trim staff. These include Daimler-Benz, the country's biggest industrial company, where earnings are likely to drop by a quarter over this year, as well as virtually all the motor companies, the big chemicals companies and the large engineering groups. This is vivid evidence that after two years of post-reunification growth, which decoupled Germany from the economic downturn afflicting most of the rest of the world, the country is sliding rapidly from stagnation to recession. Economists are predicting zero growth for west German GDP next year, a prognosis which may soon look too optimistic. Furthermore, the interest rate environment in Germany remains harsh, especially given the weakness of the economy. The Bundesbank raised interest rates to historically high levels in July, reduced them only grudgingly during September's European currency crisis, and failed to deliver a long-awaited further cut in rates after its regular council meeting on Thursday. None of this was forecast a year ago when brokers were making their forecasts for 1992. As Mr Uwe Flach, a main board director of the DG Bank, said ruefully in a recent speech, the expectation was that the DAX index would climb from around 1,550 to 1,900 - a mistaken prognosis, he admitted. For the first few months of the year, such expectations seemed to be justified and the index climbed to 1,812 in the last week of May. But it has since fallen back below 1,500 and is now 4.5 per cent below its level at the start of the year. Seasoned investors know that an equity market can rally even during the deepest recession, but there is little support for the view that now is a good time to buy German equities. The best that analysts hope for is a small rally towards the end of the first quarter next year, but a sustained recovery is only likely in the second half. The reasoning behind this is that the full deterioration of the economy has yet to feed through into equity prices. There has been a general reluctance by both investors and managers of German companies to believe that Germany could fall victim to a fully-fledged recession, after 10 years of unbroken growth. Even if other German companies do not suffer the same fate as Klockner-Werke, their fourth-quarter profit figures - not to be published until late January or February - could come in well below expectations and prompt further share price weakness. Working against this pessimistic view is the widespread hope that the Bundesbank will eventually cut its headline interest rates, in line with its stance in previous recessions when it has relaxed policy significantly. According to many forecasts, the Lombard rate is likely to fall to 7 per cent by the end of next year, from 9.50 per cent now. Recent confirmation of weakness in the economy - combined with the first signs of wage restraint (steelworkers in the north-west of Germany settled for 3.3 per cent between 1992 and 1994) - has encouraged the belief that the Bundesbank will cut its rates during the first quarter of next year. When the Bundesbank finally cuts its rates, this should revive the equity market. If the cut is generous enough to be taken as an unequivocal sign that the era of high interest rates is over, it will also provide an incentive for investors to look beyond Germany's short-term troubles. But there are two problems here. Firstly, it is by no means certain that the Bundesbank will cut interest rates that quickly, or that sharply: as Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the bank's president, made clear again this week, inflation at 3.7 per cent is still too high in Germany and the increase in VAT scheduled for the beginning of next year will take it above 4 per cent. Moreover, Mr Schlesinger maintains that long-term interest rates have been cut already. Long bund yields are at 7.3 per cent, where they were before reunification and down from 8.4 per cent a year ago. He also maintains that high short-term rates have not damaged the economy. The second problem is that even when rates are cut, say, towards the end of the first quarter, there may still be more bad news to come on the economy. Thus the equity rally induced by the first cut in the Lombard rate may be short-lived. Consequently, brokers are already looking ahead to 1994, by which time they confidently expect the US and other countries in Europe to have pulled their economies out of recession and in so doing, will help export-orientated Germany to recover.</p>

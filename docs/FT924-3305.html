			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Bribe case against rail chiefs collapses THE OLD BAILEY corruption trial of a former British Rail senior executive and two directors of Plasser GB, the rail maintenance supplier, collapsed yesterday for lack of evidence. Mr David Currie, BR's former head of civil engineering, Mr Norbert Jurasek, Plasser's managing director, Mr Michael Brooks, Plasser's company secretary, and the Austrian-owned company itself were all acquitted of bribery charges on the orders of the judge. All were also acquitted of another charge of conspiring to bribe other BR staff. The prosecution had alleged that corporate hospitality and entertainment provided by Plasser to Mr Currie and other BR employees amounted to a corrupt attempt to win contracts. The hospitality included air tickets to Europe and the US, cases of wine and tickets to sporting events. Mr Justice Buckley said the charges against Plasser and the three men related to items worth a maximum of Pounds 11,000 spent over 10 years. Depending on the method of calculation, that figure might be just Pounds 5,000 over the period, he said. It was not a case of bribery in the sense of money being passed, he went on. There had been no evidence of the alleged bribes having worked and the Plasser defendants had never tried to 'call in' the bribes by reminding BR staff of the benefits they had received, he said. Prosecution allegations that the gifts had enabled Mr Currie to live the life of a rich man were simply not borne out by the evidence, he went on. Mr Justice Buckley strongly criticised BR for not having acted earlier. In 1983, BR held an internal inquiry after a complaint from a rival supplier about the extent of Plasser's entertaining. Although the level of hospitality breached its guidelines on accepting gifts, the judge said, BR made no attempt to correct the situation or point out to Plasser that the scale of its entertaining was embarrassing. It was a tragedy that BR had allowed the situation to continue. Had the matter been dealt with then, the case would never had come to court, he said. BR said later guidelines on accepting gifts had since been tightened up to avoid a recurrence of the situation. The costs of the trial - estimated at between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m  - will be met from public funds. The prosecution was initiated by British Transport Police, an independent arm of British Rail, which first raided Plasser's offices in September 1988. Since the legal proceedings began, it is understood that Plasser's business with BR has declined substantially. Contracts worth several millions of pounds have been won by competitors.</p>

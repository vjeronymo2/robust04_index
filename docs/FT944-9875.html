			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Magnet advisers to settle cases Advisers and bankers to the failed management buy-out of Magnet, the retailer of fitted kitchens, have agreed to settle court cases in which damages could have been as high as Pounds 1bn. Parties involved include Bankers Trust, the US bank which led the banking syndicate, GE Capital, one of the syndicate's members, Arthur Andersen, adviser to Magnet's management, and Arthur Young, Magnet's auditor. All parties to the dispute have signed a settlement agreement that will come into effect when one undisclosed condition is met. Those close to the dispute say a full settlement could be in place by the end of the month. The case involved two separate legal actions. GE Capital, which lost about Pounds 70m, claimed damages from Bankers Trust, which in turn sued accountants Arthur Andersen for Pounds 600m. That is roughly the amount lost by the banks which backed the deal. The companies involved refuse to discuss the settlement terms. But the payment expected to be made by Arthur Andersen to Bankers Trust is thought to be less than Pounds 50m. Arthur Young, now part of Ernst &amp; Young, is expected to contribute to the settlement. Bankers Trust argued that Arthur Andersen was negligent for failing to provide it with an objective and independent report on Magnet. The accounting firm denied the allegation. It claimed that it never did any due diligence or audit work for the bank, and that its duty during the buy-out was entirely to Magnet management. GE Capital claimed that Bankers Trust had 'completely failed' to discharge its responsibilities as syndicate leader and ignored warnings about Magnet's financial health. The Pounds 629m Magnet buy-out in 1989 was the largest ever and the first involving 'mezzanine' finance. Senior lenders, led by Bankers Trust, put in Pounds 372.5m. Refinancing talks between Magnet and the banks began after the deal closed, and substantial interest on the debt was rolled-up into the capital. Lower-than-expected profits, the collapse of the housing market and high interest rates soon took their toll on the highly-borrowed retailer. Airedale Holdings, Magnet's parent company, had debts of Pounds 800m by the time it went into receivership in December 1992. The banks that were the original senior lenders bought the operating company from the receiver. It was sold earlier this year for Pounds 56m. The court cases had been expected to raise a series of important legal precedents about the nature of diligence on acquisitions, and the duty of care of corporate finance advisers and lead banks to syndicate members.</p>

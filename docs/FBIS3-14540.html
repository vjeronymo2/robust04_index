Perhaps this was justified by certain  circumstances and by bilateral relations that did not require  constant contact in order to be developed. Moreover, the  political situation in Iraq at that time allowed it to achieve  successes at the UN because of the Iranian rejection of any  peaceful settlement to the Iraqi-Iranian conflict. This is in  addition to the fact that most other countries understood Iraq's  stand, except for major and Western countries, which had selfish  interests and sought to prolong the conflict on the ground,  taking advantage of the United Nations as a political forum that  provided them with an opportunity to avoid a peaceful solution.  This is similar to the present situation, but with a different  form and method aimed at keeping Iraq in its current situation  for the longest time possible so that these countries can meet  their agenda in the region. This was clear in their alternating  support for Iraq and for Iran.    It is also obvious that the means available to Iraq at the  time were no longer available after 2 August 1990 and the  subsequent barbaric aggression against Iraq. On the contrary,  the United Nations became a field for political confrontation  against Iraq, through the use of all its institutions, as a main  tool to break the will of and destroy Iraq. This restricted the  role of Iraq in terms of influencing these institutions and the  UN member states because of U.S., Western, and Zionist hegemony.  This fact led to the conclusion that all of Iraq's efforts at  the international organization's level would not achieve their  objectives even though Iraq mobilized all legal, political, and  factual arguments to support their case.    In light of this situation, I believe that Iraq should no  longer deem it enough to work with the United Nations alone --  although this is something that has been imposed on Iraq and  Iraq has been given no other choice. In order to support and  render its work a success, Iraq should intensify its bilateral  contacts, not only with UN member states, but also with all  countries of influence within their particular geographical  groups, based on a plan created by the Foreign Ministry. If  this is achieved and we are able to realize tangible progress in  those relations that were greatly harmed, then our stand in the  United Nations will improve and our proposals and views will  have an effect on friends and just nations. This is especially  true if we take into consideration that the current  international situation has changed and that there has been an  emergence of many countries that could express their viewpoint  in a manner different than that during the Kuwait crisis.    I note, regrettably, that we have ignored our continuing  ties  with our friends. Our moves were confined to certain periods of  time, after which we forgot about such moves until major events  on the level of our relation with the United Nations occurred.  Even if we made a move toward one of these nations, such a move  basically ended up in New York because we did not have many  ambassadors in many important countries that could have  influence on a case such as ours.    Based on my study of the developments in countries' stands  toward us, I find it appropriate that the Foreign Ministry's  action plan should cover many fronts:    Within the framework of inter-Arab relations, it is  necessary  to continue our contacts with the countries whose stands toward  us continue to be relatively positive.    As for the Gulf countries, it has become clear to every  observer that there has been a change in their stands toward  Iraq. Some are even publicly announcing their stands and their  sympathy with us without any fear from the media. These  developments should be an incentive for us to intensify and  broaden our contacts with these countries.    We also find that stands on the international level are  tangibly improving. Even though it did not make a declared  stand exactly as we wanted, Britain is no longer raising the  banner against Iraq as it did before. Mr. Tariq 'Aziz's meeting  with the British ambassador at the Security Council may not be  considered a bad step. What applies to Britain also applies on  other European countries, including France, Italy, Spain, and  former socialist states, led by Russia. If we are able to reach  out to these countries and talk to them in the language of  interests that they understand, then I am confident that we can  reach good results.    It is important not to restrict our moves toward certain  countries. There are countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin  America that have influence in the international arena and at  the same time have economic interests and problems that Iraq can  help solve.</p>

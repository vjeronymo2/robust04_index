			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading FADING hopes of a reduction in interest rates, together with poor economic data from both the US and the UK, led to aggressive selling of Footsie futures, writes Joel Kibazo. The first trade in the June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index was struck at 2,859 and initially led to hopes of a strong buying session. However, those hopes faded with the release of German money supply figures showing a sharp rise. Dealers took this as a signal of no cut in UK base rates and it triggered an aggressive wave of selling, led mainly by independent traders. This increased with the release of worse than expected UK retail sales figures, and the continued fall led to the erosion of the premium by mid-session. In the afternoon, dealers focused on the poor US budget deficit statistics, sending the contract lower in anticipation of a poor opening on Wall Street. Sporadic bargain hunting was seen in the late afternoon when New York opened firmer than anticipated. June finished at 2,828, down 30 from its previous close and around 6 points ahead of its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 5. Turnover was 11,201 at the official close. Volume in the traded options was a hefty 41,096 lots, of which 13,017 contracts were in the FT-SE 100 option. Barclays was the busiest stock option with 1,445 lots.</p>

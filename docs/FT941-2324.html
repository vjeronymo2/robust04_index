			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Super 301 is not for you, EU told The US has sought to ease transatlantic trade tensions by insisting it is not considering invoking Super 301 sanctions in its disputes with Brussels over public procurement and audio-visual markets. Mr Stuart Eizenstat, the US ambassador to the EU, also expressed cautious optimism Washington was making progress in its efforts to improve European understanding of its attempts to open Japan's market. 'There is at least a beginning of (EU) interest in talking to the US and trying to learn more,' he said. However, their approaches still differed widely, and Brussels' suspicions of US tactics remained high. Although Mr Eizenstat said the US would continue a firm line with Brussels on outstanding bilateral trade problems, his generally conciliatory tone suggests Washington is anxious to lower the temperature of its dealings with the EU. In particular, he went out of his way to soothe recent concern in Brussels that Washington would take Super 301 action unless the EU acted more decisively to open its telecommunications equipment markets to foreign suppliers. The EU and the US are holding further talks on public procurement in Washington this week to try to resolve their differences before next month's ministerial conference of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Marrakesh. Although the two sides have sought to clarify their dispute by commissioning an independent study of transatlantic procurement markets, their interpretations of its preliminary findings appear to differ sharply. The EU claims the study shows US markets are less open than its own. But Mr Eizenstat said the study merely confirmed the lack of transparency in tendering for European state and municipal contracts. He said the US was taking a 'co-operative' stance on audio-visual trade, where its main priority was to avoid further EU broadcasting restrictions. Washington hoped talks between entertainment industries on both sides of the Atlantic would lead to a more open EU market and increased collaboration. The US would accept the outcome of a forthcoming review by Brussels of a five-year exemption from competition law of the leading Hollywood studios' European distribution arrangements, providing the case was a given 'a transparent, fair, due-process hearing on its merits'. Mr Eizenstat said he was 'gravely concerned' that that objective could be prejudiced by recent moves in the European Parliament in support of Europe's television industry and statements by Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the European culture commissioner. Mr Eizenstat said the US and the EU had 'an identity of interest' in working to cut the Japanese trade surplus, but Japan had obscured it by persuading Brussels that Washington was engaged in an attempt to manage trade. He did not want the EU and the US to give the impression that they were 'ganging up' on Japan. 'If we the EU understands what we're up to, if we can get the EU to focus on its own self-interest, it would send an important signal.'</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: North West Water The European Court did its best to spoil a respectable set of interim figures from North West Water. By judging the UK guilty of poor water quality, the court highlighted the vast capital spending which could be required to bring standards up to scratch. Since North West is responsible for a region still drinking water from lead pipes, it is more exposed than most. If the industry is allowed to make a healthy rate of return on investment, of course, higher standards could be good for shareholders. But that is taking a lot on trust. North West is still waiting to hear what rate of return the regulator will allow on Pounds 430m unexpected environmental spending over the next two years. North West may be wise to look for profits elsewhere. Ventures in process engineering and water supply overseas could help sustain dividend growth if the regulator gets tough. But diversification - like capital spending - is a double-edged sword. Profits from outside the regulated water business are less reliable. Like other ambitious water companies, North West will have to prove it can manage diversification effectively.</p>

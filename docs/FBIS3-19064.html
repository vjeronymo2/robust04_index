"The American Defense Secretary William Perry contacted me  on  Wednesday. I think we can handle this mission," said Bjoerck  during a military conference in Halmstad, southern Sweden.    No details were released on when the redeployment could take  place.    "We're still working on how this will exactly happen," he  underlined.    But a decision could be made quickly, without a  parliamentary  discussion, Bjoerck added.    "Parliament has given permission to send a maximum of 1,000  men to Bosnia. There are just over 800 there now, so there is  room to manoeuvre," he said.    Nordic defense ministers could meet to discuss the issue in  the next few days, Bjoerck hinted.    Meanwhile Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, speaking at a  meeting of political party leaders in Stockholm, said the issue  would be further examined at a meeting of the advisory council  on foreign affairs next week.</p>

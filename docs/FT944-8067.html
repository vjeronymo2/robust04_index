			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Hamilton repeats Fayed denials Mr Neil Hamilton, the former corporate affairs minister, last night denied that he had been guilty of any impropriety as a result of his involvement with Mr Mohamed Fayed, the owner of Harrods. In his first speech in the Commons since returning to the back benches, Mr Hamilton attacked the press for hounding him out of office after he had been subjected to allegations. He insisted that there was no truth in the claim that, before becoming a minister, he had accepted bribes at 'Pounds 2,000 a time' to put down parliamentary questions. Nor, said Mr Hamilton, had he received Pounds 50,000 for putting down 17 questions for the House of Fraser, the one-time owner of Harrods. Tory backbenchers rallied to his support as he denied abusing his position as an MP, or betraying the trust of the prime minister. Mr Hamilton said he bitterly resented suggestions that 'I was prepared to to accept payment in cash or kind to ask parliamentary questions or change my opinions'. He contrasted the extended publicity given to his 'celebrated stay' at the Ritz hotel in Paris - owned by Mr Fayed - to the brevity of a report about a payment which Lord Callaghan, the former Labour prime minister, had failed to declare in the Commons register of interests through a 'mere technical over-sight'. Mr Hamilton dismissed charges of 'so-called sleaze' levelled at the government in general, and stressed that the 'plethora of allegations' to which he had been subjected in no way concerned his conduct as a minister. He suggested that the Nolan committee examining the standards of conduct in public life should have its remit extended to cover the activities of the media. Mr Hamilton said the power of an editor vastly transcended that of most MPs and that of many ministers.</p>

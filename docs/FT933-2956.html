			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Survey of Relaunching the Ruhr (7): Solar showpiece arises - Rheinelbe Science Park THE key to the character of the Rheinelbe Science Park, now being built on the site of the former Thyssen crude steel works in Gelsenkirchen, will lie on the roof. Two enormous glass sails will rise from the twin towers of the new building, and along its entire 350 metre-length will march serried ranks of three metre-square glass panels. The whole complex will add up to the largest roof-based solar power plant yet to be built in Germany, and the plan is to provide all the communal power needs of the 17,000 square metre building from the sun. Professor Dieter Otten, the chief executive of the science park, who thought up the idea, and pushed it through, sees it as a natural development of the history of the Ruhr region. 'For years we have been producing solar energy in fossil form - coal,' he says. 'That has the added disadvantage that it produces carbon dioxide. 'The science park, linked to the Ruhr's tradition of energy production, will show we can produce a technology for the future, out of future energy.' He admits that it was hard to persuade the backers of the science park - the North Rhine-Westphalian state government, the Emscher Park international building exhibition, and local industry - to support his investment. 'The idea did not have many supporters. It was opposed particularly by the people representing traditional technology.' Professor Otten had, however, a second line of attack: the solar energy panels could be produced in Gelsenkirchen itself, in precisely the sort of public-private sector co-operation which the science park is designed to promote. The panels will be produced by Flachglas, the Pilkington glass-making subsidiary in the town, and designed by Flagsol, its solar energy subsidiary. The other partner in the venture is Britain's BP, which produces the photo-voltaic cells used in the solar panels. That appeared to clinch the plan. Now the entire science park is intended to be focussed particularly on all possible uses and development of solar energy. 'The solar energy power plant will be our external symbol,' Professor Otten says. 'Our aim is to attract as many people here as possible, to set up training programmes and seminars on the uses of solar energy. We expect masses of solar energy tourists to come visiting.' Among the first occupants of the science park will be an institute for applied photo-voltaic technology, as well as an organisation appropriately called Zeus - the centre for energy conversion and storage. Forty per cent of the DM7.5m costs will be borne by the European Community's research programme, and 10 per cent by North Rhine-Westphalia. The future tenants are expected to finance the difference. Mr Joachim Benemann, chief executive of Flagsol, is quite clear why he, and Flachglas, are involved. 'Our aim is simply to find all possible ways of increasing the sale of glass,' he says. The company has now set up a special production unit in Gelsenkirchen to produce the panels, using a special technique of pouring resin between two panes of glass to seal the solar cells in place. 'I was not convinced it was going to work,' he said. 'The breakthrough has yet to come in Europe. Some say it is too expensive, and that we don't have enough sun. But it's a technology that no one can criticise.' Which is no doubt why the unlikely site of the industrial heart of the Ruhr region has been chosen for such a high-profile experiment in solar power generation. 'We want to prove that it is a perfectly effective, conventional source of power,' Professor Otten says. 'The EC wants to use it as a demonstration project, to show how the latest technology can be intelligently used in the public grid. 'The demonstration effect will be much greater than if it were buried somewhere in the countryside. You will have a power plant, a manufacturer, and an institute for applied solar energy, all in the same spot. What more can you ask for, if you are studying uses of solar energy?'</p>

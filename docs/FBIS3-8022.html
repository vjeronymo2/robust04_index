Inhabitants of the Kantrida settlement in the Croatian port  of Rijeka in [word indistinct] particular way expressed  dissatisfaction with Slovenia's policy towards Croatia and the  deteriorating relations between Ljubljana and Zagreb.    On a number of ocassions they threw stones at trains on the  Rijeka-Ljubljana line, the Rijeka police said.

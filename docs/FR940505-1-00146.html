			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An airline's compliance with a seasonal environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance target will be determined by comparing actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pounds-per-PEU performance against the target. An airline whose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actual performance exceeds the target will be required to submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a fee proportional to the resultant excess emissions, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in ``Fee System'' above. This fee will be remitted along  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the annual compliance determination report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An airline's annual emissions/activity report will include a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement signed by a corporate officer affirming the report's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accuracy. Failure to provide accurate information in the annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions/activity report will be considered a FIP violation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to EPA enforcement. Reporting airlines will be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to maintain copies of their annual reports for three years,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including all relevant calculation worksheets and supporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> f <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Exemptions. EPA requests comment on the desirability of providing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemptions from the requirements of this control program for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain types of commercial aircraft operations or unusual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situations. Atypical aircraft operations beyond the control of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an airline and not anticipated in the design of the operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data collection system, such as in-flight emergency situations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring emergency landings, could be exempted from reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements and would not count toward an airline's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental performance. Also, certain small commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aircraft operators might be unnecessarily burdened under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program relative to the emissions reductions that might be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtained. EPA requests comment on the desirability and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasibility of establishing a de minimis exemption for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control program. Additionally, the Agency requests comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the desirability of waiving part or all of any fee incurred by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual airlines that can demonstrate unreasonable economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hardship or burden on interstate commerce. Finally, comments are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solicited on appropriate procedures and criteria for granting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemptions to foreign flag air carriers to ensure compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> international treaties, bilaterial agreements, or when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary or Deputy Secretary of the Department of State find  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that granting such an exemption is in the national interest of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Legal Authority and Regulatory Interactions. As noted in this preamble, EPA has broad authority under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 110(c) to promulgate regulations in a FIP when states  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have failed to submit a state plan or have submitted defective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state plans.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Southland Terminal Corp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 504 F.2d 646,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 669 (1st Cir. 1979). The courts have not required EPA to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate explicit authority for promulgating specific control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures in FIPs. Instead, EPA may exercise its broad authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under section 110(c) unless such authority is expressly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibited under the Act, other statutes, or the United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Constitution. EPA's general regulatory authority and its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority under section 110(c) include the ability to impose and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforce pollution fees.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 42 U.S.C. Sections 110(a)(2)(A);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 172(c)(6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress has also granted express authority to EPA to set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions standards for certain sources of pollution, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aircraft and new locomotive engines.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 42 U.S.C. Sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7547, 7571 (a)(2). In vesting EPA with authority to promulgate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aircraft emissions standards, Congress recognized the authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to regulate aircraft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design and manage the navigable airspace to assure safety and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency. Sections 231 and 232 of the Act establish a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooperative scheme in which EPA is required to consult with FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in setting emissions standards, and FAA is charged with enforcing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those standards. 42 U.S.C. Sections 7571&hyph;7472. The president  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may disapprove any standard after notice and an opportunity for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing, based upon a finding by the FAA that the standard would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> create a hazard to safety. Additionally, in section 233,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress preempted the states from enacting or enforcing any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards for aircraft that did not conform to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federal standards.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 7573.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's broad powers under section 110(c) provide the legal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority for promulgating the control strategy proposed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIP_an emissions fee system based on a declining performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> target expressed in per passenger emissions that can be achieved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through either operational or technological means. EPA is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exercising its authority under section 231 to promulgate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology forcing emission standards for aircraft engines as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control strategy in this FIP. Nevertheless, the proposed control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategy maintains cooperative interaction between EPA and FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and recognizes FAA's expertise in aircraft safety and navigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has consulted with FAA in drafting the proposed control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategy and will continue to consult and cooperate with FAA in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finalizing and implementing the control strategy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has determined that the proposed control strategy is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well within the broad scope of powers under section 110(c) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the strategy is not prohibited under any provisions in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act. As explained elsewhere in this preamble, EPA has solid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legal authority for fee systems to encourage emission reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, EPA believes that the proposed control strategy is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibited by or in direct conflict with other federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations and statutes, such as the Airline Deregulation Act of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1978 (``ADA''), the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (``ANCA''), or the Federal Aviation Act, which establishes FAA for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overseeing aircraft safety, the efficient use of the navigable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airspace, and the national air transportation system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

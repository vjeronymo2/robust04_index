			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In the program On the Spot this morning, Nikola  Koljevic, vice president of the Srpska republic, commented on  the significance of the turning point in the Bosnian drama: the  involvement of the Russian diplomacy at five to twelve.    [Begin Koljevic recording] It is important that it is five  to twelve. The turning point happened at the last moment, the  moment after which there can be no other turning point. I think  that this is a great success for the Russian diplomacy, and, I  would add, a great success in recognizing what the Serbs have  been committed to from the start. This is not an issue of the  siege of Sarajevo, but an issue of defense, of two sides, of the  strategic balance between the Serb artillery and the Muslim  infantry. The Russian initiative has solved that problem. The  arrival of Russian units will enable the withdrawal of the Serb  artillery that will not endanger the safety of the Serbs around  Sarajevo.    The only danger now, in my opinion, is that in the coming  days of the so-called ultimatum, there might be provocations and  incidents. The UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] is obliged to  prevent any misinterpretation of such incidents, incidents that  can be expected. Finally, the regular UNPROFOR reports can be  enough to prevent such attempts by the Muslims. [end recording]    [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] Mr. Koljevic,  we understand that you are saying that further developments  depend on the behavior of the Muslim side and, of course, its  western allies that support it. [end recording]    [Begin Koljevic recording] Of course, of course,  particularly because the Serbian side has been cooperative to  the maximum and, I would add, now it is protected, after the  Russian initiative there is no more concern about the disruption  of the strategic balance. It is known from the UN Charter that  the basic thing in all peace operations is that no side can  profit during the peace process. That would compromise the  United Nations very much, and that is what UNPROFOR fears the  most. We hope that this will have a considerable effect on  overcoming this crisis, this need of theirs, that no side should  benefit from this. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / International Company News: French issue lifts Ecu bond market FRANCE provided an important lift for the Ecu bond market yesterday with the announcement that it plans to auction between Ecu500m and Ecu700m of a new 10-year stock on Monday. The Ecu bond auction will mark the first substantial issue of Ecu bonds since Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty on June 2, which threw the Ecu bond market into confusion and cast doubts over European economic and monetary union. France, which has been a keen supporter of European economic and monetary union, has traditionally been one of the most significant issuers of Ecu bonds. France last issued Ecu bonds in April 1992, apart from some limited issuance intended for repo purposes. Mr John Hall, international economist at Swiss Bank Corporation, described the decision as 'very significant and very important for the Ecu bond market as it shows that issuance has come back'. He pointed out that 10-year Ecu bond yields have fallen from their peak of about 220 basis points over 10-year German government bond yields, to around 107 basis points. Ten-year Ecu bonds yield 72 basis points more than French government bonds so it is more expensive for the French treasury to fund its borrowing requirement in Ecu than in French francs.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 6 May (EFE) -- Foreign Minister Sergio  Abreu has confirmed to foreign correspondents that his country's  stance on Mercosur [Common Market of the South] is to  consolidate it. He nonetheless conceded that "as in any  integration process, the road is paved with difficulties."    He moreover pointed out that with regard to the  controversial  issue of duty free zones, his country "will neither change its  position nor make any concessions, because the private sector --  the one that invests there -- needs clear and predictable rules  of the game." Besides, he contended that it has been "proven"  that for Uruguay "it is a very useful tool for achieving  development."    Abreu denied that Uruguay will withdraw from negotiations  over the common external tariff. Nevertheless, he acknowledged  that one or two officials might have voiced their personal  opinions, which do not reflect the government's official  position. The government never "as an institution entertained  the idea of leaving Mercosur, or voiced a desire to do so."    Abreu's remarks were made during a news conference,  following  the release of press reports on 5 May which, citing government  officials, indicated that Uruguay had decided to withdraw from  negotiations until Brazil had explained its proposal to  establish a South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA).    The foreign minister stated that "to date, Uruguay's  strategy  and position are clearly known to be in favor of the  consolidation of Mercosur in all its manifestations." He  explained that these consist of "the enhancement of free trade  zones, which will have been concluded by the end of the year  with the exception of the Treaty of Asuncion for Uruguay and  Paraguay, and the definition of the common external tariff."    Abreu added that this will not necessarily entail  establishing a customs union, "which needs other instruments for  its creation, such as the system of origin, clear rules and  regulations on exceptions in foreign trade, and also aspects  that have to do with the settlement of controversies." He  underlined that the countries are undertaking "a gradual process  in a negotiation that is by no means easy."    The foreign minister reported that there is consensus  between  the four Mercosur partners -- Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and  Uruguay -- on 85 percent of the subjects pertaining to the  common external tariff. Despite this, he noted that three major  sectors "that are very sensitive to the two more developed  economies, Brazil and Argentina, namely capital goods, the  petrochemical industry, and computer science," are still pending.    Abreu said that Uruguay, like the other member countries, is  studying the Brazilian proposal for creating SAFTA, which has to  be improved to make it compatible with Mercosur's political  projects and with the other integration endeavors.    Abreu believes that SAFTA "is Brazil's absolutely  understandable reaction to NAFTA" in defense of South American  trade.    Insisting on defending tax-free zones, the minister said  that  once the common external tariff is set "we will know what type  of integration we want and what type of protection from third  countries we will have."    Abreu considered the common external tariff to be "of prime  importance, and it will affect the free zones, which Uruguay  will not change."    The minister pointed out that the economies of some regions  of the country need to be bolstered, and duty free zones are an  appropriate means for doing so.    Brazil and Argentina have not accepted Uruguay's system of  free zones, even though Abreu said that "there are different  opinions" on it, though no "major opposition."</p>

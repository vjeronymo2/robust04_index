			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: Mercedes merger to cut cost of components Mercedes-Benz is to spin off its German engine valve factory into a DM530m (Dollars 344m) ground-breaking joint venture designed to reduce component costs. In the third such deal in as many months, its Bad Homburg works, which provides valves for all the group's cars and commercial vehicles, will be merged into a new company, MWP. The move follows agreements under which Keiper Recaro is to take charge of car seat manufacture at the Daimler Benz subsidiary's Bremen factory, and Mercedes' own production of power-steering units is to be merged with that of ZF. The deals are the earliest results of a shift in the group's components supply and manufacturing strategy, outlined earlier this year by Mr Werner Niefer, chairman. They will reduce the degree of vertical integration within Mercedes, generate cost reductions as a result of greater economies of scale, and ensure that the vehicle maker can maintain direct control over quality. MWP, for example, will combine the various component operations of Mahle-Wizemann and Pleuco with those of Mercedes, and manufacture complete valve systems to be installed as a single unit on the assembly line. The so-called 'system supplier' grouping, with aggregate annual sales of DM530m and 3,100 employees, will supply other customers as well as Mercedes from factories in Europe, Asia, and North and South America. Although the Mercedes factory employs only 650 people, it is the third largest engine valve supplier in Europe. Pleuco is market leader in the US and Europe for valve seatings, turbo-charger parts and other components. Earlier this month, Keiper Recaro management moved into the car assembly plant at Bremen and took over its seat manufacture operations.</p>

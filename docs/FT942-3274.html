			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: De Benedetti back on takeover trail Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Italian financier, has relaunched Cofir, the Madrid-based holding company controlled by his Cerus group in France, on the Iberian takeover trail. It has acquisitions, secured and in the pipeline, amounting to Pta9.5bn (Dollars 70m). Mr De Benedetti told Cofir's annual meeting yesterday that it had last Friday acquired the majority holding in Spain's leading city hotel group for Pta6.5bn. He said it was close to spending Pta3bn to buy a supermarket chain and it planned to expand its wine division to become to the biggest producer of Rioja table wine. Twenty UK and US institutions control 25 per cent of the holding company's share capital. Cerus owns 45 per cent of Cofir's equity and the rest is traded on the Madrid stock market. Mr De Benedetti said institutional backing for Cofir gave him 'great satisfaction'. He defended the cautious investment policy of the past years that had allowed Cofir to build up a liquidity of more than Pta20bn. The decision to restart buying comes as fixed income investment becomes less attractive due to falling interest rates and as cheaper properties come on to the market. The first move has been to increase a 49 per cent stake held by Cofir in NH Hoteles, a group that owns and manages 60 hotels in Spain, to 70 per cent as a prior move to listing the hotel chain within the next two years. 'It's good news to see Cofir at last buying growth potential assets again to take them to the market,' said Mr Carlos Pertejo of AB Asesores, a Madrid securities firm. Mr De Benedetti's group is close to completing the purchase of a 100-unit family-owned supermarket chain called Dagesa which is based in Catalonia and in Aragon, two of Spain's fastest-growing regions. The retailing business represents a new division for Cofir and this acquisition is likely to be followed up by further ones in the sector. Cofir is assessing properties in the wine business where it controls Berberena, the second-ranked Rioja producer, with the stated aim of becoming Spain's leading table wine group. The group's real estate division has in the meantime been lifted by the announcement that the 1997 Ryder cup will be played on the Valderrama golf course. This is one of three located in its extensive holiday home and leisure complex of Sotogrande, near Gibraltar.</p>

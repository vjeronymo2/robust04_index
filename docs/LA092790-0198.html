			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB AWARDED $19,882  </P> <P> Almost $20,000 in federal grant money was awarded to the Boys and Girls Club by  the City Council this week.  </P> <P> Council members praised the other six community service organizations that also  requested the money but voted unanimously to give the $19,882 from the Housing  and Urban Development to the Boys and Girls Club.  </P> <P> "It's a local club and it serves all the children in the city. We felt that  this one warranted the money because it has had financial problems in the last  year that could have closed it down even," Councilwoman Anita Huseth said. "We  felt it's helping the children to fight drug and delinquency, which are major  problems."  </P> <P> The money will pay for a variety of programs aimed at steering youngsters away  from gangs and drugs and provide tutoring and a supervised environment for  children who need after-school care, said Ceil Miller, president of the club's  board of directors.  </P> <P> "We're going to try and stretch that 20 grand to cover a lot of bases," she  added.JON NALICK  </P></p>

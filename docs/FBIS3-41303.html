Coca farmers have  called for active resistance to avoid the forceful eradication  of coca farms in the region.    (Cibar Victoria), second secretary of the General Trade  Union  Confederation of Peasant Workers, reported:    [Begin (Cibar Victoria) recording]: In keeping with the  government's repressive guidelines, the government's repressive  forces--UMOPAR [Mobile Police Units for Rural Areas] and the  DEA--on 14 February at 5 a.m. [words indistinct] eradicated five  hectares of the sacred coca leaf. To conduct this eradication  operation, the government forces arrested several fellow  peasants in a violent and savage manner and are keeping them  incommunicado. [end recording]    [Luis Mayan] Farmers from the (Villa Cunari) coca-producing  farmers cooperative have decided to declare themselves in a  state of emergency and general mobilization. The following is a  report by peasant leader Valentin Gutierrez, who reports the  assembly's conclusions.    [Begin Valentin Gutierrez recording] We have decided to put  in force the self-defense committees and declare ourselves in a  state of emergency and general mobilization at the grass-roots  level.    This means we will not be responsible for any eventual  conflict or clash that may be caused by the government's  repressive forces.    The government will be solely responsible for any eventual  conflict because coca producers have been willing to negotiate  and have attended all negotiations called by the government.  Therefore, the government is solely responsible for any  eventual conflict. [end recording]    According to reports supplied to this radio station, we  reassert that members of DiNaCo [National Coca Control  Directorate], Direco [Coca Eradication Directorate], UMOPAR, and  inmates from the Chimore rehabilitation center continue to  eradicate coca farms by force. These eradication operations are  being conducted at the (Sebastian Fundador) colony against the  (Ibircanzana) coca farmers cooperative where, according to  peasant leaders, there was a clash and tear gas was used.</p>

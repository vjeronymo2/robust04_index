			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Walesa's Life to Go on Film: Warner Bros. and Mount Co. will go to Poland to  document the life of Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa on the big screen.  "In these times of extraordinary social and political change in Eastern Europe,  we all recognize that it began with Lech Walesa and Solidarity in Poland," said  Mark Canton, Warner Bros. executive vice president, in announcing plans for the  film. No one has yet been asked to play Walesa, studio publicity agent Michael  Singer said. But Hollywood experts have said they believed Michael Douglas and  Robert Wagner would be in the running for the starring role in the film, which  will go into production next year. The world charity premiere of the motion  picture, which is scheduled to begin production in 1990, will benefit  Solidarity's Social Fund. SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias has  announced that he has accepted an invitation by Cypriot Foreign  Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis and will soon visit Cyprus.  Papoulias made the above announcement following a meeting with  Mikhailidhis in Athens today. During the meeting the two  ministers exchanged views on developments in the Cyprus issue  following the delay in the submission of the UN secretary  general's report to the Security Council.    Replying to a question on the issue of the pan-national  conference, the Greek foreign minister said that he discussed  the issue with Mikhailidhis and added that the conference will  take place at a time when it will be productive. He said he  thinks that the situation that will result from the submission  of the UN secretary general's report will make it imperative to  hold such a meeting. Responding to a question about the  possibility of the National Council going to Athens,  Mikhailidhis said that he and Papoulias exchanged views on this  issue and that it is just a matter of setting a date.    Both Papoulias and Mikhailidhis expressed the view that the  delay in the submission of the Butrus-Ghali report causes  concern and shakes the credibility of the process for solving  the Cyprus issue. Papoulias also said that it is very important  for the UN secretary general's report to reflect the actual  developments.    Asked about Cyprus' application to join the European Union  [EU], Papoulias said that during the EU Summit in Corfu the  Greek presidency will propose beginning official accession  talks. The Greek foreign minister said that he is certain that  there will be steps toward that direction.</p>

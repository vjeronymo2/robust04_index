			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Eyes on the dividend after a heady leap - HSBC Holdings Only 18 months after coming to the UK with its acquisition of Midland Bank, HSBC Holdings finds itself the second largest company in Britain by market value. This heady leap up the FT-SE 100 index has come mainly through its exposure to the booming Asia Pacific market. When it announces results today, there will be strong interest in the dividend level. The poor reception of National Westminster Bank's results was attributed partly to a payout increase of only 6 per cent, compared with 20 per cent from Lloyds Bank. HSBC is among the most strongly capitalised of the UK banks, and with analysts expecting a rise of a third in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.3bn, against Pounds 1.71bn, there are strong dividend hopes. A cautious move could affect investor sentiment towards the sector. Within the results, the previously troubled banking arms in Australia and the US have already reported on their recovery, so most attention will be focused on Asia and on Midland. The UK bank is expected to have more than doubled the previous year's Pounds 315m profit figure. One strategic question for HSBC is the extent to which it can form a strong global investment bank through the fusion of James Capel, its agency broking arm in London, and the primary sides of Wardley in Asia and Samuel Montagu in London. There will be continued interest in the degree to which HSBC has solved a previously accident-prone image with its overseas acquisitions. Although most retail banking operations are now under firm control, analysts expect further provisions against losses at Concord Leasing in the US. Another possible area of anxiety is the group's exposure to the Hong Kong property market, which some fear is over-heated. The group showed signs at the half year of limiting asset growth in the territory to reduce risks.</p>

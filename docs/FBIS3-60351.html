By decomposing  ammonia with magnesium hydrate, magnesium sulfate, which can be  disposed of in the ocean, is extracted as a by-product. Since  fixed ammonia is subject to regulation by waste water standards,  the company plans to promote plant sales based on the new  technology.    Although Nittetsu Chemical Industry also examined a  processing technology using inexpensive calcium hydroxide,  magnesium hydrate was adopted instead since separation was  difficult due to the gypsum generated when using calcium  hydroxide. While treating the fixed ammonia, ammonia water and  ammonium sulfate can be collected for recycling. The company is  constructing a pilot plant which will begin operation soon.</p>

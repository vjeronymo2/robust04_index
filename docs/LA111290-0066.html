			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> DETROIT BISHOP ASKS FOR CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS  </P> <P> Auxiliary Bishop Thomas J. Gumbleton said he will ask Roman Catholic bishops to  sign a statement asking Catholic soldiers to become "selective conscientious  objectors" against war in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> Gumbleton said he will press for a discussion of the Persian Gulf crisis at the  four-day annual meeting of Catholic bishops that opens today in Washington,  although it is not on the agenda.  </P> <P> Gumbleton told the Detroit News he will ask the bishops to sign a statement  prepared by Pax Christi, the national peace organization of religious and lay  people that he heads.  </P> <P> The statement asks Catholic soldiers to "become selective conscientious  objectors" and actively resist the U.S. government's offensive deployment.  </P> <P> "War is a very important moral issue, and if the bishops speak out about  anything, they ought to speak out about going to war," the longtime peace  activist said.  </P> <P> But Gumbleton's superior, Archbishop Adam J. Maida, said he will urge a more  moderate approach, although he said the Bush Administration cannot justify war  in the Middle East if it is a fight over oil.  </P></p>

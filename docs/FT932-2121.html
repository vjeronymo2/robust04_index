			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Public still doubts Clinton's leadership MOST Americans still feel that President Bill Clinton is not a strong leader, but their support for Mr Ross Perot, the outspoken Clinton critic, is also slipping, according to a new national poll, Reuter reports from Washington. The poll of 1,000 registered voters, conducted for US News and World Report magazine, showed 68 per cent of those responding rated the president's leadership capabilities as fair or poor. Mr Clinton has done poorly in virtually all similar polls in recent months and has been attacked sharply on his economic programme by Mr Perot, a Texas billionaire and unsuccessful independent candidate for the White House last year. But the latest poll also showed that only 54 per cent of respondents had a favourble impression of Mr Perot, against 67 per cent a month ago. More Americans (37 per cent) had an unfavourable impression of Mr Perot than they did in May (26 per cent). But 59 per cent said he should continue to hold Mr Clinton accountable for what is right for the country, while 30 per cent felt he was being too critical of the president.</p>

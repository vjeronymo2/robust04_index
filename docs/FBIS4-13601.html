			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Kamal Kharrazi, permanent </F> representative to the UN, in New York by unidentified  correspondent in Tehran--live]    [Text] [Correspondent] Some minutes ago you heard on the  news that the member countries of the Islamic Conference  Organization's [ICO] contact group are to meet next week to  examine the situation in Bosnia. In a telephone call to  Kharrazi, our country's permanent UN representative, we asked  him for an interview for the listeners. My colleagues inform me  that Mr. Kharrazi is on the line:    Mr. Kharrazi, greetings and thank you for your cooperation.  Last night it was announced at the UN Headquarters that the ICO  contact group members are to meet next Wednesday to examine the  situation in Gorazde and Bosnia. What is the reason for the  delay in this meeting, especially in view of the heavy  responsibility that the Islamic countries have in defending the  Bosnian Muslims and the Muslims in Gorazde?    [Kharrazi] In the name of God, the almighty and merciful.  You are absolutely right. The responsibility that the Islamic  countries shoulder in this issue is extremely heavy. I believe  that not only has the United Nations lost its credibility, but  the Islamic countries too are losing their credibility because  the Islamic countries could have done a great deal, especially  in the form of multifaceted pressures on the Security Council  and on the United Nations.    Now that this proposal has been adopted--and actually the  decision that the ICO contact group's foreign ministers meet was  proposed by Iran--once again this opportunity should be seized,  although this meeting could have taken place sooner. However,  naturally, a bureaucratic process was needed to call this  session, the issue of visas, and operational problems. Thus,  the ICO Secretariat has set Wednesday as the date for the  session, even though this session could have been convened a few  days sooner.    At any rate, this opportunity should be seized, and we hope  that with the presence of the ICO contact group's foreign  ministers, the necessary pressures can be brought to bear on the  Security Council members and the Security Council can be given  an ultimatum to end its indifference and to take action;  otherwise, the Islamic countries will have to decide on their  own.    [Correspondent] Thank you. Concerning the forthcoming  session of the ICO contact group members, a question: Has the  possibility been considered of the Islamic countries warning the  Security Council that if it does not lift the arms embargo on  Bosnia, they will do it themselves? How close to reality is  this possibility in your opinion?    [Kharrazi] We hope that during this session, the foreign  ministers will adopt a decisive decision. We should wait and  see what these foreign ministers on the whole think. The  atmosphere is extremely ripe and some of the countries are  completely ready to take serious steps. However, we should wait  and see what the decision of all the Islamic countries is and,  God willing, act accordingly.    [Correspondent] Thank you. As my last question, many believe  that as far as the tragedy of the fall of Gorazde is concerned,  the UN secretary general did not use his authority and that with  his procrastination he prepared the ground for Gorazde's fall  with the help of the Western powers. Is this the prevailing  view in the United Nations as well?    [Kharrazi] The same question is being asked by the  representatives of various countries on whether the secretary  general acted correctly or if he did not. When the secretary  general himself is asked this question, his answer is: It is  true that I have some authority, but I have to apply to the  Security Council powers and ask for their view and decision.  Actually, I only execute Security Council decisions and I must  consult with the Security Council powers.    Of course, it is true that this is the Security Council's  method and that the secretary general serves the Security  Council and executes its decisions. However, at the same time,  the secretary general has instruments in hand that he can use to  inform the people. He can speak to them and express realities  and his problems and, in short, give a push to the United  Nations in general and the Security Council in particular.    The truth is that the United Nations in general and the  Security Council in particular have completely lost their  credibility on the Bosnian problem in general and in the Gorazde  problem in particular.    [Correspondent] Thank you, Mr. Kharrazi, for answering our  questions and for giving us your time.    [Kharrazi] You are welcome.</p>

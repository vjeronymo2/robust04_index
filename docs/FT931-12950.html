			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: End of the road for an ambitious supercomputer SUPERCOMPUTER Systems, an ambitious US supercomputer venture launched five years ago with plans to build the world's fastest computer, closed its doors yesterday after failing to raise funds to continue its development work. The company was founded by Mr Steven Chen, a world-reknown supercomputer expert when he left Cray Research in 1987. International Business Machines has funded Supercomputer Systems for the past five years, pouring Dollars 100m into the enterprise. However, IBM told SSI last month that it would not continue funding the venture beyond the five-year period to which it had originally agreed. Mr Chen acknowledged that his supercomputer development was behind schedule, but said that the company had recently completed a prototype system and had plans to deliver its first computer in October. Yesterday, however, SSI's operations were closed and most of the company's employees were laid off. An official for the company said that efforts are continuing to raise money, but that 'there are very few options left, and we're not optimistic.' Mr Chen said: 'We were left with no alternative but to terminate our project at this point. Today is a sad day for all of us at SSI.' Mr Chen said he had been unable to find an investment banker willing to raise money through a stock offering, and that a worldwide search for new investors, to provide Dollars 60m needed to continue operations until the end of 1993, had also failed. Cray Computer said its new Cray-3 supercomputer system would soon be available to a limited external user base, Reuter reports.</p>

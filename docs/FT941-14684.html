			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / MAI bids Pounds 292m for Anglia TV The consolidation of ITV into larger more powerful groupings continued yesterday with MAI's agreed Pounds 292m bid for Anglia Television. MAI, the financial services and marketing group, controls Meridian Broadcasting, which covers the south of England. The bid - which sent Anglia's shares up 180p to 664p yesterday - is the third for an ITV company since November 24, when National Heritage secretary Mr Peter Brooke first proposed relaxing the rules on ITV ownership. The three bids, including the hostile Granada bid for London Weekend Television, have totalled more than Pounds 1.75bn in cash and shares. If Granada takes over LWT, it means that three men - Mr Michael Green of Carlton Communications whose offer for Central has gone unconditional, Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada, and Lord Hollick, chief executive of MAI - will dominate the ITV system. Together the three enlarged groups would account for about 70 per cent of total ITV advertising. Sir Peter Gibbings, Anglia's chairman, said: 'It was not if but when (the company would be taken over) and by whom - the most important of all.' A takeover by MAI has been likely since Anglia rejected a joint deal with LWT to take over Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, splitting the target's two licences. MAI's Pounds 292m bid values each Anglia share at about 637p. For each share it is offering 357p in cash and 2.667 new MAI convertible preference shares, with a cash alternative. Anglia shareholders will be entitled to receive a second interim dividend of 8p. The deal pushed up share prices in other ITV companies. Carlton rose 39p, Central 67p and Scottish 25p. Both Mr Robinson, of Granada, and Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of LWT, took comfort from the MAI-Anglia deal. 'There is going to be consolidation. There are going to be big blocks and LWT on its own is not going to be one of the major players,' said Mr Robinson, who may have to improve the terms of Granada's bid, currently worth about Pounds 670m. Sir Christopher commented: 'It's greatly to our advantage. Granada now has no chance of success at today's price.' The LWT chairman pointed out that the revaluation of ITV shares continued and there was now one fewer company to buy. Attention may now move to the remaining free-standing ITV companies of any size: Scottish and HTV, the ITV company for Wales and the west. Yorkshire-Tyne Tees may only be interesting to a predator outside the ITV system because it owns the maximum of two licences. MAI's enlarged broadcasting division will be chaired by Lord Hollick. Mr David McCall, who will remain chief executive of Anglia, will be deputy chairman and join the MAI board. Lord Hollick said: 'We will be looking right across the range of the business to achieve savings.' However, any job losses are likely to be in areas such as administration, with programme production expanded. Rather like the Carlton-Central takeover, the MAI-Anglia deal brings together a publisher broadcaster in Meridian, which commissions rather than makes its programmes, with a studio-based producer. MAI is also talking to Time Warner, of the US, over a possible bid for the UK's new national Channel 5. Lex, Page 20</p>

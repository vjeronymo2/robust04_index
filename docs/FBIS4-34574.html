			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Honduran economic developments monitored through 21  June.    The Honduran private banking sector has disclosed that  non-traditional Honduran exports increased by 22 percent in  1993. According to the Tegucigalpa-based Banco Atlantida, income  from non-traditional sales on the international market amounted  to $226 million. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1957 GMT 13 Jun 94)    The Central Bank Board of Directors has decided to increase  its cash reserve by six points. This will begin on 16 June and  is to be done gradually, increasing one point every 15 days  until it reaches 40 percent on 30 September. This is a measure  to prevent the sliding of the lempira with regard to the dollar  and to put a stop to the spiraling inflation. (San Pedro Sula  TIEMPO in Spanish 15 Jun 94 p 3)    A banking source told ACAN-EFE that the fever to save  dollars  in Honduras has reduced deposits in the local currency by 1.3  percent. According to this source, the country's monetary system  is experiencing a "strong expansion of deposits in dollars," and  has surpassed expectations in less than a year.

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Wilder tempted by Virginia race Political Washington may be consumed with Whitewater, but it does not have to look far afield for diversion. The neighbouring state of Virginia is currently providing political theatre of the highest order. The latest twist to its endless soap opera has come in the shape of public musings by Mr Douglas Wilder, former governor, that he might have to enter this year's Senate race to stop the state becoming, as he puts it, 'a laughing stock'. Most Virginians were surprised when Mr Wilder, a Democrat, pulled out of the Senate contest in January. They had assumed he would not be able to resist the temptation of taking on his long-time enemy, the incumbent Democratic Senator Chuck Robb, whose staff had owned up to bugging Mr Wilder's telephones. They believed Mr Wilder, the state's first black governor, had concluded that Mr Robb was more likely to beat former Lt Col Oliver North of Iran-Contra notoriety, then considered the Republican favourite. He may also have been influenced by the ease with which Mr George Allen, the conservative Republican, won the governor's race last November. But circumstances have changed and both Mr Robb and Mr North have fallen on hard times. The former has finally confessed to being unfaithful to his wife (the daughter of President Lyndon Johnson) while the latter has incurred the wrath of ex-President Ronald Reagan for presuming to suggest that his old boss knew more than he has let on about Iran-Contra. Both men's favourable ratings have plunged to the low 30 per cent range, according to one local poll. Mr North now only has a small lead in the Republican contest over Mr James Miller, budget director in the Reagan administration but hitherto an obscure personality in the state. Mr Miller comes out even with Mr Robb, while Mr North trails the incum-bent senator by 17 points. Meanwhile, Mr Allen, in spite of successes with the state legislature, has also been no stranger to controversy, first saying he would join a private club with a history of discrimination against blacks and women and then changing his mind. His staunch support of a proposed new Disney historical theme park in northern Virginia is also stirring up the local hornets. The temptations for Mr Wilder are pretty obvious. 'People are joking about us nationally,' he said this week. For a state which produced George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, that is no laughing matter.</p>

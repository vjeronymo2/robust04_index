			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / People: Shell's Pink for Enterprise Oil Enterprise Oil, Britain's biggest independent oil company, has underlined its ambition to be regarded as a fully fledged oil company by recruiting Mike Pink, 55, director of production and development at the Shell group, as its first chief operating officer. Pink, who has spent 30 years working mostly overseas for Shell, will join Enterprise next May after he retires from Shell. A geologist and petroleum engineer, Pink brings substantial technical and managerial experience to the company at a time when it is just about to become a big North Sea production operator. Enterprise's early success was based on being a financial partner in oil projects and the company is keen to be regarded in the City for its operational skills as well. Next year it will take on the operation of the Pounds 1.1bn Nelson field development, one of the biggest in the North Sea. Pink knows the field well; Shell has a stake in it and was responsible for the design and installation of the facilities. The arrival of Pink, who will be responsible for exploration, development and production activities and will be number two to chairman Graham Hearne, plugs an obvious gap in Enterprise's boardroom. Peter Kingston, a former Shell man who had been Enterprise's technical managing director, resigned in July 1992, and finance director John Walmsley, responsible for many of Enterprise's major deals, is leaving at the end of the year.</p>

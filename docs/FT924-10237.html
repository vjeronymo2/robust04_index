			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Efim receives first offer for assets MR FABIANO Fabiani, managing director of Italy's state-controlled Finmeccanica engineering and aerospace group, has made the first public offer to buy assets from Efim, the state holding company put into voluntary liquidation in July. Finmeccanica has proposed to buy Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie (BCF), Efim's railway equipment subsidiary. which would then be merged with Finmeccanica's quoted Ansaldo Trasporti subsidiary. The combined companies, creating Italy's biggest rail equipment company, would form the railway equipment group which has for years been the unrealised dream of Italy's sometimes warring public-sector companies. In a letter to Mr Alberto Predieri, Efim's special administrator, Mr Fabiani is reported to have offered to pay cash for BCF, which made net group profits of L5.7bn (Dollars 4.3m) on sales of L512bn last year. The company, which has net debts of L219bn, has built a reputation for its rolling stock and equipment for urban mass transit systems, sold successfully in the US. Finmeccanica's interest in acquisitions, the motor for its recent growth, has been tempered by growing indebtedness and the effects of recession. Last month, it gained a stock market quotation via the reverse takeover of Sifa, a quoted subsidiary. The transaction should have been the first stage in a series of capital increases raising up to L1,700bn. However, the financial problems of IRI, Finmeccanica's parent, and poor sentiment on the bourse have led the deal to be postponed indefinitely. Finmeccanica is known to be keen on bidding for Nuovo Pignone, the turbines and compressors subsidiary of the ENI energy and chemicals group. Merging Nuovo Pignone with Finemccanica's existing Ansaldo turbines business would form the biggest turbine-maker in Italy. Although bankers think Nuovo Pignone will be sold via an international auction, many expect that Finmeccanica will emerge as the winner. Creating large near-monopolies in railway equipment and turbines could ensure steady business for Finmeccanica from Italy's state-owned railway and electricity generating groups, currently involved in very heavy investment drives. Successful incorporation of the state-owned assets now for sale could be the prelude to a large internal restructuring for Finmeccanica. Many bankers believe the company plans to buy out minority interests in quoted subsidiaries such as Alenia, in favour of having Finmeccanica as the single quoted vehicle. Minority shareholders in the subsidiaries would be offered shares in the parent company in exchange for their existing holdings.</p>

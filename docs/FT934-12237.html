			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Big US selling bruises equity market A PROMISING early performance by UK share prices, triggered largely by Wall Street's move to a record closing high overnight, was dismantled from mid-morning onwards by a very disappointing quarterly survey published by the Confederation of British Industry and some bad news on the US economy. The equity market, now showing distinct signs that its upsurge this month could have run out of steam, came under heavy fire from some of the big and influential US investment banks and stockbrokers. It was a sudden burst of heavy buying interest from these same US sources that triggered the big upward move in the UK stock market, during late August and in the middle of this month. One senior trader said: 'There was a big hit on the market this morning when some of the Americans offered large chunks of the Footsie future, which dropped sharply to a level where the arbitrageurs moved in. Rather ominously no-one around the market was happy to take the offers, and the market tone deteriorated from then on.' He added that he still felt comfortable with the market but that he saw little upside for the next few days. The FT-SE 100 Index began the session in good form, reflecting Wall Street's move on Monday to an all-time peak, and showed a near nine-point gain during the morning and before the news from the Confederation of British Industry survey was published. The CBI quarterly survey was every bit as gloomy as some market observers had feared, saying that the economic recovery had slowed and calling for a reduction in domestic interest rates in the November 30 Budget. This news, coupled with a very disappointing index of US consumer confidence this month, drove the FT-SE 100 down to the day's low point of 3,164.8, a fall of exactly 20 points, before it stabilised to close a disappointing session 19.5 down at 3,165.3. Market strategists were also disturbed by the US consumer confidence index performance, which at 59.4 per cent, was well below general expectations that were in the region of 63 per cent. A number of UK commentators expressed concern about the equity market's recent performance. 'I would like to think the market peaked at Footsie 3,199,' said Mr Robin Aspinall at Panmure Gordon. The strategy team at NatWest Securities, in their latest Equity Market Commentary, pointed to 'a deluge of profits downgrades so far this month - five upgrades compared with 18 downgrades - an uninspiring results season and a couple of disappointing inflation figures'. BZW said: 'After the FT-SE 100's surge towards the 3,200 mark, the simple price/earnings and yield valuations begin to make the eyes water.' And dealers also expressed minor disappointment with the volume of business transacted so far this week. Turnover yesterday of 589.5m shares, although well up from Monday's dismal 482.6m, was well below recent levels which have held at well above 600m per day for the past two weeks. Customer business on Monday was valued at Pounds 1.17bn, also the lowest figure for two weeks. The telecoms sector, roughly handled last week as one of the leading UK brokers adopted a more cautious stance, put on a good showing in the wake of some determined US buying.</p>

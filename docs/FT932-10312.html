			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Rise in oil demand slows World oil demand will rise only slightly this year to a little over 65m barrels a day (b/d), OPEC Secretary-General Subroto said at the weekend, according to Reuter in Vienna. Mr Subroto said production by non-members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries would fall by about 1m b/d so that the cartel would have to make good this shortfall. Demand would pick up particularly in the second half of the year.</p>

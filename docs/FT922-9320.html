			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Brown presses Heseltine on takeover policy  -Labour questions whether the MMC's 'competition' approach will be changed Heseltine to spell out his policies on mergers and acquisitions increased at Westminster yesterday, following the announcement that the proposed takeover of Midland Bank by Hongkong and Shanghai Bank appears to fall within Brussels' jurisdiction. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, called on the president of the board of trade to explain 'exactly what his policies are for takeovers'. Mr Heseltine 'must tell us what he now believes on takeover policy and what action he proposes to take with these bids'. Mr Brown's challenge follows the tabling by Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour frontbench spokeswoman on City and corporate affairs, of four written questions relating to the battle for Midland and Mr Heseltine's thinking on takeovers in general. The questions include whether Mr Heseltine proposes changes to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's present approach in which 'the implication for competition is the sole criterion taken into consideration'. Interviewed by the Financial Times earlier this week, Mr Heseltine insisted that any change in the so-called Tebbit doctrine would require a collective decision by the cabinet. 'I have inherited a set of (merger) policies; until and unless any announcements are made, those policies prevail.' Brussels' indication that the Hongkong Bank bid was likely to fall within its jurisdiction was meanwhile welcomed by one prominent Conservative backbencher who described it as 'the right approach'. Mr Tim Smith, who served as vice-chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee in the last parliament, said that, since the Hongkong bid did not involve domestic competition issues, it was a matter for the EC to deal with. 'As far as the UK market is concerned, Hongkong have made it clear that they do not propose to make many changes to Midland so there wouldn't be any impact on competition in the high street,' he said, speaking on BBC Radio 4. Mr Smith called for the possible Lloyds bid for Midland to be investigated by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, however. 'We have only got four major clearing banks and I think if you are talking about one taking the other over and then taking it out completely, you are definitely reducing competition,' he said. Mr Smith is understood to have played a leading role in offering Hongkong and Lloyds an opportunity to meet Conservative backbenchers next week. Other Tory backbenchers are privately expressing misgivings about the competitive and employment implications of a marriage between Midland and Lloyds. One said yesterday that he found it 'difficult to imagine' that reducing the number of main clearers to three would improve already inadequate competition in the domestic corporate banking sector.</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / CrossRail project thrown out The CrossRail project to create an underground link between east and west London may have been thrown out by a parliamentary committee - but work is continuing on the design of the Pounds 2bn rail line, Charles Batchelor writes. A full-scale mock-up of the train which would be used on the link went on display in central London yesterday to demonstrate the styling, seating lay-out and driver's cab. The coach and cab unit, designed by DCA Design Consultants of Warwick, has been modified to meet the needs of passengers with limited mobility. The demonstration of the CrossRail rolling stock coincides with attempts to revive the project. MPs have been urged to back a motion to send the bill back to the committee which earlier rejected it. Mr David Lidington MP, promoter of the original CrossRail bill, is leading the rescue effort. The project was turned down because of revised traffic forecasts and fears it would not attract private sector finance.</p>

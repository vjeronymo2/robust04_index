			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEN. JESSE HELMS  </P> <P> Thanks to Huntington Williams (Opinion, Nov. 11), we now understand Sen. Jesse  Helms (R-N.C.).  </P> <P> First, Helms wants to limit the power of government except for pork-barrel  items for his state and government policies which encourage school  resegregation.  </P> <P> Second, Helms believes in the sanctity of private property except for women.  Third, Helms believes in individual responsibility and so wants to abrogate  social safety net programs, thus allowing those now covered to fall by the  wayside. Fourth, Helms believes in charities except for endowments to the arts  and to charities servicing those with a lesser right-wing tilt, using his  perspective. Williams says that Helms represents a large and growing  constituency that extends beyond North Carolina. No wonder the country is in  trouble.  </P> <P> BOB BUTLER, Culver City  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEFENSE LAWYER SUGGESTS WITNESS FRAMED  DEPUTIES  </P> <P> A lawyer for one of seven Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies on trial for  alleged money-skimming suggested Wednesday that the prosecution's chief witness  framed his former deputies to hide his own thefts of drug money.  </P> <P> Attorney Jay Lichtman told a federal court jury that former Sheriff's Sgt.  Robert R. Sobel lied when he testified that the deputies shared in the thefts.  </P> <P> And Lichtman said Sobel may even have planted "bait money" from an FBI sting on  two deputies to implicate them.  </P> <P> Lichtman said his client, Deputy Ronald E. Daub, and another defendant, Deputy  John C. Dickenson, may have been victimized by Sobel, who has already pleaded  guilty to the money-skimming charge.  </P> <P> In their closing statements Wednesday, other defense attorneys also attacked  Sobel's credibility, noting that he has admitted beating suspects, stealing  money and committing perjury while he was a narcotics sergeant.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> SUIT SEEKS TO FORCE SALE OF BEACHFRONT BUSINESS  </P> <P> The city is considering legal action to force the owners of a beachfront  hamburger stand to sell their property.  </P> <P> The City Council, acting as the Redevelopment Agency, voted 6 to 1 this week to  authorize filing suit to condemn Wimpi's on Pacific Coast Highway and 5th  Street if negotiations to buy the property remain deadlocked.  </P> <P> Wimpi's is inside Huntington Beach's downtown redevelopment area. Its land is  needed before the second phase of the project can move ahead, City  Administrator Paul Cook said.  </P> <P> The city has been negotiating with three property owners for about two years  and needs to move ahead to force the sale, he said.  </P> <P> The owners are willing to sell the land but not at a price the city is  offering, said Charles Sarrabere, 78, who owns the land with his sister and  niece. Sarrabere said he grew up on that property, where his parents bought a  house about 1920.  </P> <P> The land is a prime piece of beachfront property on a well-traveled street and  is worth much more than the city has offered, Sarrabere said.  </P> <P> "We're not trying to gig anybody," he said. "But at the same time, I'm trying  to get paid."  </P> <P> Councilwoman Grace Winchell voted against authorizing condemnation because of  the owners' many years in the city, she said.  </P> <P> The city probably will not have to condemn the property, Cook said.  </P> <P> Although the city has filed suit in the past to take property in the  redevelopment area, he said, agreements have always been reached.  </P></p>

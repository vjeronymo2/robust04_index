Regulatory Analyses and Notices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> History of Department of Transportation Regulation of Etiologic Agents/Infectious Substances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. Regulation Prior to 1991 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Hazardous Materials Regulations Board (Board; a predecessor to the RSPA) adopted a final rule under Docket HM&hyph;142 on September 30, 1972 (37 FR 20554), that added ``etiologic agents'' to the list of hazardous materials regulated by the Secretary. The final rule at 49 CFR 173.386(a)(1) defined an etiologic agent as <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> a viable microorganism, or its toxin, which causes or may cause human disease, and is limited to those agents listed in 42 CFR 72.25(c) of the regulations of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> (The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) is now the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)). The final rule at 49 CFR 173.387 also specified packaging requirements for etiologic agents, and excepted, at 49 CFR 173.386(d), from DOT regulation ``diagnostic specimens'' and ``biological products,'' which were subject to regulation by HEW. The final rule was adopted after notice and opportunity to comment (36 FR 25163, December 29, 1971).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 29, 1972, after receiving two petitions for reconsideration and several comments, the Board proposed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (37 FR 25243) to except from DOT regulation cultures of etiologic agents of less than 50 milliliters (1.666 fluid ounces) in one package. The petitions stated that such an exception was necessary to allow physicians in rural areas to transport cultures to laboratories on passenger-carrying aircraft, rather than by slower surface transportation which, in turn, promotes health safety. The petitions added that cultures of etiologic agents may perish if in transportation too long. The Board adopted the proposal as final on March 29, 1973 (38 FR 8161). One commenter objected to excepting such quantities of etiologic agents from all regulation. The Board noted, however, that quantities of etiologic agents excepted from DOT regulation would still be subject to HEW labeling and packaging regulations under 42 CFR 72.25(c). The March 29, 1973 rule also adopted incident notification requirements for etiologic agents, as proposed on July 22, 1972 (37 FR 14728).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B. The 1988 notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) under Docket HM&hyph;142A <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 10, 1988, RSPA proposed (Docket HM&hyph;142A, 53 FR 45525) to revise the definition of ``etiologic agent,'' remove the 50 milliliter (ml) exception, and align the per package quantity limits of etiologic agents aboard aircraft with the International Civil Aviation Organization Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air (ICAO Technical Instructions). RSPA proposed broadening the definition of ``etiologic agent'' to include, in addition to etiologic agents listed by DHHS (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)) in 42 CFR 72.3, any agent that poses a similar degree of hazard, such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). RSPA noted that the proposed definition was not as broad as the definition for infectious substances (Division 6.2) contained in the United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (UN Recommendations) and international regulations based on the UN Recommendations, such as the ICAO Technical Instructions. CDC has not updated the list in 42 CFR 72.3 since July 1, 1980 (45 FR 48627). On March 2, 1990 (55 FR 7678), CDC proposed to delete the list from its regulations and adopt criteria to define ``etiologic agent,'' but a final rule has not been published.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> C. January 3, 1991 final rule under Docket HM&hyph;142A <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On January 3, 1991, RSPA published a final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (56 FR 197) under Docket HM&hyph;142A. The final rule (1) adopted a revised definition of ``etiologic agent,'' (2) removed the 50 ml exception, and (3) clarified quantity limitations for etiologic agents transported aboard aircraft. ``Etiologic agent'' was defined to mean <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> a viable microorganism, or its toxin, which is listed in 42 CFR 72.3 of the regulations of the [CDC] or which causes or may cause severe, disabling or fatal human disease. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The definition adopted differed from the proposed definition in response to commenters who suggested that the language of the definition be modified to better reflect agents that may pose an unreasonable risk to health and safety during transportation. Accordingly, the wording was revised to include other agents that cause or may cause severe, disabling or fatal human diseases in humans in addition to the agents listed in 42 CFR 72.3 of the CDC regulations. In response to comments, RSPA indicated in the preamble that it believed most medical waste is composed of material that does not contain etiologic agents, either because it does not contain any infectious material or because the infectious material does not meet the regulatory definition of etiologic agent. RSPA also stated that, in many cases, if medical waste is known or suspected to contain an etiologic agent, it is treated on-site to destroy the agent by using a method such as incineration, autoclaving, or treatment with disinfectants. However, RSPA clearly stated that ``*&blank;*&blank;* if an infectious waste that contains an etiologic agent is offered for transportation, it must conform with the requirements in the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR; 49 CFR parts 171&hyph;180) for etiologic agents'' (56 FR 198). As stated earlier, the final rule also removed the 50 ml exception, as proposed in 1988. The January 3 preamble responded to numerous comments received on the 50 ml proposal and comprehensively discussed the reasons for this action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

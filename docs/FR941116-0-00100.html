			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Betula uber <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is a moderate-sized tree in the Betulaceae family. It grows to 15 meters (45 feet) in height with smooth, dark brown to black, aromatic bark and a compact crown (Ogle and Mazzeo 1976, Sharik and Ford 1984, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1990). Its leaves are round to slightly oblong and alternately arranged. The catkins have long, smooth scales and three broadly divergent lobes. Three winged nutlets or samaras are borne at the base of each scale (Sharik and Ford 1984).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Betula uber <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  flowers when the leaves emerge from the winter buds in April to early May (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1986).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the time of its rediscovery in 1975, the only known natural  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Betula uber  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> population consisted of 41 individuals; by 1977 the population had declined to 26 individuals, and it is now down to 11 trees. This population is confined to a 100 meter-wide (100 yard-wide) band of highly disturbed second-growth forest along a one kilometer (1 mile) stretch of the Cressy Creek floodplain, a site nearly surrounded by agricultural land (Ogle and Mazzeo 1976, Ford, Sharik and Feret 1983). The strip of forest containing the round-leaf birch occurs within a much larger population of related dark-barked birch species (sweet birch and yellow birch,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> B. alleghaniensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The round-leaf birch population extends over three contiguous ownerships comprising the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area in the Jefferson National Forest and two private tracts. In 1976, the Federal government and the private landowners erected protective fences around their respective segments of the population. This did not, however, prevent subsequent vandalism and transplanting of individual trees by private landowners, with a resultant loss of 12 round-leaf birches on the private lands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Previous Federal Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Protection of the species gained momentum in 1977 with formation of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Betula uber <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Protection, Management and Research Coordinating Committee, which consists of representatives from the Federal and State governments, conservation organizations, universities, and the private sector.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Betula uber <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was added to the U.S. Department of the Interior's list of endangered and threatened wildlife and plants on April 26, 1978 (43 FR 17910), bringing it under the protection of the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The species was also added to the Commonwealth of Virginia's Endangered Plant and Insect Species Act in 1979 (Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services 1979).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1982, the Service approved the Virginia Round-Leaf Birch Recovery Plan (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1982), which was revised in 1986 and updated in 1990. The goal of this plan is to increase the number of round-leaf birches in the wild to a level where the species can be removed from the Federal list; this level is estimated at 500&hyph;1,000 individuals in each of 10 self-sustaining populations. These populations may include individuals of sweet birch which carry the round-leaf trait. Any population of round-leaf birch, whether natural or established through plantings, will be considered self-sustaining when it produces 500&hyph;1,000 individuals greater than 2 meters (6 feet) tall. Given the present status of round-leaf birch and current knowledge of its life history, this condition is projected to be met by the year 2010 in both the natural and additional populations. The 1990 plan does not document a reclassification objective; nevertheless, significant recovery progress can trigger consideration for reclassification to threatened.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The natural population has been monitored closely since 1978. Given the heavy mortality that has occurred in this population since 1975, an effort to enhance natural regeneration was implemented in 1981. Two small areas were cleared of vegetation within 60 meters (65 yards) of potential seed sources, one on public land and one on private land. Eighty-one round-leaf birch seedlings were recorded on the private property site. Round-leaf birch seedlings were not produced at the public land site, and this was attributed to the absence of a pollen source for the relatively isolated round-leaf birch mother trees growing there (Sharik  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1990). Initial survival and growth rates of the seedlings suggested that fitness in round-leaf birch may be as high as that in sweet birch (Sharik  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990). However, all of the 30 round-leaf birch seedlings remaining after the end of the second growing season were gone by 1986, the apparent result of vandalism, as whole plants (including roots) were missing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1984, The Nature Conservancy acquired 14 hectares (35 acres) of land adjacent to the natural population. The land was in turn purchased by the U.S. Forest Service in 1986 and has since been managed as potential round-leaf birch habitat; however, round-leaf birches currently do not occur there.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

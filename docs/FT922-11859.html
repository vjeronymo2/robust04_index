			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London COCOA prices sunk to their lowest for around nine months, depressed by a combination of trade selling and a dearth of buyers. New York cocoa futures were also down at midday, with active July at a new life of contract low of Dollars 940 a tonne. New York traders said the fall was partly down to morning news that the ICCO had downwardly revised its estimate for the 1991-92 production deficit to 115,000 tonnes from 140,000 tonnes. London dealers said there was some talk of further sales of new crop cocoa by the Ivory Coast. In the short-term there appeared little reason why the market should not continue downwards. Some psychological support is expected around Pounds 600 a tonne but the next major objective looks to be Pounds 588, last year's second position low. Manufacturers continued to show little sign of supporting the market and some were even emerging as light sellers. London robusta COFFEE futures also came under pressure with prices finally breaking out of their recent range on the downside. Dealers said the fall was initially driven by stale long liquidation in thin conditions. Sell-stops were triggered as the downward move gathered momentum. Compiled from Reuters</p>

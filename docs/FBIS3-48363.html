The secretary general said in his letter: The meeting with  you, and the luncheon that you hosted afterwards were the  highlight of my stay in Pyongyang. It was useful to review  matters of mutual concern, including your proposals for the  reunification of Korea and, more generally, the need for peace,  security and development on the Korean peninsula. I fully share  your view that the armistice agreement, which is nearly forty  years old, must be replaced by a permanent peace treaty.    One of my objectives in visiting the Korean peninsula was to  help, if at all possible, in defusing the tension, he noted, and  said: I wish to reiterate my thanks for an excellent visit,  which has helped to strengthen relations between the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea and the United Nations.</p>

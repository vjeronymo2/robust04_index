Company  Director Hanz Duerr and board member Diethelm Vack, as well as a  representative of the German Government signed the foundation  document at a lawyer's office in Frankfurt.    The public limited company is owned outright by the German  Government and will replace the Bundesbahn [in the west] and the  Reichsbahn [in the east], which thereby cease to exist after  operating for 44 and 56 years respectively. Under the  agreement, the railway company will also transfer existing debts  of 70 million German marks, which will now be assumed by the  German Government.</p>

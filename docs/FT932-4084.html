			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: DG Bank shows improvement DG BANK is performing well after a period of consolidation, the chief executive of the central bank for the German co-operative system said yesterday, as the bank announced a 33 per cent increase in partial operating profits for the first quarter of the year. Mr Bernd Thiemann, appointed in the summer of 1991 to head what was then a deeply troubled institution, said partial operating profits - excluding a contribution from the bank's own-account trading activities  - rose to DM68m (Dollars 42.5m) in the first four months of the year, up from DM51m in the same period last year. Mr Thiemann said the improvement reflected the bank's restored market profile and cost-cutting measures. He predicted further improvement over the rest of the year. Last year, partial operating profit at the parent bank was DM311m after DM27m in 1991 but itonly broke even at the net level after provisions against doubtful country and corporate risk. The parent bank's surplus on interest income rose by 20 per cent to DM209m in the first quarter of the year, while business volume fell 1.3 per cent to DM129.4bn. When Mr Thiemann joined the bank, it was suffering the after-effects of over-expansion and financial imprudence. More than DM3bn has been injected into the bank by shareholders over the past two years and Mr Thiemann expects the bank to be restored to full financial health by 1995-96, when he hopes that dividends will be paid again.</p>

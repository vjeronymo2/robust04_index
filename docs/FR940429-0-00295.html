Therefore, August 29, 1994 was the Secretary's estimation (made prior to the date the NPRM was published) of when the final regulations would be effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This date, and all other dates based on it, will be revised when the actual effective date is known.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.402(d)(6)(i)(D)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 28.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters believed that the regulations should require a guaranty agency to provide loan-specific information to lenders so that lenders can more effectively suspend collection efforts against individuals with respect to loans made at closed schools. The commenters noted that a lender would not be able to identify a PLUS borrower if the guarantor notified the lender of the school code and closure date only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary believes that because the loan application retained by the lender will have the name of the school and the period of enrollment for which the loan was made, the lender should be able to determine which individuals it should suspend collection efforts against once the lender is notified of the date a school closed. The Secretary encourages a guaranty agency to provide assistance to a lender that believes it is unable to identify the appropriate PLUS borrowers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.402(d)(6)(i)(E)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 29.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters recommended that a guaranty agency be required to suspend collection activities on loans that it holds for borrowers who the agency believes may be eligible for a closed school loan discharge. The commenters noted that this is a requirement in the analogous regulation in &sect;682.402(e)(6)(iv) and (v) with respect to false certification discharges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary had intended that this requirement would be in the NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The regulations have been amended to require a guaranty agency to take the same actions with respect to a borrower who may be eligible for a closed school loan discharge as the agency is required to take under &sect;682.402(e)(6)(iv) and (v) with respect to a borrower who may be eligible for a false certification discharge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters noted that &sect;682.402(d)(6)(i) of the proposed regulations did not specify what a guaranty agency would be required to do upon the receipt of a complete application from a borrower whose loan is held by the guaranty agency. The commenters recommended that the procedures required under &sect;682.402(d)(6)(ii) should also apply to &sect;682.402(d)(6)(i).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary agrees that the requirement for notifying the borrower that he or she does not qualify for a loan discharge should be in both &sect;682.402(d)(6)(i) and &sect;682.402(d)(6)(ii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The final regulations have been revised to add this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.402(d)(6)(i)(F)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 31.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters objected to the requirement that a guaranty agency must consult with representatives of the closed school, the school's licensing agency, the accrediting agency, and other appropriate parties to learn the current address of borrowers whose loans are held by the guaranty agency, and who have been identified as potentially eligible for a closed school loan discharge. The commenters believed that the skiptracing efforts required under &sect;682.410(b)(6) are more likely to be successful than contacts with the closed school and its related agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary believes that special efforts should be made to contact borrowers who may be eligible for a closed school loan discharge, but whose current address is unknown. Therefore, the interests of fairness to all borrowers justifies the additional skiptracing efforts required by the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.402(d)(6)(ii)(C)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

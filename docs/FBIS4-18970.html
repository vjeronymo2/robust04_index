In a telephone call to a private radio station, 17 November  stated that it was also going to strike at the aircraft carrier.  At 1230 today, a passerby accidentally found two 2.3-inch  rockets in a metal pipe and a firing mechanism on a building  site along the Miaoulis coast in Piraievs. The rockets were  defused by explosives experts.</p>

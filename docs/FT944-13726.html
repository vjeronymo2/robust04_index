			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Recovery at RJR Nabisco RJR Nabisco's earnings bounced in the third quarter, marking a recovery from the price war that rocked the US tobacco industry a year ago. The group recorded continuing advances in sales in its international tobacco business, particularly in Eastern Europe, and in US biscuit sales. The rebound in earnings, to 11 cents a share from 4 cents a year ago, met market expectations. It comes as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, an investment firm, is seeking to use part of its RJR stake to buy Borden, another food group. Overall operating profits rose by Dollars 248m to Dollars 835m. US tobacco operations, which earned Dollars 382m, accounted for Dollars 181m of this improvement. The recovery stemmed in part from a 5 per cent increase in sales, as RJR switched its product mix towards higher-value brands such as Winston, Camel and Salem. Sales growth in Russia and eastern Europe was the main factor behind a 12 per cent increase in international tobacco revenues. Operating earnings in the food businesses reached Dollars 285m, up from Dollars 230m, as North American earnings were boosted by higher sales at Nabisco. Overall net income was Dollars 216m on sales of nearly Dollars 4bn, compared with Dollars 76m on sales of Dollars 3.6bn a year ago.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 91&hyph;CE&hyph;22&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of NPRMs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 91&hyph;CE&hyph;22&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA has determined that reliance on critical repetitive inspections on aging commuter-class airplanes carries an unnecessary safety risk when a design change exists that could eliminate or, in certain instances, reduce the number of those critical inspections. In determining what inspections are critical, the FAA considers (1) the safety consequences of the airplane if the known problem is not detected by the inspection; (2) the reliability of the inspection such as the probability of not detecting the known problem; (3) whether the inspection area is difficult to access; and (4) the possibility of damage to an adjacent structure as a result of the problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These factors have led the FAA to establish an aging commuter-class aircraft policy that requires incorporating a known design change when it could replace a critical repetitive inspection. With this policy in mind, the FAA recently conducted a review of existing AD's that apply to de Havilland DHC&hyph;6 series airplanes. Assisting the FAA in this review were (1) de Havilland; (2) the Regional Airlines Association (RAA); and (3) several operators of the affected airplanes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From this review, the FAA has identified AD 81&hyph;10- 11, Amendment 39&hyph;4112, as one that should be superseded with a new AD that would require a modification that could eliminate the need for short-interval and critical repetitive inspections. AD 81&hyph;10&hyph;11 currently requires repetitively inspecting the elevator root rib for cracks on certain de Havilland DHC&hyph;6 series airplanes, and replacing any cracked part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> De Havilland has issued Service Bulletin (SB) No. 6/399, Revision E, dated May 25, 1984, which specifies procedures for (1) inspecting the elevator root rib; and (2) modifying the elevator root rib (Modification No. 6/1769). Modification No. 6/1769 consists of pulling back the elevator skins, removing the torque tube assembly, replacing the root rib assembly and doubler, replacing the second outboard nose rib, installing a new intercostal, and reinstalling the torque tube assembly and new skin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on its aging commuter-class aircraft policy and after reviewing all available information, the FAA has determined that AD action should be taken to eliminate the repetitive short-interval inspections required by AD 81&hyph;10&hyph;11, and to prevent failure of the elevator root rib, which could result in loss of control of the airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other de Havilland DHC&hyph;6 series airplanes of the same type design that do not have Modification No. 6/1769 incorporated, the proposed AD would supersede AD 81&hyph;10&hyph;11 with a new AD that would (1) retain the current requirement of inspecting the elevator root rib for cracks, and replacing any cracked part; and (2) require modifying the elevator root rib (Modification 6/1769) as terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with de Havilland SB No. 6/399, Revision E, dated May 25, 1984.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 169 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately 54 workhours per airplane to accomplish the proposed action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $60 an hour. Parts cost approximately $4,200 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,257,360. This figure is based upon the assumption that none of the affected airplane owners/operators have incorporated Modification 6/1769.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The intent of the FAA's aging commuter airplane program is to ensure safe operation of commuter-class airplanes that are in commercial service without adversely impacting private operators. Of the approximately 169 airplanes in the U.S. registry that would be affected by the proposed AD, the FAA has determined that approximately 50 percent are operated in scheduled passenger service. A significant number of the remaining 50 percent are operated in other forms of air transportation such as air cargo and air taxi.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following paragraphs present cost scenarios for airplanes where no cracks were found and where cracks were found, utilizing an average remaining airplane life of 15 years and an average annual utilization rate of 1,600 hours TIS. De Havilland Models DHC&hyph;6&hyph;100 and DHC&hyph;6&hyph;200 airplanes have probably already accumulated 15,000 hours TIS; therefore, those airplanes would have 100 hours TIS after the effective date of the AD to incorporate Modification 6/1769. Some Model DHC&hyph;6&hyph;300 airplanes have not yet accumulated 15,000 hours TIS. This analysis is based upon the assumption that these airplanes yet to accumulate 15,000 hours TIS have 10,000 hours TIS if operated in scheduled service and 5,000 hours TIS if operated in general aviation. A copy of the full Cost Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility Determination for the proposed action may be examined at the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 91&hyph;CE&hyph;22&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;No Cracks Scenario for Models DHC&hyph;6&hyph;100 and DHC&hyph;6&hyph;200: These airplanes would be inspected at 50 hours TIS after the effective date and modified within 100 hours TIS after the effective date. The incremental present value cost of the proposed AD over that required by AD 81&hyph;10&hyph;11 is $5,919 for an airplane utilized in sheduled service, and $6,642 for an airplane utilized in general aviation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;No Cracks Scenario for Model DHC&hyph;6&hyph;300 Airplanes: These airplanes would be inspected at 50 hours TIS after the effective date and thereafter at 600-hour TIS intervals until the elevator root rib is replaced upon the accumulation of 15,000 hours TIS. The incremental present value cost of the proposed AD over that required by AD 81&hyph;10&hyph;11 is $4,962 for an airplane utilized in sheduled service, and $3,099 for an airplane utilized in general aviation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily or disproportionally burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires government agencies to determine whether rules would have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,'' and, in cases where they would, conduct a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in which alternatives to the rule are considered. FAA Order 2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, outlines FAA procedures and criteria for complying with the RFA. Small entities are defined as small businesses and small not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated or airports operated by small governmental jurisdictions. A ``substantial number'' is defined as a number that is not less than 11 and that is more than one-third of the small entities subject to a proposed rule, or any number of small entities judged to be substantial by the rulemaking official. A ``significant economic impact'' is defined by an annualized net compliance cost, adjusted for inflation, which is greater than a threshold cost level for defined entity types. FAA Order 2100.14A sets the size threshold for small entities operating aircraft for hire at 9 aircraft owned and the annualized cost thresholds, adjusted to 1994 dollars, at $69,000 for scheduled operators and $4,850 for unscheduled operators.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

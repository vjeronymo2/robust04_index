			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIEWPOINTS;  </P> <P> HAVE S&amp;LS OUTLIVED THEIR USEFULNESS?;  </P> <P> MANY EXPERTS QUESTION WHETHER TRADITIONAL THRIFT FUNCTIONS NEED TO BE A  SEPARATE INDUSTRY OR JUST ANOTHER BANKING OPTION.  </P> <P> The savings and loan industry was established in the United States mainly to  help ordinary people save money and buy homes. Deregulation of financial  services in the 1980s, however, brought consumers more savings and home finance  options and blurred the distinction among banks, S&amp;L and, to a lesser  extent, investment firms. At the same time, the S&amp;L industry -- racked by  fraud, bad management and unpredictable interest rates -- has seen many of its  members fall into deep trouble, and President Bush has proposed a bailout plan  expected to cost taxpayers billions. Given these developments, is there still  justification for a separate S&amp;L industry with a special status under U.S.  law? Do we still need S&amp;Ls, or should we let them become banks and compete  under the same rules that banks do? Free-lance writer Meredith Chen asked a  number of authorities these questions, and their answers follow:  </P> <P>  Robert Gnaizda, staff attorney with Public Advocates Inc., which represents  the Urban League and the Latino Issues Forum:  </P> <P> "If the primary function of savings and loans is affordable home mortgages,  then we need them. If their only function is home mortgages for the affluent,  then we don't need them.  </P> <P> "They must provide affordable home loans. . . . They need to go into  communities that have been frozen out of the economy by banks and savings and  loans and aggressively assist development there.  </P> <P> "The Federal Home Loan Bank data shows that a white person living in an  integrated neighborhood has as difficult a time getting a loan, even if  affluent, as a poor white living in an all-white neighborhood. There is  prejudice even against integration.  </P> <P> "We basically have to consider what the function of the savings and loan  industry is supposed to be. If it is to be essentially identical to that of  banks or what is has been in the 1980s, then we don't need a special  institution. If it is to take on the mission that many of its leaders still  believe should be its primary mission, and do it with skill and commitment,  then I say we should consider special tax credits to assist the industry rather  than the very onerous burden that President Bush is seeking to impose on the  industry. The President's burden will eliminate the industry. There is no  question about it."  </P> <P> James F. Montgomery, chairman and chief executive of Great Western Financial  Corp.:  </P> <P> "Bad apples spoil the barrel, and they should be taken out of business. We've  done some dumb things with deregulation that have caused some problems, but the  savings and loan business is still making half the mortgage loans in America,  and we don't want to take away half the mortgage lending in America.  </P> <P> "I can't believe that we can just glibly say that we can eliminate the bad and  replace those loans with something else. That is just not going to happen. We  need the thrift industry and we're going to continue to make mortgage loans,  and that is important to people and important to America."  </P> <P> R. Dan Brumbaugh Jr., author of "Thrifts Under Siege: Restoring Order to  American Banking" and a former deputy chief economist at the Federal Home Loan  Bank Board:  </P> <P> "We don't need savings and loans in the traditional sense. I say this because  in a recent study that I did with Andrew Carron of First Boston Corp., we  examined many aspects of the performance of mortgages in the portfolios of  thrift institutions. What we found was that when you adjust the return on  fixed-rate residential mortgages . . . and take into consideration the  prepayment option that the homeowners have, they basically have not made money  with those mortgages holding them in portfolio in the 1980s. This means that  they can't really make money on that aspect of their portfolio which gives them  their unique reason for being.  </P> <P> "These institutions (should be able) to meet changing conditions in the market.  Those institutions which we now call thrift institutions ought to evolve into  institutions which more closely resemble commercial banks.  </P> <P> "Both banks and thrifts are fighting for their lives. Banks provide high-cost  information, and telecommunications and computer technology are making it less  expensive for borrowers and lenders to get that information themselves. And  they are getting together without banks and thrifts."  </P> <P> Anthony M. Frank, U.S. postmaster general and former chairman and chief  executive of First Nationwide Bank:  </P> <P> "I think we should have two kinds of banks in this country, and I always have.  There should be family banks and corporate banks, or commercial banks and  retail banks, or savings banks and commercial banks -- one of those three sets  of pairs.  </P> <P> "The distinction between them should be that if more than half of your assets  and liabilities are in corporations, then you are a commercial bank. If more  than half goes to serving people directly, then you are a retail or a family or  a savings bank. I don't want to see that distinction lost.  </P> <P> "We have some systemic problems in our country. The low rate of savings is one  of them. What do savings and loans basically do? They combine the savings  accounts of 10 families and they lend it to another family. They aggregate  little dribs and drabs of savings that nobody else is interested in. Here we  have a 3% savings rate in this country compared to the high teens in Germany  and 20% in Japan, and now we are going to eliminate one of the few ways people  can save. I don't think it is a very intelligent thing.  </P> <P> "Our proportion of home ownership is going down in this country. Home ownership  is the glue that holds this country together and provides emotional and  financial stability. It holds a family together. Savings and home loans are two  of the most important consumer aspects of our country."  </P> <P> Joe Jolson, an analyst with the Montgomery Securities investment firm:  </P> <P> "There needs to be an industry dedicated and regulated to providing funds for  the housing industry. You need an industry that is going to have some incentive  to favor housing with their funds.  </P> <P> "How many banks have made home loans? If you look historically at the amount of  home loans that are owned by commercial banks, it is extremely low relative to  the size of banks. Less than 20% of all home mortgages are owned by banks. That  is not very much. Who else is going to provide this financing for home loans is  the question.  </P> <P> "The insurance companies, the commercial banks and Wall Street, the three large  investors in loans and credit, are only interested when times are good. They  don't have a firm commitment in all parts of the cycle to this business.  </P> <P> "If you make the funding source for homes into a cyclical beast, it is going to  be volatile like the stock market. Housing values could go up and down in a  couple of years by 20% and that doesn't promote confidence in buying a home as  safe investment."  </P> <P> Kenneth T. Rosen, chair of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at UC  Berkeley:  </P> <P> "In California, the savings and loans have originated about 65% of home  mortgage credits. If you believe that people need to buy houses, you need  savings and loans because commercial banks are not going to do it on a regular  basis.  </P> <P> "The large savings and loans in California are quite profitable and you can  make good money on them. They have to be more efficient operations than they  had to be five years ago because there is a lot more competition now. Seventy  percent of the savings and loans in this country are both profitable and  healthy. It is very important to realize that, in California, we've had maybe  four or five major cases of fraud. Other than that, they are all doing just  fine.  </P> <P> "The savings and loans were deregulated in 1982 in terms of assets and  liabilities, and unfortunately they were allowed to have asset powers that are  too broad. They have to be watched. . . . I am very optimistic that if savings  and loans that are healthy are allowed to continue to function in a separate,  independent fashion, they will do fine."  </P></p>

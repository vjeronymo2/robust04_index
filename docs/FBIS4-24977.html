			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 3 (XINHUA) -- China's Ministry of  Finance is preparing to issue Samurai bonds for the first time  in Japan, according to ministry sources.    The bonds will be in different terms and be issued "very  soon", said an official who declined to give the total amount or  to elaborate.    But he disclosed that Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd and Nomura  Securities Co. Ltd will act as lead managers for the issue.    China's Ministry of Finance returned to international  capital  markets in 1993, after an absence of six years, marked by  issuing 30 billion Japanese yen in Eurobonds on the London  market in September and Dragon bonds totalling 300 million U.S.  dollars in Asia in October.    In February this year, it successfully issued one billion  U.S. dollar Global bonds, the biggest issue ever carried out by  the ministry.</p>

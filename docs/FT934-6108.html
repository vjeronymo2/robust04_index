			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Management: Why Michael Heseltine is absolutely right / A look at Britain's myopic managers At the end of a seminar on corporate 'performance improvement', the manufacturing director of a well-known British engineering company took aside the consultant who had led the proceedings. 'I'm disappointed,' he said. 'I haven't learned much - we're doing everything you talked about.' 'Oh really?' replied the consultant. 'Yes,' said the director. 'For instance, I bet you don't know our warranty defect rate' (the proportion of products that fail within the first year). 'Thirty per cent?' asked the consultant. 'How did you know?' beamed the director. 'Because that's your industry's average in this country,' the consultant replied. 'Aren't you ashamed when the mean time between failure for TV sets is now 12 years?' he continued. Retorting that 'TVs are simple compared with what we make', the director stalked off. Three years later, his company is losing market share rapidly to a competitor which has raised its quality far above the industry average. It is run by a team of newcomers who moved in from continental European companies and are busy applying the skills they learned there. The consultant in question, Mark Smalley, recounts what he calls 'this appalling story' to reinforce this week's attack by Michael Heseltine, the UK trade and industry secretary, on British managerial complacency. Smalley, who directs the Midlands office of PA Consulting, and also heads its strategy unit, has plenty of other horror stories about British managerial self-delusion, insularity and unwillingness to learn. For the past decade he has led groups of executives on short, fact-finding trips to Japan. 'In spite of Japan's success, many of them start out thinking the Japanese do things differently and therefore wrongly,' he says. 'It takes two days to turn them round.' It is not that British managers have a monopoly on complacency: a Cranfield Business School study of companies with less than 500 employees, which was cited by Heseltine - but only for its UK results - suggested that the problem was almost as bad in Spain and even worse in Italy. But, with respect to those countries, that is no great reassurance to the British. Their arch-rivals, Germany and France, came out of the survey far more respectably. Though German managers and companies were seen by others as the best in Europe, they underrated their own strengths and assessed their weaknesses realistically - precisely the opposite characteristics from the British. The French, though a bit over-confident, were pretty realistic about their pluses and minuses. On the face of it, the Cranfield findings look odd: most detached observers  -Swedes, say, or Japanese - would rate the Germans as more arrogant than the British and the French even more so. Nor, one might think, would managers in large companies with considerable international experience suffer from anything like the degree of self-delusion as those from a bunch of smaller enterprises such as those in the Cranfield survey. Smalley begs to differ. His recalcitrant director worked for a large company, as do some of the most blinkered executives on his Japanese tours. He attributes the problem not to arrogance in the usual sense, but to a reluctance - or inability - to learn from the discomforting experience of others. Both Smalley's points would seem to be borne out from a surprising quarter: an informal club of 16 big multinationals which have spent the past decade trying to do precisely that, through benchmarking and a range of other practices. Called the Inter-Company Productivity Group, the club covers a much broader range of issues than its name suggests: quality, organisation structure, product innovation, information technology, skills training, management development and motivation and re-engineering. Its membership list is impressive, including the likes of British Airways, Courtaulds and Unilever, plus the UK operations of Nissan and top US companies such as Heinz and 3M. Their managers are far from blind. Yet according to John Russell, consultant to the group, incipient complacency was evident from an opinion survey and benchmarking exercise carried out just before the group's 10th anniversary meeting a month ago. Most senior managers surveyed showed little knowledge of their competitors' performance in 17 areas which the group has identified as key to success. To the frustration of Russell and other speakers, the three-day meeting of teams from each company was permeated by a sense of premature satisfaction with companies' existing improvements. If complacency, however understandable, can grip a group of such relatively advanced companies, it is not surprising that it swamps so many lesser fry. The most powerful antidote to managerial complacency is closeness to a demanding set of customers - witness the impact which US electronics companies, British food retailers and the Japanese motor assemblers have had on their UK suppliers. The next most forceful antidote is benchmarking. But neither remedy will work if a company's executives are ill-trained, myopic and therefore poor learners. Far too many British managers, young and older, still fit that description.</p>

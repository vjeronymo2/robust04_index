			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Uproar in Indian parliament Both houses of the Indian parliament were adjourned in uproar yesterday as angry members of the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) demanded the release of Mr LK Advani, the party president, and other leaders arrested in Lucknow on Tuesday, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi. Eight leaders of the BJP, India's largest opposition party, were remanded in custody until December 20 after they refused to file personal bonds before a special magistrate from the government's Central Bureau of Investigation which is investigating the demolition of a mosque in nearby Ayodhya in December 1992.</p>

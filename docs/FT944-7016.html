			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Cornwell Parker chief makes boardroom changes Mr Martin Jourdan, chairman of Cornwell Parker, has followed his downbeat trading statement at the end of October with boardroom changes at the furniture and fabrics group. 'When trading is poor, people expect something to be done,' he said. As well as remaining group chairman Mr Jourdan is taking over as chief executive of the fabrics division and managing director of the furniture side. These moves are displacing Mr Tony Thomas in fabrics and Mr Jourdan's brother Tom in furniture. While Mr Tom Jourdan will remain responsible for manufacturing operations, Mr Thomas will leave at the end of January. Mr Martin Jourdan said Mr Thomas was on a rolling two-year contract and no payment above any contracted entitlement had been discussed. The senior board was reorganised three and a half years ago to cope with expansion, but 'now we need to manage the business we've got, and we've got international management talent we don't need', Mr Jourdan said. There was also a need to 'de-layer' the organisation between the top of the business and the shop floor. At subsidiary board level, one director was taking early retirement and three had left already. As these events had happened early in the financial year, costs would probably cancel out savings, and benefits would show in the following 12 months, Mr Jourdan said.</p>

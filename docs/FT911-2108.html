			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Budgens moves to oust chairman THE BOARD of Budgens, the neighbourhood grocery stores chain, met last night to decide terms on which its chairman, Mr John Fletcher, should leave the company, following a revolt by institutional shareholders. The hastily convened meeting followed a call late on Monday by institutions controlling 27 per cent of Budgens stock for an extraordinary general meeting to install a new management team. Lloyds Merchant Bank said that the institutions - including IEP Securities (founded by Sir Ron Brierley), Electra and Gartmore - had called for the meeting because of Budgen's 'extremely poor track record, both in absolute terms and by reference to the sector.' Since 1987 the Budgens price has fallen from a high of 252p to 45p at yesterday's close. The institutions have recommended the appointment as chief executive of Mr John von Spreckelsen, who helped turn around the KAFU-Wasmund Handelsgesellschaft supermarket chain in Germany, Mr Christian Williams, who worked on the same project, and Mr Graham Rigby, formerly of BTR. Mr Fletcher's likely departure from Budgens would appear to bring an end to a roller-coaster retailing career. This included a stint as managing director of the Asda superstore group until an abrupt departure in 1984, and a failed bid through Budgens to take over Gateway in 1987. His departure may also cost Budgens more than the interim dividend which it decided not to pay in February following a collapse in profits, a move which triggered the institutional revolt against Mr Fletcher. Shortly after Budgens declined to pay the dividend, Mr Fletcher's service contract of Pounds 145,000 a year was extended from three to five years. Budgens' only non-executive director before yesterday's meeting was Mr Martin Sorrell, the chairman of WPP. Before the Budgens' board meeting Mr von Spreckelsen said he believed that smaller high-street retailers could compete with superstores such as Tesco and J. Sainsbury. 'Some well-run stores have made good contributions,' he said. 'Some shops should become more competitive locally.' He promised an immediate review of locations if the board changes went through. However, some analysts said Budgens still faced an uphill struggle even after a board change. The company has run into difficulties with a new distribution depot where overheads are too high for the group's sales and stock control has been a problem. Lex, Page 20</p>

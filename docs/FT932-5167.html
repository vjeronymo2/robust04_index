			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / UN approves force to protect Bosnian 'safe areas' THE UN Security Council last night approved a plan agreed in Washington last month to send international troops to protect six Moslem enclaves in Bosnia designated as 'safe areas'. The plan is expected to require some 5,000 extra UN troops in addition to the 9,000 now engaged in humanitarian operations in Bosnia. For the first time, the council authorised UN troops to use force in reply to any bombardment of the safe areas or to carry out armed incursions. Member states, in co-operation with the UN, would also be authorised to use air power in and around the safe areas to support UN peacekeepers. The UN decision came as Bosnian Serb forces overran two villages near the Moslem enclave of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia. After two weeks of intense backstage negotiations, the US, Britain, France, Russia and Spain - which drew up the plan at a foreign ministers' meeting - managed largely to stem criticism by non-aligned members. Thirteen states voted for the resolution. Pakistan and Venezuela abstained. The US described last night's move as an intermediate step towards countering Serb aggression. The resolution called on member states to contribute forces and empowered Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, UN secretary-general, to seek additional contingents. A number of Islamic states, including Pakistan, have offered soldiers, but so far Mr Boutros-Ghali has not wanted to employ them. Nato is ready to assume a co-ordinating role for the air operations. British officials played down apparent differences between the US and European governments over the specific role of air strikes. They said they were 'reasonably content' with the language of the resolution. Mr Muhamed Sacirbey, the Bosnian delegate, denounced the resolution, saying that by designating a few protected havens the Council implicitly declared 'open season on the majority of our towns and citizens who don't happen to fall into safe areas.'

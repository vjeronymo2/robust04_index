			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Lyudmila Vilyuga] Today a continuation of the rally  and strike started on 15 February at the initiative of the  republican strike committee, the independent trade union and the  Belarus People's Front, was expected in Independence Square in  Minsk. The rally, which numbered about 1,500 people, however,  did not turn into a large-scale event. It demanded that the  government should resign, the parliament be dissolved and new  elections to the Supreme Soviet be held. Incidentally, the last  demand coincides with a demand put forward by the republican  federation of trade unions.    Meanwhile, the people's deputies who met today after a break  in the session were in no hurry to heed the voice of the people.  They started with discussing the agenda. Today Stanislav  Shushkevich, ex-chairman of the parliament, turned up in  parliament for the first time since his resignation. Now he can  appraise the Supreme Soviet's work under a different angle.    [Begin Shushkevich recording] The parliament does not want  to  heed the views of the minority. Its overwhelming majority is  made up of old Communists elected when the Belarus Communist  Party was in power. [end recording]    [Vilyuga] The parliamentary majority solved cadre issues  quite efficiently today. Three generals took important offices:  Uladimir Danko was appointed interior minister, Genadz Lavitski  -- chairman of the KGB, and (Anatoliy Novikov) -- chairman of  the Supreme Soviet's commission for national security and  combating crime. Ivan Bambiza was elected new deputy chairman  of the Supreme Soviet.</p>

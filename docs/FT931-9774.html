			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Euro Disney sees large deficit EURO Disney, which operates the FFr4.2bn (Dollars 768m) EuroDisneyland theme park near Paris, has warned shareholders it would make a substantial loss this year. Mr Philippe Bourguignon, who last month took over as chairman, told an investors' meeting in Paris that he expected to see an improvement in the second half of the year, but that Euro Disney would stay in the red for the full year. Euro Disney, which made a pre-tax loss of FFr339m in its last financial year to September 30, has announced a deficit of FFr492m for the first quarter of this year. Mr Bourguignon said it was on course for slightly worse losses in the second quarter. When asked whether Euro Disney would be profitable in the second half he replied: 'The third quarter - I don't know. The fourth quarter - I hope so.' Since its opening last spring, EuroDisneyland has been hit by shortfalls in attendance and merchandise revenue due to the economic environment and strength of the French franc against other European currencies. The group is burdened by high financing costs after being forced to postpone its property development programme because of the Paris property slump. Analysts estimated that Euro Disney would attract 10m-10.5m visitors by the end of its first year. This compared to Euro Disney's forecast of 11.5m visitors. Mr Richard Simon, analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York, expected Euro Disney to produce a net loss of 'at least FFr750m' this year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Craig Doonan and Clive Govender] </F>   [Text] Durban April 7 SAPA -- Friday's [8 April] summit  between South Africa's four key leaders comes amid unprecedented  levels of political violence in Natal/kwaZulu and a hardening of  positions on this month's election.    African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, State  President F W de Klerk, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] President Mangosuthu Buthelezi are  to meet at a secret venue in what is widely perceived as a  last-ditch attempt to save the country from a bloody poll in  three weeks' time.    On the eve of the summit, the ANC, through Mr Mandela and  its  Natal region, was adamant there was no chance of an election  postponement. But IFP marchers in Empangeni this week demanded  elections be delayed to allow international mediation to run its  course.    A memorandum presented by the marchers warned the  Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] it would find it difficult to conduct  peaceful, free and fair elections unless the IFP's  constitutional demands for federalism were met.    This came as violence threatened to engulf the Natal/kwaZulu  region, with scores of townships and rural settlements already  under virtual siege and death tolls climbing at alarming rates.  Despite last Thursday's declaration of a state of emergency,  more than 120 people have been killed in what amounts to an  average daily toll of more than 17 lives.    Although IEC Vice-Chairman Dikgang Moseneke said on Thursday  the commission was forging ahead with preparations for elections  in Natal/kwaZulu, electioneering has become virtually impossible  in many areas of the region.    His view was endorsed by IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann  Kriegler. Elections would be held in kwaZulu in spite of  political unwillingness, Mr Justice Kriegler said.    At least two voter education workshops have been attacked  and  a National Party MP in northern Natal was forced to flee a mob  while putting up posters last week.    KwaZulu MPs and tribal chiefs have also made it clear to Mr  Justice Kriegler that the IEC is unwelcome in many rural areas  under kwaZulu control.    ANC Southern Natal Chairman Jeff Radebe said the ANC was  hoping Friday's summit would pave the way for free and fair  elections in Natal. "We'd like the king to indicate to all his  subjects that it is a democratic right for everyone to vote.  The ANC would also like to indicate to His Majesty what we feel  about the future of the Zulu monarchy. We are hoping to dispel  some misconceptions," he said.    Mr Radebe said Mr Mandela would meet King Zwelithini  privately at the undisclosed summit venue before the four  leaders meet.    IFP Central Committee member Thembinkosi Memela said his  party remained inflexible on its rejection of the negotiated  interim constitution. "We will be firm on these issues, and  that is the reason why international mediators have been called  in to settle the constitutional dispute -- because we are firm."    He said Zulu self-determination and King Zwelithini's  demands  for sovereignty would also be addressed at Friday's talks.    A Durban newspaper on Thursday reported King Zwelithini was  prepared to become ceremonial head of kwaZulu/Natal and drop his  demand for an independent Zulu kingdom if this would help reach  a settlement. Mr Memela, however, said he was unaware of this  development.    Questioned on whether anything concrete was likely to come  out of the summit, Mr Memela said: "In the light of escalating  violence, everyone is serious about solving these problems. But  I'm neither very optimistic nor very pessimistic. I expect the  leaders to do the best they can under the circumstances."    Meanwhile, University of Durban-Westville political analyst  Kiru Naidoo said: "It would be too much to expect a significant  breakthrough at this extremely late stage. I can't imagine  anything that can be arrived at that would pave the way for the  IFP's participation in elections. If (Friday's) meeting can  secure free and fair political activity, that is the most  significant thing one can expect. To reduce tension, we would  need King Zwelithini to urge his followers -- as difficult as  they would find the situation -- to allow the democratic process  to continue unhindered."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has said that even if  only one weapon remains outside Sarajevo, NATO must implement  its decision to intervene if it wants to maintain its  respectability and credibility.    Replying to questions by our correspondent, Cetin pointed  out  that all weapons outside Sarajevo must be under UN control  within the next few hours. Otherwise, he said, NATO must  intervene.    Cetin said he had a telephone conversation with Bosnian  President Alija Izetbegovic this afternoon. He pointed out that  20 percent of the Serbs' heavy weapons have not been placed  under UN control yet, and that there are reports that some of  the weapons are being taken to residential areas. The latter  constitute a potential danger, Cetin said, and must be placed  under UN control with the other weapons.    Cetin recalled that Turkey, a NATO member, has been saying  for the past 22 months that a limited air operation would be a  first step toward the solution of the problem. The latest  developments justify our position, he stressed.</p>

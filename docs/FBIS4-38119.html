			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Libya: Britain Would Be the First </F> Loser If Sanctions Are Escalated"]    [Text] Cairo, AL-HAYAH -- A highly placed Libyan  diplomatic source in Cairo has warned British officials against  continuing to reject the Arab and Libyan proposals for the  settlement of the Lockerbie crisis. He said: "Britain would be  the first loser if the sanctions against Libya were escalated to  include Libya's oil exports. [no closing quotemarks as  published] He pointed out that 7,000 Britons worked in the  Libyan oil sector and that the trade balance between the two  countries was $1.5 billion in Britain's favor. In a statement  to AL-HAYAH yesterday, the source criticized what he described  as "the West's intransigence against the Arab League's proposal  calling for the implementation of international legitimacy by  having the two Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie case stand trial  before a Scottish court at the headquarters of the International  Court of Justice." He added: "That rejection is not only a  stand against Libya but also a slap to all the Arab states." He  said that if the Arab League proposal was rejected and the  Western states concerned with the crisis insisted on escalating  it, then the Arab states should not comply with the economic  sanctions imposed on his country since April 1992 under Security  Council Resolution 748, and should resume flights between the  Arab states and Libya. He said that "if the Arab states did  that, they would command world respect. Not all the Security  Council resolutions are always in their favor. In fact, the  majority of these resolutions are applied by some states and  ignored by others."    Meanwhile, Ambassador 'Adnan 'Imran, the Arab League's  assistant secretary general for political affairs, has stated  that the Arab League's proposal for the settlement of the  Lockerbie crisis placed the ball in the West's court. He said  that the proposal took into consideration international  legitimacy and Libya's sovereignty at the same time, and that  the Western states should respond to the Arab proposal which is  also supported by the Organization of African Unity and the  Nonaligned Movement.    In a statement to AL-HAYAH, 'Imran said that Libya is  serious  in its efforts to close the Lockerbie file, adding that Western  rejection raised some questions about this issue. He said: "If  the Western states have sufficient evidence to support the  charges then why do they not agree to the trial of the suspects  at the headquarters of the International Court of Justice?"    Arab League Secretary General 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has sent  new messages to the foreign ministers of the United States,  France, and Britain stressing that agreement to the trial of the  Libyan suspects in the Hague "would spare the region unnecessary  dangers. A settlement of this issue would increase confidence in  the new world order."</p>

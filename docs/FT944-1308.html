			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Cunard blames QE2 delay on contractors Cunard, the cruise operator, yesterday blamed subcontractors for the delayed completion of a Pounds 30m refit of the liner Queen Elizabeth 2, which resulted in 500 passengers being turned away from its Christmas cruise. The company said the refit, which involved the refurbishment of all 960 cabins and the building of many facilities in 30 days, was 'the biggest ever undertaken in such a short time'. But Cunard denied being over-ambitious. It said: 'All the contractors knew what we were undertaking and were prepared to tender for it. They convinced us they could finish on time and that was why they got the contracts.' Cunard emphasised that of more than 50 contractors, only 'about three' British companies - which it refused to name - had not finished on time. About 57 per cent of refitting work by value went to British companies, the rest to German and other international groups. Passengers have complained that the liner resembled a 'building site', with plumbing not functioning in many cabins and equipment strewn across public areas. Captain Ron Warwick of the QE2 told Cunard yesterday, however, that more cabins were constantly being opened, allowing passengers to move into better accommodation. The main refit contract, involving structural work inside the ship, was awarded to Blohm &amp; Voss, the Hamburg-based shipbuilder. It said it had completed the work on time but cabin work had been subcontracted to UK companies by Cunard. Cunard said it received assurances from subcontractors that the refit would be finished on time. But it became apparent on Friday that insufficient cabins would be ready for Saturday's departure. Subcontractors yesterday refused to comment on specific causes of the delay. Trimline, the Hampshire-based company named as one of the companies which was late, confirmed it was talking to Cunard about the contract. A company executive said he was 'extremely brassed off' at suggestions that the company had been at fault. Trimline had been refitting more than 700 bathrooms on the QE2 and started work in July. He said: 'We were never running late, and are confident the work will be finished on time, hopefully by the time the ship reaches New York.' He said Trimline depended on other companies finishing their work before it could refit the bathrooms, and 'unforeseen events' over which Trimline had no control were to blame for the delay. One shipbuilding industry official said the timetable for the refit was 'very, very tight'.</p>

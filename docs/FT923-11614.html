			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Buoyant Microsoft soars 52% MICROSOFT, the world's largest provider of software for personal computers, yesterday reported a 52 per cent increase in fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 210.1m, or 48 cents a share. The final quarter took Microsoft's earnings for its fiscal year to Dollars 708m, or Dollars 2.41 a share, well up on the Dollars 463m earned in fiscal 1991. The strong fourth quarter was attributable to heavy demand for new versions of the company's Windows operating system, Microsoft Excel for Windows, and other applications for the system. Sales of applications for Windows almost doubled in the final quarter against a year ago. Mr Frank Gaudette, Microsoft's executive vice-president and chief financial officer, said investments the company had made over the years in graphical applications of Windows were paying off, and noted that for the full year net income was a record 25.7 per cent of revenues. Mr Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, said the company would continue to invest not just in its existing successful products, 'but in object technology, consumer systems and in database and work group technology as well'. In its latest fiscal year Microsoft invested Dollars 352.2m in research and development, compared with Dollars 235.4m in the previous year. Total operating expenses in the year just completed, including Dollars 854.5m on sales and marketing, reached Dollars 1.29bn, up 56 per cent on the preceding 12-month period.</p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: David Smith paying Pounds 95m to buy Spicers DAVID S SMITH, the paper and packaging group, is to buy Spicers, the UK's largest wholesaler of office products, from Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget of Sweden, for Pounds 95m. The deal is to be financed via the issue of 31m shares at 305p, or 38p below the closing price on Thursday night. The price fell after the announcement but finished 16p up at 359p. Smith also estimated pre-tax profits for the year ending May 1 would be Pounds 27.1m, up from Pounds 15.4m after exceptional items. The group is recommending a 7.25p final dividend, giving 10p for the year (9.5p). The deal marks a return for chief executive Mr Peter Williams to Spicers which he sold for more than Pounds 250m to SCA in 1990, when he held a similar position at Reedpack, the management buy-out from Reed International. Mr Williams said the deal would be marginally dilutive in 1993-94 but would enhance earnings thereafter. Smith is buying Spicers at an 11.3 earnings multiple. In addition to the UK operations, which made Pounds 12m operating profit from sales of Pounds 227m in 1992, Spicers has a lossmaking French operation. Mr Williams was responsible for developing the business but says recently 'management lost complete control of the business'. On sales of FFr359.3m in 1992, Spicers France made an operating loss of FFr45.4m. Mr Williams said he was not yet sure the division could be turned round but there were no current plans to close it. If it was closed, however, the acquisition would enhance Smith's earnings in 1993-94. And closure would cost Pounds 10m implying a 12.5 multiple. Spicers supplies about 10 per cent of the office products market and 50 per cent of the wholesale distribution of office products. It also makes envelopes and other stationery products in the UK. On Smith's results to May 1, Mr Williams said a strong performance from Kaysersberg Packaging in France, acquired in 1991, had been offset by an overall deterioration in the results of the UK paper and packaging industries due to pressure on margins. German recycling legislation continued to distort the European waste paper markets, allowing continental recycling companies a ready supply of cheap recycled material. Mr Williams said immediate prospects in the UK were encouraging. The first half would , however, be affected by the scheduled three month closure of one of the three paper machines at Kemsley. The placing, which is subject to a 1-for-4 clawback for shareholders, is underwritten by SG Warburg. The brokers are Credit Lyonnais Laing. See Lex</p>

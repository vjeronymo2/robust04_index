			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Problem stays on the agenda - Macedonia GREECE has temporarily succeeded in blocking European Community recognition of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, but the problem remains on the agenda of foreign ministers. The concluding declaration of the Council on Macedonia was variously interpreted as being a victory for the Greek position or merely a postponement of a particularly delicate decision which could have scuttled the whole conference. If other member countries had insisted on recognising Macedonia under that name, Greece could have blocked approval of all the other important decisions taken by the heads of government, including those on Denmark and the future financing of the Community. Unanimity remains the rule for European Councils. Though Mr Constantine Mitsotakis said after the meeting that the EC would continue to be bound by 'the united policy' proclaimed in last June's Lisbon declaration, which stated that the former Yugoslav republic would be recognised only under a name other than Macedonia, the Council's statement on the subject was more ambiguously worded. The special representative, Mr Robin O'Neill, a former British ambassador, had suggested various compromise proposals acceptable to the republic's president Kiro Gligorov, including naming the new state 'the Republic of Macedonia (Skopje)', to distinguish it from the northern Greek province of Macedonia. The Greeks claim that to call the new state Macedonia would provoke ethnic conflict in the region, particularly by encouraging territorial claims on the neighbouring Greek province. Though Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said no participant had challenged the Lisbon declaration, Mr Hans van den Broek, his Dutch opposite number, said the summit decision to give Macedonia economic aid and the despatch of United Nations military observers there provided the basis for further discussions about recognition. It was agreed that the Community would provide Ecu100m (Pounds 80m) of humanitarian and technical assistance to Macedonia, half of which would be provided by the European Commission out of common funds and a matching amount from member states. Macedonians said yesterday they were deeply disappointed, but not surprised, by the EC's failure to recognise their republic, Laura Silber writes from Skopje. Government officials, however, said they were pinning their hopes on the UN. The UN Security Council is due to consider recognition this week.</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Britain to stand up for Hong Kong's interests Britain will stand up for Hong Kong's interests until its handover to China in 1997, Lord Caithness, British foreign office minister for the colony, promised yesterday, Reuter reports. The minister pictured left yesterday with Mr David Thomas, police commander of Shek Kong refugee camp, said the UK hoped for 'an undramatic transfer of power', but stressed this did not mean it would give way to all China's demands for Hong Kong. 'We do not intend to give way on everything simply to achieve convergence,' he told a British Chamber of Commerce lunch. The minister also reaffirmed Britain's commitment to keeping a strong commercial presence in Hong Kong after 1997.</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE VOTE SPELLS END FOR 86 BASES;  </P> <P> CLOSURE CLEARS LAST LEGISLATIVE HURDLE BUT FOES FILE SUIT  </P> <P> The House Tuesday cleared the way for the closing of 86 military installations  and the consolidation of others, overwhelmingly rejecting a measure that would  have blocked a politically sensitive cost-savings plan.  </P> <P> The 381-43 vote virtually wiped out the last legislative chance to save four  major military bases in California listed for closing, including Norton Air  Force Base and George Air Force Base, both in San Bernardino County.  </P> <P> Also slated for extinction are the Army's historic Presidio in San Francisco  and Mather Air Force base near Sacramento, as well as such national landmarks  as Illinois' Ft. Sheridan and Ft. Dix in New Jersey. Two smaller California  facilities, Hamilton Army Airfield in Marin County and the Navy's inactive  Salton Sea Test Base, also would be closed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Senate Action Needed  </P> <P> With the House vote, any action by the Senate becomes irrelevant, because  disapproval by both houses of Congress was necessary to prevent the findings of  a blue-ribbon base consolidation panel from going into effect.  </P> <P> Opponents of the base closings acknowledged that the prospects for halting the  plan now are nearly nil.  </P> <P> "The House has spoken rather emphatically," said Rep. George E. Brown Jr.  (D-Colton) after the vote. "The chances of reversing that are very slim."  </P> <P> Brown, who introduced the House measure to save the bases, said: "It's time now  to focus on getting the job done, on getting (Norton Air Force Base) cleaned  up."  </P> <P> Anticipating the outcome of the vote, however, the National Federation of  Federal Employees had filed suit Monday in federal court in the District of  Columbia to block implementation of the panel's recommendations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Civilian Group's Suit  </P> <P> The federation, whose membership includes 5,000 civilian employees at George  and Norton Air Force bases, charged that in establishing the commission to pick  military facilities for closing, former Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci  unconstitutionally had delegated powers that belong in the hands of elected  officials.  </P> <P> Congress, struggling with a severe federal budget deficit and the inevitable  political obstacles to shutting down major government employers, last year  passed legislation creating the commission and charged it with identifying  obsolete military installations that could be phased out to save money.  </P> <P> Carlucci was directed to appoint the members, and Congress agreed to accept its  recommendations unless both chambers acted to block them. On Dec. 29, the panel  proposed closing 86 military installations and shifting many of their functions  to 54 other bases, for an estimated savings of $5.6 billion in the next 20  years.  </P> <P> Tuesday's House vote followed three days of intermittent debate, during which  opponents of the closings criticized the commission's screening methods and  charged that the savings promised were far less than Carlucci had once  estimated might be possible -- $3 billion to $5 billion per year.  </P> <P> "That's bait and switch at its worst," said Rep. Larry J. Hopkins (R-Ky.).  "What we wanted were real savings. What we're getting is false economy."  </P> <P> They insisted that many of the bases were targeted arbitrarily, that they still  perform valuable defense services and mean much more economically to their  regions than the relatively small cost savings to be gained from closing them.  </P> <P> However, supporters insisted that hard choices had to be made if Congress were  to trim back defense costs that the nation can no longer afford.  </P> <P> "This objective piece of work has passed the test," said Rep. Dick Armey  (R-Tex.). ". . . I know it's painful for the communities involved. But the  bottom line is that defense dollars are for defense needs, not for community  development."  </P> <P> Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands), who lobbied vigorously to block the closings  plan, estimated chances of saving the installations now at 5%. He said that  lawmakers could have additional opportunities to keep bases open during the  budget appropriations process. The Bush Administration will need to seek  further congressional approval for funds to begin the closures.  </P> <P> "Because this resolution passed doesn't mean the ballgame is over," Lewis said.  "There's a long way between now and the end of the process."  </P> <P> But House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.), who called the  commission's work "well done," warned opponents that his panel will work to  thwart any efforts to remove funds for the closings.  </P> <P> At the same time, members of the committee echoed opponents' concerns that the  Defense Department will be slow to clean up toxic waste that has accumulated at  several of the installations slated for closure.  </P> <P> "We are sympathetic," Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.), a defender of the  closures, told Lewis during floor debate. "We know that California has been  mistreated before. We're going to do everything to see that these cleanups are  done."  </P> <P> The Pentagon has estimated that it will need $800 million to clear obsolete  bases of toxic waste over the next six years.  </P> <P> Two San Bernardino officials joined Brown at the conclusion of Tuesday's vote  to announce that they will pursue "parallel paths" of encouraging efforts to  save the bases while also planning for new civilian uses for the facilities.  </P> <P> "While we are tempted to continue the fight, we must be honest with our  constituents," Brown, San Bernardino Mayor Evlyn Wilcox and San Bernardino  County Supervisor Robert Hammock said in a joint statement. "Blocking the base  closures is an uphill struggle against a vast majority in Congress.  </P> <P> "We therefore believe it is in the interest of our communities to shift the  focus of our efforts to ensuring that the base's closure leads to economic  growth for our region," the statement said.  </P> <P> The closings affect 6,653 military and civilian workers at Norton and 5,358 at  George. But March Air Force Base, 9 miles southeast of Riverside, would pick up  an additional 3,420 military and civilian employees from proposed  consolidations, many of them from Norton.  </P> <P> Hammock and Wilcox said that during their trip to Washington, they had secured  concessions from Pentagon officials, including permission for county managers  to begin planning for the use of Norton Air Force Base by civilian planes. The  officials said that the petition to open Norton to commercial air traffic was  made before the commission recommended Norton's closure. But they added that  the Pentagon's approval now could ease the base's transition to life as a fully  commercial airport.  </P> <P> Hammock and Wilcox also won assurances that the Defense Department will seek  $40 million by 1991 to clean toxic wastes from Norton, and secured a Pentagon  grant of $140,000 to help fund the development of plans for the conversion of  Norton and George Air Force bases.  </P></p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / The FT Interview: Tough talk scores savage hits - Jose Mara Aznar, leader of Spain's Partido Popular, talks to Peter Bruce and Martin Wolf At 40 years of age, Jose Mara Aznar makes Felipe Gonzalez - still, after John Major, the second youngest leader in the European Community - seem stale and old. But cold and untainted youth is what Spaniards seem to prefer. By next Monday, Mr Aznar may be forming a government. He himself takes his victory in Sunday's general election for granted. 'The only thing that is going to happen on June 6,' he says in a typically clipped sentence. 'is that there will be a change in government and this change will demonstrate that our democracy has matured.' Political prospects are rather more interesting than that. As he admits, 'we don't have much tradition of democratic function, so any change of government in Spain might be more complicated'. Victory for Mr Aznar would, in fact, mark the first time that power in Spain has passed peacefully from left to right. Leader of the conservative opposition Partido Popular since 1990, Mr Aznar is a tax inspector by profession and, judged by his performance in this campaign and the past three years of parliament, a political Rottweiler by nature. There is nothing subtle or witty about the way he has attacked the record of Prime Minister Gonzalez and his Socialist party in the past three weeks. He has been insulting and rude, and is winning because of it. The founder of the PP, Mr Manuel Fraga - one of the few Spanish politicians to thrive both under the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco and as a democrat - plucked Mr Aznar from relative obscurity as premier of the autonomous region of Castilla y Leon to be the PP's candidate in the 1989 elections. Conscious that his own Francoist past made it impossible for the PP to win under his leadership, Mr Fraga had tried to find a young successor before and had failed. Mr Aznar was Mr Fraga's second choice. But his performance has justified his patron's judgment. His savaging of Mr Gonzalez, almost a mythical figure in Spain after 11 years in power, in a television debate last week was a shock not only to the prime minister, but to the country. Spaniards love winners, but they also love to see them torn down. Mr Gonzalez has been gravely wounded. Quiet and polite in private, Mr Aznar sticks to broad principles, avoiding controversial policy prescriptions. 'The first duty of my government will be to remake Spain,' he says, without revealing how, or even, why. A few days later he tells a TV audience that 'I don't want to change everything. I want to keep the good things that have been done.' He is frustratingly vague. The suspicion is that this is because he has no clear ideas, though it may also be because his best chance of winning is to exploit the Socialists' disarray. After so many years gnawing away at the same pole, it is falling over almost without warning. He does not know, he says, exactly what he will do if he wins enough seats to form a government. 'We are going to do what the French did and do an inventory, an audit, of the situation in which we find ourselves and then we will take action,' he says. But 'we will keep the people informed - you have to tell Spaniards the truth'. Will he tell them the truth if he finds he has to raise taxes and not cut them, as he is promising in his campaign? 'I want a recovery policy that does not depend on increasing fiscal pressure on people, but I am prepared to make a big austerity effort and to save.' But what if, as he and his colleagues have been charging, the economy and particularly public finances are in much worse shape than the present government's figures show? If, instead of a 5 1/2 per cent public deficit we find a 9 per cent deficit, we will have to tell the people and take action accordingly. But I can't say now.' With one eye on his role model, Mr Edouard Balladur in France, Mr Aznar says he will try very hard to whittle down the size of Spain's public sector, especially state holdings in industry. 'We are going to do two things; first, draw up, internally, a complete list of privatisations and, second, put in place transparent mechanisms to make privatisation possible. 'Our country needs to free up resources, first just to improve efficiency but also to try, if possible, to reduce our public debt and our deficit,' he said. 'I do not believe in public sector business and I am determined to trigger a major reorganisation of public sector industry.' Privatisation is one area where PP and Socialist policy diverges markedly. The other is over a strike law, which the Socialist government wanted to introduce, but which was sunk by the more left-wing party machine. Dismissing charges that the PP is little more than a mouthpiece for big business as 'idiotic', Mr Aznar says that 'Spain needs a strike law. I would really like to be able to find a framework for a strike law that would be above modification by whichever party was in power.' To do that, though, he will need to talk to the unions. 'What is important in any relationship with the unions is trust,' he says. 'We could not possibly do any worse than the government and, anyway, historically in Spain, centre-right governments have had a better dialogue with the unions than the centre-left.' Mr Aznar's tough campaigning tone can seem a front. Occasionally he will even catch himself on the verge of saying something nice about the country, before remembering he is in the middle of an election. On foreign policy, he insists he has no hankerings for Francoist isolationism and fully endorses the 'historic objective' of Spain to be in Europe. But the government's 'enthusiasm' for all things European is not, he argues, a substitute for domestic economic strength. If Spain is to be in the first economic rank of Europe, it must be made more economically competitive. Spain, he asserts, is isolated now. 'What do you think isolates us from Europe?' he asks. 'What isolates us from Europe are 3,300,000 unemployed people, a public deficit of at least 5 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product, the destruction of our industrial fabric. Everything else is just words. The man responsible for this is Felipe Gonzalez. What this country needs is a leader who shows his face to the frightened people hiding under their tables. Mr Gonzalez is himself hiding away and would not dare show his face.' Mr Aznar sticks to discretion on all points. Does he, for example, differ from Mr Gonzalez in enthusiasm for the Maastricht treaty. Not at all, he answers, though he is more open to the idea of speedy enlargement than the present prime minister. 'Europe is much more than just a market. It would be logical to include the former Efta countries in the EC at once, but it would be sad if enlargement led to any loss of the sense of union among EC members.' Where he is more cautious than Mr Gonzalez is on the EC's Social Charter. 'The objectives of the EC's planned social dimension are one thing. They are satisfactory. But the possibilities of their application in Spain are limited in the current circumstances.' For now, his energies are focused on winning the election. If he is to become prime minister, he will have to form a coalition with the Catalan and Basque regional parties. Mr Aznar argues that this would not be a problem. 'They are conservatives, as we are,' he points out, 'and will do business with whichever of us and the Socialists has the most votes'. Yet they might wish to note Mr Aznar's authoritarian tendencies. Asked why he has not yet named a finance minister, given that he felt he was going to win anyway, he replies, amid guffaws, that it will not matter who his finance minister is because whoever it is 'will do whatever I tell him to do'. Future colleagues have been warned.

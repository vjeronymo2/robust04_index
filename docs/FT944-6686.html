			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / US home sales up in October Sales of existing US homes rose by 0.5 per cent in October, but downward revisions to statistics for earlier months meant that the announcement offered more evidence of a slowdown in the housing market. The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing single family homes rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.91m in October from a revised level of 3.89m in September. The figure is, however, a drop from the 3.97m annual rate the association had originally reported for September. The association is predicting sales of existing homes will reach a total of 3.97m in 1994. Home sales have shown increasing signs of weakness in recent months in response to the Federal Reserve's successive increases in short-term interest rates, which had already pushed average 30-year fixed-interest mortgage rates up by 2 percentage points before the three quarters of a percentage point increase the Fed decided on two weeks ago.</p>

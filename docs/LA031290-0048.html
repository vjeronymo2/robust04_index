			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: VIDEOS;  </P> <P> STRONG DEMAND FOR 'THE LITTLE MERMAID'  </P> <P> You won't have to wait until the next decade to see Disney's smash-hit animated  feature, "The Little Mermaid," on videocassette. Its home-video debut will be  considerably sooner -- May 18.  </P> <P> Like the other Disney animated features, it will be available at a price geared  to sales: $26.99. The price will be slashed three dollars with a rebate from  Disney. Discount stores, though, will probably sell it for $15 to $18.  </P> <P> Standard Disney policy has been to put its animated films through several  theatrical releases over a period of years. In addition to increasing its  exposure to young audiences, this extended release pattern also beefs up the  gross, further enhancing the movie's appeal in the home-video market.  </P> <P> Since it came out last November, "Mermaid" has grossed more than $76 million,  the most any animated film has earned in its initial release.  </P> <P> It seemed likely that "Little Mermaid" wouldn't come out on home video until  long after the debuts of two other animated features, "The Great Mouse  Detective" (1986) and "Oliver and Co." (1988). Why did "Mermaid" leap-frog over  them in the home-video release line?  </P> <P> The reason was spectacular marketing research results, explained Richard Cohen,  senior vice president of Buena Vista Home Video, the parent company of Disney  Home Video.  </P> <P> "The initial exit (from theaters) research was astounding," he said. "People  said they were anxious to buy it and that they'd buy it any time of the year.  The intent-to-purchase figures were so high and so much in favor of putting it  out as soon as possible that we eventually decided to put it out for the summer  market."  </P> <P> Cohen also said that there would be no commercial on "Little Mermaid." Some  potential sponsors wanted to buy a spot on the cassette, but ads on animated  features are against company policy, he explained.  </P> <P> Part of the decision to put "Mermaid" out so soon has to do with the notion,  which surfaced last year, that the home-video sales market is lucrative  year-round, not only in the Christmas-holiday gift-buying season. The release  in early February of "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" and "Lethal Weapon 2"  -- both at $24.98, geared to the sales market -- tested the sales market  outside the holiday season, with mixed results.  </P> <P> According to various industry estimates, Disney should ship between 6 million  and 10 million copies of "Mermaid." Eventually it may surpass "Bambi," Disney's  best-seller at 10.5 million copies.  </P> <P> Traditionally, Disney pulls a feature-length animated feature from its vaults  for Christmas home-video release. Earlier in the year, that movie gets its  final theatrical re-release, partly to reacquaint audiences with the title. But  Cohen said that the release of "Little Mermaid" didn't preclude the company  putting out another animated feature on home video this fall.  </P> <P> The most likely candidate for fall release is "Peter Pan," with "Snow White and  the Seven Dwarfs" also a strong possibility.  </P></p>

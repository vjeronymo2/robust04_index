			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Accordingly, the Director finds Iowa's proposed rule at IAC 27&hyph;40.74(8) not to be inconsistent with the Federal program and is approving it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> 30. IAC 27&hyph;40.74(5)a., Procedures for Assessment Conference <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Iowa proposes, at IAC 27&hyph;40.74(5)a. to revise its rule by changing the number of days that a person who was issued a notice of assessment has to provide written request for an assessment conference to review the proposed assessment. Iowa proposes to increase the timeframe from 15 days from the date the notice of assessment was mailed to 30 days from the date the notice of assessment was mailed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal regulation at 30 CFR 845.18 allows the person to request an assessment conference within 30 days from the date that the proposed assessment is received <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Since the number of days within which a person may request an assessment conference is a procedural matter, Iowa's proposal must be evaluated from the point of view of its similarity to the Federal rules in affording rights and remedies to persons.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (46 FR 53376) October 28, 1981. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director finds that the time difference between the date of mailing versus the date of receipt is minor enough to be considered similar and, therefore, finds the proposed revision at IAC 27&hyph;40.74(5) to be no less effective than the Federal regulation and is approving it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 31. IAC 27&hyph;40.75(207), Individual Civil Penalties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Iowa proposes, at IAC 27&hyph;40.75(207), to incorporate by reference the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 846 as in effect on July 1, 1992, dealing with individual civil penalties. Some exceptions to this incorporation by reference are proposed and are discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Scope. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Iowa proposes, at IAC 27&hyph;40.75(1), to delete from incorporation by reference, the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 846.1, Scope. This provision merely states that Part 846 covers assessment of individual civil penalties (ICP's) under section 518(f) of the Act. It does not set out any separate substantive requirement relating to ICP's. The Director, therefore, finds that the proposed revision at IAC 27&hyph;40.75(1) does not render Iowa's program less effective than the Federal program and is approving it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Violation, failure or refusal <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Iowa proposes, at IAC 27&hyph;40.75(2), to delete paragraphs (1) and (2) from the definition of ``violation, failure or refusal'' at 30 CFR 846.5, and insert in lieu thereof, substitute paragraphs (1) and (2). Iowa's proposed language is substantively similar to the deleted Federal language except that, where the Federal regulation provides the specific statutory cite of section 518(b) of the Act as being excepted from failure or refusal to comply with orders, Iowa substitutes a general reference to Iowa Code section 207.15. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As explained in the preamble to the final rule for 30 CFR 846.5 (53 FR 3664, 3666, February 8, 1988), the specific exception for orders issued pursuant to section 518(b) of the Act in the definition of violation, failure or refusal is required by section 518(f) of SMCRA: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Section 518(f) specifically prohibits the Secretary from assessing penalties for failure to comply with an order incorporated in a civil penalty decision rendered under section 518(b), presumably because it would be counter-productive to assess an individual civil penalty for the nonpayment of the original civil penalty assessed against the corporate permittee. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Both section 518 of SMCRA and the State counterpart provision at Iowa Code section 207.15 cover more than just the original civil penalty assessed against the corporate permittee. Accordingly, Iowa's proposal to completely exempt  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> all <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  orders issued under Iowa code section 207.15 is less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the Federal rule because section 518(f) exempts only one particular type of order issued under section 518. The Director is not approving Iowa's proposed revision at IAC 27&hyph;40.75(2) to the extent that Iowa's proposed rule provides for the exemption of all orders issued under Iowa Code section 207.15. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Iowa proposes, at IAC 27&hyph;40.75(4), to delete from its incorporation by reference the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 846.17(c), dealing with service of civil penalty assessments, and insert in lieu thereof the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Service. For purposes of this section, service is sufficient if it would satisfy Division III of the Iowa rules of civil procedure for service of an original notice and petition. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Iowa provided OSM with a copy of the service requirements from the Division III of the Iowa Rules of Civil Procedure for review (Administrative Record No. IA&hyph;383). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

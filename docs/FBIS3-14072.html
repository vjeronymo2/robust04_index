			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "If Only It Used the Veto"] </F>   [Text] Three weeks after the Hebron massacre, the UN  Security Council has issued a resolution condemning it and  urging international protection for the Palestinians in the  occupied territories in accordance with the clauses of the  Fourth Geneva convention. Although the United States did not  use the veto against the resolution, it did something worse by  opposing the consolidation of Palestinian identity in the West  Bank and the Gaza Strip, with Jerusalem as an integral part of  it.    It is difficult for us to see this U.S. position as anything  but negative, especially as the Arabs -- individually and  collectively -- offered numerous concessions to make the peace  process sponsored by Washington a success.    The danger in the U.S. abstention from voting lies not only  in the complete bias toward Israel and its crimes in the  occupied territories, but in the credibility of the peace  process sponsored by it in its early and final stages.    If the United States does not believe that the occupied  territories in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are Palestinian  territory, this means it espouses the Israeli position, which  regards them as disputed territories -- which conflicts with all  international charters and laws and the letters of guarantees  and assurances the U.S. Administration sent to the parties  concerned and on the basis of which it participated in the  Madrid peace conference.    As for the U.S. abstention from considering Jerusalem an  integral part of the occupied Arab territories, it can only be  interpreted in one way: There is no guarantee of the inclusion  of this fundamental issue on the agenda of the final phase of  negotiations. And even if it is included, it might not  encounter U.S. support.    This U.S. position put all Arabs, not just the Palestinians,  in a very embarrassing position. Because the Arabism of the  land has become threatened and the future of sovereignty over  Jerusalem has become more vague.    What arouses astonishment and amazement is some Arab  parties'  rush to respond to the "telephone" demand by the U.S. to return  to the negotiations, without having obtained specific  clarifications to determine the true U.S. position after the  recent voting, especially with regard to the identity of  Jerusalem.    More than one Israeli newspaper has quoted U.S. President  Bill Clinton as calling Jerusalem the unified capital of Israel.  We were surprised by some Arab newspapers' rush to publish a  denial of these remarks by U.S. officials who volunteered to  make this denial to save the Clinton administration among Arab  circles.    The abstention of the U.S. representative to the Security  Council from the vote on considering Jerusalem part of the  occupied territories justifies Israeli press reports about  President Clinton's position on Jerusalem and his view of its  future -- a dishonorable situation for the Arabs at any rate.    And if Dr. Barukh Goldstein and those who participated with  him in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron have revealed  serious loopholes in the declaration of principles agreement  vis-a-vis the Palestinians' security in the occupied  territories, the recent voting in the UN Security Council has  revealed bigger loopholes in the U.S. position on fundamental  issues -- loopholes that could kill the current peace process in  all its early and final stages.    All the calamities afflicting the Arabs are the result of  the  lack of coordination among the parties concerned and the  complete submission to U.S. policies in the region, beginning  with the embargo imposed on Iraq through to the sanctions  imposed on Libya and the swift response to the appeals to return  to the negotiating table without any conditions or guarantees.    It is regrettable that the Hebron massacre and the  subsequent  smaller massacres, which occurred in confrontations between Arab  demonstrators and Israelis armed to the teeth, should take place  and yet we hear no Arab call to convene an Arab League meeting  at any level to discuss the matter and agree on a unified plan  to raise the issue in international forums.</p>

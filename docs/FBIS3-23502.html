Suponko under the rubric "Advice for IAS  Specialists": "They Have Their Own Concerns in Summer"]    [Text] The servicing of aviation hardware in the summertime  has a number of specific features, knowledge of which will help  personnel to avert breakdowns in flight in a timely manner.    One of the most typical causes of failures is the refueling  of an aircraft or helicopter using substandard fuel that  contains water. This is usually a consequence of the violation  of regulations for its storage in fuel dumps, and a lack of  airtight seals on service and holding tanks and airfield fuel  lines. The development and testing of the IVT-1 instrument to  monitor fuel for the presence of water has currently been  completed, and a small lot of them has arrived in VTA  [military-transport aviation] units. It would be expedient to  employ potassium permanganate in places that do not yet have  those instruments; it provides an easily noticeable reaction  with water.    Rain can bring quite a bit of unpleasantness. The pipes of  the central aircraft refueling system were underwater at one  airfield after a downpour. The water got into the pipeline  through a bad seal and later, with inadequate monitoring of the  fuel, into the tanks of aircraft, which led to the failure of  several engines in flight. It should be noted that draining the  residue from aircraft tanks does not always make it possible to  detect substandard fuel in a timely manner; this is because  there are areas in the lower portion of the fuel tanks of some  types of aircraft that are not in communication with the drain  points. They can be formed either by the folds of soft fuel  tanks, or by longitudinal and transverse metallic partitions.  The undrained fuel residue sometimes reaches several dozen  liters. It is thus essential, when instances of the refueling of  aircraft with substandard fuel have been ascertained, not only  to drain it by the usual methods, but also to extract the  residue from the undrained areas.    The consequences of operating engines using fuel with water  are the extinguishing of the flame in the combustion chamber,  disruption of fuel feed owing to clogging of the fine filters  with water, and corrosion damage to parts of the fuel-regulating  apparatus, leading to its jamming or sticking. The decision on  the procedure for the further servicing of an aircraft after  refueling with substandard fuel is made after an engineering  analysis of its technical condition, with a regard for the  requirements of servicing documentation.    The contamination of GSM [fuels and lubricants] in the  summer  is also possible when dust gets into them. The use of a closed  refueling system under pressure is thus recommended, under  conditions of enhanced dust, for those aircraft whose design  provides for it, with measures to protect against dust  penetration observed for open refueling. When systems are  unsealed (for the replacement of fuel, oil and hydraulic  filters, for example), steps that rule out the entry of  mechanical impurities into them must also be envisaged.    The state of the filter elements is objective evidence of  the  cleanliness of the operating fluids. The level of their  dirtiness is determined by their flow duration using a PKF  (filter element monitoring instrument)--the greater the  duration, the dirtier the filter element. This check is  performed during routine operations before the ultrasound  cleaning of the filter elements, as well as after it. If they  turn out to be very dirty, it is essential to determine the  causes for that in order to endure the failure-free operation of  the aircraft in flight.    If a lack of airtightness is detected in the systems, the  possible appearance of the physical phenomenon of obliteration  should be taken into account. It essence is as follows--a leak  through a slot of micron dimensions, starting quite intensively,  decreases appreciably over a certain time, and in some cases  even ceases. This occurs as a result of the mechanical  contamination of the narrow channels with insoluble particles,  as well as the formation of a special aggregate state of the  liquid molecules on the walls of the channels that creates  boundary layers with a certain strength. Obliteration  accelerates with an increase in the consumption of the operating  liquids through the slot and with increases in temperature,  which is typical of summertime conditions. One must thus not be  limited to wiping and the tightening of joints, even if there is  no seepage detected after that for a certain period of time; it  is essential to make sure that the obliteration of a crack has  not been "hidden," and whose further development could have  dangerous consequences. If it is detected, the damaged parts  must simply be replaced and the conditions and reasons for the  appearance of the crack established, in order to make sure that  it is not the manifestation of some other flaw such as an  increased level of vibrations.    The most dangerous consequence of a lack of airtight seals  in  the fuel, oil and hydraulic systems is the outbreak of a fire.  Operating fluids are ignited when they come into contact with  hot sections of aircraft or engine systems, as well as damaged  sections of electrical wiring. The most easily combustible ones,  even in the absence of open flame, are the hydraulic liquids and  lubricating oils. This danger increases during summer servicing  periods, since the temperatures of structural elements of the  aircraft increase through external heating.    Turbojet engines [TRD] are easily started under conditions  of  increased temperatures of the surrounding air. The start-up of a  TRD that has not had time to cool down after shutoff, however,  has certain specific features. There is an engine speed holdup  with the throwing of the gas temperature behind the turbine in  start-up, owing to the fact that the air in the air-intake  channel and in the engines is heated. Such failures used to be  of a mass nature with start-ups of hot AL-21F-3 type engines.  Recommendations were thus entered into the servicing manuals,  after special research that determined that the RUD [engine  controls] should be moved to "idle" 30--35 seconds after pushing  the "start" button when starting up an engine that had not had  time to cool down. The cranking of the turbine to remove the  heated air from the air-gas duct and subsequent start-up were  thereby combined into one cycle.    Aircraft and helicopters should be positioned in such a way  that their air intakes are pointed into the direction of the  wind, especially when they are high in velocity, for the more  reliable start-up of gas-turbine engines of all types. This  improves the cooling of the engines, and reduces the required  capacity of the electric-power sources by easing the cranking of  the rotors.    Attention should also be paid to the fact that the  parameters  for the start-up and idle mode also carry valuable diagnostic  information on the technical condition of the engine. There have  been many cases where the flight, engineering and technical  personnel have been able to ascertain dangerous failures of the  automatic fuel apparatus by increasing the duration of the  start-up cycle according to the value of the maximum gas  temperature behind the turbine. The idle mode is the first  operating mode of the power plant that establishes an  equilibrium, which is maintained by a minimal consumption of  fuel. The engine is thus more sensitive to changes in the state  of the elements in its flow portions. It is possible to  ascertain in a timely fashion, by monitoring the rate to reach  revolutions and temperatures in idle mode, such problems as  damage and destruction of compressor and turbine blades, cracks  in the combustion chamber, and the destruction of fuel feed  lines to the nozzles of the main combustion chamber.    The likelihood of deviations in the structural elements of  the aircraft from increased discharges of static electricity  increases appreciably in the summer, creating the danger of a  discharge during fueling and a subsequent fire. The reliable  grounding of both the aircraft and the refueling equipment is  therefore essential, especially after the return of aircraft and  helicopters from dense clouds and areas of thunderstorm activity.    The specific features of servicing runway equipment during  the summer include regular monitoring of the air in pneumatic  tires. The point is that when the temperature of the surrounding  air increases by 15C, the pressure in the tires increases  by 10--12 percent, leading to increased likelihood of their  rupture in sharp braking.    Summer also requires increased attention toward ensuring the  protection of engines against the entry of dust and small  foreign particles from the surfaces of the airfield. Erosive  wear and damage to parts of the air-gas duct by foreign  particles leads to a reduction in the reserves of gas-dynamic  stability and the formation of nicks--concentrations of stresses  that are often the centers for the formation of fatigue cracks.  Constant monitoring should thus be performed--both when  preparing for flights and when making them--of the cleanliness  of the areas where the engines are started and tested, as well  as the taxiways and runways. The likelihood of the entry of  foreign objects into the air intakes is increased when the rules  for aircraft taxiing are violated (high speed, high engine RPMs)  and when the moving row of aircraft is blown by gas streams.    The trajectory of the movement of particles in the operation  of helicopter power plants has its own specific features. The  dust raised by the inductive flow of the main rotor moves to the  periphery of the area swept by the main rotor, is sucked up into  the zone of rarefaction under it, and then is thrown back down  by the inductive flow. A considerable portion of that dust is in  the rarefaction zone created by the engines and is sucked into  the air intakes. It must be noted that helicopters with  gas-turbine engines, as opposed to aircraft, do not create  vortex or turbulent flows that throw the dust right from the  ground into the air intakes. Special dust-protection devices are  employed as design features on helicopters. The cleanliness of  the separators must be checked on aircraft fitted with them  during flight preparations. Their fouling leads to a reduction  in the effectiveness of the dust-protection devices, and to an  increase in the non-productive expenditures of engine capacity.

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / A ray of colour beams down on drab Albania: Europe's poorest economy is emerging from the dark days of Stalinism MOST factories are still closed, but the ubiquitous stalls selling cigarettes, soap and Pepsi Cola, adding a splash of colour to Tirana's drab streets, indicate that Albania's transition to a market economy is under way. With about 310,000 unemployed and another 200,000 Albanians working illegally in Greece, people in Europe's poorest country have been forced to make radical adjustments in the year since the election of a democratic government ended a half-century of Stalinist self-sufficiency. Out-of-work diplomats and engineers trade lek for dollars and drachmas in the foreign exchange market, held in the street outside the central bank. While banking reform is painfully slow, the lek has stabilised since the government adopted a harsh reform package last August in return for an Dollars 18m stand-by loan from the International Monetary Fund. Food prices have been liberalised, with the exception of bread. Rents were raised sharply, while petrol for a burgeoning fleet of secondhand trucks and battered cars is sold at international prices. Nevertheless, the monthly inflation rate has fallen steadily after a 47 per cent jump in response to price liberalisation last August, dropping to 6.8 per cent in January and just 0.9 per cent in March. The finance ministry forecasts that year-on-year inflation will be held at 45 per cent in 1993. 'I think we've done better than other ex-communist countries in stabilising the economy, even though we'd no experience at all of a free market,' says Mr Genc Ruli, finance minister. However, with real wages and unemployment benefits both showing a sharp decline, remittances from Albanians working abroad, estimated at more than Dollars 300m in the past year, have been crucial in cushioning the impact of market reforms. In addition, the Group of 24 wealthy nations provided another Ecu850m (Pounds 671.5m) in aid in 1991-92, much of it contributed as emergency food supplies following a disastrous fall in agricultural output, the result of privatisation of collective farms. Moreover, the government has had to postpone plans to earmark revenues from selling food aid to domestic consumers as the Albanian contribution to foreign-funded development projects. Instead, much of this income went towards covering a budget deficit saddled with huge losses at state enterprises, amounting to some 22 per cent of GDP in 1992. With farm production forecast to rise by at least 20 per cent this year, food aid will be gradually phased out. Mr Ruli must now persuade donor countries that Albania is firmly committed to structural reforms that would justify international funding for infrastructure projects. The government's medium-term reform plan, to be supported with another Dollars 20m loan from the IMF, calls for reducing public spending by speeding up privatisation, confined so far to selling off about 20,000 state-owned shops, and cutting public sector jobs. However, plans for improving the foreign investment law to provide better protection for investors and for permitting land to be sold rather than leased to foreigners, meet with fierce political opposition. A new law that provides for restitution of property to pre-communist period owners will only add to the confusion. Potential investors also appear discouraged by the slow pace of decision-making on specific projects, and a rising level of corruption , which Mr Ruli dismisses as 'unavoidable when salaries are so low,' equivalent to Dollars 30 a month for most civil servants. Despite the advantages of an undeveloped coastline, cheap labour, and easy access to European markets, Albania has so far managed to attract only Dollars 20m in foreign investment and none at all in the tourist sector.</p>

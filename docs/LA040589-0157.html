			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> OAKLAND COLISEUM STRIKE AVERTED  </P> <P> A tentative contract has been reached with the union representing vendors at  the Oakland Coliseum, averting a strike today at the second game between the  Oakland Athletics and Seattle Mariners.  </P> <P> The terms of the settlement reached Tuesday night between Local 28 of the Hotel  and Restaurant Employees Union and Canteen-Volume Service were not made public,  pending a ratification vote by workers later today, union spokesman Lincoln  Smith said.  </P> <P> Coliseum food stand managers with a year's experience currently make $9.17 an  hour compared with $12.90 hourly for similar managers at Candlestick Park in  San Francisco. Coliseum fry cooks get $9.73 hourly. Candlestick cooks get $9.71  to $11.37.  </P> <P> A threatened walkout by the 350-member union on opening night Monday was  avoided when the union agreed not to strike while talks continued with  Chicago-based Canteen-Volume Service.  </P></p>

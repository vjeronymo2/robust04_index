			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Sizov] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 14 TASS -- The documents on the  complete destruction of Ukraine's nuclear arsenal by its  transfer to and scrapping in Russia, which were signed in the  Kremlin, also determine the procedure of the payment of  compensation to Kiev for their loss, Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev said in an interview with ITAR-TASS.    This loss, according to Kozyrev, will be made up with  uranium  fuel, which Russia will obtain after recycling the weapon-grade  uranium in collaboration with the United States. Part of the  profit gained from the sale of uranium on the world market  belongs to Ukraine, Kozyrev noted. The uranium after all is the  property of the former Soviet Union, which is why the profit  from its sale will be divided, he said. "We ourselves will  obtain weapon-grade uranium, recycle it and sell to America, and  the share belonging to Ukraine will be paid in the form of  uranium fuel," he clarified.    According to the Russian foreign minister, there is no  provision for any additional payments by Russia, and also of  writing off a part of Ukraine's debts.    Andrey Kozyrev said that the United States will provide  additional resources so that Moscow and Kiev can both ensure  safety during the dismantling of the nuclear arsenal, its  transportation and other necessary procedures. Naturally, the  dismantling of the arsenal - the nuclear contents and the  warhead - will be carried out in Russia only. Not because,  Kozyrev emphasised, Moscow wants to humiliate or offend Ukraine,  but because the appropriate plants are located in Russia and a  warhead can only be dismantled where it was made, otherwise  there would be a real danger of monstrous environmental  consequences.    The signed agreements really are historical. A political  decision has been made and the political will has been  displayed, now only "purely technical work" is needed to go  ahead, Kozyrev said. First of all we should determine the share  belonging to Ukraine, deduct from it Russia's expenses on  recycling it and other works and repay this part "in whatever  form the Ukrainians want and the Russians can manage," he said.  But it is a purely technical question, the Russian minister  said.    Speaking of security guarantees given to Ukraine, Andrey  Kozyrev emphasised that they are basically standard ones. These  are the same guarantees which the three countries, the United  States, England and Russia, give to all the participants in the  non- proliferation of nuclear weapons treaty. It is quite  natural that the signed documents will come into force only  after Ukraine joins the nuclear weapon non-proliferation treaty  as a non-nuclear state, the Russian minister said.</p>

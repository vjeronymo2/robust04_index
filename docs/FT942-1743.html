			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Electrolux purchase approved Electrolux, the world's leading household appliance maker, said yesterday it had received approval from the European Commission for its DM730m (Pounds 294.3m) acquisition of AEG Hausgerate, the white goods arm of Germany's AEG industrial group. The takeover, which will now take effect from October 1, will bring Electrolux alongside Whirlpool of the US in global white goods sales, extend its lead in total appliance sales and give the Swedish group a commanding position in Europe's white goods markets. Together, Electrolux and AEG Hausgerate have annual appliance sales of more than Dollars 9bn. Combined with AEG, Electrolux will have a white goods market share in western Europe of at least 25 per cent, against 15-19 per cent for Bosch-Siemens of Germany and 11-15 per cent for Whirlpool Europe. The Commission issued its approval of the takeover after a one-month review. Electrolux said the Commission's main concern had been over its position in Scandinavian markets, where its share is now set to rise significantly above its share in other European markets.</p>

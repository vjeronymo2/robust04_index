Telephone conversation between Michele R. Weisbaum, Associate General Counsel, Phlx, and Thomas N. McManus, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, on April 26, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Index value, for purposes of settling outstanding Index options contracts upon expiration, will be calculated based upon the regular way opening sale prices for each of the Index's component stocks on the last trading day prior to expiration. Once all of the component stocks have opened, the value of the Index will be determined and that value will be used as the final settlement value for expiring Index options contracts. If any of the component stocks do not open for trading on the last trading day before expiration, then the last reported sale price of such security will be used in any case where that security does not trade on that day. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D.

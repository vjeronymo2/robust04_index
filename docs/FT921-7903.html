			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: Largest US insurer to cut workforce by 1,000 Prudential Insurance Company of America, the largest US insurer, plans to cut its workforce by up to 1,000 this year in an effort to trim costs, AP-DJ reports. Employees are being offered early retirement and voluntary redundancy, but the insurer may have to resort to layoffs if there are insufficient volunteers. Mr Robert Winters, chairman, has said the company needed to cut its operating costs. Prudential Insurance had net income last year of more than Dollars 1.1bn in 1991, up from 1990's Dollars 113m. Last month, Moody's Investors Service, the US rating agency, lowered its assessment of Prudential Insurance's claims-paying ability amid concerns over possible deterioration in the insurer's real estate and junk bond investments. Last year, Prudential Insurance cut 2,000 jobs by offering early retirement.</p>

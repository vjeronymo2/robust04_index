			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Arts: An upmarket Big Issue - Off the Wall I must not whinge: it is a message that seems to have hit home. The bosses of our leading arts companies now present an optimistic, expansionary, face to the world - and to hell with their deficits. The English National Opera and the Royal Shakespeare Company share one thing in common - they each have an accumulated debt of around Pounds 2.4m. But are they down hearted - no] On Thursday Dennis Marks of the ENO unveiled a plan to cut his losses by putting on more new productions next season and yesterday Adrian Noble of the RSC was equally buoyant. 'This is a time for modest boasting, both financially and artistically.' Noble revealed audiences at 83 per cent of capacity for both his London and Stratford operations, the highest for almost ten years, plus a profit this financial year which will enable him to shave the deficit slightly. Some of this bullishness was induced by the Pounds 3.3m, over three years, from new sponsor Allied Lyons - businessmen hate defeatist talk. But with near sell outs for RSC productions of Tamberlaine, Macbeth and Travesties in London Noble can afford some self congratulation. Next season he is playing safe, with Stratford presenting four new productions of Shakespearean favourites, Henry V with Iain Glen as Harry, Twelfth Night starring Emma Fielding and Haydn Gwynne, A Midsummer Night's Dream with Toby Stephens, and Steven Pimlott's Measure for Measure. The Barbican is even safer, with last season's Stratford successes moving to the capital, although more exciting plays are promised for the autumn. The two smaller auditoria at Stratford get some stimulation with the unknown, late 17th century play The Wives' Excuse and the very rare John Ford 1629 tragedy The Broken Heart at the Swan, plus new plays by Anne Devlin and David Edgar at the Other Place. But all in all the RSC is conforming to the received wisdom that in a time of frozen Arts Council grants and choosy audiences this is no time for risk taking. Dennis Marks cannot be quite so sanguine because on top of his accumulated deficit he has a projected annual shortfall this season of around Pounds 500,000. He is going ahead with repairing a repertoire which was only fitfully replenished during the last years of the Peter Jonas reign, when the recession knocked 20 per cent off the ENO's annual audience. Marks has quickly discovered that economising on new productions and relying on revivals is box office suicide. Even the best productions, like the seasonal Hansel &amp; Gretel, have a limit to their shelf-life. So he has lifted the number of new productions in 1994-95 from six to eight, creating fresh versions of old war horses like Tosca and Don Giovanni, extending into the romantic repertoire with the first ENO productions of Massenet's Don Quichotte and Mussorgsky's Khovanschina, bringing back after a lengthy interval a new version of Mahagonny, and throwing in the home grown King Priam and A Midsummer Night's Dream. The sliver of the contemporary is the UK premiere of Schnittke's Life with an Idiot. Thanks to new productions of popular favourites like Der Rosenkavalier and La boheme audiences are 3 per cent up so far this season, and every additional 1 per cent adds Pounds 100,000 to the revenue. With luck, planned changes in back stage workings, involving some redundancies, and the New Stages Appeal to the ENO's loyal audience, targetted to raise Pounds 250,000 this season, should, between them, enable the company to break even, while higher box office income in future years is expected to pay off the overdraft by the end of the millennium. The ENO is also starting its season later, in September, and renting out the Coliseum to commercial managements during the Christmas period as well as the summer. This could reduce its own performances to under 200 a year, but there will be fewer of those uncomfortable evenings when the audience is less than 60 per cent of capacity, and within a few years the ENO should be able to offer shorter runs of a considerably greater number of operas, including the traditional favourites in fresh dressings. If you throw in the Royal Opera House and the National Theatre, the accumulated deficits of the four flagship companies must exceed Pounds 8m, but there is no sense of panic. The National Theatre has cut back on new productions but is doing well on established favourites and Covent Garden is switching productions at the last minute to optimise its box office. Perhaps they have all heard the rumours that one of Lord Gowrie's conditions for taking over as chairman of the Arts Council was the promise of a higher Arts Council grant for 1995-96. Certainly Lord Palumbo, who did well financially for the arts during his five years as chairman, can rightly feel disgruntled about not getting the rise in funding he had been promised for his final year. * On the surface there is a yawning gap between the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and The Big Issue, the newspaper distributed to help the homeless. Yet the Opera House is advertising for customers in the campaigning magazine. The seats it wants to sell are for Saturday nights, when, six times this season, the average price is Pounds 11 and best stalls seats cost Pounds 18 rather than Pounds 102. It is part of a scheme to help Covent Garden lose its elitist image and be seen to be accessible to a wider public, in particular to pensioners, the unemployed, and students. Saturday night is not the most popular with the traditional opera and dance audiences - corporate seats are unfilled and other regulars are away in the country. Covent Garden hoped to get sponsors to underwrite the performances which cost it Pounds 40,000 in lost revenue for a dance evening and Pounds 60,000 for opera, but to date no backers have been forthcoming. It has pressed ahead independently and is happy with the results. The annual season supported by the Paul Hamlyn Trust, which is aimed at the disadvantaged, has given it a large mailing list to sell to, but anyone able to prove that they are not in receipt of a regular wage can qualify for the cheap Saturday night tickets. The next bargain evening is the first performance of the ballet Manon on July 2 and Covent Garden hopes to repeat the concept, perhaps with more such Saturday nights, next season.</p>

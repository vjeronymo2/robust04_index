			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> POLICE VETO PUBLIC ENEMY SHOW  </P> <P> Police put city officials on notice that off-duty security will be hard to come  by if the rap group Public Enemy is booked to play here, so the city decided  against a concert by the band.  </P> <P> Police oppose the group because of lyrics to some of their songs, said P. D.  Taylor, president of the local Fraternal Order of Police.  </P> <P> The police group voted last fall not to provide off-duty security if Public  Enemy performed in the city.  </P> <P> The city decided not to book the band for a concert this summer at Myriad  Convention Center, said Pat Downes, director of public facilities. Downes said  the show would have been impossible without the off-duty security officers.  </P></p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Call to bar more unfit directors FEWER THAN a fifth of directors who show signs of being unfit to run their companies are being pursued for disqualification, the National Audit Office says today. The public-spending watchdog says in a report that even in cases where the directors of collapsed companies have demonstrated seriously deficient conduct, the government has pursued legal action against just two-thirds of those brought to its attention. The details come in the first detailed examination of procedures for punishing executives since the regime was introduced through the Directors' Disqualification Act in 1986. The watchdog criticises the government's Insolvency Service, which is part of the Department of Trade and Industry, and also raises concerns about the conduct of insolvency practitioners in the private sector. The study shows that there have been about 153,000 corporate insolvencies from 1987 to 1993, of which 28,541 - or 19 per cent - involved some incidence of unfit conduct. It estimates that about 15 per cent of these cases - or 4,278 - involved serious 'public interest' breaches, but that there had been just 2,891 directions to begin disqualification proceedings against directors, and 1,935 against companies. Only 1,700 have so far led to successful director disqualifications. The report highlighted considerable regional variations between the performance of the Insolvency Service's offices. The average time to select a case for investigation varied from 21 days to 57 days. While the number of compulsory insolvencies - handled by the official receiver's office - rose 160 per cent between 1987 and 1993, the number of cases submitted for disqualification proceedings fell. Some official receivers were investigating less important 'public interest' cases for potential disqualification before more serious ones. The NAO said that 78 per cent of statutory reports, required to be filed to the DTI from insolvency practitioners, were submitted after the deadline which is six months from their appointment. More than one-fifth of these late returns were filed at least one year after the appointment. It also showed that 34 per cent of reports filed by practitioners were incomplete, with important documents omitted such as statements of affairs and audited accounts. It said Companies House, part of the DTI, had failed to maintain a complete list of disqualified directors and there was not sufficient effort to ensure that these people resigned existing directorships and did not take any new ones. Three-quarters of a sample of 103 insolvency practitioners surveyed for the report said an insufficient number of directors were being disqualified. Just one-third believed that the existing arrangements deterred unfit conduct, and one-quarter that disqualification was successful in protecting the public. A separate survey of 517 company directors showed that nearly 60 per cent were unaware of the existence of the act and 57 per cent said they were not well informed about disqualification procedures. But 43 per cent believed that insufficient numbers of directors were being disqualified. National Audit Office. The Insolvency Service Executive Agency. Cmd 907. HMSO. Pounds 6.70</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Small businesses greet red tape moves with muted applause The government's de-regulation bill was yesterday greeted with muted applause by small-business groups which say the smallest companies spend a disproportionate amount of time fighting red tape. While welcoming the initiative, small-business lobby groups said it was essential that the government followed through with a determined effort to sweep away the red tape produced by centuries of legislation. Businessmen and women were particularly pleased with the so-called small business litmus test which would be applied by all departments when introducing new legislation. The departments would assess the costs of complying with new legislation by consulting two or three typical small companies. The DTI said it would adopt a 'think small' principle which meant new regulations would be framed with small businesses in mind. New legislation would be tested for its impact on small companies' competitiveness and their ability to export, the cost of implementation and practicality. The CBI said the government was introducing a fundamental change in culture and attitude. Officials should no longer see themselves as regulators but de-regulators. The Institute of Directors called the legislation 'a powerful antidote to unnecessary and obstructive regulation'. Mr Peter Morgan, director- general of the IOD, said: 'Until now it has been too easy for government to introduce new laws and too difficult to get rid of them. 'Government and parliament will now have the the power to remove a noose from the necks of business - they should use it.' The IOD said the UK's high regulatory burden put British companies at a disadvantage with competitors operating under more flexible regulatory regimes. The Forum of Private Business, which has 21,000 members, gave a cautious welcome to the bill. Mr Stan Mendham, the forum's chief executive, said: 'Sadly we have seen many false starts on regulation.' The success of the initiative depended on the government following through its good intentions and resisting new legislation from the EU. 'To understand the law, business owners need to read over 400,000 words and complying with red tape costs 3 per cent of turnover,' said Mr Mendham. The attack on red tape was 'too important for the economy to be allowed to fail'. The forum said its research showed a quarter of companies spent between five and 10 hours a week complying with red tape. Citing particularly absurd regulations, the British Chambers of Commerce said it took five separate pieces of permission to set up a whelk stall. And one EU directive included guidelines for the maximum permitted length and curvature of cucumbers.</p>

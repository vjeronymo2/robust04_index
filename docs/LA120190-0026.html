			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRADLEY SLIPS PAST LOYOLA, 99-97;  </P> <P> IRVINE TOURNAMENT: LIONS DROP TO 1-3 AFTER WASTING A 12-POINT LEAD IN THE FIRST  HALF.  </P> <P> Forward Andy Bastock made a high-arching shot in the lane with five seconds to  play Friday night, giving Bradley a 99-97 victory over Loyola Marymount in the  opening game of the Freedom Bowl Classic at UC Irvine.  </P> <P> The loss dropped Loyola to 1-3 and put the Lions in tonight's consolation game  at 6. Bradley improved to 1-1.  </P> <P> The depleted Lions, who were missing two starters and a key reserve because of  injuries controlled the game early and took a 12-point lead. But Bradley turned  cut that to 59-56 at halftime.  </P> <P> Bradley tried a zone defense in the second half, successfully closing down  Loyola's outside game, and took a 16-point lead midway through the half. But  Loyola then scored eight consecutive points in the next 1:11, and eventually  took a 91-90 lead on Terrell Lowery's layup off a steal with 3:59 to play.  Lowery led Loyola with 22 points.  </P> <P> The lead changed hands five more times before Loyola's Brian McCloskey made one  of two free throws with 48 seconds left. Bradley held the ball and called a  timeout with 12 seconds to play.  </P> <P> "When they called the timeout it was lucky for us," Loyola Coach Jay Hillock  said. "We got a hand on the (inbounds) ball. Close, close."  </P> <P> Bradley, trying to run a play for Curtis Stuckey, who had 33 points, lost  control of the inbounds pass. But in the scramble, Bradley center Xanthus  Houston came up with the ball and passed to Bastock. Bastock dribbled into the  lane and scored the last of his 10 points.  </P> <P> "When I shot it I was concerned about getting blocked so I put a lot of arc on  it," Bastock said. "It felt good when I let it go and it felt great when I saw  it go through."  </P> <P> Said Hillock: "We played better than in Maui (in a tournament), but we had some  lapses. We're still hurting ourselves in phases of the game. . . . We're not  playing as well in the second half."  </P></p>

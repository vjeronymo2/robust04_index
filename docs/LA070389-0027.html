			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: BETTING RECORDS CHALLENGED BY 'EXPERT'  </P> <P> A Chicago bookie told a Chicago newspaper that records of bets Pete Rose  allegedly made should have been destroyed, or organized crime members would  have placed a hit on the bookmaker.  </P> <P> "Hanging on to records is stupid," the bookmaker, who did not want his name  used, was quoted in the Chicago Sun-Times. "Not only would it be unfair to the  customers and yourself, but the (outfit) would put you out of business for  leaving evidence lying around. That's a ticket to the penitentiary."  </P> <P> The comments were the latest in the wake of baseball's investigation into  gambling allegations against Rose, manager of the Cincinnati Reds.  </P> <P> John M. Dowd, a Washington attorney serving as baseball's special investigator,  compiled a lengthy report with witnesses detailing Rose's gambling, including  baseball games involving the Reds.  </P> <P> Dowd's conclusion prompted Rose to file a lawsuit last month in which he he  successfully blocked his scheduled hearing before Commissioner Bart Giamatti.  </P> <P> Hamilton County (Ohio) Common Pleas Judge Norbert A. Nadel has scheduled a  hearing Thursday on a preliminary injunction that would prevent Giamatti from  making a final determination on Rose indefinitely.  </P> <P> Part of baseball's evidence against Rose consists of documents alleged to be  bookmakers' records of bets that Rose made.  </P> <P> Robert R. Fuesel, formerly an IRS special agent now employed by a top private  detective agency, told the paper: "The only possible excuse I can find for  keeping records like that would be if the bookmakers planned to use them in the  future against Pete Rose."  </P> <P> During his deposition with Dowd on April 20-21, Rose repeatedly said he has  never bet on baseball games. He also questioned the character and motives of  those who claim he did. "Well, it's nobody that's got any credibility," Rose  said.  </P> <P> Dowd has publicly called Rose's credibility into question, concluding that  evidence supports the accusations that Rose bet on his own team -- an offense  that carries a lifetime ban from baseball.  </P></p>

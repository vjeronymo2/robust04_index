			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / UK Company News: New billboard battle beckons after site buy  -Steven Watkins considers the consequences of the acquisition of Dolphin Media THE RECENT purchase by Mills &amp; Allen, Britain's largest roadside poster company, of the outdoor advertising division of Dolphin Media, a smaller competitor, registered in the Isle of Man, has raised yet again the question of whether the UK industry is concentrated in too few hands. The deal, completed last month, raised Mills &amp; Allen's share of the main UK billboard market - '48-sheet' advertising hoardings - to more than 39 per cent. Together the top two companies, Mills &amp; Allen and Arthur Maiden, control 65 per cent. The Office of Fair Trading has already begun to consider whether to recommend a Monopolies and Mergers Commission study of the concentrated market. It would be the MMC's third inquiry into the business in 10 years. With an estimated annual revenue of Pounds 110m, the market accounts for more than half the UK outdoor advertising spend. The last inquiry, completed in November 1987, occured because Mills &amp; Allen's share of the 48-sheet market reached approximately 40 per cent, following the acquisition of London Continental Advertising Holdings by its parent, then MAI, the diversified financial services company. That merger established Mills &amp; Allen as the only group able to offer national coverage from its own sites. The MMC found the concentration against the public interest, giving MAI sufficient market power to lift prices above competitive levels, especially in the case of nationwide advertising campaigns, and to reduce advertisers' freedom of choice. The MMC also concluded that MAI's predominance would have allowed it to 'inhibit the emergence of effective new competitors', by outbidding them in the acquisition of new sites and through the selective lowering of prices. Mr Peter Brown, managing director of Multimark, a small outdoor poster contractor which was active in the submission of evidence to the 1987 enquiry, was particularly upset by the implications of Mills &amp; Allen's latest acquisition. He claimed that the largest outdoor advertising firms employed a number of other anti-competitive practices, to the disadvantage of their smaller competitors. These allegedly included the use of 'onerous hidden contract clauses' to prevent the loss of leased poster sites to smaller competitors, and the manipulation of the Outdoor Advertising Association of Great Britain. The findings of the 1987 inquiry resulted in MAI being required to reduce within 12 months its share of the national 48-sheet market to 34 per cent. Other poster groups have since assumed this to be the maximum permissible for a single company. The ruling required MAI to dispose of some 2,000 48-sheet poster sites, with no repurchase for four years. In November 1988 Dolphin took the opportunity of purchasing 1,868 48-sheet billboards from MAI, as part of an expansion drive which had earned it third position in the market by 1990. Dolphin subsequently fell on hard times, giving Mills &amp; Allen the chance to buy its billboard division. The deal included 1,500 sites the MMC had earlier required it to sell. However in July 1989 MAI sold Mills &amp; Allen to Avenir Havas Media, a French company which is Europe's largest outdoor advertising group, in exchange for an equity stake. MAI now holds about 15 per cent of Avenir Havas, exempting the group from any of MAI's 1987 MMC undertakings, said Mr Philippe Santini, Mills &amp; Allen's chief executive. The Dolphin acquisition is therefore being treated by the OFT as a fresh case, which particularly upset Multimark's Mr Brown. In representations to the OFT, Multimark and other parties opposed to the acquisition, are likely to emphasise the similarities between the situation found to operate against the public interest by the MMC in 1987, and the present state of the 48-sheet market, with its alleged malpractices by larger firms. Mr Santini, however, emphasised that the situation was the unexpected outcome of his company's involvement in a financial rescue package that was being prepared for Dolphin's outdoor interests. Having expanded rapidly at a time of downturn in the advertising industry, Dolphin Outdoor hit financial difficulty. It was negotiating a partnership in which Mills &amp; Allen would take a minority stake, rising to 51 per cent over two years. When other backers withdrew last April, Mills &amp; Allen stepped in to save the group from receivership, in a deal involving Pounds 3.48m cash, a substantial working capital injection and the acceptance of liability for Dolphin Outdoor's debts. Mills &amp; Allen added that the market had developed significantly in recent years. Mr Santini argued that nationwide 48-sheet poster companies now faced more competition within the outdoor market, for example from strong regional contractors and the widespread, though smaller, illuminated boards. Mr Santini also said that the outdoor advertising industry now needed large, nationwide poster companies which could provide a complete marketing service to compete with other media. Mills &amp; Allen had lead efforts to develop the industry, he said, investing about Pounds 700,000 this year in such innovations as its 'Twins' campaigns, where a pair of advertisements are run on adjacent billboards and the computer mapping of poster sites. What view the industry, and the OFT, eventually takes of the Dolphin acquisition will depend upon its finer details, which have yet to emerge. However Mills &amp; Allen has sought to pre-empt widespread criticism, by writing to concerned parties, explaining its strategy and what it sees as future opportunities for the industry. Moreover, Mills &amp; Allen was 'prepared to give undertakings,' to advertisers, said Mr Santini.</p>

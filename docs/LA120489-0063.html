			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METER MAD;  </P> <P> HE BEAT A TICKET -- NOW HE'S TRYING TO BEAT THE SYSTEM  </P> <P> Bill Stamps got moving when he received a ticket for parking outside his  Hollywood home six months ago.  </P> <P> He went to court to beat the ticket. Then he went to work to beat the system.  </P> <P> Stamps formed The People for Parking Rights, a group he hopes will someday  force Los Angeles' army of parking enforcement officers into retreat.  </P> <P> "The system now is a sham," said the semi-retired plumber. "They're just  extorting money out of citizens. They write parking tickets knowing they won't  hold up in court. They know you won't take time to fight the ticket -- they  count on you paying."  </P> <P> That charge is denied by city parking officials, who are the traditional  targets of motorists angered to find their cars ticketed or towed from streets  around the city. Officials say they encourage drivers who feel they have been  wronged to take their cases to court. Those who prefer not to take that step  are encouraged to promptly pay their fines.  </P> <P> At $13, $23, $28 and $53 a clip, thousands of motorists have done just that  each day. And as of last week, fees in three of those categories became even  more costly. Mayor Tom Bradley announced last Friday that bails for meter  violations have been increased from $13 to $18, red zone violations from $28 to  $53 and handicap zone offenses from $53 to $103.  </P> <P> About 4.5 million parking violation notices will have been slapped on  windshields in 1989 by the city's 564 gray-uniformed parking enforcement  officers, municipal officials estimate. The city will end up collecting about 3  million of those tickets from motorists, who will have paid about $100 million  in fines -- bails that are legally forfeited when they opt not to show up in  court to contest their citations.  </P> <P> Recipients of about 60,000 of this year's tickets will have tried to fight  their citations in Municipal Court, officials say. Statistics indicate that  only about 34% of them will be winners. Many win their cases only because the  roving parking officers who write their citations fail to appear in court to  testify on the scheduled trial day. When that happens, tickets are  automatically dismissed and bail money is refunded.  </P> <P> That's what happened to the ticket tucked under the windshield wiper on Bill  Stamps' 1972 Ford Falcon van one Friday morning last May.  </P> <P> Because of street sweeping, parking is prohibited Thursday mornings on one side  of Mariposa Avenue and Friday mornings on the other. Stamps said his truck was  legally parked on the Thursday side when it was ticketed.  </P> <P> Although Stamps said he has often been rankled by parking tickets, his alleged  street-sweeping violation was particularly irksome. "I wanted to confront the  people who accused me," he said. "I never had that opportunity. I never got my  due process."  </P> <P> The result was The People for Parking Rights. The organization has had a modest  send-off since then. Stamps and his friends have tacked small notices to  bulletin boards at schools and supermarkets seeking people who feel  "victimized" by parking tickets.  </P> <P> Those who call are asked to write "paid under protest" on checks sent to the  city to cover their fines. They are instructed to send photocopies of both the  check and the ticket to The People for Parking Rights.  </P> <P> So far, about 150 drivers have done just that, Stamps said. The group has about  30 active members who pay no dues but volunteer their services for typing and  announcement-posting. When the group gathers 1,000 of the photocopies, Stamps  said, he plans to approach the Los Angeles City Council to demand parking  enforcement reforms.  </P> <P> For starters, Stamps said, the fledgling organization wants an end to the  "stacking" of parking regulation signs that cause confusion by listing  conflicting restrictions. They also want parking officers to use official time  stamps on tickets -- particularly those written for parking meter violations.  Such items, Stamps said, would keep officers from writing violations before  drivers have a chance to hurry out and feed their meters.  </P> <P> The group is seeking a new system of administrative hearings instead of court  trials for drivers who want to dispute tickets. And they want the current bail  requirement dropped, with drivers released on their own recognizance -- without  paying fines -- while they protest their citations.  </P> <P> Parking officials say all of those demands are either unnecessary or  unworkable.  </P> <P> Robert R. Yates, the city's parking administrator, who has listened to more  than his share of grumbling from irate drivers, said he has never heard of The  People for Parking Rights. He disputed suggestions that parking enforcement  procedures need to be overhauled.  </P> <P> Yates said the city Department of Transportation already uses administrative  hearings to referee some parking disputes. He said the city has also set up  three locations where drivers can be relieved from paying bail by signing a  form promising to appear in court.  </P> <P> According to Yates, no synchronized and non-adjustable portable time stamp  exists that could be used on current ticket forms. But he said his officers may  soon test an electronic ticket writer that will print out the time, along with  other details of alleged infractions, on a computerized citation.  </P> <P> Yates acknowledged that seemingly contradictory parking signs posted on some  streets can be confusing. But there is no way, he said, to list such things as  street sweeping times, tow-away warnings or special neighborhood parking  restrictions on a single sign.  </P> <P> Stamps said that additional parking enforcement changes will be proposed as his  organization grows. Members predict there will be no shortage of suggestions.  </P> <P> Los Angeles taxi driver Larry Shorts is upset that cabbies receive $53 tickets  for discharging passengers in a rush hour no-stopping zone in front of the  downtown Greyhound bus station. He said it is dangerous to make fares walk any  distance along Skid Row with their luggage.  </P> <P> A similar case, heard last week at the Los Angeles Traffic Court on South Hill  Street, showed just how far parking enforcement officials and aggrieved  motorists may have to go before they make peace.  </P> <P> The parking squabble started on the street next to the Hollywood Bowl four  months ago, ending last Wednesday in a hallway next to the courthouse elevator  after limousine driver Dayna Campo was found guilty of stopping in a  no-stopping zone on Highland Avenue by Acting Judge Douglas W. Weitzman.  </P> <P> In court, Campo, a Torrance resident, asserted that she was traveling about 1  m.p.h. outside a Rod Stewart concert when parking enforcement Officer Jerry  Dodd improperly ticketed her July 31. Dodd argued that Campo was stopped among  a cluster of double-parked limos on the street.  </P> <P> After Weitzman assessed a reduced fine of $28 and promised that the rest of  Campo's $53 bail would be refunded, the two left the courtroom, continuing  their debate by the elevator.  </P> <P> They both got in the last word as they climbed into separate elevators.  </P> <P> "I was moving," said Campo. "She was stopped," said Dodd.  </P></p>

The exercises are expected to be held for a week on Russian  territory, with the participation of a few units belonging to  land troops, ITAR-TASS learned from a well-informed source in  the Russian Defense Ministry today.    The possibility of conducting joint military exercises was  discussed last year during a working meeting between Russian and  U.S. defense Ministers in Bavaria in summer, and during the  visit by the Russian defense minister to the United States in  autumn. A final agreement on joint exercises was reached at the  January U.S.- Russian summit in Moscow.</p>

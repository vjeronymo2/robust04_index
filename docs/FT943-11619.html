			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Management: Insider on the outside - Otto Lambsdorff explains his zeal for reform of German boardrooms to Michael Lindemann and David Waller Otto Lambsdorff has every reason to feel dejected. For 20 years he has campaigned to shake up the boardrooms of leading German companies and to disentangle the complicated web of cross-shareholdings that dominate and - critics argue - deaden the German economy. On the face of it, Lambsdorff, economics spokesman for the Free Democratic Party and chairman of DSW, Germany's largest small shareholder association, has had little success. Large-scale cross-shareholdings remain the norm in German industry, preventing hostile takeovers and stunting the growth of the stock market which is playing an increasingly important role in other leading economies worldwide. The 67-year-old, who was economics minister from 1974 to 1984, remains undaunted. His campaigning has earned him a reputation as one of the most eloquent speakers on the workings of the German economy and he is convinced that he is making inroads. He points out, for instance, that a new law will oblige banks and companies to declare any shareholdings above 5 per cent that they hold in other companies. But Lambsdorff wants to go further. Cross-ownership of the sort that exists in Germany is forbidden in many countries and, while achieving a similar ban may be impossible, more must be done to reduce the web. 'If you look at what the big German banks, taken together, control - the shareholdings themselves, the supervisory board seats, the proxy voting rights - then it amounts to a concentration of economic power and influence which is largely beyond the reach of any outside control and which can lead to dangerous developments and abuse of power,' Lambsdorff says. His favourite bugbear is Westdeutsche Landesbank, the state-owned Dusseldorf-based bank, which Lambsdorff says calls the tune in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. He singles it out as a particularly offensive example of a state-owned institution where there is an all too cosy relationship between the state's Social Democratic government, the Federation of German Unions and local industry. 'They buy shareholdings in industry the way other people collect pictures or stamps,' he says. The recent near collapse of Metallgesellschaft, the metals, mining and industrial group, is a good example of how the banks, with their large stakes in the company and their positions on the group's supervisory board, were unable to prevent a debacle, he says. The Frankfurt-based group lost DM1.9bn (Pounds 780m) to end-September 1993 and warned it will lose a similar amount for the 1994 financial year, its losses triggered by speculative trading in the US oil futures markets. It is in the throes of a drastic restructuring which involves cutting the workforce to one-third of the 60,000 people employed 18 months ago. The reorganised group will have turnover of DM14bn, little more than half last year's levels. Lambsdorff is dismissive of the big German banks' claims that they have provided a heroic service to the German economy by rescuing Metallgesellschaft (they were the biggest contributors to the DM3.4bn rescue package agreed in January). 'The mistake was not in the way that the group was rescued - but rather that one allowed the situation to arise. First you drive the car against the wall and then you hope to rescue your reputation by going to a good garage.' Other recent cases, including the Jurgen Schneider bankruptcy and alleged fraud at Balsam, a German sports-floorings manufacturer, and Procedo, the biggest factoring company in Germany and biggest creditor to Balsam, reflect bad management at the banks, Lambsdorff says. 'A series of large bankruptcies like this damages the reputation of the German banks on the international capital markets,' he warns. The second Finanz-marktforderungsgesetz, or financial markets promotion law, which is set to come into force next week, may do something to redress the imbalance by making the corporate landscape more transparent, Lambsdorff argues. For example, companies will be forced to declare any shareholdings in other companies once they exceed 5 per cent, an improvement on the previous 25 per cent threshold. Supervisory boards - the non-executive bodies made up of shareholders and workers' representatives - also need reform if they are to play a useful role, he says. In 1965 a law limited the number of supervisory boards an individual could sit on. Now, Lambsdorff argues, it is necessary to limit the size of the supervisory boards. Some of Germany's largest company boards - such as Volkswagen, where Lambsdorff is a supervisory board member - have 20 members, making them unwieldy. Critics allege that membership is often based less on professional competence than on political favouritism, while the annual fees paid to supervisory board members (average DM8,000) are too low to provide incentive for full involvement. Supervisory board members need more direct contact with company accountants and the accountants should have extensive powers to sit in at important company meetings, he argues. Current arrangements mean that contact between the two parties is channelled through the company management - the people the supervisory board is there to oversee. Some argue that Lambsdorff may not be an ideal campaigner for the reform of supervisory boards. He sits on eight belonging to larger, listed companies and on a host of other smaller ones. He replies: 'I'm an insider critic. That makes me even more difficult for them.'</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (7): The alternative to cellular radio - Data on the move MOBILE communications are much in the news, particularly in the UK, following the launch of Mercury's One-2-One PCN service and the subsequent tariff and publicity battle with Vodafone and Cellnet. The productivity benefits gained by equipping key staff with cellular phones are widely appreciated. Less well understood are the advantages of a more mature communications technology - radio paging. Cellular radio is widely perceived as innovative and dynamic, whereas paging is seen as yesterday's technology. In reality, paging is a highly efficient one-way messaging service and can be a cost-effective addition to a company's communications portfolio. Investment in terminals is low, prices are fixed and the service offers both national and international coverage. Yet, despite these advantages, European paging, when compared to the booming markets of the Far East and the USA, has exhibited slow growth over the last decade. Many observers lay the disappointing development of paging in Europe at the feet of the operators. Until recently there has been little competition with many countries having only a single monopoly operator. Tariffs have been high and the service offering was complex with multiple tariffs and zone structures. Paging was treated as a 'cash cow' by operators who were reluctant to invest in new technology or undertake innovative approaches to market. According to Nigel Salomon of new market entrant Hutchison Paging: 'Paging in the UK is an under-rated technology - in the past it has been over-priced, too complicated and too inaccessible to potential users.' However, significant changes are taking place and paging looks set to experience substantial growth through to the end of the decade. New technology such as satellite links are improving the service with single national zones and lower tariffs being introduced. New market sectors are being opened up with the launch of specialist information networks such as Hutchison's Pulse financial data service. Some of the leading UK operators have amalgamated and new players such as Hutchison are developing new and innovative approaches to the market. According to Hutchison Paging's managing director, Mike Bowerman: 'There will be significant market growth for a service that has so far been under-estimated. The potential exists to more than double the market by the year 2000.' THE NEXT STEP:  GLOBAL PAGING One of the factors which may stimulate paging growth is its European and international dimension. Like the digital cellular service GSM, international roaming is becoming a feature of paging networks. Hutchison operates the UK end of Euromessage, a service provided by a consortium of European paging operators, which allows users to be paged when travelling in France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain. Over the next two to three years, the pan-European paging standard ERMES will be rolled out, offering a complete European roaming service for paging customers. The next step forward will be global paging. The International Maritime Satellite Organisation INMARSAT, will be using its network of geostationary satellites to provide a global paging service. Targeted at the international business traveller, the service will be launched in the second half of 1994 and INMARSAT is forecasting 250,000-500,000 users within six years. At least four manufacturers will be offering alphanumeric pagers linked to the INMARSAT service. Radio paging has the disadvantages of being a one-way service, limited in the amount of data that it can carry. These factors, together with the growth in the portable computer market, have created a demand for more flexible and powerful mobile data communications systems. Mobile data was widely forecast to be a booming market but the market has been slow to develop. In the UK, excluding Cognito's specialised two-way paging service, only RAM Mobile Data is active. There is general agreement that the mobile data market has long term potential. PA Consultants forecasts a UK market of 2m by the year 2000 and Arthur D. Little has identified 3.8m potential customers in the US. However, as Jonathan Tarlin of communications consultants EMCI points out, the demand for mobile data has so far been unimpressive - 'customer acceptance of mobile data solutions is relatively low due to the inability of operators to effectively communicate and market the benefits of mobile data, relative to the costs involved. The multiple standards used by European networks has also restricted the growth of the marketplace and prevented manufacturers from reaching economies of scale through mass production.' John E. Jarvis, chief executive of RAM Mobile Data, concedes that there have been problems in the past but is convinced that the market is now ready for lift-off - 'you need five things to be right before you can achieve successful market penetration: you need coverage, you need mobile applications on host computers, you must have hardware and software connectivity tools, hardware prices must be right and the distribution channels must be in place. 'These major market inhibitors are now behind us and we can concentrate on capitalising on the opportunities that are available. I strongly believe that all the bits are falling into place. We have already scored some notable successes and this stimulates the market.' One of the developments likely to affect both paging and mobile data is the rollout of digital cellular networks. The European GSM system, for instance, offers both advanced data transmission capabilities and the Short Message Service (SMS) which provides a two-way text messaging service. Ian Germer of Vodata sees GSM as being a great liberator for potential users of mobile data - 'GSM makes entry into mobile data much easier for the customer. In the past, mobile data was hard to use, involved lots of extra wires and boxes, had poor coverage, was expensive and unreliable. All that has changed with GSM, so it lifts away a lot of the barriers that have kept people out of mobile data.'</p>

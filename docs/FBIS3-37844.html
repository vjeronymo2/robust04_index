He believes this international  peace summit might result in signing a document "which would be  of historic importance and help cease bloodshed in Yugoslavia".    The necessary premises have been already created. "The  European peace plan" to settle the crisis in former Yugoslavia,  which was discussed at yesterday's meeting of senior diplomats  from Russia, the United States, "the European trio", NATO, and  the United Nations in Bonn, is based to a great extent on  Russia's concept of stabilizing the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Russian peace initiatives made it  possible to stop bloodshed in Sarajevo, to avert the NATO  threatened air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions and to  take a small first step towards a final peace agreement between  the three warring factions in Bosnia. The major success of  Russia's foreign policy revealed the ineffectiveness of the  "tough ultimatum" stand taken by Western countries.    The developments of the past few days have proved there is  no  need to resort to ultimatums for extending "peace dynamics" from  the Bosnian capital to other zones of military actions. The  Russian initiative displayed other possibilities of solving such  problems, which can presently be exploited to open the Tuzla  airport and to relieve Dutch peacekeepers in Srebrenica.    The latest events in Bosnia showed that Russia should be  actively involved in the Balkan peace process. The world  community is gradually coming to understand this. Thus, British  Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Douglas  Hurd admitted in today's interview with the French newspaper LE  FIGARO that the international community's first successful step  towards a peaceful solution in Sarajevo had been to a  considerable degree due to Russia's positive initiative. And  one of the lessons to be learned by Western countries from the  latest developments is that they should always inform Russia  about measures they are going to take for settling the conflict,  Mr. Hurd noted.</p>

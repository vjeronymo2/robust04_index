			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Keiji Kobayashi, AERA editorial staff member: </F> "President Kim Il-song and Secretary Kim Chong-il: Father Begins  To Restrain His Son"]    [Text] In April this year, President Kim Il-song of the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea invited a number of  Western journalists to Pyongyang. It was a publicity campaign  aimed at the outside world, personally staged by the president  himself. To the question: "How are you going to settle the  nuclear issue?" put by one of the guests, Ms. Mun Myong-ja, a  Korean-American journalist, President Kim replied:    "So far, we have made all kinds of proposals and let them  see  all that has to be seen for settlement of the nuclear problem.  In spite of this, throwing doubt on us is what matters. This  time, the Western mass media including CNN has come to report on  us, and I have instructed: `Let them take pictures and see all  that they want to.' My instruction is intended to enable them  to come to understand the realities by themselves, by letting  many people see our situation as it is."    At the same time, he expressed a strong distrust of the IAEA  (International Atomic Energy Agency) saying: "When we let them  -- the IAEA -- see what they want to, they then say they are  suspicious of other places and so we let them see those. Then,  they continue to take the attitude that they are suspicious  about still other places. They are suspicious about a military  base, but military facilities are a different matter, having  nothing to with IAEA inspections."    Ms. Mun is one of the few journalists who has been able to  meet President Kim personally. In Tokyo on her way home, she  gave a Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter her impression: "Though it  may not be simple, the issue seems to be heading toward  solution."  <H5>  Young Leadership Feared To Have Gone Its Own Way on Nuclear </H5> Development    On 13 June, less than two months after the meeting, the DPRK  abruptly announced its intention to "withdraw from the IAEA."    It was made immediately before announcement of the schedule  for the third round of high-level talks between the United  States and the DPRK; and as the result of the DPRK's unilateral  replacement of fuel rods without IAEA's inspectors on hand -- an  act apparently intended to "destroy the talks."    The DPRK Foreign Ministry announcement of the intended  withdrawal said: "We absolutely cannot permit any unjustifiable  inspections, until such time we decide on whether we either  return to or withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  (NPT)." Though the DPRK withheld the decision on whether it  will withdraw from the NPT, most specialists conclude: "Thus it  became impossible to verify how much plutonium the DPRK had  extracted." There is a big discrepancy between President Kim's  reply to the journalist and the recent DPRK decision.    The IAEA's presence at the scene of nuclear fuel rod  replacements does not constitute an entry into a military  facility; it is a routine inspection activity. Why then, did  the DPRK refuse this at the sacrifice of the "U.S.-DPRK  high-level talks," which the DPRK so ardently wishes to hold?    The first conceivable reason is to "conceal the plutonium."    The DPRK has insisted it processed "a very small quantity of  plutonium" only once in 1990.    But, from what has been detected by satellite photographs,  the IAEA suspects the DPRK processed a considerable amount  (several kilograms) of plutonium when it ceased operations of  the experimental reactor for more than one month in 1989.  Special inspections were requested to resolve these suspicions.    The year 1989 marked a period during which the DPRK felt a  sense of crisis about its own existence due to the collapse of  communism in the Soviet Union and East Europe, in contrast to  the Republic of Korea which was in high spirits after the  success of the Seoul Olympics the previous year. It is highly  conceivable that the younger generation of the DPRK leadership  headed by Secretary Kim Chong-il ordered the processing of  plutonium with the aim of developing nuclear weapons, without  consulting President Kim Il-song.  <H5>  The President Cannot Be Made a Liar </H5>   Meanwhile, President Kim Il-song has repeatedly declared:  "We have neither the intention nor the ability to build nuclear  weapons."    If, through inspections, the processing of plutonium turns  out to be true, the President will be made a liar, downgrading  his international dignity; severe punishment would await those  who had brought this about. So, it is presumed that the young  leadership decided not to allow this to happen at any cost, thus  deterring the inspections.    A businessman who recently visited Pyongyang does not deny  this possibility, saying: "Last year's report of good harvests  reflected a good harvest of rice in certain areas, despite the  reports of poor crops in the substantial staple food, corn, on  the east coast and other areas. Those close to the president  deleted the part on poor crops in their reports, giving him the  wrong impression that the whole country had a good crop. In  fact, it was only a little better than the year before last,  which was a lean year. It is said that the usual practice is  not to inform the president of anything bad."    In recent days, President Kim Il-song seems to be taking  measures to restrain Secretary Kim Chong-il's activities.    Late last year, the DPRK Government closed the so-called  "Room No. 39," the office overseeing consolidated business  enterprises [sogo kigyo] which served as a big source of income  for Secretary Kim Chong-il; and dismissed his confidant Choe  Su-gil, chairman of the board of directors of the Tae-song Bank,  from the responsible position as head of the Room. The Room had  a supralegal authority and was engaged in the amassment of  foreign money. Powerful enterprises such as Kumsan, which had  actually been managed by Secretary Kim's group, were put under  the cabinet's management. It was said these measures were taken  under the president's instructions and were intended to reform  the economic policy which had given priority to the party and  armed forces, and to make a good use of civilian vitality.    In an interview with the WASHINGTON TIMES in April,  President  Kim declared: "Secretary Kim's thought and guidance are  completely identical to mine," indicating the order of  succession was solid and firm. On the other hand, Kim Yong-ju,  his younger brother, was appointed to the post of  vice-president; and Kim Pyong-il, his second son, was recalled  from his newly appointed post as ambassador to Finland. These  actions were interpreted as signs of Kim Il- song's discontent  with the leadership of Secretary Kim Chong-il.  <H5>  The United States Wants To Prevent the DPRK's Withdrawal </H5> From the NPT Another factor contributing to the DPRK's  high-handedness is China's attitude.    Immediately before the announcement of the DPRK's intended  withdrawal from the IAEA, China extended an invitation to Choe  Kwang, the DPRK's chief of general staff. Chinese President  Jiang Jemin met and extended him a superlative welcome address:  "China and the DPRK are friendly neighbors with inseparable  relations like lips and teeth." This is a complete change from  the situation several years ago when it was said: "The DPRK is  no longer an ally."    Details of the talks were not made available but they were  presumed to have negotiated the supply of weaponry parts which  Russia had refused; military assistance in case of  contingencies; and the exercise of veto power when a resolution  on economic sanctions on the DPRK was presented before the UN  Security Council. A Chinese source in Tokyo assumed: "China has  probably responded favorably."    Although tensions have mounted on the Korean peninsula as  the  result of the DPRK's announcement of its intended withdrawal  from the IAEA, I do not see the danger of war breaking out as  long as President Kim personally takes command.    Even though the DPRK actually processed plutonium for  weapons  and continues to conceal the fact, the United States looks  likely to approve it. A U.S. expert on international affairs  close to the Department of State who visited Japan this spring  said: "Late last year, the Clinton administration decided on a  DPRK policy that viewed several kilograms of plutonium in the  DPRK as almost irrelevant to the U.S. security. What is  important is the maintenance of the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty (NPT). So it has probably been decided that efforts have  to be made to prevent the DPRK from quitting the NPT, with eyes  closed to bygone facts."    The DPRK is letting IAEA staff members stay on to watch the  replacement of fuel rods, despite the fact it has withdrawn from  the IAEA. A slight chance is still left for resumption of a  dialogue with the United States.</p>

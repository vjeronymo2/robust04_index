Toyoda, who is in Washington for the Japan-U.S. business  conference, said, "an excessive rise in the yen is not good."    "Lifting the yen is surely not the solution for all  problems," he said, disagreeing with the view that a rise in the  Japanese currency is the only way left to rectify Japan's trade  surplus with the United States.    He suggested that the monetary authorities should step in to  stop the dollar from falling further.    "There must be an appropriate level that reflects economic  fundamentals, and we should help the market get nearer that  level," Toyoda said.    In New York trading Monday the yen soared momentarily to  101.10 to the dollar, and in late trading stood at 102.15-25  yen, up 4.85 yen from the previous session.</p>

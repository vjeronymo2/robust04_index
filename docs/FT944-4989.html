			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: High-flyers of the wireless age Sir, The reference to radio licences in your Letters column (November 26-27) reminded me of the early days of wireless when my older brother, Bill Francey, then a schoolboy, applied for and obtained an experimental licence for reception and morse transmission for the sum of 10 shillings and sixpence. It was signed by an up-and-coming politician called J Ramsay MacDonald. My brother in the course of his experiments erected a 100ft aerial between our chimney and the flagpole of a nearby factory, an aerial which was responsible for the sudden death of many unsuspecting seagulls before my father made him dismantle it and re-erect it in our loft. Whether it was equally effective would be known only to my brother's fellow experimenter, a young chap who lived about 10 miles away, who had a great interest in flying and wanted to improve his morse proficiency. The young man's name was Jim Mollison. John B Francey, 59 Aytoun Drive, Erskine, Renfrewshire, PA8 6DD</p>

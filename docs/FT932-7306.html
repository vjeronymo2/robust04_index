			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Review makes China a most fazed nation - Beijing waits anxiously on Clinton trade move BEIJING will be monitoring signals from Washington this week with more than usually obsessive interest. A decision on its Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status is due by June 3. Also in the melting pot is the likely course of the broader Sino-US relationship during the Clinton administration. Chinese officials make no secret of their concerns that a narrow focus on issues surrounding renewal of China's MFN status - the principle of according equal conditions to all trade partners - at the expense of wider interests will deflect US policy makers from recognising what is at stake. 'We want to see more mutual confidence, less trouble, closer co-operation and no confrontation between us,' Mr Jiang Zemin, China's party boss, said at the weekend. Chinese officials have also been talking worriedly about what they perceive as a lack of direction in President Bill Clinton's foreign policy on such issues as Bosnia and international trade. They fear that China policy may also be prey to such a muddling approach, and differences on issues such as human rights and weapons transfers will prove more difficult to contain. In the meantime, China has made some limited gestures to appease its human rights critics in the US, such as releasing several relatively high-profile dissidents from jail early, which Americans cynically refer to as the annual MFN releases, and hinting at a willingness to do more without being specific. The process has taken on the aspect of a fairly unedifying shell game. China has also sought to address concerns about weapons transfers, assuring Mr Shimon Peres, the visiting Israeli foreign minister, that it was not selling missiles to either Iran or Syria. No mention was made of Pakistan, a recent recipient of Chinese missile technology and a country thought to have close defence links with Tehran. Beijing would be well aware that the US administration has not completed its review of China policy to guide Mr Clinton in his decision next week. He is universally expected to renew MFN for 1993-94, but what is at issue is whether he will at the same time announce conditions on renewal for the next year. If he does so, trade-related investment is likely to be affected immediately. If the Chinese were seeking clues to US thinking they might consider testimony given to the Senate foreign relations committee on March 31 by Mr Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs. 'Our policy challenge,' Mr Lord told senators, 'is to reconcile our need to deal with this important nation with our imperative to promote international values. We will seek co-operation with China on a range of issues. But Americans cannot forget Tiananmen Square.' It is stark observations such as this that make the US-China business community nervous, raising as they do the spectre of tougher and more specific conditions on renewal of MFN than the Chinese may be prepared to live with. Among the many provisions of a draft bill before the US Congress are: China should allow unrestricted emigration of political and religious prisoners; provide an acceptable accounting for and release of Chinese citizens detained, accused or sentenced as a result of non-violent expression of their political beliefs; and cease religious persecution in China and Tibet. In Beijing, attitudes within the US business and official community seem to range from optimism to a lingering dread that a distracted Washington may miscalculate. Mr John Hart, president of the American chamber of commerce, believes that continuing uncertainty over MFN is affecting trade relations and if it persists US business is in danger of being disadvantaged. 'We think it's a fairly high risk game they're playing,' Mr Hart observed. 'The biggest problem, as I see it, is the climate of uncertainty. The situation is much more difficult this year than last when we knew what the scenario was going to be.' Mr John Frisbie, director of the US-China Business Council, a lobby group representing US business interests in China, takes a more sanguine view. 'I don't expect Clinton to be extremely specific (on MFN conditions). Why would a president want to reduce his flexibility over a decision he is not obliged to make for a year.' The US-China Business Council has been at the forefront of lobbying efforts with the administration, arguing that trade with China has helped create 150,000 additional jobs in the US; and that the Chinese market with its insatiable demand for passenger aircraft is vital to the health of the American aerospace industry - an industry targeted for growth by Mr Clinton. 'This is not just American companies salivating over the China market,' Mr Frisbie said. 'The business presence here in all its forms has been the single most pervasive force for change in the past decade. To take that away would be counter-productive to the goals of those in Congress seeking to change China.' According to US figures, Chinese imports are Dollars 25.7bn (Pounds 16.6bn) and the US market accounts for 25 per cent of China's global exports. Removal of MFN preferences may cause a drop of as much as 10 per cent in China's export earnings. Previous articles on China's MFN status appeared on May 20 and May 22/23</p>

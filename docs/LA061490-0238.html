			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> ANOTHER SLICE OF 'AMERICAN PIE'  </P> <P> Not much has been heard from singer Don McLean since his big hit in 1971,  "American Pie," but he's working on a comeback. An album titled "Headroom" will  be released in the fall; it deals with topics ranging from kids watching too  much television to the public's embrace of style over substance.  </P> <P> After the short-lived success of "American Pie," McLean says he no longer wants  to be a star. "When you're really hot, it's dangerous," he said. "Back then, I  recall it being quite unpleasant. I didn't commit suicide and I didn't go into  bankruptcy, but it was quite a swim upstream until I got my bearing."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, he's pleased that he made his mark. "('American Pie' is) not just  another song I wrote, that's for sure," McLean said. "It's a folk song. It  belongs to the people. If children keep singing it, it will be around for ever,  long after I'm dead."  </P></p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Arts: Perth keeps its cool - A laid back festival down under 'Lionel Ritchie wrote this for me in memory of Marvin Gaye' - a kookaburra cackled mirthlessly from an awning gum tree. Has the great soul singer reincarnated as an Australian bird? Fanciful, but no less fanciful than watching the Queen of Motown flashing her Versace see-through al fresco in a winery in Western Australia. Each year the Leeuwin Estate goes black tie, jetting in a musical legend, perhaps Dame Kiri, perhaps Dionne Warwick, for a gala event which is filmed and then sold throughout the world. It is a wonderfully clever marketing ploy. The annual promotional budget for Leeuwin wines becomes self-liquidating. Diana Ross was vintage stuff. She shrugs off the Supremes early on in a medley; she mechanically airs the latest album; then actually tingles nerves with 'The man I love' sung straight to a jazz trio. But her biggest number these days is motherhood. After over 30 years and 50 albums the music has become routine; the buzz is from communion with the audience. Diana was soon thrusting deep into the real people at the sides, plucking out babies to croon over. As she brought us up to date with her family Ms Ross totally cracked the mystery of stardom. It was a double whammy - smoothly performed crooning by a natural woman. The Leeuwin concert coincides with the Perth Festival, a pleasantly low key event which for 40 years now has pepped up the pristine West Australian capital. Perth is a city remarkably at ease with itself and its Festival is especially laid back. There is the odd grumble that the over-lapping arts fest at Adelaide attracts most of the attention, but Perth sounds the right cultural notes - Sir Harrison Birtwistle was composer in residence - without trying the patience of the locals. This sang froid in a perfect climate was best shown in Perth's respectful interest in the French performance art troupe Ilotopie. They spent much of their time walking the streets like mechanical zombies dressed only in fluorescent body paint. For their performance in a shopping mall they douched each other in colourful blancmange. Congenitally impervious to this kind of thing, I admit to a frisson of excitement as the most virginal of brides, polyvinyled white to the tip of her bouquet, stood motionless in a cage while her jilted lover poured colourful slodge all over her from above. In Adelaide the city lived up to its Methodist roots by arresting two members of Ilotopie for immodesty. Even Cementville, performed by the Actors Theatre of Louisville, failed to shake Perth's good nature. This began sleazy and became progressively more squalid. Four women wrestlers slump into their rat infested locker room in Cementville, Tennessee, which is a dead ringer for Pittsville, Arizona. One has problems with drink; one with money; one with girl friends. The other is black, a big enough problem in Tennessee. None has problems talking dirty. There is something irresistibly visual about plays featuring women wrestlers: think of Trafford Tanzi. But there the actresses were ring wise; this bunch were unconvincing experts in the head butt or the half nelson. Writer Jane Martin enthusiastically throws in schlock after schlock, notably the Knockout Sisters, a tag team of druggies called in as crowd pleasers, whose mother herds them into the ring shouting 'Do it for the white trash'. What with a bitten off penis; a crushed pet dog; shootings and strips; drugs and dementia, Cementville has all the charm and delicacy of cock fighting in the back of beyond. And yet . . . it has a certain hysterical vivacity and with more confident actors would travel well. Australians are currently racked with guilt at the treatment of the Aboriginal peoples. There is one positive result - every encouragement is given to Aboriginal artists to reach an audience. The Perth based Black Swan Theatre asked one Aboriginal, Jack Davis, to write a loosely autobiographical play which is performed by another, Stephen Albert, and directed by a third, Andrew Ross. Wahngin Country, which translates as 'Talking Country', offers the insights of an Aboriginal vagrant. We meet him, literally, first waking up in the bushes in the campus of the University of West Australia and then follow him across its lawns to the bench where he passes the day. This is a monologue of the half life of the urbanised, culturally bereft, black man, accompanied by a plaintive didgeridoo. The trouble is that such a life is necessarily boring. His best friends, as he points out, are Johnny Walker, Jack Daniel and Jim Beam, his adventures as limited as his possibilities. Occasionally Davis allows his character to break into poetry and then you can catch the folk memories of a lost race. But Wahngin Country never quite becomes drama, staying an interesting diversion on a warm Australian night. On a modest budget, Perth provides a leisurely, civilised, arts festival. It loses some vivacity by hiving off its fringe, Artrage, to another part of the year, and although it makes obvious financial sense to share overseas arts troupes with Adelaide - 16 events featured at both festivals - it lessens its impact. But then Perth is quite happy to be the city apart, looking geographically and economically towards South-east Asia rather than the Pacific, certain that its well mannered rhythms of life are far preferable to the gaudy frenzy of distant Sydney.</p>

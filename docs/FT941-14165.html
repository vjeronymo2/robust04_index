			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Observer: Ageing well One award not mooted at yesterday's annual awards ceremony of The Oldie magazine was one for would-be author of the 'oldest proposed book yet to appear in print'. One candidate - alongside Sir Edward Heath, whose memoirs are in danger of being scooped by the public record office publishing under the 30-year rule - would be Oldie founding editor Richard Ingrams himself. He has just handed over the editorship to ex-Observer editor Donald Trelford so that he can try yet again to complete his long-awaited biography of one-time Punch editor Malcolm Muggeridge. Don't hold your breath.</p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Flexible working safeguards urged ANY workable model for full employment has to embrace the realities of Britain's increasingly flexible labour market, says Full Employment UK, the employment think tank. In its submission to the Commons employment committee's inquiry on full employment it says: 'It is becoming increasingly apparent that the familiar notions of a 'job for life' and 'employment security' are outmoded. Real security lies . . . in the acquisition of skills and training.' While other submissions have concentrated on macro-economic stimulus or employment subsidies, Full Employment UK advocates working with the grain of recent labour market trends. Labour market flexibility, the submission states, is bringing obvious advantages to the economy in the improved competitiveness of UK goods and services. But, it adds, there is a disadvantage of 'widespread job insecurity'. Arguing for 'security of employability', as opposed to security of employment with a particular company, Full Employment UK says that the government must back 'supported flexibility'. That means the state must underpin the workings of a flexible labour market by supporting people with 'individual-centred' provision. People need assistance to develop 'personal financial and self-investment' strategies to overcome the irregularities in income forced on them by flexible employment.</p>

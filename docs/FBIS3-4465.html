Thin-wall drilling bits and geological core-extracting  drilling bits made of this material have proved more efficient  and long- lasting than earlier types.    China produced monocrystal diamonds in 1963 and afterwards  took steps toward creating polycrystal ones, the MGMR said.    In 1991, the project to develop polycrystal diamonds was  listed as a major scientific project in the nation's Eighth  Five-Year Plan.    Diamonds are widely used in the fields of aviation and space  flight, machine processing, national defense science and  geological drilling.    Possession of diamonds has always been considered an  important factor in judging the industrialization of a country,  according to an official from the MGMR.    Natural diamonds are rare worldwide, with an annual output  of  400 million carats. The natural polycrystal diamond has only  been produced in Brazil, and it holds a value ten times that of  the monocrystal variety.</p>

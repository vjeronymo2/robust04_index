			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says if he has another  meeting with Yasir 'Arafat it will have to be carefully prepared  to ensure that it is not a failure like the last one. He told  reporters this morning Israel will stand firm on the issue of  the Qatif Bloc, in spite of the last minute demands of the  Palestinians in the Cairo talks. Our reporter Jack Katzenell  asked him if the talks were proceeding too slowly:    [Begin recording] [Rabin] There are differences of opinion,  but I believe that we will succeed to overcome the difficulties.  We are not expecting to achieve an agreement in few days, but  we have agreed to start building the nucleus of the Palestinian  police in two places in Gaza and in one place in Jericho. We  will do it gradually. We believe that it will allow -- once we  reach an agreement and sign it -- and help a more smooth hand  over of the responsibilities that will be transferred from the  Civil Administration and the military government to the  Palestinian authority.    [Katzenell] If Israel allows the Palestinians to deploy bit  by bit in this way, will it not in the end force our hand? Can  Israel hold the Palestinians to their promises about all the  limitations on the Palestinian police?    [Rabin] Well, I believe that the bringing of a few dozen  Palestinian police to these places -- to each one of them, every  one of them -- will not undermine our capability to reach the  agreement that we want, so that our vital interest will be  served.    [Katzenell] Is Israel standing firm on the issue of the  Qatif Bloc and the idea of its being one single bloc which the  Palestinian police cannot enter?    [Rabin] We signed an agreement in Cairo, including attached  maps. Of course, everything is dependent on the conclusion of  the agreement; but the maps were signed and we take them as they  signed as the basis for whatever will develop. [end recording]</p>

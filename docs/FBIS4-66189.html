			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Collection of essays: "An Investigative Report on China's </F> Surplus Rural Labor Force; Exploring the Sources, Part IV --  Shaking Up Life in the Countryside"]    [Text] Master of `House of Fury'--by reporter Lu  Yuegang [4151 6460 0474]    Normally, to gather news, one would go to the county or the  city first and ask the propaganda department people to escort  one to the countryside and ask the township cadres to give a  briefing and then let them make the arrangements and accompany  one to the villages. This time I skipped the above procedure and  went straight from Beijing to the most basic cells of the  Chinese society.    My arrival brings quite a bit of excitement to Huxia village  which normally leads a quiet life. Historically, no reporter has  ever patronized Huxia, let alone stayed for a whole week.    Compared to Huxia village's branch party secretary, Guanfu  village's secretary Fu Jiannian [0102 1696 1628] is more active,  hot-tempered, and outspoken. In seeing Du Shuiyuan, he ignored  the presence of other people and said, "Secretary Du, this year,  our per capita income will at most reach 700 yuan; we won't be  able to meet the 900-plus yuan goal." He has been village branch  secretary for only a year. It will not be wrong to say that he  fought and won the post of village branch secretary. At the  beginning, everybody was surprised. A capable man who had gone  out to do business and gotten rich in the construction business  has suddenly returned to hold a government post, and he even  told Du Shuiyuan that if he served, he wanted to be village  branch secretary in charge of the village.    I visited Zou Mugen's [6760 2606 2704] family in Huxia  village's Fujianao village. His eldest son and daughter work in  an electronics factory in Shenzhen. His son wrote home and ended  his letter with the words "bye-bye." His parents were shocked.  They asked me, "What does `bye-bye' mean?" Compared to the shock  the Guanfu villagers are experiencing, Zou Mugen's was nothing.    After wandering around for many years and having seen the  world, Fu Jianning returned to the village to be branch party  committee secretary. Du Shuiyuan asked about his plans. He said,  "Repair the roads, build a factory, and propagate scientific and  technological results." What upset the villagers most was that  the village had 776 people but only 580 mu of farm, but in one  stroke, he transformed 241 mu into a nursery to grow citrus  fruits, loquat, peaches, and other cash crops intermingled with  other grain crops. He said, "There is so little land, and if we  only plant grain, it won't even be enough to feed everybody."    The peasants did not understand. They fought their way to  his  house and yelled obscenities at him. He pretended that he didn't  hear them. Soon, he invited a scholar from town, and after three  rounds of drinks, he said, "Would you write something for me?"  "Write what?" "`House of Fury'" Bolstered by a few drinks, the  scholar took a giant pen and wrote on the white wall three big  one-meter-square characters.    "Why `House of Fury'?" I asked.    "Of course I have to accomplish something big here;  otherwise, why would I give up good money on the outside and  come back here to this poverty-stricken village to be a branch  secretary?" He said, "I'm not being arrogant, but there are too  few people like me in the villages."    Not long ago, he sent me a five-year-plan to change the face  of Guanfu village. He said that he would fulfill each and every  one of his plans.  <H5>  New Biographies of the Heroic Sons and Daughters--by </H5> reporter Mao Hao [3029 3185]    Upon entering Guozi village, the first thing that comes into  sight is a yet-unfinished, four-story building. Surrounded by  lower civilian homes, it stands like a crane among chickens.  This building which is built according to state specifications  and will soon have air-conditioners installed is the Yanlin  Elementary School, named after industrialist Liu Yanlin who  donated 400,000 yuan.    In Guangan county, everybody has heard of Liu Yanlin. At the  station, this reporter heard the driver talked about Boss Liu  getting a new car for the county mayor. In recent years, Liu has  given his village nearly a million yuan. In 1992, he paid to  repair the road that allowed farm machinery to move from his  house to the end of the village. In 1993, Guangan went to the  coastal areas to solicit business and investments. Liu indicated  that he was interested in investing 10 million in a joint  investment with the county to build the Guangfu building.    But Liu's mother thinks little of his son's success. "He is  in small business. His work is not as stable as yours. Out  there, he is like playing mahjong; he wins if he draws the right  tile, and someone else wins if he doesn't." We can't blame her.  In a traditional farming community, people have their own idea  of a hero. This reporter looked up Who's Who in the  Guangan County Annals. Many government officials' names are in  there, followed by those in scientific and technological fields,  and there are names of all kinds of skilled craftsmen, but under  industries, there is only Hu Zhongshi [5170 0112 1395].  Traditionally, people only admired those will exceptional  farming skills. The local people have a saying, "The business of  buying and selling is just like a flower that doesn't last. It  is the hoe that works the ground that yields the crop."    Liu's father was a typical country hero. He not only was a  successful farmer but he was honest, sincere, and never  offensive. When the younger Liu first revealed his rebellious  side, he took quite a few lashes from his father. The village  clan also rebuked him for being a bad son. He was not a bit like  his old man; he was superficial, and he ran around all day long  on his motorcycle (the kind pig-sellers ride), and hard on his  heels were a bunch of creditors. This was the impression Liu  Yanlin left behind when he took off. Liu simply could not stay  in that environment. He left home in 1991 with 9 yuan and 2 jiao  in his pocket.    "In 1985, Number Two Son came home and said he wanted to buy  a brick factory and borrow 5,000 yuan from the credit  cooperative. He took the note home, but neither his father nor I  dared to sign the note." Liu's mother recalled. "He got married  that year, and many people warned the girl against it, saying he  had several hundred thousand yuan's debt out there that he had  not paid off. Whoever married him would certain cry her eyes out  later."    Yet only a few years later, Liu came back to Guangan with  his  huge economic clout, and the succession of action he took  stirred the people of Guangan. They were forced to reassess him  and his flaws. Liu Yanlin's elementary school teacher, Liu  Huaifu [0491 0001 4395] had joined him a year earlier. He was  cautious in talking about Liu: "Liu Yanlin's greatest asset is  that he is bold; he is full of drive; he is never hesitant or  indecisive; he is never complacent or satisfied with what he  has." Teacher Liu has nothing but admiration for his former  student. "Only those who have been out and about can appreciate  that he deserves to get rich."    Indeed, Liu's success deeply affects the young people of  Guozi village. Today, any young person who has not traveled  around a bit will be considered a worthless wretch. In the last  few years, Guozi villagers have gone so far as the northeast and  Xinjiang, and there are scores of bosses with hundreds of  thousands of yuan in assets. At the village's elementary school,  I asked the children whom they admired most, and they answered  in one voice, "Liu Yanlin." At the end of 1993, even though  Liu's family had moved to Guangdong, he was still named first  among Guangan's top ten young people.  <H5>  The Same Eyes, But Shine Brighter--by reporter Sun Kai [1327 </H5> 0418]    Guo Sanhu [6753 0005 5706] who has been away doing small  business for seven-eight years said that having been away for a  few years and coming back today, one can see that there are more  and more ways to make money.    He said that in the days of the "Gang of Four," just that  little bit of land couldn't produce enough to keep people alive,  but they were still forced to remain on the farm and were not  allowed to leave. Every year, people looked forward to the day  they were paid dividends, but usually when that day came, they  not only did not get anything but found out that they actually  owed the brigade money. In the village some people smuggled  grain from Shaanxi and sold them in the village. The leaders  even led militiamen to the railway station to arrest them.  People not only did not have enough to eat, they couldn't even  afford to buy salt.    The truth is, what Guo Sanhu described was the history not  only of Xinzhuang village. It was the epitome of the by-gone  days for numerous villages in rural China.    Today, Xinzhuang's people have bid farewell to the poverty  of  yesterday. Going away has meant many new ways for the people to  make money.    The bright ones bring Gangu's chili noodles and Chinese  herbal medicine to the outside to be sold and shipped elsewhere  and do some small business while they are out there. The strong  ones make money in the construction teams. The old folks and the  women stay home to farm what little land there is. Those who  have been away and come back inevitably find many ways to make  money--women who stay home can process chili noodles and do some  embroidery work on the ready-made clothing they sell, or they  can work on the sweaters and so on and let other people take  them out and sell them. All these can bring substantial income.  Old people can set up a pingpong table, and each month they can  make more money than a department-level cadre.    Different types of peasants are finding different ways to  make money. Some of these money-making avenues have always been  there, but they were not discovered until people started going  out and their horizon began to broaden; others were created and  developed only after people gained mobility.    Mobility has allowed the peasants to make lots and lots of  money.    Mobility has allowed the people to look away from the land  and set their sights on the broad horizon yonder.    Mobility has changed the people's concept of wealth, which  is  far more valuable than just giving these peasants more money.  <H5>  Today One Realizes That Education Is Money--by reporter Dai </H5> Yuanzhi [2071 5913 2388]    A township enterprise in southern Jiangsu reaches across the  river to recruit workers. The test for the applicants is very  simple: Bring in a sewing machine and sew in the hidden pocket  below the waistline on the trousers, and then the applicant  leaves his or her name and identification card number. The  qualified workers show up for work with their ID cards.    More and more factories are hiring working boys and girls,  but they only hire the skilled ones.    There used to be a saying in Yancheng, "You can't pick up  pennies without bending down." It means if one is not willing to  work hard, one cannot make money.    And so everybody bend down to "scrap" money off the ground.  When they first arrived in town, they thought that physical  strength alone could earn them some money. But once they had to  work with machines, reality taught them that physical strengthen  alone was not enough; they needed technology and skill.    "Migatory bird," Liu Xunjun said, "This is known as `if you  ride other people's horse, you carry other people's gun'--you  work for other people and you learn their skills." Once, the  workshop contractor quietly sent him to Zhangjiagang's Chenghang  Township to work in a factory to install axles and repair cars  while the workshop director arranged to have someone else take  over his old job. He made money for the workshop, and so  besides his original wage and bonus, he also made extra money.  The other factory manager saw that he was a good technician and  kept him there and paid him 500 yuan a month.    Life has taught him that skill is money. Work is to earn  money, but without skills, there will be fewer job opportunities  and one would earn less. "With skills, the world opens up."    Yet, learning a skill is not easy. When Liu first arrived at  the Zhongshi Factory, he was assigned to sweep floors. He swept  floors while learning from the master craftsmen. He caught up  with some young men who had entered the plant before him and  borrowed such technical books as "1515 Loom Repair and  Maintenance Manual" and "1515 Multiple Shuttle Box  Maintenance Manual." Behind his back the plant's master  craftsmen said, "Let him read. He can't understand anyway."  Workers who came to the plant before him also asked him, "Can  you understand?"    Reading alone was not enough. When the looms broke down, he  took one look before the master craftsman came to repair it, and  he took another look after the repair, and after a few more  tries on his own, he began to figure things out.    Chen Chao [7115 6389] had a similar experience. After he  borrowed the book, he would "match everything by number" to the  machine according to the book. He looked at the machine and then  checked the flow chart and he clutched the books and let the  master craftsmen test him. But when repairing the machines, some  master craftsmen would send him away. Some would even warn him,  saying, "You don't know how to do it. Don't touch."    When the machines break down, repair work is the day shift  job. Chen Chao also wanted to try it. At the beginning, he was  scared, afraid that he could not do it and the master craftsman  would yell at him. So he read some books first and then thought  about what the master would do. When he really couldn't do it,  the next day he went to the master craftsman to apologize. The  teacher saw that he was willing to learn and did not give him a  hard time.    "Three months after I arrived, I was doing the day shift,  but  after dinner, I would also work the swing shift. I wanted to  learn to repair cone winders. Someone in that shift was also  from northern Jiangsu. He had been there for more than a year.  He told my master, `Don't let him come.' It turned out that this  man was negotiating with the unit, and he figured that if  someone else learned the skill, his deal with the unit would  fall through."    Today, in Chen Chao's factory dormitory, he still has  Cotton Spinning, Carding Machine Repair  Manual and other technical books by his bedside.    Lu Ningdong [4151 1380 2639] the "migratory bird" who worked  in a construction company and ended up losing his job also  worked hard to learn a skill, and ultimately he made good and  became the platform car brigade leader. The workshop director  even let him contract his work. He said after he began  contracting he wanted to quit two lowing-paying "basic jobs" in  the city, but the workshop supervisor would not let him and gave  him a 50-yuan-a-month raise instead. Of course with the raise  came more responsibilities. Without skill, how could he have  made an extra 50 yuan a month?    At the Xinsu Machinery Factory where Chen Liang [7115 0081]  works, the young men from Yangzhou's Tiaxing who are certified  technicians who have "fourth-level knowledge plus third-level  know-how" have a competitive edge over the young men from  Yancheng's Funing and are hot commodities in the factories.    Among the Funing youths, those who are smart already realize  that skill is money. When Chen Liang returned to the village, he  talked about a young "combination factory worker and peasant" in  his workshop who had once been "foolish": This young man asked  to extend his apprenticeship for another month so that he could  learn more from the master. The workship was fairly open-minded  and did not keep him to his quota for that month so that he  could fully learn his skills. Today, among the two groups of 80  young workers from Funing, the first 10 who passed the tests  have been upgraded by half a grade in pay by the factory.    After throwing away the scythe, if one truly wants to pick  up  the hammer, one must have skills. A Jiangsu Provincial Labor  Bureau official told me that today, Nantong has added an  educational course called "Employment Guide" for the graduating  middle and high school classes. This year. Jiangsu has handed  down its guidance-oriented plan to the labor exporting  localities asking them to provide training for 340,000 people.  <H5>  Looking Forward To Autumn In Spring--by reporter Liu Jian </H5> [0491 0256]    Forty-eight-year-old Liu Zaitian [0491 0961 3944] was  probably the youngest kid in Liujiaguanfang village to learn to  write with a brush. He is very smart, but unfortunately, he only  went as far as finishing elementary school. In 1977,  Heilongjiang Province's Qitaihe Mining Bureau was recruiting  many full-time miners. His older brother who had long planted  roots in Qitaihe asked someone to send in an application for  him, and when everything was arranged, he took off. A few years  later, his whole family moved to Qitaihe, and henceforth they  would no longer be Shandong people.    This is Liujiaguanfang's typical emigration story. Those who  have no luck will always come home no matter how long they have  been away. Those who come back are back, and those who come back  first should not regard those who come back later as  "extraterrestrials," and those who have just returned will get  rid of their little bit of northeastern accent after ten days or  half a month, and then basically they become "one of the crowd"  and go back to do what they have been doing all along.    As for people who had been away but have returned to the  village to hold government posts and change the village,  occasionally one may read about them in the newspaper in  Liujiaguanfang. The village's rule is that those who are village  cadres or have a chance of becoming village cadres obviously  will not go "wandering around," and generally speaking, those  who did go out have very little hope of returning to serve as  officials.    At first, many who left Liujiaguanfang did so because they  owed people money or were trying to stay out of debt. But this  situation no longer holds true today. Since 1992, young people  who have no debts and whose families are fairly well-off have  been leaving simply because they want to earn more money. When I  returned home to gather materials for this story, a fairly  well-off elderly lady in the village asked me to pull strings  for his son so he could get his driver's license, because the  line for driver's license examination was too long at the local  traffic police training center. Five or six young kids from the  village have already obtained their "driver's licenses" and have  gone to nearby Linyi and Rizhao to make money driving cars, and  some have even gone to Jiaodong Peninsula. They clearly make  more money than the others. They have not been gone for long,  and it is not likely that they will be returning home soon.    In a place like Liujiaguanfang, if one can find a job at a  state-owned or collective enterprise in the nearby towns and  townships, it is considered something to be proud of. This is  different from venturing out to the northeast. Anybody can get  out to the northeast, and anybody out there can find a job, good  or bad. But to be able to go to work in an enterprise or an  institution in the city, county, or even the township (even as a  driver) is something else. It requires pulling strings. Scarce  goods are always better. Even though one can clearly make more  money working in the northeast than at home, at home one does  not have to go down to the coal pits and suffer.    From the point of future impact on these small villages,  those who move about in nearby cities and towns will have  greater impact than those who venture out east of Shanhaiguan.  Almost 70 percent of those who go to the northeast end up in  Qitaihe, Shuangyashan, Jixi, Hegang, and Daxinganling and  Xiaoxinganling and other mining towns and forest areas to do  work that requires sheer physical labor. Shandong's workers have  little opportunity of getting into even construction work. Over  there, the civilian construction market belongs to the Jiangsu  people. That is why although they travel far, their horizon may  be broaden at most to the extent of knowing that at the end of  several thousand kilometers of railway line lies a mine or a  huge forest. Moreover, the northeast is a region with the oldest  tradition of planned economy.    The young people who do not stray too far from home are  different. Almost all of them are also engaged in physical  labor, but they are in Linyi, Rizhao, Jinan, Qingdao, and  Yantai, and they directly observe life in another world. They  are fully stimulated. When these people (and not those who  venture out to the northeast) decide to go back to the villages,  will they create a "revolution"?  <H5>  Appendix </H5>   Item/Village     Gansu:       Jiangxi:    Sichuan:    Jiangsu:    Shandong:  Name             Xinzhuang    Huxia       Guozi       Dagang      Liujiaguanfang                   village      village     village     village     village   per capita       (family of   (family     (family     (family     430 yuan  annual income    3) 480       of 4) -30   of 5) 650   of 4) 500  for household    yuan         yuan        yuan        yuan  without mobile  worker   per capita       (family of   (family     (family     (family     1,280 yuan  annual income    3) 1,440     of 4) 750   of 3) 980   of 3.5,  for household    yuan         yuan        yuan        paying  with one                                              half of  mobile worker                                         the                                                        mother's                                                        living                                                        expense)                                                        600 yuan   per capita       (family of   (family     (family     (family  annual income    5) 1,200     of 5) 900   of 3)       of 6) 920  for household    yuan         yuan        1,833       yuan  with two                                  yuan  mobile workers    per capita       (family of               (family  annual income    5) 1,920                 of 5)  for household    yua                      1,560  with three                                yuan  mobile workers    per capita       (family of               (family  annual income    5) 3,000                 of 2)  for household    yuan                     2,600  with all                                  yuan  mobile workers    (Note: One  sample only of  each category  from each of  the five  villages.

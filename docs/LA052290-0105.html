			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOURNERS PUT ON A HAPPY FACE FOR HENSON  </P> <P> There were happy songs, upbeat words, an overflow crowd of 5,000 and a gaggle  of Muppet pals at a memorial service Monday for Jim Henson.  </P> <P> Henson, who used the Muppets he created to entertain and educate children on  "Sesame Street" and elsewhere, died Wednesday of pneumonia.  </P> <P> He was 53.  </P> <P> Henson had written instructions for his funeral four years ago that were opened  after his death. He said he wanted the occasion to be a happy one and that  mourners should not wear black.  </P> <P> An old green coat emblazoned with a frog-shaped piece of scarlet cloth greeted  mourners as they entered the church. The coat symbolized one belonging to  Henson's mother, from which he was said to have cut material to make the  original Kermit the Frog.  </P> <P> With Big Bird and Harry Belafonte on hand, an organist began the service with a  rendition of the "Sesame Street" theme song, "Sunny Day."  </P> <P> Then the Dirty Dozen Dixieland band strolled in playing, "Please Release Me,"  followed by ministers, a red-and-white robed church choir and family members.  </P> <P> Mourners fluttered colorful butterflies atop metal stems as Belafonte and three  backup singers sang, "Turn the World Around," a song Belafonte wrote and Henson  used.  </P> <P> Big Bird, a character played by Carroll Spinney, sang, "It's Not Easy Being  Green," a number usually done by Kermit.  </P> <P> Afterward, Big Bird looked heavenward, said, "Thank you, Kermit," then slowly  walked away, head hung low.  </P></p>

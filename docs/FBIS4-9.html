			<p>Vladimir      Zhirinovskiy demonstrated his firm grip over the  ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) at the  party's 2 April congress, persuading the gathering to alter the  party's rules to formally give him virtually unchallengeable  powers.  Reportedly at his behest, the congress voted to extend  his powers as party chairman until 2004.  Previously the party  charter stipulated that the chairman's term lasted three years.  The congress also granted him the power to personally appoint and  dismiss members of the party's Supreme Council and to assume its  powers in the newly approved three-year interim between  congresses.  Previously, the Supreme Council and the chairman  "jointly" served as the LDPR's "supreme" governing body between  congresses, held on an annual basis.  Finally, the congress  confirmed Zhirinovskiy as the LDPR candidate in future  presidential elections (LDPR Press Release, December 1993; ITAR-  TASS, Interfax, 2 April).  The congress was extensively covered  by the independent news agency Interfax and the state-run ITAR-  TASS agency as well as the two main television news programs  "Vesti" and "Novosti" (ITAR-TASS, Interfax, Russian TV, Ostankino  TV, 2 April).     Although Zhirinovskiy now has the power single-handedly to expel  party members, the State Duma has so far thwarted his efforts to  introduce an amendment into its draft rules that would allow him  to expel party heretics from the LDPR's parliamentary faction and  replace them with loyalists.  Known as the "imperative mandate,"  this rule would allow parties to take away a rebellious deputy's  credentials and substitute the next member on the party's  election list (ITAR-TASS, 18 March).  Zhirinovskiy has proposed  the imperative mandate amendment for adoption at least twice in  the Duma, prompted by high-level defections from the LDPR in mid-  February.  At that time deputies Viktor Kobelev, the party's  administrator, and Aleksandr Pronin, a leading official in the  LDPR's Moscow organization, announced their resignation from the  party after denouncing Zhirinovskiy's extremist foreign policy  statements (Trends of 16 February 1994, page 33).  More recently,  Vyacheslav Marychev--the party's number two candidate on its  election list behind Kobelev and a highly visible deputy in the  Duma--announced that he had been expelled from the LDPR because  of his opposition to the imperative mandate (Interfax, 4 April).

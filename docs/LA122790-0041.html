He doesn't  exercise.  </P> <P> And all that stressful crimefighting has taken its toll. Gotham City's  Commissioner Gordon has a massive heart attack in an issue of Batman comics on  sale now. The storyline is a joint effort between DC Comics, the publisher of  Batman, and the American Heart Assn. to educate the public about heart disease.  In addition, public service advertising about heart disease, featuring the  character of the commissioner, will appear in other DC comic books this month.  Will Gordon recover? The heart attack saga will continue in Batman over the  next few years. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

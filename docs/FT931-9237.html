			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Level of executive pay-offs declines EXECUTIVES made redundant last year could expect to receive pay-offs equivalent to 89 per cent of one month's salary for every year of service, according to Drake Beam Morin, outplacement consultants. This was down from 93 per cent of a month's salary for each year in 1991, and a 13 percentage point drop since 1989 when the average payment was 102 per cent of a month's pay. For an executive earning Pounds 40,000 with 10 years' service, this is a fall of just under Pounds 5,000 in the final sum. Mr Peter Trigg, managing director of the consultants, said the reduction in redundancy packages was part of overall cost-cutting by companies. Even so, UK executives were considerably better off than many of their Continental and US colleagues, he said. Executives in Finland, Germany and the US are paid about two weeks salary for each year of service.</p>

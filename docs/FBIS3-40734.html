			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Bassam Abu-Sharif by Najm 'Abd-al-Karim; </F> place and date not given]    [Text] Bassam Abu-Sharif, who now serves as personal  advisor to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, may seem to be a  contradictory figure when we review his history. He began his  career in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine with  George Habash, the faction that the farthest to the extreme left  in order to restore Palestinian rights. He dealt with and  struggled with its slogans and ambitions and nearly paid the  price of his life. Through his confrontation with the Arab and  western press and media, however, he learned the difference  between slogans and reality, between politics and dreams.    Al-Sadat and his peace with Israel were a reality the day  Bassam Abu-Sharif shook his hand; he was disqualified from the  Popular Front and joined 'Arafat's wing, believing in the steps  that 'Arafat would take towards peace.    There is a great controversy over Bassam Abu-Sharif: the  puzzles, quotations, and contradictions. In its interview with  him, AL-MAJALLAH tried to shed light on the puzzle and the  contradictions.    ['Abd-al-Karim] We often listen to your fiery statements,  then find PLO Chief Yasir 'Arafat and other senior PLO members  denying them, some saying that these views do not represent the  organization. A short time later we discover that what you said  was true, and that it is as if their denial never was. Are these  the roles you are assigned? You make a statement, they deny it,  then they accept what you said?    [Abu-Sharif] You have answered your own question. Media work  and credibility are a sensitive and delicate balance, and it  does not come in a night or an afternoon. Credibility is built  over years, by relying on the truth that one says, and one does  not necessarily say everything.    I built my media credibility by telling the truth, but not,  as I said, the whole truth. A media person does not say anything  erroneous, because that hurts his credibility, and I built this  credibility over the years, especially with the global media and  the wire agencies.    It has been proved to everyone, despite all the denials,  that  what I was saying was the truth.    ['Abd-al-Karim] Why did the PLO recently issue a statement  that made it sound as though you were being thrown out?    [Abu-Sharif] I don't know what statement you're talking  about. I haven't read any statement criticizing me. What has  come up recently are the rumors of the media services because of  the phone lines being cut in my office. I am telling the truth  when I say that the sole, solitary reason for the cutting of the  phone lines is that we had no money to pay the phone bills.    ['Abd-al-Karim] Some people see this matter of not paying  those bills as an excuse, and say that it was the PLO that cut  off your lines, to say that Bassam Abu-Sharif has nothing to do  with the organization, and so may not speak in its name.    [Abu-Sharif] That is not true. The reason for cutting off  the  lines was lack of money. In spite of all that has been said in  the press, these were the bills for the past four years. They  piled up, and the telephone company moved slowly, though now it  has cut off the lines, just as they cut off other lines in Tunis  because the bills were not paid. I would like these lines to be  restored at the first possible opportunity.    ['Abd-al-Karim] Including 'Adnan Yasin's--which was open to  the Mosad (the Israeli intelligence agency)?    [Abu-Sharif] Well ...    ['Abd-al-Karim] Can we talk about it?    [Abu-Sharif] Telephone lines!    ['Abd-al-Karim] Not 'Adnan Yasin's open lines to the Mosad?    [Abu-Sharif] The story of 'Adnan Yasin should not be either  minimized or exaggerated. Not minimizing this story is that it  is a gravely serious matter, as 'Adnan Yasin held a post that  enabled him to be in contact with all members of the leadership,  to go into any office, and look into many matters. I believe the  Palestinian leadership is now in the process of interrogating  him and opening files that could lead to heads rolling! I don't  know what has gone on in Tunis in recent days, but I believe  that President Yasir 'Arafat has formed an investigative  committee with honest people to clear up the matter  <H5>  Al-Hasan and Qari' </H5>   ['Abd-al-Karim] What is the meaning of Hani al-Hasan's being  appointed to post belonging to Qari', and making four official  trips with President 'Arafat? He is the one who made the  decision to expel him from the Executive Committee after going  to Damascus and agreeing with ten organizations to adopt a stand  against the agreement. How do you explain this move? How do you  put it in perspective? Were these assigned roles too?    [Abu-Sharif] The perspective is simple: this is Palestinian  democracy. The views of the minority are respected, and no  decisions are made against them, against the minority, depriving  them of their jobs. After the decision was made to sign the  agreement, President Yasir 'Arafat asked everyone, whether  dissidents or supporters of the move, to enact this agreement  and proceed on the road to peace.    Hani al-Hasan is a member of the Palestinian organizational  and legislative institutions, and a member of the Central  Committee of Fatah; he has an active role. As to his being  appointed chief of the negotiating team in the multinational  talks, this is a sign that Hani al-Hasan, despite his dissident  stance, has embarked on action to get the agreement enacted.    ['Abd-al-Karim] I think the Palestinian democracy you are  talking about is different from the political corridors, which  go on in their normal fashion. There are those who talk about  you yourself, when you were a member of the Popular Front, and  when you suddenly joined the ranks of President 'Arafat. We  don't know why you made the move: was it ideological, or was it  a search for a niche for yourself? How do you explain all this?    [Abu-Sharif] Let us begin with the end of the question. For  my part, my leaving the Popular Front was the result of  political positions. I am convinced that the political line of  President Yasir 'Arafat is sound, and that the Palestinians are  entering a new phase that requires them to review their position  in the world, and to know that the contradictions of this world  are no longer contradictions based on the balance of military  power. This world is seeking stability based on economic  competition; for the first time the interests of the world are  in line with the establishment of a stable Middle East. In order  for it to be established, the Palestinian problem must be  solved. My political difference with the authority was what made  me leave the Popular Front, and led the Popular Front to expel  me openly when I shook hands with President Husni Mubarak at the  African summit in Addis Ababa.    As to Brother Hani al-Hasan, his meeting with the ten  organizations, and the issuing of the declaration--we had  invited all of them, including the Doctor [Habash], the Popular  Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Democratic Front,  once again to join the institutions of the PLO, in order to  rebuild the infrastructure of Palestine, and to develop the  economic state of Palestine. We are beginning with a first step,  i.e., Gaza and Jericho, because the road is a long one, and we  have no illusions. The thing is for everyone to work on  rebuilding, and on ending the occupation of Palestinians in the  occupied territories.  <H5>  Gaza-Jericho </H5>   ['Abd-al-Karim] Are you one of the optimists about the  Gaza-Jericho agreement?    [Abu-Sharif] The truth is that I have criticisms of the  agreement, and voiced them in the proper forums, but in general  I am optimistic about the general course I see clearly coming  from the Middle East. It is the most sensitive region of the  world, with the strategic interests of the West and the vital  interests of the peoples of the Middle East. There is a  congruence, at this very moment, the historic moment, between  the vital interests of the world in the Middle East, and the  establishment of a stable Middle East. Now, they are not  maintaining these interests just because they love the Arabs and  the Palestinians.    The West is seeking to create a stability in the Middle East  that will prevent explosions, prevent wars, and so that the  global groups involved in the Middle East may benefit from its  resources and markets. The Middle East problem has also become,  for the first time in 50 years, clearly linked in the mind of  the West, and in the mind of the United States, with a solution  for the question of Palestine, and an end to the Israeli  occupation of the Arab territories. How can stability take hold  as long as Israel has not withdrawn from the territories it  occupied in 1967, without, in Reagan's phrase, "land for peace,"  first stated in 1982, and subsequently reaffirmed by President  Bush when he announced the initiative that led to the Madrid  peace conference, and the acceptance of the peace process so far.    I am optimistic about the general course, starting with the  congruence of the world's interests around the stability of the  Middle East. On the other hand, I believe that Israel is in a  very tight spot, perhaps a tighter spot than many of the Arabs.  It is a difficult spot economically, spiritually, and  strategically. I believe that the new generations in Israel are  now convinced that there is no alternative to ending the  occupation and getting rid of the Judaea and Samaria ideology  which in itself has been an obstacle for long years. A step  forward to ending the occupation and establishing peace with the  Arabs enabling Israel to live in a world of big fish and little  fish. As long as the little fish stick together in a school that  cannot be swallowed by the big fish, they go, and they go like  the wind.    Israel, too, is defending its interests, and not because it  loves the Arabs, or is giving in to the wishes of the Americans.  All these factors have convinced me that we must seize this  historic moment, from its circumstances, and take a step  forward. Gaza-Jericho is a first step on the road to the  establishment of a Palestinian national authority in the  territories occupied in 1967, then confederation with Jordan,  and these will be followed by many developments in the Middle  East, leading, perhaps, to the establishment of a common market  to protect the interests of the peoples of the Middle East.    ['Abd-al-Karim] This is the political strategy you are  discussing from one position; the matter would move smoothly  according to your ambitions as Palestinians. But will the  Israeli side think the same way? Or will it go the same way with  you?    [Abu-Sharif] I see the general course just as clearly as I  can see you. At the same time, I have no illusions about this  course being an easy one. There will be difficulties. There is  an opposition in Israel, and there are extremists, just as we  have an opposition and extremists. There are countries in the  Middle East opposed to this course, though the majority, of  course, support it. But we have no illusions. If the thing were  easy, then why negotiate? The negotiations have one  justification, which is to solve the problems pending between  the two sides, and to reach compromises. I believe that this  process will gradually build its inner dynamic.    ['Abd-al-Karim] For you or for the Israelis?    [Abu-Sharif] For all the sides, like a snowball: the farther  it goes, the bigger it gets. Everyone will be persuaded by the  start of the economic wheel and the building, or rebuilding  process. Everyone will be persuaded that peace means economic  development, that peace means wide-ranging prosperity; that  peace means a morsel of food.  <H5>  Edward Sa'id's Opinion </H5>   ['Abd-al-Karim] Edward Sa'id wrote in THE GUARDIAN of  Britain  that "secret negotiation between strong and weak is often at the  expense of the weak, and in the interest of the strong. When the  PLO went to Oslo and consented to secret negotiations, it  contented itself with the weaker position." What do you think  about that?    [Abu-Sharif] I salute Edward Sa'id, the intellectual and  writer, who is as far as possible from politics and political  thinking. If Germany had refused to negotiate its surrender, we  would not be seeing a strong Germany now. Political thinking is  one thing, theories about weak and strong are something else.  The strategic dimension of the Palestinian question will  continue to exist. Had the Palestinians been weak, the Israelis  would have put an end to them and to the Arab organizations over  the last 45 years. They have waged wars against us that might  have eliminated some other peoples.    It is enough for me to remind Edward Sa'id of the battles in  Jordan and the battles in Lebanon, of the PLO's other battles  against Palestinians! Of the starvation in the camps, the  destruction of the camps, of Israel's 27-year occupation of the  West Bank and the Gaza Strip. I would also remind him of the  900,000 Arabs still in Israel as Israeli citizens, who are still  Arabs who speak Arabic, who are proud of Arab poetry, and who  give their children a good Arab upbringing. So we are strong;  had we not been strong, Israel would not have sat down to  negotiate with us on the basis of ending the Judaea and Samaria  ideology--all their generations have been brought up to believe  that [Judaea and Samaria] are an inseparable part of Israel.    ['Abd-al-Karim] What concerns the Americans and the Egyptian  mediators now is Syria's position, which rejects the secret  agreement. Do you expect success on the Syrian front?    [Abu-Sharif] The Syrian-Israeli axis is progressing. I  expect  the signature of an agreement in the near future; I also expect  a Jordanian-Israeli agreement to be signed in a few days. And,  of course, a Lebanese-Israeli agreement. It would be a mistake,  however, to imagine that our problem, us, the Palestinians, is  the problem of the occupation of the Golan or the occupation of  the border strip [of Lebanon]. Syria is a fully existing state,  with its people on its territory, its sovereignty in force over  its land; there is a piece of occupied Syrian territory called  the Golan. The issue between Syria and Israel is the schedule of  Israel's withdrawal from a piece of land belonging to an  existing country that has its own institutions, its people on  its land, and its sovereignty in force. The same is true of  Lebanon. The issue between Lebanon and Israel is the occupation  of the border strip. Us, we have two issues; the first is  actually Israel's withdrawal, and the second is the Palestinian  people's right to self-determination and the establishment of  institutions and sovereignty over the land which had heretofore  not existed.    Since 1948, the Palestinian people have lived under an  Egyptian mandate in Gaza, and attached to Jordan in the West  Bank.    So we have two issues, and a solution to our problem will  come in two phases. This has been agreed upon. On this basis,  all of the Arab negotiating sides have participated in 10 rounds  of negotiations. What we advanced in the declaration of  principles was a first step on the road to finding a solution to  one of the two questions, and the two questions together: as a  first step, Israeli withdrawal from these areas and giving the  Palestinian people the rule of a national authority throughout  the territories. It is not true that the Palestinians isolated  themselves or were isolated. The only peace with Israel that has  any value for us is a comprehensive peace. That means a peace in  which all the Arabs meet to sign on the basis of land for peace  with Israel.  <H5>  The Economic Aspect </H5>   ['Abd-al-Karim] In your interview you are focusing on the  economic aspect. Don't you agree with me that the statements of  Peres and Rabin call for a Middle East economic policy that  would mean prosperity for everyone, including Israel?    [Abu-Sharif] Don't you agree with me that such talk of a  Middle Eastern economic market are premature?    There can be no real progress at this level until a  comprehensive peace has been realized. The Arab position here is  absolutely clear, both in terms of the multinational meetings,  and when the United States asked the Arabs to annul the Arab  boycott resolutions. There can be no cooperation so long as  there is no comprehensive peace, and comprehensive peace means  the return of all the territories occupied in 1967, giving the  Palestinian people its total right to self-determination. At  that time, discussion of the establishment of a common market in  the Middle East will become not only possible but, in my  opinion, natural.    ['Abd-al-Karim] Did you know about the accord or the secret  talks going on in Oslo?    [Abu-Sharif] I had absolutely no idea. I was like many of  the  members of the leadership: in the dark about it. This was clear,  with the use of staff that was not very well known to negotiate  with the Israelis, so that it would remain quiet and hidden.    ['Abd-al-Karim] It's as if in this interview you want to  grant legitimacy to the Israeli presence in the region, even  though we were brought up to believe that the Zionist state had  stolen part of Arab territory.    [Abu-Sharif] Facts are facts, whether we like it or not,  both  for those who still call for the liberation of Palestine from  the river to the sea, and those who signed the land-for-peace  agreement. Israel is a fait accompli, and it is practical and  necessary for our minds to deal with this; otherwise our people  will remain under occupation, and we will remain in this  miserable condition.    The agreement that was signed is a declaration of principles  and a first step on the road to establishing a Palestinian  national authority in a Palestinian state on all the land  occupied in 1967. It is based on the initiative established by  the Palestine National Council [PNC]. It is the PNC that  established recognition of Resolutions 242 and 338, and the  recognition of Israel in return for the establishment of a  Palestinian state on the land occupied in 1967.    These are the facts; this is what those who do not want to  remain in dreams and illusions must deal with.    But the signature of this agreement does not prevent those  who want to dream or imagine or continue in the strategic  defense of the historic right of the Palestinian people, from  doing so!    I must say that it is not only the right but the obligation  of our writers and intellectuals to keep on talking about this.  With politicians it is different: they are dealing with it with  the freedom of a people being crushed under occupation, with a  morsel of food for these people, and their future.  <H5>  Regarding Acceptance </H5>   ['Abd-al-Karim] We rejected Resolution 181 in 1947, and we  rejected the proposals of the Palestinian Communist Party, which  called for keeping the partition. We did not listen to  Bourguiba's appeals, and Resolutions 242 and 338 were rejected.  Al-Sadat was killed because of his visit [to Israel]. You were  one of the rejectionists in all these things. What new factor  came along for you to consider a policy of accepting reality?    [Abu-Sharif] This is true. It is also true that there were  resolutions adopted after all those you listed. There is--on 15  November 1988, the PNC resolution to build a new strategy. There  is the declaration of a Palestinian state; there is the consent  to Yasir 'Arafat's initiative, plus the decision to go to Madrid.    These too are resolutions, and if they prove anything, it is  that the Palestinian mind is not rigid, but flexible. Every  resolution must be assessed at its time, and in the  circumstances in which it was adopted. For example, today we  cannot judge a decision made by Palestinians 40 years ago in  their own circumstances.    These developments show that the Palestinians, and Arabs,  too--because the Palestinians are not going it alone--have  received the news in this world and been able to learn the facts  of the matter and the conditions the world is going through. The  Middle East is part of the world, and they were able to draw a  new political line; not one that would remove them from the  political map, but to put them at the heart of the political  map. I say this is a healthy sign. It indicates that the Arabs  know what is going on around them and have become capable of  defending their interests, instead of being unaware, as McMahon  and British and French colonialism, and even the Israelis, made  them in the past. They--the Israelis--fooled numerous Arab  organizations, who cooperated with them to impose suffering on  the map of the Middle East.    ['Abd-al-Karim] As long as we are talking about regimes,  permit me to point out that you in the PLO were dealing with  most of the regimes, and with their diverse ideologies, in a  balanced fashion. With the exception of the Kuwait affair, that  is, because your tilt towards the Iraqi regime cost you the  balance you had had.    [Abu-Sharif] Frankly, I believe that there is a muddle and a  mistake. The muddle is in interpreting the Palestinian position.  The Palestinian position was clearly against the occupation, for  Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait, for the withdrawal of the foreign  forces, and for avoiding war and the calamities of war. The  mistake was one of expression; a great many expressions from  some Palestinian leaders made our position seem as though it  supported the occupation of Kuwait. No, we did not support the  occupation of Kuwait. Naturally, there were some who supported  it, just as in the Arab world there were some for and some  against, but the Palestinian position was against Iraq's  occupation of Kuwait.    ['Abd-al-Karim] So, what do you call some Palestinian  military units that were in Kuwait, with some of them  questioning Kuwaiti citizens in interrogations?    [Abu-Sharif] I don't think there were any Palestinian  military units in Kuwait at all.    ['Abd-al-Karim] Some people say that there were Palestinian  forces side by side with the Iraqi forces.    [Abu-Sharif] There was the Arab Liberation Front, and the  Arab Liberation Front, as you know, is a branch of the Ba'th  Party in Iraq, not a Palestinian organization. Here I am not  denying that some Palestinians took a certain position, but it  was not the official one.    The official position was clear, and I am aware of the  details due to the letters sent to numerous Arab and  international figures. Our position, in its first paragraph,  called for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait and the formation of an  Arab political committee to find a political solution to prevent  war and spare the Arabs its calamities.  <H5>  Persuading Saddam Husayn </H5>   ['Abd-al-Karim] Is it true that Salah Khalaf (Abu-Iyad)  clashed with Iraqi President Saddam Husayn during the invasion?    [Abu-Sharif] The fact is that the Palestinian leadership's  meetings with Saddam Husayn were for the most part attempts to  persuade him of a political solution, attempts to convince him  that it was essential to withdraw from Kuwait, attempts to  convince him that the war would bring destruction upon everyone.  Unfortunately, all that was shown on television was Abu-'Ammar  embracing Saddam Husayn, and this image was put to evil uses, to  harm the Palestinian position. Regarding the assassination of  Abu-Iyad during that crisis, it had no connection with what you  mention. Another Palestinian faction assassinated him.    ['Abd-al-Karim] How will you confront Hamas inside the  territories? They oppose the agreement.    [Abu-Sharif] Hamas is against it. They have the right to  express their view, and we respect their opinion, but we demand  that they go along with the majority decision. The majority  decision is the Palestinian decision, and internal conflicts  will not be solved by the use of violence. That much is agreed  upon: freedom to express opinions and the democratic struggle.    ['Abd-al-Karim] What about the intifadah?    [Abu-Sharif] The intifadah is the popular resistance to  occupation. If the occupation ends, there is no need for  resistance!    ['Abd-al-Karim] But large areas of national territory are  still occupied.    [Abu-Sharif] No, this is a first step. The first step is  Gaza  and Jericho, and within nine months from this step, according to  the agreement, come the rest of the West Bank territories. The  question of Jerusalem remains to be negotiated in the next phase.    I bid Bassam Abu-Sharif good-bye, convinced that he had not  said everything, and we agreed to meet again when the first and  genuine step is made: the day of the withdrawal of Israeli  forces from Gaza and Jericho in a few weeks.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: Hearing postponed as TWA names head TRANS World Airline, the bankrupt US carrier, yesterday named Mr William Howard as chairman when the company emerges from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection later this summer. As a result of the appointment, tomorrow's US bankruptcy court hearing to confirm TWA's reorganisation plans has been postponed to August 11. TWA has been operating under Chapter 11 since January 1992. The company said yesterday that more than 90 per cent of each of its unsecured creditor classes had voted in favour of reorganisation. TWA's unions and creditors have been pressing for an experienced outsider to help lead the company. Attempts to woo Mr Lee Iacocca, former head of Chrysler, failed late last year. Mr Howard, 71, is credited with the success of Piedmont Airlines which he headed in the 1980s. He is popular with labour groups - which is important since TWA's unions will own 45 per cent of the re-organised common stock and have four seats on the board. Mr Howard left Piedmont in 1987, when it was acquired by USAir. Mr Howard faces a daunting task. Competition remains fierce, and TWA has lost some of its most valuable routes, such as New York-Heathrow which was sold by Mr Carl Icahn, TWA's former owner, in 1991. Mr Glenn Zander and Mr Robin Wilson, TWA's two chief executives, will remain with the company as vice-chairmen.</p>

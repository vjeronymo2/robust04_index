			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / World Trade News: P&amp;O to manage Argentine terminal P&amp;O, the shipping and construction group, yesterday announced the acquisition of management control of a recently privatised terminal at Puerto Nuevo, which serves the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires. This is P&amp;O's first move into the management of container port facilities in Latin America, Lord Sterling, chairman, said. The group's Australian subsidiary has acquired a 40 per cent stake in the equity of the venture and it will supply the management of the terminal and provide support services. The activities acquired by P&amp;O account for 270,000 teu (20ft equivalent units) container movements a year, out of the total handled by the port of about 500,000. P&amp;O is also looking to extend its container operations at Montevideo in Uruguay and in Brazil and Mexico. 'This project will act as a springboard for further investment opportunities in the region,' Lord Sterling said. P&amp;O's local partner in the project, which is to be renamed Terminales Rio de la Plata, is Murchison Roman.</p>

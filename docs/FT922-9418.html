			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: BHH advises acceptance of Pounds 21m bid from chief's company THE BOARD of BHH Group has recommended a Pounds 21.3m cash bid from IM Group, a private distribution company controlled by Mr Robert Edmiston, chairman of BHH. The offer, which has been irrevocably accepted by shareholders representing 39.5 per cent of the equity, is worth 36p per share. BHH shares closed unchanged at 34p. The property company incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 4.7m on turnover of Pounds 25.8m in 1991. BHH said it was cutting costs, but was unlikely to return to profitability unless there was a sustained and significant improvement in the property market. It believed it would be better placed to continue with the support of, and access to, the funds of IM Group.</p>

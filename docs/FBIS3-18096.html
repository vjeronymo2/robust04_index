			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Alalin Prate, vice president of the European </F> Investment Bank, by Baudouin Bollaert; place and date not given:  "Prate: `The EIB Does Not Lack Resources, But Good Projects'"  -- first paragraph is LE FIGARO introduction]    [Text] Loans by the European Investment Bank (EIB), the  European Union's [EU] financial institution, increased last year  at a good rate, from ECU17 billion in 1992 to ECU19.6 billion in  1993. Of this total, ECU17.7 billion went to the EU member  states -- France ranked third among the beneficiaries, with 12.4  percent of the loans granted -- while ECU1.9 billion went to  third countries in the framework of the cooperation policy.  EIB's French vice-president, Alain Prate, agreed to be  interviewed by LE FIG-ECO.    [Bollaert] How far have we got with the European growth  initiative and the white paper's promises in the areas of  growth, competition, and employment?    [Prate] In the depths of a crisis and at a time of serious  unemployment it really was the time to establish major  intra-European infrastructures, open to both East and southern  Europe. The first stage consisted of accelerating the financing  by the EIB of major projects that already had been defined and  were almost complete. Of the ECU5-billion budget agreed on at  the Edinburgh summit, to which we should add the ECU2 billion  from the Copenhagen summit, ECU5.1 billion has already been  poured into 100 or so specific projects. I could mention the  Paris-Brussels high-speed train link from the Belgian border to  Brussels, the Chamoise tunnel, or various environmental  protection projects, for example at Nancy, Nantes, or Belfort.  We really are ahead of schedule!    [Bollaert] We could also mention the ECU1 billion, which  includes various government low-interest loans, set aside to  finance investments by small- and medium-sized companies....    [Prate] Of course, this project is currently being  implemented. However, we need to go further and enter a second  stage with the emergence of new projects. This is why the  Brussels summit decided to create, along the lines of the white  paper, a group composed of the personal representatives of the  heads of state and government of the Twelve -- the  Christophersen Group -- with the mission of identifying new  trans-European projects that should take priority. We are  actively cooperating in the work of this group, and 26 projects  are currently being examined. However, it is a difficult task  and the problems sometimes go beyond merely finding the money....    [Bollaert] For example?    [Prate] Take the high-speed rail link between Paris and  Strasbourg: It should become the Paris-Frankfurt link. The  French part is almost certain to be completed, but not the  German part. The low profitability of the project implies a high  rate of subsidy and, as a result, major public aid. This had  led to a degree of reticence on the part of the Germans. That  is why we have great expectations of the Christophersen Group.  Through its advice and with the urging of the heads of state  and government, we think that a certain number of projects that  cannot be normally financed could benefit from the major support  of the political authorities.    [Bollaert] But it will be difficult....    [Prate] Yes. Take two other major projects, like the  Brussels-Amsterdam-Cologne high-speed rail link, or the  high-speed Eurotunnel train to London. In both cases, the high  population density creates major environmental problems. In  addition, the British Government would like a share of the money  to come from the private sector.  <H5>  Fundamental Criteria </H5>   [Bollaert] Maybe we now understand better what [Prime  Minister] Balladur meant when he said on the "Hour of Thruth" TV  show that nothing much seemed to have come out of the Brussels  summit....    [Prate] The Christophersen Group has only met twice. We must  give it time to work.    [Bollaert] In December, the Twelve were talking about  ECU120 over six years to accelerate the creation of the major  networks (transport, energy, and telecommunications) and about  giving the EU "information highways." That is a fine program,  but is it not too ambitious?    [Prate] For credits at normal rates, the EIB is quite  capable  of increasing its aid since our current ceiling is ECU144  billion, of which only ECU98 billion have been used. We  therefore have a large financial margin, all the more so since  the ratification procedures for the European Investment Fund  (EIF), the instrument guaranteeing the financing of major  infrastructures and assisting small- and medium-sized companies,  are almost completed. The EIF will therefore be an additional  and useful way of easing the financing of major projects.    However, these projects -- which vary in their profitability  -- still have to meet certain criteria which we consider to be  fundamental: They must be well prepared technically; they must  respect the environment; they must be economically viable; and  they must be financially balanced. I repeat: We do not lack  the resources. We do, however, need more good projects.    [Bollaert] The Commission in Brussels would nevertheless  still like to issue "Union Bonds" -- bonds issued in the name of  the EU -- to accelerate the movement....    [Prate] It takes more than "Union Bonds" to create new  projects. We all know that most finance ministers consider that  the EU should not get too heavily into debt. There is still a  difference between the approach of those who want to go ahead  with new projects first and talk about the finances later, and  those who want to do things the other way round.    [Bollaert] What about cooperation with East Europe and the  countries of the Mediterranean basin?    [Prate] This made good progress in 1993, when we doubled the  amount of financing. I could mention, among other things, the  construction of the Algerian section of the Maghreb-Spain gas  pipeline; the modernization of the Warsaw-Berlin rail link; and  the action of the METAP (Technical Aid for the Environment in  the Mediterranean), in which the World Bank, the European  Commission, and the EIB have pooled their resources, in  particular in the area of water management.</p>

			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Japanese investors breathe life into Euroyen market AFTER A sell-off at the end of last year, the Euroyen bond market has come back to life. Wider yield spreads have revived interest among Japanese investors, who can now buy Euroyen bonds at attractive levels relative to the domestic market. At the end of last year, many European investors took the view that the rally in the Japanese bond market had more or less run its course, and took profits. But with the Japanese economy still weak, and the widespread belief that a further cut in the official discount rate is on the way, the market appears to be better underpinned. Although Japanese investors have proved more enthusiastic than European ones so far this year, expectations that the yen will firm against European currencies over the year are encouraging European demand. More deals are expected to follow Sweden's Y100bn issue of five-year bonds last week, which reopened the market for 1993. Portugal is planning to launch an offering of five-year Eurobonds today. The issue, totalling up to Y75bn, is arranged by Daiwa Europe and IBJ International. In addition, the Asian Development Bank is taking bids for a Y50bn 10-year offering later in the week. Meanwhile, other European sovereign borrowers and several supranational agencies are eyeing the market. The World Bank's next global yen bond offering is also under preparation. Sovereign and supranational borrowers typically hold funds in a variety of currencies, often in the form of a pre-determined basket, in order to spread their currency risk. The attraction of the Euroyen market is that it currently offers very low interest rates and can accommodate large funding operations. The tiering of the Euroyen market has become more pronounced than in virtually any other market. The market consists on the one hand of a group of actively traded sovereign, supranational and government-guaranteed names, bought by international investors. The second tier is made up of Japanese companies which channel funding through the Euroyen sector, because fees are lower than in the domestic market. Despite the Eurobond label, such paper, often structured deals tailored to suit specific investor needs, finds its way back to the Japanese market. There has been talk that the Japanese authorities, unhappy with the practice, may seek to curb it. However, with Japanese companies facing large funding requirements this year to refinance their maturing equity-linked debt, the authorities may decide the Euroyen market remains too valuable a source of Japanese corporate financing to tamper with. Meanwhile, poor swap opportunities have, for the most part, discouraged foreign corporate borrowers from tapping the market. Those borrowers in the top tier of the market are estimated to command a premium of around 10 basis points. But dealers said the market offers the most attractive funding levels to those sovereign borrowers which are not the very top credits, since there is less differentiation based on credit rating than, for example, in the dollar market. In terms of absolute costs for borrowers, the Euroyen bond market has become increasingly attractive, as interest rates fell last year. At the same time, however, margins over the JGB yield curve for Euroyen bonds have widened, so the benefit of the JGB market rally has been lessened. For example, the World Bank's first global yen bond offering, launched last March, was priced to yield 19 basis points below the 10-year Japanese government bond. It now trades at a yield of around 30 basis points over the JGB. 'For the top tier names, spreads have a cap of 30-40 basis points (over JGB yields): at that level, Japanese investors enter the market,' said Mr Neil Colverd, head of yen trading at Merrill Lynch. However, unlike the dollar market, Euroyen spreads over the government bond market do not necessarily provide an accurate means of valuation. Around 95 per cent of trading in JGBs is concentrated in the current 10-year benchmark, which consequently trades at a huge premium to other issues. 'Most other JGBs are very rarely traded, which, in effect, means that there is no yield curve in the government market,' according to Mr Alexander Mitcheson-Smith, an economist at Banque Paribas. The revival of activity in the Euroyen market in the last year or so has created a yield curve made up of actively traded Euroyen bonds, which can now be used for pricing new issues.</p>

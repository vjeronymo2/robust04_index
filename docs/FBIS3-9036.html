			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the 16 March Romanian press review] </F>   [Excerpt] Bucharest ROMPRES, 16/3/1994 -- "Irredentist  Fangs in Bucharest and in Transylvania" is the headline in daily  ADEVARUL of the set of reports on the observance of the  anniversary of the 1848 revolution by the ethnic Hungarian in  Romania. The matter is covered by all newspapers that emphasize  the attempt of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania  [UDMR] Deputy Imre Borbely to make an address in Hungarian in  Romania's Parliament. "To speak Hungarian before the Chamber of  Deputies means an official offense to the country and to the  fellow parliamentarians," writes daily CRONICA ROMANA, noting  that "this characteristic rudeness of Mr. Borbely, a UDMR  hardliner, (...) serves only those accused of nationalism (...)  and we must admit that in such situations they are right,  because one needs not be a nationalist to feel offended in one's  own home, in one's own country, and in one's own parliament."    Daily ORA covers the visit paid to Transylvania by high  state  officials of Hungary in order to celebrate together with the  Hungarian minority there the memory of the 1848 revolution.  "The Hungarian Government's gesture to celebrate at high level  the event that was a happy one for them and a tragical one for  us, is impolite and this is an understatement (...). It is  offending the Romanians' feelings" daily ORA writes. "The  Hungarian revisionism is behaving as if the Hungarian empire  existed, temporarily subjected to different, unjust laws, but  still an empire, consequently the government has to participate  in the festivities in its eternal provinces, irrespective of the  present situation (...) The Hungarian revisionism tries in  every possible way [to achieve] Romania's isolation from the  community of European states. In an isolated Romania, subject  to the quarantine of civilization, the difficult mission has  been assumed by the UDMR. In Romania's Parliament there is a  party hostile to Romania, that despises the Romanian nation."  [passage omitted]</p>

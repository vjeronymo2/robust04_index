			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Treuhand finds buyers for three shipyards THE TREUHAND privatisation agency has secured its last major sale, finding buyers for eastern Germany's troubled shipbuilding industry. It said yesterday three of the five large companies belonging to the state-owned Deutsche Maschinen- und Schiffbau are to be sold to Kvaener, a Norwegian group and to Bremer Vulkan of western Germany. The Treuhand is also talking to Danish and Norwegian buyers to sell the other two yards. Kvaerner is to buy the Warnow and Neptun yards, east Germany's largest shipyards, based in the Rostock area. Bremer Vulkan is to take over the MTW shipyard in Wismar, and DMR, a diesel engine producer based in Rostock. Mrs Birgit Breuel, Treuhand president, said the decision to sell the core of the industry to the two companies had been 'one of the most difficult the agency has had to make'. The European Commission will have to examine the sale because state funds are involved. The Treuhand, whose governing board is expected to approve the sales next Tuesday, said it was confident the Commission would approve the level of state aid needed. The state government of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where the yards are based, said yesterday it would unveil a restructuring plan for the industry today. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, said last week that any plans for the shipyards would have to include a basic restructuring plan before the Commission could consider approving the level of state aid. Brussels officials are seeking assurances that the restructuring would be sufficiently realistic to make the yards competitive by the end of 1993, when all state aid to shipbuilding in the Community is to be abolished. Mrs Breuel indicated yesterday the sale represented a compromise between Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic party (CDU) and its junior coalition partner the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), and between the two parties in the state government of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The CDU had sought a comprehensive privatisation with state aid while the FDP said there should be no subsidies and that unviable parts of the industry should be closed. The Treuhand said the number of workers in the three shipyards would be reduced from 10,300 to 7,000. Trade union representatives at the shipyards claimed the sales violated a 'package deal' for the sale of the entire industry. Thousands of shipyard workers are to demonstrate today outside the parliament of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern which is to debate and approve its plan for the shipbuilding industry. Mr Hartmut Rower, chairman of the action committee of workers at the Neptun-Warnow shipyards, called the deal a 'rotten egg.' The unions have also argued that the future of the industry would be more secure in the hands of a single buyer. Mr Rower said he feared Kvaerner would close the shipyards and sell the property. Tough negotiations with the companies are likely to take place over the amount of state subsidy. The Treuhand previously indicated it was prepared to assume more than DM1bn (Pounds 300m) in shipyard debts as well as a substantial portion of the DM900m needed in investments. The agency previously guaranteed liquidity loans of DM1.3bn to the shipbuilders.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Travel: Royal Viking Queen Because of a slip, last week's article on the Royal Viking Queen cruise-ship stated that 'the average daily price paid by US clients for a two-week cruise on the Queen is Dollars 9,500 per person.' As the article later made clear, the Dollars 9,500 relates to 14 days' cruising - an average daily price (per person) of Dollars 679.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Jacques Isnard report: "The Last-Chance Legionnaire"] </F>   [Text] Lieutenant General Bertrand Guillaume de Sauville de  Lapresle, a tall man, with a smooth brow, quiet, and discreet  without being self-effacing, is the reverse of the legendary  figure of the legionnaire -- he served in the Foreign Legion for  a long time -- who is usually thought of as an adventurer --  brutal, crude, and undisciplined.    And yet, do not be deceived; although Gen. de Lapresle may  not be talkative, he knows what he wants, does what he says he  will, and does not officially have moods. Like all officers who  have accepted the notion of discipline, he knows how to obey,  but he also knows how to give an order and expects it to be  carried out. At the age of 56, Bertrand de Lapresle is the  last-chance general for the United Nations.    Born in Marseilles on 5 September 1937, a graduate from  Saint-Cyr, holder of a master's degree in economic sciences and  a graduate from the faculty of Political Sciences, Bertrand de  Lapresle was sent to Algeria in 1960 with the airborne and  armored troops. After 1963, he alternated posts in the Foreign  Legion, in the armored division and cavalry units (especially in  Germany), in the general staff, and higher military, scientific,  and technical education institutes.    In August 1981, with the rank of colonel, he commanded the  1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment in Orange (Vaucluse). From 17 May  to 25 September 1983, Bertrand de Lapresle was chief of staff of  the French section -- 2,000 men -- of the multinational force in  Beirut, alongside American, Italian, and British contingents,  called up following the Sabra and Shatilah massacres to help the  regular Lebanese army to intervene between rival factions and  protect the civilians. In that post, he was valued for his  qualities as an organizer and, also, for his coolness and sense  of diplomacy during the individual actions which the  international force was obliged to carry out.    He again served in the general staff, especially in the  "financial planning" office, and, with the rank of brigadier  general, he was deputy chief of "operations" in the army general  staff in 1986, and then in 1987 he became chief of the "plans,  programs, and space" division in the army general staff.  Promoted to major general, he commanded the 3d French Armored  Division in Germany in 1989. Raised to the rank of lieutenant  general in 1990, he became major general of the Army (number two  in the hierarchy, after the chief of staff), then he was placed,  on 1 December 1993, at the head of the five divisions of the  Rapid Action Force (FAR).    In the Army, Bertrand de Lapresle is an officer who is not  opposed by his peers or his subordinates (which is a double  exploit). His appointment was expected and, in its way, it is a  signal which France is sending to the United Nations. Indeed,  Gen. de Lapresle is already being called "the last-chance  general" in the French armed forces, the man who -- if he failed  to agree with Mr. Butrus-Ghali on remedying the United Nations'  shortcomings on the spot -- could be repatriated with the 6,600  or so French blue helmets in the former Yugoslavia.</p>

The Central Fatherland  Administration of the party will be elected by a show of hands  and the chairman will be elected by secret ballot among several  candidates. This was what Party Chairman Vojislav Seselj  announced at the regular news conference. The journalists'  attention was mostly attracted by Radical's stands on the  interparty agreements on the election of the new chairman of the  republican parliament. Dragoljub Stankic has the details:    [Begin recording] [Stankic] It is the principled stand of  the Serbian Radical Party that a member of an opposition party  be elected Serbian Assembly chairman. The first solution, that  Vuk Draskovic be elected, is unacceptable to the Radicals. The  other proposal, the one that was accepted, failed to receive a  sufficient number of votes, Vojislav Seselj said. Vuk Draskovic  did not consult anybody about the second round of voting, but  decided himself that the same proposal be given. We opposed  that, Seselj said.    He said that he proposed that the candidate be a member of  the Democratic Party or some other party and asked why that  person had to be from Depos. We complied with everything that  was agreed among the opposition parties, but we are not going to  allow Vuk Draskovic to speak on behalf of the whole of the  opposition, because he is not authorized to do so, Vojislav  Seselj pointed out. He commented on the situation among the  opposition parties as follows:    [Seselj] I do not think that an opposition bloc should be  formed, nor do I think that there has been a rift among the  opposition parties. A rift can only occur if there was unity  before, and, in this case, no unity existed. We only agreed  upon one specific question.    [Stankic] If there is an intervention by NATO, Seselj called  on the Serbian people to oppose it with all means. In that  case, one should respond fiercely against Croatian and Muslim  targets and do so indiscriminately. And, as he put it, one  should attack UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] units as well,  wherever they may be. [end recording]</p>

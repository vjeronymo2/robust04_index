CCEJ Secretary-General So Kyong-sok said that there had been  problems during the Uruguay Round talks, and he called on the  government to take measures to revive agriculture and rural  economy in coping with rice market opening.    So said the lack of experts caused by frequent reshuffles of  concerned public officials, the absence of an active negotiating  strategy and the lack of investment in rural areas during  negotiations were problems noticed in the course of handling the  UR talks.    The government should fully support farmers' and fishermen's  organizations and the fund for this support should be supplied  by the non-agricultural and urban sectors, the policy  recommendation says.    While predicting farm products market opening will affect  not  only related industries such as fertilizer, farm machinery and  farm products processing but living conditions in urban areas  because of migration to cities, it calls on the government to  take measures as early as possible.</p>

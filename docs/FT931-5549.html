			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Putting the colour into plastics Speciality inks which change colour when exposed to sunlight can now be incorporated into plastics, such as polypropylene, to create novelty products - lunch boxes or toys. Developed in the US and launched in the UK by Sunshine Promotions of London, the range of 16 inks can also be used on clothing, paper or packaging. The photochromic inks begin life as crystals, which are broken down and mixed with a medium before application. Sunshine Promotions: UK, 071 323 5022.</p>

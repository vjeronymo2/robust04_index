			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / MPs may face probe over Milan scandal INVESTIGATIONS into Milan's multi-billion lire corruption scandal have taken a decisive turn with the arrival in Rome of legal papers calling for parliamentary immunity for five politicians implicated in the inquiry to be lifted. The list includes two prominent Socialists, Mr Carlo Tognoli, the outgoing minister of sport, and Mr Paolo Pillitteri, elected to parliament in April. Both are former mayors of Milan, and Mr Pillitteri is the brother-in-law of Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist party leader. Separately in Milan, the role of big industrial companies has come further into the spotlight with the decision by Mr Ivo Braglia, the head of the transport division of the Italian subsidiary of the multinational Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) engineering group, to testify voluntarily before investigating magistrates. ABB is one of a number of big engineering companies which supplied equipment for the city's third underground railway line, which has been one of most important infrastructure projects being investigated by magistrates. Until now, inquiries had focused on Fiat's Cogefar-Impresit construction and civil engineering subsidiary. Its managing director, Mr Enzo Papi, has been in prison for the past month as a result of his refusal to co-operate with magistrates.</p>

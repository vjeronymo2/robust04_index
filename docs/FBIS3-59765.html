			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  (MITI) will begin a study on ways for Japanese plastic  processing companies to provide investment capital and technical  guidance in a smooth manner for the expansion of the plastic  processing industry in Asia, acting mainly through ASEAN. The  plastic processing industry has many small and mid-sized  companies, and business expansion on a global scale has lagged  behind other industries. In addition to its current measures to  combat the high value of the yen, MITI has decided that healthy  business growth will be impossible without expansion in Asia,  which is a site of potential growth. Furthermore, various  countries in Asia are looking to Japanese industry to raise the  level of their plastic processing technology and train their  personnel, so mutual exchanges of personnel are on the rise.    In addition to ROK and Taiwan, the petrochemical industry is  expanding rapidly in Southeast Asian countries such as  Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. At the same time,  in these countries the plastic processing industry is expanding  as well in step with the rapid growth in assembly industries  such as the electric/electronics industry and a higher standard  of living. According to MITI, Thailand alone has about 3000  plastic processing companies.    The fact is, however, that international expansion by  Japanese plastic processing companies has lagged behind other  industries. MITI contends that we cannot expect future growth in  this industry without expansion in Southeast Asia, which is  becoming a major consumer site. Therefore, MITI will begin a  study to allow for Japanese companies to make capital  investments and provide technical training in Asia in a smooth  manner, and also to raise the level of technology in the region  and cooperate in personnel training.    MITI plans to conduct this study through the Japan High  Polymer Center, a non-profit corporation with experience in  overseas technical cooperation such as a plastic processing  testing and inspection project in Uruguay and a water-retaining  materials project in Egypt.    MITI plans to begin a new policy of global expansion through  mutual exchanges of personnel with Asia, which continues to grow  rapidly not only as an export base to the U.S. and Europe, but  also as a huge consumer market. The New Fiber Vision, for which  an interim report was recently released, also proposes the  establishment of a new global strategy centered on Asia. In the  petrochemical industry as well, a Southeast Asia study group  will be dispatched by the International Supply &amp; Demand  Subcommittee of the Petrochemical Product Supply &amp; Demand  Research Institute. All this will add impetus to expansion in  Asia in fields related to the chemical industry.</p>

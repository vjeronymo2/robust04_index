			<p>BFN     [Text] Chairman of the Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko  proposed advancing Boris Yeltsin's candidacy to the presidential  elections in 1996. "Boris Yeltsin's stay in office for one more  term would only benefit Russia," he told journalists in Moscow.  Shumeyko believes that Yeltsin "has no right" to rely on any  particular political forces, because none of them reflects the  interests of broad sections of the population.    The political parties are mostly concentrated in the State  Duma, he went on to say. "Their work shows that polarity in  decision- making still persists: democrats are blocking the  communists and vice versa," stated Shumeyko. He noted, that  centrist tendencies were increasing. Among the centrist parties  are the Party of Russian Unity and Concord, Women of Russia, the  Communist and agrarian parties, and the New Regional Policy  faction, said Shumeyko. However, the center favors conservative  ideas rather than reforms, he went on to say.    He told Interfax that Russia should not hasten to join  NATO's  Partnership for Peace program. The main condition for doing so  is joint work, equality and a clear-cut mechanism of  implementing decisions, said Shumeyko. "The air strikes on the  Serb positions by the US military command suggest that there is  no such mechanism even in the UN Security Council," stated  Shumeyko.</p>

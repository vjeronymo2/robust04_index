			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 49ER FANS GET LAST LAUGH AT COLUMNISTS  </P> <P> Something tells me that Jim Murray was eating quiche as the 49ers kicked the  Rams' butts.  </P> <P> Like Murray's over-extended metaphors, the myth of the 49ers as a finesse team  doesn't seem to fade for those sheltered ones who never see them play. Murray  seems intent on coming up with a clever premise as a replacement for the facts.  </P> <P> Maybe if he started paying close attention to the thing he is purportedly  writing about, his jokes would have more basis in truth, always the best source  for humor as well as rational thought.  </P> <P> DARREN SHAW, Irvine  </P></p>

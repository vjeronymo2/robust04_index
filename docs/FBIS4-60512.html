			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ruba al-Husari and Rashid Khashanah: "Israel </F> Demands that 'Arafat Reaffirm Commitment to Cairo Accord in  Writing"]    [Excerpt] Gaza, Tunis -- A Palestinian official told  AL-HAYAH yesterday that the agreement on the implementation of  self-rule signed officially in Cairo by President Yasir 'Arafat  "does not need to be signed again." He was responding to  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's demand that 'Arafat  reaffirm in writing his commitment to the accord, otherwise the  negotiations with the PLO would be suspended.    Hasan 'Asfur, who has been director general of the  department  following up negotiations with the Israelis since his return to  the Gaza Strip last week, has said that "commitment to the  accord was announced before the entire world, not in a closed  room. The Israeli Government, the PLO, and the cosponsors of  the peace process all have a copy of the text."    'Asfur, who participated in the Cairo negotiations and in  drafting the Gaza-Jericho agreement, said that "despite the  difficulties that emerge from time to time, the agreement to  continue the negotiations is binding on the Israelis, just as it  is binding on the Palestinians." He went on: "There are no  preconditions in the agreement. It might help Rabin to read its  clauses."    'Asfur said that the second part of the negotiations  concerning the early transfer of powers in the West Bank could  begin in June. He added that Palestinian President 'Arafat's  presence in the self-rule areas is essential before these  negotiations begin. [passage omitted]</p>

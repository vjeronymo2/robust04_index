			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Leading Article: The future of the forests Following the flak caused by railway privatisation and the decision to shirk postal privatisation, the UK government might be thought mad to be considering privatising forests. Ministers' and MPs' postbags are already bulging with hostile letters, even though a decision on whether to privatise is still far away. The essential problem is that the Forestry Commission, whose woods cover 5 per cent of the country's surface area and provide 14 per cent of its timber needs, does more than saw logs. It affords exercise for ramblers, facilities for holiday-makers and habitats for birds. The forests can also look good, though many of the commission's monotonous sitka spruce plantations are eyesores. These non-timber benefits cannot always be commercialised. It is, for example, impossible to impose 'hotel charges' on nightjars or red kites. Devising a toll system for ramblers would also be tricky. The fear is that private owners would neglect the non-timber aspects of forestry, since they would be unable to earn profits from them. People might be stopped from roaming through the woods and birds' breeding grounds destroyed. But forest privatisation is not quite the crack-pot idea it seems on first sight. It could help convert the Commission, which has been a constant drain on the public purse during its 75 years of existence, into a dynamic enterprise. Privatisation would also bring into the open the costs of meeting environmental objectives, which are currently hidden by opaque accounting practices. Recreational potential The scope for a more commercial approach is great. The commission's bureaucratic culture has been blamed for high costs by comparison with private-sector foresters. Recently it was criticised by the National Audit Office for prematurely felling trees, so foregoing Pounds 11m a year in revenue. It has also failed to make the most of its recreational potential, cutting the number of log cabins during the 1980s despite growing demand and high profitability. Privatisation would, of course, need to protect those interests which might be neglected by the narrow pursuit of profits. This could be achieved through a mixture of regulation and financial incentives. Ramblers could be protected by a 'right to roam' in privatisation contracts. Natural habitats could be preserved by paying private owners to maintain sites of special interest, just as some farmers do. And ancient woodlands such as the New Forest, whose non-timber benefits dwarf their timber potential, could be transfered to a national forest parks authority. Public money Critics say such an approach would not work. It would be impossible to write regulations that were sufficiently flexible to meet all environmental concerns. They also fear that, once the profitable parts of the estate were sold, the government would be unwilling to find cash to support loss-making forest parks or bribe the private sector to stay green. Privatisation would certainly make the costs of providing environmental benefits transparent, so allowing a proper discussion of whether the public is getting value for money. In some cases, it might be obvious that money was being wasted. But, in others, the fact that environmental advantages of forestry were more clearly identified could lead to a justified demand for more public money. Devising a proper structure of regulation and incentives will not be easy. It would therefore be best to go first for a half-way house under which the commercial and regulatory aspects of the Forestry Commission were fully separated. This would build on a partial division of the commission into a Forest Enterprise and Forest Authority, which came into effect last year. But it would go further in that the enterprise would acquire a corporate structure and be subject to the same rules as private forest owners. This would provide time to debug the regulatory structure and put the enterprise's accounts into shape. Once this had been done, ministers would be free to consider wholesale or partial privatisation. By offering shareholders incentives such as discounts on log cabin holidays, privatisation might even be seen as a small triumph of popular capitalism.</p>

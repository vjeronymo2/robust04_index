			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Arts: 'Flute' minus magic - The new Scarfe/Hall production in LA FEATHERS AND all, Papageno is the most normal-looking and theatrically credible character in Peter Hall's new production of The Magic Flute at the Los Angeles Music Center Opera. Despite the director's traditional, straightforward and often fine-grained staging of the opera, Gerald Scarfe's designs anchor the production in the world of the cartoon. In contrast to what one can divine of Hall's, Scarfe's is scarcely an allegorical Flute, no less but no more a parable of the human psyche than an episode of The Simpsons. The production seems to have been gauged more to a cliched perception of its Los Angeles public than to Hall's more earnestly expository sensibility. What magic there is is of the Disneyland and Hollywood variety. After a first-scene snake of Ring-Wurm proportions and neo-Baroque decoration, the ensuing menagerie - animal and human - is an amalgam of surreal animation, classic-film imagery and robotic, Star Wars futurism. On their own terms, Scarfe's modishly colourful designs are striking, visually integrated , consistently amusing and intermittently engaging. But Hall's story-telling literally comes up against them. When they do not dwarf the human characters, they pose daunting physical hurdles. It is all so much fun that the first indication of anything serious about Mozart's last opera is in the Act 1 finale, when the Priest confronts Tamino on the latter's first approach to the temples. The trials by water and fire seem perfunctory, and there is something Peter Pan-ish about the culminating transformation and would-be enlightenment. When he is not steering his characters through the sets and around the props, Hall achieves some telling strokes with his talented singing actors. Tamino's silence before his uncomprehending Pamina - and the silence he later attempts to enforce from a differently uncomprehending Papageno - are affecting. And the priests' barring Pamina from the temple strikes an original (if somewhat jarringly modern) note. But the production imposes coarseness on moments once senses Hall might otherwise have staged with more finesse. The first view of Monostatos, costumed as a bloated purple frog with a chartreuse, lizard-like head, menacing Pamina who is sporting a white Valkyrie brassiere and an outsized blond wig, has visual overtones of King Kong and Fay Wray that lame both characters. The cast, all in white face, is vocally strong. In what is in effect Papageno's show, Rodney Gilfrey responds with a beautifully voiced, finely inflected yet welcomely unexaggerated bird catcher. Despite a cone-headed red wig, Kurt Streit emerges an ardent, poetic Tamino. Ann Panagulias, in clear, shining voice, is a Pamina of uncommon passion (undercut slightly by a jaunty tempo in 'Ach, Ich fuhl's'). Harry Peters' sympathetic Sarastro, Sumi Jo's accurate, oddly touching Queen of the Night, and Dale Franzen's pert Papagena are rewarding. The chorus is stirring in 'O Isis, und Osiris.' The Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra plays splendidly for Randall Behr. After a somewhat distended overture, the conductor settles for accompaniment over interpretation. Hall's production, his first Flute in 27 years, never quite decides whether it is serious - every word of the German dialogue is included - or popular entertainment. Scarfe's designs determines it: full of effects, but little magic.</p>

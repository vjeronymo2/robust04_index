			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Postal watchdog calls for reforms THE Post Office Users' National Council, the industry's official watchdog, yesterday accused the government of backtracking over its plans to reform the Post Office. Before the last election the government's Citizen's Charter contained proposals to establish mandatory standards and introduce more competition by reducing the monopoly on letters costing less than Pounds 1. The Queen's Speech in May contained no reference to proposals for the Post Office and Mr Tom Corrigan, Pounc chairman, says in the council's annual report: 'For the second time in barely six months the possibility of legally-backed reforms had been shelved.' He argues there should be no loss of momentum in putting charter principles into practice. In particular he does not want to see any stepping back from making the achievement of delivery performance standards mandatory. The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday said it remained committed to reforming the Post Office. It added that while it hopes to bring forward legislation in the next Parliament this would depend on whether other issues took priority. The users council is also concerned at the closure of 200, mainly rural, Post Offices in the past year and called for better consultation with local people. Mr Corrigan says: 'We recognise there must be commercial realism but that must be balanced with social needs.' The Post Office said the views of local people were always taken into account before an office was closed.</p>

			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Lamont to act on project funding: Budget statement likely to ease logjam on private-sector financing MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is expected to act in tomorrow's Budget statement to answer concern in the construction and banking sectors that the Treasury has been slow to approve projects involving private sector investment in public sector projects. He is widely expected to refer to the Pounds 300m plan by British Rail and BAA, the airports operator, to build an express rail from London to Heathrow airport. He may announce other projects. Construction companies and investment bankers have become frustrated by the length of time it is taking to get projects approved, and are concerned that there is a gulf between the Treasury and potential investors over what should constitute a reasonable balance between risk and reward. Officials and ministers outside the Treasury are irritated that despite fresh impetus given to the initiative by Mr Lamont in the public spending statement last November, little progress has been made on schemes which have been put forward. They accept that the new Treasury guidelines on private finance were published only in December, but believe some suggestions are being dismissed without being given proper consideration. In particular, there is concern over the Birmingham western orbital toll road, where the government has indicated that it might allow joint funding arrangements. The four interested consortia say they have been waiting for specific proposals since the autumn statement. Mr Patrick de Pelet head of project finance at Kleinwort Benson merchant bank, said: 'There is a lack of momentum and a danger that companies which have invested large sums of money gaining experience and building up teams could become disenchanted. 'A lot of other countries are looking to finance infrastructure investment privately. British companies and banks have a good track record in this field and it is important that this reputation be maintained. Opportunity for much needed infrastructure at home and export orders abroad, could be lost.' Mr John Hackett, director general of the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors, said the industry had appeared to be making real progress when the Treasury published its guidelines permitting private companies and public authorities to invest jointly in projects. 'Since then there have been plenty of suggestions but no real progress. It is not clear who is in charge of the private finance initiative.' The Treasury vehemently rejects this criticism, emphasising that talks are progressing on how the initiative might apply in the health and prison services and that some Scottish schemes, including a proposal for a privately financed Forth road bridge, have been announced.

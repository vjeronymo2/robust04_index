			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / International Company News: Fokker in the red but sees first signs of recovery FOKKER, the Dutch aircraft maker majority-owned by Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) of Germany, reported a net loss of Fl 127m (Dollars 65m) for the first half of 1993 and reaffirmed earlier forecasts of a full-year loss of around Fl 150m. The first-half loss, which compares with a small profit of Fl 5.9m a year earlier, includes a one-off charge of Fl 90m for cutting staff in line with a reduction in aircraft output. Turnover fell by 8 per cent to Fl 1.73bn and operating profit before interest expenses to Fl 55.1m from Fl 62.8m. The company said that recent orders received for its 100-seat Fokker 100 were a first sign that parts of the depressed aircraft market was starting to recover.</p>

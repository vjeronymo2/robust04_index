			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "`Future Large Aircraft Launch </F> Possible Without British,' Says Gallois"]    [Text] Nice -- The launch of the European military  transport aircraft, the FLA [Future Large Aircraft], is possible  even if Britain does not order it and even if British industry  does not play a part in its production, according to the view  put forward on 7 May by Aerospatiale Group President Louis  Gallois.    "We would like to have the British with us for industrial  reasons -- the manufacture of the wings -- commercial reasons --  a potential British order for 60 aircraft -- and for the sake of  the Airbus system's credibility," Gallois stated, "but we could  still do it if they do not join us".    The FLA project -- for which pre-feasibility studies were  begun at the end of 1993 by the four partner countries in the  Airbus consortium (France, Germany, Britain, and Spain) as well  as by Italy, Portugal, Turkey, and Belgium, which are all  members of the Euroflag consortium -- recently received funding  in France worth 2 billion French francs [Fr], allocated by the  military planning legislation for 1995-2000.    This military transport aircraft, which should allow the  Europeans to remain independent and not have to purchase  American equipment -- the Hercules C-130J manufactured by  Lockheed -- or Russian aircraft -- the Antonov-77 -- has a  market estimated by Aerospatiale at 300 aircraft: 60 to 80 for  France, 75 for Germany, 40 to 50 for Italy, 39 for Spain, 33 for  Turkey, 10 for Portugal, between 13 and 18 for Belgium, and  around 60 for Britain. The British must in fact choose, before  the end of the year, the name of the aircraft due to replace  half their fleet of aging C-130s. The members of Euroflag,  including British Aerospace, naturally support the FLA against  the C-130J proposed by Lockheed, which is available at an  earlier date.    "If they buy 30 C-130Js in the first phase, the industrial  effect of keeping a uniform fleet will be so great that they  will be persuaded to take the EC-130 for the second phase,  especially since they will have enabled Lockheed to restart its  production lines," Gallois predicted. In addition, "if Britain  does not come to us, it will not be possible to assign the work  to British industry. Taxpayers in continental countries would  never put up with the idea of financing work being carried out  in Britain".    In response to accusations of excessively high prices,  Gallois said that the manufacturers "were setting themselves the  challenge" of offering 300 aircraft at the same price as the  C-130J (an estimated Fr300 million).</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / International Company News: Japan's steel makers see sharp falls JAPAN'S leading steel makers forecast falls in pre-tax profit of more than 70 per cent, as demand from the car and construction industry falters and diversification programmes remain a burden on earnings. Nippon Steel, the world's largest steel maker, forecasts a 72 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y28bn (Dollars 24m) in the year ending this month, and a 9 per cent fall in sales to Y2,390bn, as increased competition in international markets reduces margins and domestic sales fall. The company said Japanese steel production was likely to decline some 8 per cent this year, in spite of heavy demand from China, where a construction boom has led to a four-fold rise in imports from Japan, compared with a year earlier. Three makers - NKK, Kawasaki Steel, and Sumitomo Metal Industries - forecast a net profit of zero, while all expect sharply lower pre-tax profits: NKK at Y5bn, down from Y37.5bn; Kawasaki at Y7.5bn, down from Y43bn; and Sumitomo at Y5bn, down from Y40.5bn. Kobe Steel said it expects sales of Y1,180bn and a pre-tax profit of Y14bn, compared with Y1,301bn and Y47.7bn in the previous period. It said that net profit, forecast at Y12bn, would be bolstered by extraordinary gains on sales of property and stocks. Each of the leading five makers has suffered along with the Japanese car industry, which expects sales in the coming fiscal year to rise by a slim 1.6 per cent. Although construction orders will be assisted by a planned increase in infra-structure spending, a large inventory of materials has already been accumulated and steel production appears likely to drop again next year. With core profits under pressure, the companies are reviewing diversification programmes launched during the mid-1980s in an attempt to reduce their reliance on steel production. The plunge in earnings this year suggests that these new areas have yet to produce the additional profits that were foreseen when the investments were made.</p>

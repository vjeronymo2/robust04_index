This was  the message from IFP Central Committee member Walter Felgate,  following renewed optimism that the party might contest the  April poll. On Monday, senior IFP negotiator Ben Ngubane said  the IFP had yet to decide on participation in the country's  first all-race poll. "Far from being out of the elections,  Inkatha has yet to decide on participation," Dr Ngubane  reportedly said in Kimberley on Monday.    But Mr Felgate said Dr Ngubane's statement was no different  to the IFP's official stance on elections: "There's no change in  the IFP's position. I don't know why there is confusion. The  position of the IFP is unless the December 19 (Freedom Alliance)  amendments to the constitution are accepted, we will not enter  elections. Talks on mediation are under way and if mediation  results in changes to the constitution, then I believe it will  be in the national interest to ensure timetables are adjusted."    He said talks between the IFP and African National Congress  on mediation would continue on Wednesday. Mr Felgate added that  the IFP would "most certainly not" submit a candidate list by  Wednesday's 4.30PM deadline.    IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi also said in Kimberley on  Monday that his party was serious about contesting elections,  but not before its constitutional demands were met. "We are not  prepared to commit ourselves to fighting the election until the  ANC makes a sincere commitment to address our demands," he said.    On the printing of ballot papers without the IFP's name,  Inkatha MP Farouk Cassim said on Tuesday: "There's no good  reason why they couldn't keep this open. They can't exclude us  knowing mediation is taking place. We don't see the time limits  as more important than a solution. Any artificial time limits  can have very negative results for the country. When we are so  close, we should go that extra half a metre," he said. Mr  Cassim said mediation on constitutional disputes was imminent  and progress was being made on the Zulu king's demands, which  the IFP has also said must be resolved.    Meanwhile, IFP national spokesman Ziba Jiyane said he  believed the IFP was "out" of the April elections. "It does  seem like we are not participating," he said on Tuesday. On  speculation he might leave the IFP for another party contesting  the poll, he replied: "Nothing could be further from the truth."</p>

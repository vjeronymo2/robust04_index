			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 19 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam's  government, evaluating its own achievements in its first year,  claimed Saturday it has succeeded above all in planting roots of  democracy firmly in this country. The presidential office at  Chongwadae said it has also managed to revitalize the nation's  economy through eradication of corruption and irregularities and  adoption of the real-name financial transaction system.    If the overriding goal of President Kim's five-year term is  to build a "new Korea" by boosting international  competitiveness, the first year was spent in firming up the  foundation, said Chongwadae in a report issued Saturday on the  first year of the Kim administration. The nation's first  democratically elected president, Kim marks the first  anniversary of his administration on Feb. 25. The report,  however, acknowledged that there had been criticism of "the  president's solo performance" evidenced by his strong leadership.    It admitted that the Kim administration has been charged  with  sapping the country's economy and social activities by enforcing  an anti-corruption campaign aimed at settling old scores. It  also acknowledged that confusion among government agencies has  arose concerning follow-up measures to the real-name sysytem,  the uruguay round of trade negotiations and the North Korean  nuclear issue. But the Kim administration has courageously  excised rotten parts of society and wiped out corruption and  social injustice accumulated under the authoritarian governments  of former army generals over three decades, it said.    The administration's efforts to clean up the country were  made possible through investigation that does not allow  sanctuary and by strengthening the government's investigative  functions, the report said.    The civilian government has undertaken a series of lightning  reshuffles and purges of military officers, who had long enjoyed  special status under previous administrations, it said. The Kim  administration has also disbanded the once powerful private  political organization in the military, known as "Hana-hoe."  The daring military reform was carried out despite concerns  that it could harm the morale of officers and soldiers alike, it  said.    With regard to political reform, the report noted that the  Kim administration managed to clean up corruption through public  disclosure of the personal assets of lawmakers as well as other  public servants. A revision of the ethics law for public  servants and political reform bills to be taken up by the  National Assembly are other significant achievements, it said.    On the nation's economy, the report said the growth rate  perked up to 5 percent in 1993, up from 3 percent in the second  half of 1992. The country has also registered a trade surplus  for the first time in four years. The administration, however,  recognizes the criticism leveled against excessive economic  stimulus measures and its alleged failure at the Uruguay Round  of global trade negotiations, which forced the opening of the  rice market to imports, it said.    As for future tasks facing the administration, the report  cited the need to strenghten the country's competitiveness by  expanding social infrastructure and comprehensive relaxation of  administrative regulations. Early adoption of political reform  bills, education reform, stablization of consumer prices, and  improvement in inter-Korean relations are other issues the  administration will have to tackle in the near future, it said.</p>

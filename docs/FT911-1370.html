			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / The Week Ahead: First-quarter loss of Pounds 50m expected at BP - Results Due British Petroleum is expected to announce on Thursday a loss of around Pounds 50m for the first quarter, compared with a Pounds 344m profit for the comparable period on the historic cost basis. However, if changes in the value of oil stocks are stripped out, the accounting method favoured by the group, the company is expected to show a small increase in profits of around Pounds 35m. The first quarter's stock losses are expected to be as much as Pounds 425m compared with Pounds 70m last year. Trafalgar House, the construction, property, shipping and hotels group, is expected to announce on Wednesday a fall in profits from Pounds 117m to around Pounds 40m for the six months to March. The fall in profits is primarily due to the downturn in commercial property sales and the effects of the Gulf war on its hotels and ships. Last year's figures also included the lease of the QE2 liner to the Japanese. After losing out to Otto Versand in the bidding war for Next's Grattan mail order business, Sears, the retailing conglomerate has been left looking rather forlorn. That impression may only be strengthened when the company announces its full-year results on Thursday showing pre-tax profits of about Pounds 110m, a severe reversal on the Pounds 231.4m it achieved the year before. Analysts will be keen to see what happens to the dividend. It seems likely that it will be maintained but only with the thinnest cover. Tate and Lyle, the world's largest sweeteners group which is trying to take over Bundaberg Sugar of Australia, should report pre-tax interim profits on Wednesday of Pounds 92.5m against Pounds 87.5m last year despite an adverse movement of the dollar - the group makes 60 per cent of pre-tax profit in the US. Other major companies reporting next week include Jefferson Smurfit, the Irish packaging group, on Tuesday, and SmithKline Beecham , the drugs maker, on Wednesday.

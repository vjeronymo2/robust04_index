			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Restaurants: A small price for cash flow a two-course set lunch for Pounds 5 - will offer readers real gastronomic value. But what will it cost the restaurateurs and why have 131 restaurants agreed to participate? Once the Pounds 5 has been stripped of its value added tax element, restaurants will receive Pounds 4.25 for every two-course, or in some cases three-course, meal served. Not a significant amount of money, as any householder knows, to buy the raw ingredients, cover fixed costs and pay the wages of those in the kitchen and front of house, even allowing for economies of scale. Fixed costs at La Truffe Noire, a busy City restaurant near London Bridge and one of the participating restaurants in the FT offer, are a good example. Its annual fixed overheads are Pounds 165,000, consisting of Pounds 36,000 rent, Pounds 14,000 business rates, Pounds 100,000 in national insurance and salaries, while gas, water, telephone, laundry and depreciation costs add a further Pounds 15,000. The restaurant serves 13,500 customers a year so that each cover costs Pounds 12.22 before any food is served. If the restaurant could increase its dinner trade by 40 per cent, its fixed costs would drop dramatically to Pounds 7.50 per cover. 'More bums on seats', as restaurateurs say, is the answer to many restaurants' financial problems. As in so many other businesses in the UK, income, although often higher than expected, is not rising as fast as costs. The options open to restaurants are far more limited than to many others in the retail trade. The age-old maxim that you never see a good restaurant advertise may no longer be as valid as it once was but the most effective advertising rates are still far too high for individual restaurateurs to contemplate. Public relations companies are expensive and often counter-productive and, although many new restaurants have followed the example of theatres with 'preview prices', the policy has obvious limitations. Nor can restaurants merely lower their prices to attract more customers. Such a long-term reduction has to mean a similar decrease in the quality of food and service. Once a restaurant pursues this policy - unless it actually changes its identity from restaurant to brasserie, as a number did in 1992 - it only alienates established customers and confuses new ones. One solution to reducing fixed overheads - and one of the major attractions of the FT scheme for restaurateurs - is to promote their quiet periods aggressively . Many restaurateurs have successfully stimulated trade on Monday evenings, notoriously the quietest night of the week, with wine tastings and special dinners and far more restaurants open seven days a week to spread fixed costs. The FT 'Lunch for a Fiver' will, for many restaurateurs, enliven the dull period that follows a hectic start to a new year, a period that can last until Easter. Even in better economic times, this often proves the most difficult period in which to manage a restaurant. Morale sags when restaurants are quiet, tips are considerably lower, bills keep rolling in from pre-Christmas heavy purchases and staff still have to be paid, particularly the good ones who are always sought after. Fresh produce must be bought and served fresh - most good restaurants aim to turn their perishable stock over every 48 hours - and suppliers must be paid promptly to ensure quality supplies. The January sales, which attract so much publicity, had no equivalent in the restaurant trade until the arrival of the FT 'Lunch for a Fiver' scheme. But now restaurants have to compete directly with so many other retailers, all of whom are chasing a finite amount of disposable income, restaurateurs need to generate cash flow and customer goodwill to cover marginal costs and make some positive contribution to their fixed overheads. This is the new economic reality for restaurateurs in the 1990s. The FT 'Lunch for a Fiver' will, they hope, create interest and goodwill and generate demand for what they all expect will be a difficult trading year. On December 30, I wished a friend who runs a 50-seater restaurant participating in this scheme a prosperous 1993. His response was succinct. 'If we break even in 1993, we will be happy.'</p>

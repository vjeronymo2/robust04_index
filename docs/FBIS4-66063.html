			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Henri Conze, head of the General Delegation </F> for Armaments, by Dominique Garraud; place and date not given:  "Henri Conze: `We Were Coming Up Against a Brick Wall'"]    [Text] Henri Conze, who is close to Edouard Balladur, is  head of the General Delegation for Armaments (DGA). He is  calling for a "cultural revolution" in the arms industry to  prevent "structural disarmament."    [Garraud] The government is counting on the enterprises to  improve their productivity by 2 percent in order to successfully  implement the Military Programming Law. Does this strike you as  feasible?    [Conze] I am satisfied by this measure. What is being asked  for is 2 percent in addition to the normal productivity  increases by enterprises through better coordination of all the  actions of the general staffs, the DGA, and the industrialists,  who all have to adopt new directions.    This measure was necessary because we were coming up against  a brick wall. If we had remained with the bad habits which have  existed for decades, we were heading for structural disarmament.  Spending on equipment between 1980 and the year 2000 has been  virtually constant at around 100 billion francs [Fr] at the 1994  value. What is the cost of a helicopter, a plane, a frigate in  1980 and the year 2004? Between these two dates, the ratio is  one to three. This means that in the year 2020, we will have  one-third of the number of fighter planes, helicopters... We  therefore had to get out of this structural disarmament and  start to make an effort, launch a cultural revolution which must  be continued.    [Garraud] Will this imply less sophistication in the new  equipment, like the future NH-90 helicopter or the Rafale plane?    [Conze] The NH-90 will be radically reviewed in cooperation  with our partners. With regard to the Rafale, we will make a  new analysis of the costs. We will ask ourselves certain  questions again to ensure that the plane corresponds as closely  as possible to Air Force requirements, at the lowest possible  cost. I cannot predict the answers. For decades we gave  priority to performance at all costs. As we go into the new  millenium, the problem is presented in different terms.    [Garraud] How have the industrialists reacted?    [Conze] It will take time for the message to be understood.  On a fairly large number of programs now being implemented, we  will very shortly have to make a functional analysis and an  analysis of the value of these programs. The aim is once again  to ask ourselves the question: Are all the functions stipulated  for the product still valid? But the further advanced the  program is, the more difficult it is to change it. I do not  want to frighten anybody, but we will be faced with choices on a  number of programs.    [Garraud] Some deputies of the majority think that the DGA's  intervention in the programs is too costly...    [Conze] The cost of the DGA's intervention is 10 percent of  equipment spending. Five percent is devoted to the actual  functioning of the DGA. The other 5 percent corresponds to the  DGA's intervention in the sphere of tests, evaluation,  monitoring, and program expertise. It is justified by the  advantages gained by having a capacity for opposition to  industrialists, who are often in the position of having a  monopoly. This does not mean that there is no need to make an  effort to reduce this intervention cost. Henceforth the program  directors will establish contractual relations with the DGA  centers to see whether this intervention is necessary and  whether, here too, productivity cannot be improved.    [Garraud] Some people suggest that the DGA should abandon  its role as project manager in many programs. Are you  considering that?    [Conze] We are wondering about it. Project management is  not one of the DGA's responsibilities, but in practice it took  this role when, 25 years ago, General de Gaulle launched major  programs and France had neither the technologies nor the  industrial network to implement them. Thus, the DGA often has a  project management role in practice rather than in law: We have  built strategic missiles, tactical missiles, and so forth. The  project management and technological capabilities now exist in  industry. We must continue to develop and transfer to industry  as much know-how as possible on the equipment which they are  manufacturing. This is not so easy. There is a happy medium to  be found between project management responsibilities and the  industrial policy which is the DGA's responsibility. The move  toward less intervention by the DGA will therefore be slow.</p>

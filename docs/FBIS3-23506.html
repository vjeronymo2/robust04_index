			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Technical Sciences Major-General V. </F> Menshikov under the rubric "The Cosmodromes: Rockets and  People": "Rocket Test Personnel"]    [Text]  <H6>  The Unskilled Workers of Space Science </H6>   The test and operational personnel at the cosmodrome were  called the "the unskilled workers of the Earth." A song written  by local composers even has the words, "The unskilled workers of  the Earth are launching ships into space..."    But far from everyone knows that Baykonur also has  "unskilled  workers' unskilled workers." People dear to my heart and  soul--the officers, warrant officers, sergeants and soldiers of  the units for combat support and maintenance. They include  repair and reconditioning, railroad, power and water battalions,  subunits for the heat and power systems, oxygen and nitrogen,  bread-baking and many others. They are to the cosmodrome as air  is to people--you don't notice it as long as you are breathing,  but cut it off and you suffocate at once.    Everything "hangs" on these battalions--the launches of the  rockets, the well-being of the test personnel and their  families, the normal life of the city of Leninsk, the launch  pads--you can't list them all. The main incentive for their  personnel is not to get chewed out by their superior officers.    Imagine Baykonur in the forty-degree heat without water. It  is not for nothing that they say in the water battalion that  they pump the blood through the arteries of the cosmodrome. And  there is no exaggeration there. It is in fact the life's blood  of Baykonur.    The sergeants and soldiers have recently been receiving, for  these heavy labors, pay that is 200--300 times less than that of  their civilian colleagues.    But weather and climatic calamities remain the most terrible  of all for the support battalions.    July of 1988. The winds around the main substation of the  cosmodrome seemed enough to blow all of Kazakhstan away. The  wind speeds were more than forty meters a second, lightning was  flashing constantly, the peals of thunder were rocking the broad  expanse of the steppe. The hurricane winds, in a wild dance,  even bent, twisted, broke off and twisted into a "ram's horn"  the huge and strong towers for the electric-power lines as if  they were made of nothing. The roofs of substation buildings  were torn off, and windows and doors were knocked out. Powerful  concrete towers were toppled like matches. I and German  Stepanovich Titov, at the time the first deputy chief of the  space units, got through with difficulty to the stricken  substation so as to check out the situation at the scene. There  was so much rain water that it poured over the door sills of the  Volga and flooded the passenger compartment. It felt like the  car was floating rather than driving down the concrete road.  This was in the desert! No one would believe it.    The cosmodrome and city of Leninsk were left without  electricity and water. In the disaster area they scraped up some  vehicles and brought in the power battalion of Major S.  Fedorenko. The battle with the natural disaster lasted almost  the entire day. The first two towers were restored, and the city  received a partial supply of water and light. Power was supplied  to all the facilities on the cosmodrome after five continuous  days of hellish labors. They slept for four or five hours right  at the work sites, because they understood that a cosmodrome  without power was a dead cosmodrome. Captain O. Godlevskiy and  Senior Warrant Officer P. Gonzilovskiy stayed up in the rebuilt  towers of the power lines for 18 hours a day, installing  insulator strings passed to them on the LEP-220 towers.    Who can say whether this was heroism or not? For me, it  unequivocally was. And thankfully no one cursed the power  workers.    A January night in 1991. I awake from a heart-rending  wail--the safety valves had been triggered at the city's TETs  [heat and electric-power plant], which was also serviced by the  military. I grab one telephone--silence; a second--the same.  Everything became clear--the TETs was "at zero." I looked at my  watch--just after three. I open the hot-water tap--empty; the  cold--not a drop.    And now I understood that the whole power system of the  cosmodrome, and not only the TETs, was out of service. Outside,  thank God, it was only minus five degrees. Thinking quickly, I  saw that if power could not be fed to the pumps in 18 hours, we  would have to pour out the water, in the most direct sense. I  got the creeps--God forbid.    I ran to the TETs with the other officers. The cause of the  accident was ascertained--a rupture in a pipe 1,200 mm in  diameter near the 35-kV substation. The substation was flooded,  the TETs was not operating and it was impossible to hook into  the outside grid of the power system. And that meant that all of  the boilers at the cosmodrome would stop in an hour, since there  would be no water.    The city and the cosmodrome were sleeping and dreaming. The  "unskilled workers" of the battalion, the hard-working  battalions, the invisible great laborers, went into action. It  was they who started up the diesels, put the flooded substation  back into shape, turned on the boilers and turbines. Behind  every pump, boiler, valve or switch there was a soldier or  officer. It was they who "warmed" the sleeping citizenry. But by  two o'clock in the afternoon they had already been forgotten,  since the city was receiving water and light. A few knew that  people were then working for another seven days straight so as  to make everything right.    And what a nightmare frequently begins for the support  battalions in the summer, when 15--20 cables suddenly burst into  flames simultaneously owing to the two- or three-fold  overloading in the forty-degree heat (in the shade), leaving  150--200 homes and service buildings without electric power.  Phone calls, insults, blow-ups by superiors, complaints from  residents...    But as soon as the electric power is restored through three  or four days of continuous labor by soldiers and officers under  the searing sun, everything settles down again. And no one cares  that the cables have been lying in ground permeated by salt for  35 years, when the standard is ten, and that is under normal  operating conditions. It is also not taken into account that the  demands on the power system are two or three times the maximum  possible according to the design (the city and the cosmodrome,  after all, have grown to 100,000 people). How much grief and  misfortune has been caused people by this rotted-through  equipment built at some time under the "whatever's-left-over"  principle?  <H6>  Tragedy at the KAZ </H6>   The end of December 1985--a year of great catastrophes. They  affected the Baykonur cosmodrome as well. Two days before the  new year, at the end of the day, the chief engineer of the  oxygen-nitrogen plant [KAZ], A. Kozharov, reported that "there  has been an explosion at the KAZ, someone has been killed, we  are investigating."    I went immediately to the plant. I heard the rest of the  report: "There was an explosion during the welding of a barrier  in the shop. One soldier has been killed, and about thirty have  been injured." I went into the shop, or more precisely what was  left of it. There was enormous hole about thirty meters in  diameter where the ceiling used to be. Chaos, a heap of  mutilated structural elements. A terrible picture, I had never  seen anything like it. Among the debris were the shattered  remains of the soldier, who had been thrown by the wave of the  explosion into the concrete ceiling, where a bloody spot was  visible. I had never seen a human death in such a naked form. I  felt queasy and left the shop quickly. The injured--27 officers,  sergeants and soldiers--were already being taken off to the  hospital by medical vehicles. That was the price of the  explosion. A cruel price.    I began to look into the causes. It turned out that  Oxyliquit--a mixture of oxygen with organic substances--had  exploded. Long ago, back during the construction of the plant,  the wooden framing had been left in the shop out of either haste  or neglect. It had become a delayed-action bomb in the direct  sense of the word. An oxygen drainage pipe ran over that  framing, and it had seeped through the concrete into the wooden  boards. This meant that a "bomb" had been erected. The sparks  from the welding were enough for the tragedy to occur. The shop  had been in operation for about 30 years--three times longer  than planned. It had been proposed to be closed and written off  many times. But it was producing its five tonnes of oxygen a  day, and somebody higher up liked that; the documents for  closing the shop were invariably returned to the cosmodrome. I  would like to look the construction inspector in the eye who had  "not noticed" the framing left in the concrete floor. After all,  he knew full well, the bastard, that this was categorically  forbidden, that is why he was assigned there, after all.  <H6>  The Cognac of the Construction Workers </H6>   I would like to say, for the sake of objectivity, that the  greater portion of the blame for such tragedies should be  assumed by the test personnel of the cosmodrome who took part in  the servicing of various systems and equipment. Once I was  included on a commission to accept a "Greek  hall"--accommodations for American astronauts and guests--from  the military construction personnel. The basic work had already  been completed, only little things remained--a week of work and  it could be turned over ready to go. But they wanted to turn it  over a little sooner, and "brighten up" the bonus. The system  for turning over facilities by construction workers is not a new  one, but someone, to put it bluntly, was acting with a great  deal of inventiveness. They made particular use of the "current  moment of profound love and devotion to their dear party and the  wise Politburo, headed by the latest true Leninist."    The commission gathered at one of its last sessions--matters  were moving toward completion. We went into the "Greek hall" for  the next session, and there were tables so covered you couldn't  believe it. The members of the commission objected weakly--it's  not time yet, we have to finish our work. Nothing of the kind!  The chief of the UNR [office of the work supervisor] promptly  poured cognac into the glasses and, ignoring the objections of  the commission members, gave a rousing toast: "To our dear party  and our dear Soviet government!"    Try not to drink and they would stick you where they had  to--you would end up a dissident. The next toast--"To the  General Secretary," then "To the unity of the army and the  people," and then any document was signed without reservation.  Since many members of the working commission were also on the  State Commission, matters were considered closed--the "Greek  hall" was accepted. Welcome, American astronauts.  <H6>  How Good It Is to Be a General </H6>   Time passed, and I progressed in the service, got a little  older and wiser and got used to cosmodrome service, life and  living. It was only impossible to get used to the heat or the  cold. It got easier to endure, true, as I advanced along the  service ladder. First I lived in a "pencil-box"--a twelve-meter  room in a two-room apartment. Then one-, two- and three-room  apartments. Seventeen years on the top--fifth--floor. The  greatest torments were in the summer months. Many of the test  personnel sent their families off to "the great land" during  that time.    The main problem during those times was to somehow get some  sleep after a difficult work day. It was hellishly stuffy in the  apartment. Everything was hot, even the doorknobs and dishes,  nothing was cool enough. There was one way out--cover up with a  wet sheet and try to sleep until it dried out. It got cooler  toward the middle of the night. We went quickly to the balcony,  on a folding bed. Even though the mosquitoes were a problem,  they were tolerable, you could fall asleep by three at night.  "And in the morning, the gasoline locomotive again," as they  sing in the well-known Baykonur song.    The locomotive! The great cosmodrome "hoe" in which the test  personnel spent 10--20 percent of their lives while they were  serving at Baykonur. The cars of the locomotives in the 1960s  were very clean and very hot. It became cool and dirty in the  modern cars with air conditioning. That is how scientific and  technical progress and the decline in the cultural level and  cultivation of the test personnel was reflected in the  hard-working gasoline locomotive. What were the test personnel  doing in the locomotives? Reading, playing chess and cards,  sleeping. And arguing, arguing, arguing. About space and about  their own difficult life, the fate of the military before and  after pensions, universal problems and... the best recipe for  diluting alcohol. And, of course, about women. And what  locomotive folklore of the test personnel there was! Where are  you, poets and writers? There are very rich, untapped strata for  your righteous labors here. Take a look, take a ride there and  back. You will hear more than you could write in a lifetime.    I was hugely lucky in my last three years of service at the  cosmodrome--I lived, in accordance with my official position, in  the "wooden town" built at one time for the supervisors of the  cosmodrome. What can I say? It is correct what they say in the  song, of course: "How good it is to be a general..." An  excellent cottage, a garden in the yard, fruit trees and grapes.  The temperature in the rooms was four or five degrees lower than  in the brick houses.    And one wonders what kept them from building such housing  then, at the very beginning, for all of the test personnel, and  not just for the supervisors. Relaxing in the yard under the  grapes for even just an hour in the evening gives you quite a  different attitude toward the service, a different look at  cosmodrome life. But most of the officers and soldiers still  have to test themselves along with the rockets under the  constant blows of the harsh climate of the Kazakh steppes, to  which a Russian person is unaccustomed.

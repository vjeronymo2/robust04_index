			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Irish PM calls for greater push to win vote THE Irish government yesterday confirmed that the country's referendum on the Maastricht treaty would go ahead as planned on June 18. Mr Albert Reynolds, prime minister, called for a 'redoubling' of efforts to secure a 'yes' vote, warning: 'The attention of Europe will be on us.' He said that the crisis over the treaty was 'a Danish problem', but it was clear that the government fears Ireland would lose by a collapse of the treaty. Ministers are hopeful that a mechanism for going ahead with most of its proposals will be found, without Denmark if necessary. 'Clearly our partners are not going to abandon the treaty,' Mr Reynolds said. Although there appears to be no more than a sizeable minority in Ireland against the treaty, the cabinet, which met yesterday, is concerned that a postponement of the referendum would send the wrong signals. However, Mr Bertie Ahern, finance minister, acknowledged that the Danish 'no' vote would 'liven up' the Irish debate, which has also become embroiled in a row over the country's abortion laws. Speaking in parliament, Mr Reynolds expressed 'deep regret' at the Danish result and warned that the financial impact on that country, including higher interest rates and a withdrawal of investment funds, could be felt in Ireland if it also voted 'no'. The prime minister added: 'A 'no' vote does have serious economic consequences, even for a more highly developed economy than our own. Our essential national interests have not changed overnight because of the Danish result.' Ireland stands to receive cohesion funds worth about IPounds 6bn (Pounds 5.45bn) over five years through the Maastricht treaty. Ministers are anxious that negotiations on the funds continue. Mr Reynolds said he could not over-emphasise how a resounding 'yes' would enhance Ireland's standing in Europe and its negotiating position. 'The European union treaty, and our full participation in it, will provide major benefits for us, such as a boost to economic growth, more jobs, narrowing of disparities in living standards, improvements in workers' and womens' rights, protection of the environment, as well as a strengthening the community's role as a core of stability in Europe.' Mr John Bruton, leader of the opposition Fine Gael party, backed the decision to go ahead with the June 18 poll and said that a re-negotiation of Maastricht would be unlikely to work to Ireland's advantage.</p>

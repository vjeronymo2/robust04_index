			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Samsung Electronics, the nation's leading  semiconductor manufacturer, will establish a joint chip  production plant in Portugal with Texas Instruments (TI) of the  United States, the company announced yesterday. Samsung is the  first Korean semiconductor firm to build an overseas production  plant. Under an agreement on capital ties, Samsung and TI will  invest a total of $50 million to expand a TI plant in Porto,  northern Portugal, according to the company.    At the plant, TI has been producing low value-added  nonmemory  chips. Samsung and TI will equip the plant with advanced  semiconductor production facilities. Samsung will concentrate  on 4M and 16M DRAM memory chips for sale in European countries,  while TI will produce high value-added logic chips, according to  the company. The plant will begin operations in the second half  of this year. With the facilities, Samsung will be able to  expand semiconductor exports to European countries without being  embroiled in trade disputes, a company spokesman said.    Samsung and TI reached the agreement on the joint-venture  plant last December and have been waiting for the go-ahead from  the Portuguese Government. The two obtained approval recently.    The agreement basically concerns capital ties for the plant  and hence does not involve technological or business  cooperation. But the two intend to increase their ties in the  future, according to a company spokesman.    Last November, Samsung signed an accord on technological  cooperation with Micron Technology of the United States for the  development of the next-generation memory chips. Taken  together, the two agreements laid the foundation for closer  cooperation between the United States and Korea in the field of  semiconductors, the company said.</p>

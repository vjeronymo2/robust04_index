			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 8 Jan (XINHUA) -- The results of the  individual appraisal of the country's first batch of intangible  assets were announced in Beijing today. Prices were set for the  goodwill, trademarks, and products of six Chinese and foreign  enterprises. Great Wall Hotel's goodwill value is 260 million  yuan; Beijing's Yeguangbei Distillery's goodwill value is over  53 million yuan; Hainan Provincial Airlines' goodwill value is  202.9 million yuan; Hainan's Pisike [0572 2448 0344]  International Air Sightseeing Club's goodwill value is 107  million yuan.    Sun Yuehuan, general manager of the Beijing Jiacheng Assets  Appraisal Company, which announced the aforementioned results,  told this reporter that the so-called intangible assets refer to  copyright, patent rights, service trademarks, trademark rights,  goodwill, and other nonmaterial assets. He said: The value of  the intangible assets of many world-renowned enterprises is much  higher than the value of their tangible assets and annual sales  volumes. In China, people currently have not placed adequate  importance on intangible assets. The value of the intangible  assets of some enterprises with high goodwill, famous  trademarks, and well-known brand names is very high; if their  intangible assets are neglected in property right transactions  and in other economic activities, their economic losses will be  enormous.    Some experts have said: As China opens its doors wider to  the  outside world, as enterprises strive to develop modern  management systems, and as market competition becomes fiercer,  increasing numbers of enterprises will place greater importance  on their intangible assets. Intangible assets are an important  factor for making investment in foreign countries, for  reorganizing enterprises into joint stock companies, for  protecting enterprises' own interests, and for expanding  enterprises' influence. When an enterprise's property rights  are transferred due to making joint investment or to merger,  reorgnization, or sale of the enterprise, its intangible assets,  which do not appear on its account, must not be overlooked if  the value of its property is to be correctly estimated.</p>

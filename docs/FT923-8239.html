			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Kuwait may be ready for Arab deterrent force HASTILY ARRANGED visits this week to Egypt and to Syria by Sheikh Salem al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti foreign minister, have prompted speculation that the Gulf emirate may be ready to accept the presence of an Arab deterrent force on its soil to counter renewed Iraqi threats. Sheikh Salem said on his arrival in Damascus yesterday that his talks with his Syrian counterpart and with President Hafez al-Assad would focus on Iraq's 'false claims' and also its challenge to security council ceasefire resolutions. In defiance of UN resolutions, Baghdad used the August 2 anniversary of Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait to renew its claim to the tiny emirate, thereby raising fresh tensions throughout the Gulf. Egypt and Syria have been pressing for the implementation of the Damascus declaration of March 1991, which laid out a programme of economic and security co-operation between the two powerful Arab states and the six members of the Gulf Co-operation Council - Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain. Under the accord, signed in the aftermath of the war, Egypt and Syria would supply troops to the Gulf to deter further aggression in return for financial assistance, including investment in their lagging economies. However, after the declaration was signed the Iraqi threat receded and the Gulf states were unable to agree on deployment of a deterrent force. Several GCC members expressed reservations out of concern for a semi-permanent presence of Arab troops on their soil. Egypt and Syria were part of the US-led multinational force which expelled Iraq from Kuwait in February 1990. Both expressed irritation over the Gulf states' apparent reluctance to implement the accord. Sheikh Salem said implementation of the accord would be discussed at a meeting of Gulf foreign ministers in Qatar on September 9. Defending delays in the implementation of the Damascus declaration, Sheikh Salem said: 'If there was a postponement it was due to special circumstances and not to disbelief in the principle of the declaration. We all have full agreement on the declaration with all its security, economic and political sides.'</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Doubt cast on Heseltine's effectiveness When Mr Bill Cockburn, Post Office chief executive, voiced his frustration last week over the government's failure to decide whether to privatise his organisation, he was echoing wider feelings about the Department of Trade and Industry. The 21-month delay in his case is among the longest for a stalled DTI initiative. But several other important measures have been pending for long enough to cause uncertainty and raise questions about the effectiveness of Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. Some of the delay is deliberate: the government is anxious to avoid controversial announcements before the local and European elections, and orders have gone out to hold fire where possible. But some of it seems to have been caused by departmental wrangling. Mr Heseltine is committed to privatising Royal Mail. He favours selling its letters and parcels divisions, leaving the counters division  - responsible for post offices  - in the public sector. But powerful voices, such as Lord Wakeham, leader of the House of Lords, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, and Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip, strongly oppose Post Office privatisation. A senior Whitehall official said Mr Heseltine was prepared to compromise by advocating the flotation of a minority stake of Royal Mail and parcels if that would win over ministers opposed to the privatisation. The issue is expected to be debated in cabinet shortly. In the case of the gas industry, Mr Heseltine announced an end to British Gas's monopoly in December, promising a consultation document on a new market structure early this year. Ofgas, the industry regulator, prepared detailed proposals and passed them to the DTI. Several months later, there is still no sign of this document, and the gas industry is becoming anxious. The Society of British Gas Industries, which wrote to Mr Heseltine last week seeking clarification, said it was 'very concerned if the government is now going to say that the date they gave last year is no longer effective'. Industry executives say important investment decisions have been put on hold. There is even concern that de-regulation will not occur before the next election, in which case it may not occur at all. The speculation in gas circles is that Mr Heseltine is beginning to dislike the idea of gas de-regulation, and that the Ofgas proposals were not acceptable to him. The consultation document will be largely technical, but could affect the availability and price of gas in the domestic market. It could also give ammunition to the opposition. So action may be held up until after the elect-ions. A review of the nuclear power industry was first promised 13 months ago as part of the settlement of the coal crisis. It has been repeatedly postponed, most recently at the end of March only hours before the chairmen of the nuclear companies were due to meet Mr Heseltine. At first the DTI blamed the delay on legal challenges to its decision to approve the operation of Thorp, the nuclear reprocessing facility in Cumbria. A further complication has arisen over authorisations for the new nuclear power station at Sizewell. Above this is departmental in-fighting over the review's terms of reference. The state-owned nuclear power industry is keen to have the review because it could pave the way to privatisation. But as delays drag on, some nuclear executives suspect the review could be cancelled as too controversial. Whitehall officials blame the delay in the nuclear review on the protracted struggle between the Treasury and the DTI over whether the industry can be privatised. Unlike the Post Office, Mr Heseltine is strongly opposed to a sale, believing it to be practically and politically unworkable. The DTI also strongly rebuts the Treasury's argument that privatisation of the nuclear industry would not need primary legislation since it was provided for in electricity privatisation. One DTI official said: 'We do not believe that is an accurate reading of the original documents. Any attempt to move the nuclear industry into the private sector without a vote in parliament may lead to a challenge in court.'</p>

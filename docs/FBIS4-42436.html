			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report over video by correspondent Rocco Tolfa] </F>   [Text] Despite the visit of Bill Clinton, today turned out  to be a black day for the ruling coalition, which saw itself  divided and loser of a second battle in the war for the  chairmanships of the Senate committees. Silvio Berlusconi tried  to play down the matter, but the Senate affair is sending shock  waves through the ruling coalition. Rocco Tolfa reports:    [Tolfa] The curtain has fallen on the battle of the  committees and the result leaves little room for doubt; a  clear-cut eight to five victory for the opposition. This is  enough to push the coalition partners into finding those  responsible for the defeat. In the Senate the idea of calling  fresh elections is gaining ground. This specter has been raised  by the Northern League, which is demanding either a  clarification in the ruling coalition or fresh elections. The  National Alliance has also raised the specter of fresh elections.    [Begin Giulio Maceratini recording, shown on video]  Extending  the ruling coalition is a possible option and calling for fresh  elections is another possibility. Certainly, as things stand it  is impossible to govern the country. [end recording]    [Tolfa] The climate is certainly one of settling scores. The  Northern League has called Forza Italia and the National  Alliance amateurs because despite not having enough seats in the  Senate they insisted on shutting out the opposition.    There is speculation that the supporters of Silvio  Berlusconi  and Gianfranco Fini engineered the split in order to call an  early election. Forza Italia and the National Alliance retort  that Umberto Bossi is guilty of having organized an ambush on  the ruling coalition, and the proof is the agreement with the  opposition to elect a Northern League Senator to the  chairmanship of the Television Commission. This is certainly a  thorn in the side for the government alliance.    Della Valle, the leader of the Forza Italia group in the  Senate, warned that they had put up with Bossi long enough and  that the Italian Popular Party will be invited to join the  ruling coalition.    The opposition parties are ecstatic. Cesare Salvi, from the  Democratic Party of the Left, said that the ruling coalition  wanted a naval battle and they had got it.</p>

			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Shaw Industries acquires Kosset Carpets Kosset Carpets, the biggest carpet manufacturer in the UK, has been bought for an undisclosed sum by Shaw Industries of the US. Shaw, the largest carpet manufacturer in the world, has no European manufacturing base. Kosset emerged from the ruins of Coloroll, the home furnishings group run by Mr John Ashcroft, which collapsed in 1989, via a Pounds 10m management buy-out engineered by Kosset's chairman and chief executive, Mr John Parker. Mr Parker will retain his position at Kosset. Shaw has guaranteed the 720 jobs at Kosset's manufacturing plant in Bradford and is expected to invest heavily in an expansion plan.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Luanda June 17 SAPA -- Fighting intensified on  Friday [17 June] in the Angolan town of Kuito, with government  forces reportedly gaining control of the southern and western  parts. State-run radio reported UNITA rebels had deployed two  commando battalions (about 300 men) to take the town.    Government forces this week claimed unidentified aircraft  had  dropped supplies for UNITA [National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola] near Chipeta in the Catabola area.    The Angolan News Agency ANGOP said UNITA rebels were also  trying to capture Malanje town in northern Angola, where heavy  fighting has killed scores of civilians.    Peace negotiators meeting in Zambia are still arguing about  accommodation for UNITA officials throughout the country if a  peace settlement is achieved. Reports from Lusaka said UNITA  wanted the government to provide more than 1,000 houses for its  officials.</p>

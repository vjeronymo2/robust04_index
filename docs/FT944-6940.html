			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Arts: Help lines for the beleaguered Fears that next week's Budget will be bad news for the arts have been tempered by anticipation over the National Lottery jackpot. Potential applicants can now apply for the cash - expected to be about Pounds 250m annually. The Heritage Fund published its guidelines for applicants last week; the Arts Council announced details to clients yesterday. Telephone 0171 649 1345 to obtain a simple guide for potential heritage projects. The Lottery Line at the Arts Council can be reached on 0171 312 0123. Both will accept applications after January 4, 1995. There are few surprises in the guidelines. The Arts Council does not expect to make grants of less than Pounds 5,000. Commercial operations can apply, provided the project will benefit the public. But in the main it will be charities, local authorities, schools and colleges and amateur groups that will receive the promised millions. The money will be spent constructing new, and improving old, buildings in which the arts and crafts can flourish. The determination not to allow lottery money seep away in day-to-day running costs remains, but grants can be used to buy equipment and to commission works of art. This should enable arts companies currently receiving subsidy to devote more money to programming. The range of potential applicants covers circus, mime, film, video and crafts, as well as drama and music companies. If more than Pounds 100,000 is needed for the scheme the organisation should be able to contribute 25 per cent of the total cost; for smaller projects at least 10 per cent is expected. The key aim remains 'to give the maximum benefit to the public by supporting projects which make an important and lasting difference to the quality of life of people throughout England.' In contrast the Heritage Lottery Fund can offer endowment money in special circumstances and will take a flexible attitude towards partnership funding. Next week the Millennium Commissioners will reveal their eagerly awaited guidelines and applicants can then decide which body to go for.</p>

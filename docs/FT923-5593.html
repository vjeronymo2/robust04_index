			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / International Company News: Nissan predicts first loss since 1946 NISSAN MOTOR, Japan's second largest car maker, this year expects to incur its first loss since 1946. In an unprecedented move it is omitting its interim dividend. Nissan yesterday issued revised projections showing a Y15bn (Dollars 119m) pre-tax loss for the parent company in the year to next March. Previously Nissan had forecast Y40bn in profits, which would have been less than half the Y87.8bn last year. Nissan's interim dividend, previously Y7 per share, is being passed, leaving the total payout for the year halved from Y14. It will have to draw nearly Y18bn from reserves to make that distribution. The losses at Nissan are all being taken in the six months to September, with break-even expected for the second half. Nissan made net profits last year of Y54.2bn. The company said the losses included Y5bn in securities write-downs, implying an operating deficit of about Y10bn. After investments in production facilities, it is labouring under a heavy depreciation burden which should reach Y150bn this year. Nissan is cutting capital investment from Y240bn to below Y200bn. The car group's announcement was one of the starkest indications of the difficulties being suffered by Japanese manufacturers in the economic slowdown. It said a quick recovery in automotive demand was unlikely, and sales for the year would be down 4 per cent at Y4,100bn. As the government yesterday unveiled its emergency package of stimulatory measures, companies in other sectors revised their earnings expectations downward. NEC, the electronics group, said its 1992 pre-tax profits would fall some 40 per cent on a consolidated basis to Y35bn. An earlier projection had suggested growth this year and profits of Y62bn. Its rival Toshiba said it expected parent pre-tax profits of Y60bn for its March year. Three months ago, the company had projected a modest improvement to Y75bn from the Y70.7bn it earned in 1991-1992. Both expected a rise of just under 2 per cent in overall revenues: to Y3,840bn at the NEC group and Y3,250bn at the Toshiba parent company. They blamed poor demand for semiconductors and computers. Toshiba added that it was being hit by price competition in the personal computer markets in the US and Europe. Komatsu, the construction machinery group, cut as much as Y40bn from its forecast for annual sales, saying they were likely to reach only Y560bn, down 5.3 per cent on the year. It expected profits of Y27bn before tax, down from the Y32bn it had projected in May and from the Y30.1bn it made last year. Mitsukoshi, a leading department store chain, forecast it would earn just Y1.8bn in the year to February, against Y10.9bn last year and earlier expectations of Y10bn this time. It aimed to meet its original sales forecast of Y927bn, up 5.7 per cent, in the face of weak consumer demand, but has been hit by costly refinancing following convertible bond redemptions.</p>

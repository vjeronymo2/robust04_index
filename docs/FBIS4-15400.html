			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] A sensational statement made  today at No. 4 [street name indistinct] may become the main  theme of newspaper headlines and TV programs for several weeks.  Sergey Stepashin, head of the Federal Counterintelligence  Service [FSK], came to St. Petersburg today to hold a regional  meeting with counterintelligence directorate heads and a closed  meeting with directors from the military-industrial complex.  However in an interview for our program he made a fairly clear  statement on incidents of corruption in the Russian Government.    [Begin Stepashin recording] Only yesterday, or rather the  day  before yesterday to be precise, I sent a written report to Boris  Nikolayevich Yeltsin about a very high-ranking official of  ministerial rank, who is now being investigated. Yes, such work  is going on. But I want to stress once again that corruption  and episodes of corruption are fairly sensitive and so there can  be no haste here. [end recording]    Sergey Stepashin, naturally, could not name the minister  accused of corruption. However, the fact that the president was  informed immediately shows that we are talking about someone in  the top ranks of politics. But the meeting with the  military-industrial complex bosses was not only concerned with  corruption. Inter alia, we received information that there is a  sharp increase in recruitment work by foreign intelligence  services and even a stepping up of activities by the special  services of our southern neighbors in the CIS. Representations  have been made to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan about attempts to  recruit our citizens. Five personnel from the Georgian security  department were detained by our counterintelligence and handed  over to the authorities in Tbilisi. So, at the moment, it is  still too early to talk about a free and open society without  strong special services.</p>

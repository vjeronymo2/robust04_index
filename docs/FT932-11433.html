			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Risk and Reward: Computer-based approach to stock-picking BARR Rosenberg probably knows as much about the use of computers in taking investment decisions as anyone. Barr, a consultancy whose risk management model is used widely by quantitative investment managers, was founded in his basement in Berkeley, California. It still bears his name, though he left eight years ago to put his money where his mouth is and set up a fund management firm. It now has Dollars 4bn under management. The recessionary 1990s, though, proved there is nothing infallible about computer-based stock-pickers. They make mistakes just like their human counterparts. And like humans, they try to learn from those mistakes. Rosenberg's approach is close to that of an active stock-picker, rather than that of the typical quantitative investment manager. His computer sifts the details of individual companies in search of undervalued stocks, using an extensive historical database. The database is the key to such computer-based investing: Rosenberg's firm has just spent three years building a database of 28,000 European companies to add to its existing US and Far Eastern systems. The 'bottom-up' technique sets Rosenberg apart from most active quantitative managers, who start with a portfolio that matches a particular index and then 'tilt' it towards particular characteristics to try to outperform the index. The Rosenberg system looks at the fundamentals which should affect a company's performance in different circumstances, and tries to assess how the market is likely to appraise the fundamentals. Theory suggests, for instance, that cash on a company's balance sheet is worth less to investors than its face value, due to the tax that would have to be deducted if it was paid out. In practice, though, each dollar of cash held by a company is always valued by the stock market at more than a dollar: the sight of cash gives investors confidence. This is especially true during a recession, when the stock market valuation of Dollars 1 of cash typically rises to Dollars 1.45, says Rosenberg. It is assessments like these, drawn from historic experience, and the consistent, systematic and comprehensive approach which are meant to give the computer its edge. Rosenberg targets a return of 4 per cent over whatever benchmark his computer is measured against, and is paid on results. The 1990s have not been kind to this method. The Rosenberg computer underperformed by between 4 per cent and 5 per cent for two years running. 'Our system was not as wise as we would have liked,' says Mr Rosenberg ruefully, though he claims to have emerged with a more robust model. The computer proved incapable of anticipating how both companies and investors would behave in the depths of the US recession. For a start, it produced a weighting towards companies which exhibited balance sheet strength. Many of these companies, says Rosenberg, reported one-off charges or other non-recurring items as they used the recession to reduce staff or otherwise rationalise their businesses. Stronger companies were best able to take these charges, and so suffered some of the biggest earnings reductions. The computer also failed to predict how investors would flee into what they saw as 'quality' stocks. The portfolio of stocks it selected may have exhibited adequate risk-diversification qualities according to modern portfolio theory, but that is of little use if the bulk of investors choose to act 'irrationally' - that is, in a different way than the one predicted in the text books. Do these experiences invalidate the use of computers, at least as applied by Rosenberg? Not necessarily. His system has achieved an average outperformance of 2 per cent a year over the past eight years, even after the bad years. It is also 'learning': earnings forecasts have been added to the system, along with a model which attempts to analyse market sentiment. 'If you can think of a reason to override the system, then you should make the system better,' says Rosenberg.</p>

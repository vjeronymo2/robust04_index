			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / People: Baird returns to Edinburgh Grant Baird, the former chief economist of the Royal Bank of Scotland who for the past three years has run Scotland Europa, which represents Scottish organisations and businesses in Brussels, is returning to Edinburgh. He is to become executive director of Scottish Financial Enterprise, the private sector body which promotes the financial community. Baird takes up his post in September, when James Scott, a former senior Scottish Office official who has directed SFE since 1991, steps down. SFE was founded in 1986 to bolster the Scottish financial community when London was blowing its trumpet in the run-up to Big Bang. Its 220 members include all the major banks, life assurance companies and fund managers north of the border, as well as providers of professional services.</p>

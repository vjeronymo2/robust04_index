			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Mobutu dismisses bank chief President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire has sacked the governor of the country's central bank following the failure of monetary reform launched last year, according to Zaire television, Reuter reports from Kinshasa. The central African country, crippled by a political stand-off between Mr Mobutu and his opponents, launched a disastrous currency reform last October, converting 3m old zaires to one new one. The new zaire's parity against hard currency was set at three to a dollar, but by late January the parallel market rate had plunged to 130 to a dollar. Some regions loyal to the president's main political adversary, Mr Etienne Tshisekedi, have refused to use the new currency. The World Bank, the last big source of foreign aid for Zaire, is closing its office in the bankrupt country, which faces expulsion from the International Monetary Fund. Troops in Zaire have executed thousands of people for opposing Mr Mobutu's 29-year dictatorship, Amnesty International claimed yesterday.</p>

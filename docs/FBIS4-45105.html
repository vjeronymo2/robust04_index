			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nair Zaidi: "Do Not Expect Fairness From the </F> United States Over Kashmir"    [Text] Why are Pakistani or Kashmiri leaders living in the  United States insisting the United States play an active role in  resolving the Kashmir issue? This question came to my mind  repeatedly last week. There are a lot of activities taking place  because India's Prime Minister Narasimha Rao is visiting  Washington on 18 May. The federation of Pakistani and Islamic  organizations, known as the Pakistan-American Congress, held a  large meeting in Washington on 12 May. There was a dinner to  introduce Professor William Baker's book, KASHMIR VALLEY, VALLEY  OF DEATH. The professor had risked his life to collect material  for this book by visiting Srinagar. The Pakistan-American  Congress spent lot of resources and time in printing and  publication of this book. We cannot praise the organizations  president, Dr. Sakhawat Hussain, and the organizer of the  Washington ceremony, Dr. Murtaza Arain, for their efforts  enough. Several members of this group addressed the dinner  meeting. Sardar Abdul Qayum, president of Azad Jammu and  Kashmir, also made a speech.    Dr. Maliha Lodhi, the Pakistani ambassador, addressed the  meeting during the day. I was busy with some other important  activity of the Congress at that time, however, I did manage to  get a copy of the text of the speech. The ambassador presented a  balanced view of Pakistan-United States relations. Her speech  did not include mere promises of green pastures or scenarios  that scare people. Dr. Maliha Lodhi also presented the unfair  U.S. position on F-16s and our nuclear program without mincing  any words. She also made it clear that although Pakistan wanted  to cooperate with the United States, this cooperation will  depend on Pakistan's own national interests. She also said that  if the United Nations or the United States want peace in the  sub-continent, the Kashmir issue must be resolved. Dr. Lodhi has  been in Washington only for four months. During this brief  period she had to visit Pakistan twice for official business,  take care of Sardar Qayum's visit, Narasimha Rao's visit, and  President Farooq Leghari's visit. Still, she did not have a  heart attack and this shows her strong personality.    I did not know her personally despite her journalist  background, and met her after her only arrival here. She has a  strong grasp on Pakistan-United States relations and  international affairs. This is not because she was a journalist  (we have many "pedestrians" in our ranks), but because of her  personal analyses. I will discuss in a separate column how the  enemies of Pakistan are disturbed even after her brief stay  here. This issue will require a lot of details. Her address to  the Pakistan-United States Congress was a first solid speech  made to any Pakistani community. It gave glimpses of cautious  optimism, but also warned that Pakistan was not in any position  to continue taking steps unilaterally. There was another meeting  of the organization after this speech and I participated briefly  in that. What I heard during that meeting brings us to the  subject of discussion today. The participants were clear that  the United States, despite its statements, was practicing double  standards in regard to India and Pakistan. The question was how  to change the U.S. attitude. Since I was only an observer in  this forum, I thought that it would be appropriate to express my  opinion in my own way--this column. I will focus on the Kashmir  issue at this point. The United States and other Western powers  will never help Pakistan over Kashmir or the Kashmiris that want  their state to join Pakistan. The UN Security Council  resolutions that provided Kashmiris the right to  self-determination were passed in 1948-49. The forces behind  these resolutions were Great Britain and the United States.  Everyone knows that Kashmir should go to Pakistan. Great  Britain, its Viceroy Lord Mountbatten, and the leader of the  border commission, Lord Radcliffe, committed deceit and gave  Gurdaspur to India and opened a land route for the Indian army  to reach Kashmir. History shows that the Indian military did not  have fighter planes to send troops to Kashmir. Thus, India used  planes owned by American companies. It is obvious that these  American companies must have discussed this with the U.S.  embassy before cooperating in a war effort. Meanwhile when  Quaid-i Azam tried to use Pakistani military and air force, the  British general refused to obey Quaid-i Azam. It should be  remembered that the same British general was commanding both  armed forces. Thus, India not only got the privilege of using  the Indian military and air force openly, but also used American  civilian aircraft. Lord Mountbatten was India's governor general  at that time. The strategy that was used in the United States to  stop the war must have been discussed between the governor  general and Prime Minister Nehru before agreeing on all these  tricks. World War II, in which the United States and Great  Britain were allies, had just ended. The United States had  become the new superpower in the world. The security policy in  the Middle East and South Asia, known as East of Suez at that  time, was managed by Great Britain at that time. It is,  therefore, assumed that the U.S. policy on the sub-continent for  any UN resolution was formed after discussions with Great  Britain. This policy was not based on principles of fairness,  but to protect the Western interests. This made the country  established in the name of Islam economically paralyzed and  Kashmir was given to the Hindus. It should also be remembered  that the Ottoman Empire had fallen 25 years earlier, and the  West was able to establish its control in the Middle East after  the fall of this Muslim empire.    Is it possible for us to accept that the Great Britain that  had dishonestly given Kashmir to India in 1948 would sincerely  support such resolutions in 1948 that would result in annexation  of Kashmir to Pakistan? The UN resolutions were only a timely  strategy. Anyhow, the Pakistani leadership of that time had  limited military options and accepted this resolution. However,  as expected, neither did India follow up on it nor did the  United States and Great Britain press India about it.    In 1962, when India's whole military force was occupied  against China and it could not defend Kashmir, President Kennedy  wrote to President Ayub Khan not to take any military action  there. In exchange, the United States was to help Pakistan  negotiate with India. Agreeing for negotiations at a time when  we could have taken over Kashmir was a major blunder which only  the Pakistani leadership could make. The talks were held as  promised and India continuously repeated that Kashmir is its  integral part. The United States betrayed Pakistan a second  time. However, the situations in 1962 and 1965 were very  different. There was no local movement in Kashmir that could  endanger the Indian government. There were some wolves in "lion"  clothes in Kashmir that wanted to strengthen their position by  selling out the Kashmiri people.    The situation, however, changed between 1987 and 1989. A  pure  local movement in Kashmir was born and men, women, and children  of Kashmir were ready to sacrifice their lives, souls, and  property. They have made unprecedented sacrifices. However, when  this movement reached its apex in 1989-90, a group surfaced that  began to demand that the United States should play a role in  resolving the Kashmir issue. Seeing how the United States has  played no role in the whole history of the Kashmir dispute, this  demand is ridiculous. A lobby was formed here and the Kashmiri  American Council hired a lobbying firm for $500,000 per year.  Its purpose was to persuade the government and the U.S. Congress  to put pressure on India over Kashmir and take notice of human  rights violations in Kashmir. This whole lobby effort should  have been focused on one thing: the United States should be  non-aligned in this dispute and not put any kind of pressure on  Pakistan to stop helping Kashmiri freedom fighters. However,  after this lobbying firm was hired, the Kashmiri freedom  fighters were called terrorists and Pakistan was accused of  encouraging terrorism. The Pakistani strategy should have been  simple. It should have provided full support to the Kashmiri  freedom fighters and prepared itself to withstand the U.S.  pressure for a short period. Had it warded off this pressure  until 1993, the Kashmiri movement would have made remarkable  progress.    Those who are sincerely demanding U.S. involvement in  Kashmir  are naive. Why should the United States and other Western powers  help "resolve" an issue that could end the differences between  India and Pakistan? Their goal is to keep us divided and not  unite us. have these powers even given a fair treatment to any  international issue until now?    The lobby firms working for Pakistan and Kashmir should have  the strategy aimed at keeping the United States out of Kashmir  and let the freedom struggle achieve its goal. No slave nation  in the world has managed to get the gift of freedom from  negotiation tables. If this movement is suspended now, there  will no such movement again for a hundred years. Kashmir will  become an international brothel if it comes under the  trusteeship of the United Nations and Western powers. Now only  will chastity be violated, it will then be sold. The people who  are trying to "solve" the Kashmir issue with the U.S. help will  be responsible for that!</p>

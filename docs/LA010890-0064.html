			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHER ISN'T SATISFIED AFTER VICTORY;  </P> <P> SENIOR GOLF: HE WINS BY SEVEN STROKES, BUT HE ALSO WANTED TO BEAT THE PLAYERS  ON THE REGULAR PGA TOUR.  </P> <P> George Archer's attempt to beat the kids fell far short Sunday, but he was  never in danger of losing his firm grip on the senior division of the MONY  Tournament of Champions.  </P> <P> After a fast start Sunday on the long La Costa course, he ran into a bit of  sour luck, settled for a two-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total of five-under-par  283. That was seven shots better than any other 50-and-older golfer. Bruce  Crampton and Bobby Nichols tied for second at 290. Once again, the seniors  started when the frost was still on the greens. Nichols was the only senior  among the 20 who broke par in the last round.  </P> <P> Archer tied the tournament record for widest victory margin, earned $37,500,  became the youngest ever to win it and has won two of the six senior events  since he became eligible Oct. 1. But he wasn't very happy.  </P> <P> Just as he had promised, Archer, who began the final round with a commanding  seven-shot lead, set his goal to beat most of the players on the regular PGA  Tour. There were only five ahead of him going into the final round.  </P> <P> After he sank a 12-foot birdie on the second hole in the final round, Archer  was eight under. He seemed to be playing as well as he did Saturday when he  shot a 67.  </P> <P> But by the margin of less than a foot, his hopes were doused on the fourth  hole.  </P> <P> The fourth is a 386-yard par- four, dogleg right with water on the right.  Archer's drive was in perfect position for a shot at the flag, situated on the  right side of the green. He hit a seven-iron right at the pin. He hit it a bit  too thin. Instead of landing on top and rolling close to the hole, it hit in  the bank. Slowly, the ball started rolling down the terrace, picked up speed on  the cart patch and rolled into the water.  </P> <P> "When I saw the shot, I said, 'OK, it's in the fringe and an easy par.' I was  shocked when I learned it rolled into the water. That was the end, though I  kept playing bold.  </P> <P> "It's nice to win the senior event. But it's nothing compared to beating a  majority of those juniors 20 years and more younger. Now that was my goal, and  it blew up on the one shot. I really wanted to finish in the top five of the  whole tournament. I may never get that chance again."  </P> <P> Although his disappointment showed when he got the double bogey, he kept trying  hard. He missed a tricky five-footer for a birdie on six, then sank a 45-footer  on the eighth for a birdie.  </P> <P> The ninth is a 538-yard par five, with a ravine crossing the fairway 25 yards  from the middle of the green. Most players lay up with their second shot. But  Archer hit a long drive. His second shot hit in front of the ravine, bounced on  the footbridge and into the rough on the left. It was a short pitch to the  hole. But Archer left it a little short into the trap and his last hope  disappeared.  </P> <P> "I know anything can happen in this crazy game," Archer said, "but I never  thought about losing the tournament. It was the chance to beat the kids that  fired me up for the last round.  </P> <P> "I'm not knocking the senior tour. It's great fun. But I don't think I have  anything to prove. I won a Masters, I lasted 25 years on the tour despite  physical problems. If Lee (Trevino) and Jack (Nicklaus) win all the tournaments  this year, maybe I'll finish second.  </P> <P> "But I sure did want to finish ahead of those kids."  </P> <P> The only other time there was a seven-stroke margin was the first time the  senior tour winners were invited to the tournament coinciding with the regular  tour champions. Orville Moody won the 1984 event, finishing seven shots ahead  of the late Dan Sikes.  </P> <P> Moody, who had a blood pressure problems two weeks ago while hunting in Texas,  had a 73 on the final round for a 301. He says he feels good in the morning but  tires easily.  </P> <P> Defending champion Miller Barber was far back at 296. Chi Chi Rodriguez and Al  Geiberger tied for fourth at 292, four shots over par.  </P></p>

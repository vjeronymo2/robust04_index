			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> THE TOP 10  </P> <P> 1 GRANADA HILLS  </P> <P> 1988 Record: 8-3  </P> <P> League: North Valley  </P> <P> Coaches: D. Stroh, T. Harp  </P> <P> Based on their statistics of a year ago, the Highlanders have one of the best  returning skill-position packages in Southern California in receivers William  Moringlane and Jermaine Love, running backs Leon Glasgow and Brett Washington,  and senior quarterback Chris Gadomski. Bryan Martin, a junior transfer from  Illinois, may unseat the incumbent Gadomski. Granada Hills (33-9-1 from  1985-88) seems certain to win eight games or more.  </P> <P> 2 CANYON  </P> <P> 1988 Record: 11-3  </P> <P> League: Golden  </P> <P> Coach: Harry Welch  </P> <P> Last December, Canyon was almost single-handedly beaten by Antelope Valley's  Tommie Smith, who scored four touchdowns in the Southern Section Division II  final. It may now be powerful tailback Chris Peery's turn to be a one-man  wrecking crew for the Cowboys if he recovers from surgery to his groin area  that he underwent Tuesday. Clint Beauer, a three-year letterman, could be the  Valley-area's best receiver. This is a money team: Canyon has played in a  divisional championship game four times in six years.  </P> <P> 3 SAN FERNANDO  </P> <P> 1988 Record: 8-4  </P> <P> League: North Valley  </P> <P> Coach: Tom Hernandez  </P> <P> Judging by his preseason clippings, All-City Section selection Michael Wynn may  be the team's most skilled quarterback since Anthony Davis (1968-70). Tailback  Maurice McFarland, a three-year letterman, heads an explosive running game. But  can the Tigers weather three Southern Section Division I teams (Fontana, Crespi  and St. Paul) on the road in nonleague play? San Fernando plays only three home  games and visits league-rival Granada Hills on Nov. 9.  </P> <P> 4 THOUSAND OAKS  </P> <P> 1988 Record: 6-4-1  </P> <P> League: Marmonte  </P> <P> Coach: Bob Richards  </P> <P> With eight starters returning on defense, the Lancers should be the class of  the Marmonte League, even if the offense is as sporadic as it was in 1988. If  the backfield situation is satisfactorily resolved -- juniors Scott Peterson  and David Watts are in a dead heat at quarterback and tailback Mike Lindsay is  recovering from knee surgery -- the Lancers could emerge as a contender for the  Division II title. But defense, once again, will be T.O.'s primary M.O. Who  needs finesse?  </P> <P> 5 HART  </P> <P> 1988 Record: 6-5  </P> <P> League: Foothill  </P> <P> Coach: Mike Herrington  </P> <P> Senior quarterback Rob Westervelt leads all returning Valley-area passers in  yardage (2,130) and under the tutelage of the newly hired Herrington -- whose  game plan will closely resemble that of pass-happy mentor Rick Scott, a former  Hart coach -- the Indians should be burning up the airwaves at an ever greater  pace. Howard Blackwell gives Hart balance and speed in the tailback position.  </P> <P> 6 ALEMANY  </P> <P> 1988 Record: 4-6  </P> <P> League: Del Rey  </P> <P> Coach: Pat Blackburn  </P> <P> Three-year starter Joey Rosselli is the dean of Valley quarterbacks and  possesses the best credentials among returning Del Rey League passers (1,559  yards in '88). Receivers Scott Goldsmith, Billy Markowitz and Mark Dannemiller  also return. Sophomore running back Terry Barnum is a barn-burner. If the  defense holds up, a playoff berth seems realistic. Key games are with league  foes Crespi and Loyola, which combined to thump Alemany, 84-0, last year and  44-14 the year before.  </P> <P> 7 NOTRE DAME  </P> <P> 1988 Record: 8-3  </P> <P> League: San Fernando Valley  </P> <P> Coach: Kevin Rooney  </P> <P> Thirteen starters are back from last season's league championship team and the  Knights are ranked No. 2 in the Southern Section Division VII preseason poll.  Returning starters include Greg Andrachick, who took over at quarterback in  midseason, and running back Errol Small. The team's toughest test may be in  finding enough regular-season competition to prepare for postseason play: After  a 4-0 league season in '88, Notre Dame was bounced out of the playoffs in the  first round.  </P> <P> 8 CHANNEL ISLANDS  </P> <P> 1988 Record: 8-3  </P> <P> League: Marmonte  </P> <P> Coach: Joel Gershon  </P> <P> The two-time defending Marmonte League champions, who typically hammer  opponents with a punishing ground attack, may air it out more often.  Quarterback Mark Contreras, a three-year letterman, returns along with receiver  Shawn Young, who led the team in receptions. It may come down to yet another  race with defense-minded Thousand Oaks. Looking for suspense? Look elsewhere.  Thousand Oaks and Channel Islands play in the league opener Sept. 29.  </P> <P> 9 MONTCLAIR PREP  </P> <P> 1988 Record: 6-5  </P> <P> League: Alpha  </P> <P> Coach: George Giannini  </P> <P> Thank goodness for transfers, and the Mounties have more of them that an RTD  driver. Running back Derek Sparks and quarterback Leland Sparks -- they are  cousins -- transferred to the school earlier this year and give the Mounties  the most potent backfield in the area. Senior tailback Michael Jones, who  gained 1,514 yards last season at Montclair Prep, is a bona fide Division I  prospect. The Mounties are ranked No. 1 in the Division IX preseason poll.  </P> <P> 10 ANTELOPE VALLEY  </P> <P> 1988 Record: 12-2  </P> <P> League: Golden  </P> <P> Coach: B. Newcomb  </P> <P> The Antelopes are 83-28-1 in the 1980s and have won two Southern Section  Division II titles, including last season's 28-22 win over league-rival Canyon.  Yet Tommie Smith, perhaps the school's best player ever, graduated. The  sophomore team has won one game in two seasons. Newcomb may have a hard time  maintaining the Antelopes' recent high-desert high, but his program nonetheless  remains one of the area's best.  </P></p>

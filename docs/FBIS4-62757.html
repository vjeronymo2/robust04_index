			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yelena Chepkasova and Ivan Zasurskiy in the </F> "Presentation" column: "Boris Fedorov Proposes Making the Bank  of Russia A Locomotive Of Reform. The Central Bank Does Not  Care for the Monetarist Bill"]    [Text] Yesterday an enlarged session of the Central Bank's  subcommittee on money and credit policy discussed a draft law  presented by Boris Fedorov: On the Central Bank of the Russian  Federation. The session was attended by ex-Finance Minister  Boris Fedorov, now chairman of the [State Duma] subcommittee on  the Central Bank; Aleksandr Khandruyev, deputy chairman of the  Central Bank; and representatives of commercial banks and the  Moscow Interregional Currency Exchange.    Although the discussion of the draft law was not in the  confrontational spirit of old, it was interrupted by some rather  sharp interventions by representatives of the legislative and  monetary "power branches."    At the session, the draft law on the Central Bank was  disseminated, whose basic provisions are contained in Articles  19, 20, 75, 79, and 122.    In particular Article 19 resurrects the Central Bank from  the  ashes of former battles as a powerful phoenix: "Legislative and  executive bodies may not interfere in the activity of the Bank  of Russia in exercising its powers enshrined in laws or make  decisions which hinder the Bank of Russia's activity. In the  event of an intervention attempt, the Bank of Russia shall  ignore the illegal injunctions and advise the State Duma."    Boris Fedorov's draft provides only for "a week-long freeze"  on Central Bank decisions on matters pertaining to its powers,  and this prerogative is concentrated in the hands of the finance  minister who may (Article 20) suspend Central Bank decisions for  this period of time.    Viewed from the angle of political practice, these decisions  show that Boris Fedorov has not lost the hope of becoming head  of an independent Central Bank, while for the Finance Ministry  loss of power is to be offset by the possibility of deriving a  profit from collaboration with commercial structures.  Incidentally, Fedorov sees the president's position as a source  for his hopes to get "Gerashchenko's scalp": Article 122  proposes a new procedure for appointing and dismissing the  Central Bank chief. As of now the Russian president will have  an overriding power (while the State Duma will be able to make  such decisions in a limited enumeration of cases)    Articles 75 and 79 of the draft are of major importance.  Thus, Article 75 empowers the Central Bank to license all  currency operations by "banks and other credit institutions,"  including the import and export of capital. Article 79 strips  commercial banks of the right to commercial secrets (insurance  companies, investment funds and companies, in full; and  brokerage firms, their associations, and regulating bodies,  partially) if the Central Bank demands relevant data from them.  The same article, however, obligates the Central Bank not to  pass on such information to anybody else.    On the whole, the draft law proposes that the Central Bank  be  used as a locomotive of monetarist economic reform, with  Fedorov's Central Bank model being closest to Latvia's. There  they have a president of the Bank of Latvia, Eynars Repshe; the  lat stands at $1.50; and industry is winding up the production  of RAF minivans.</p>

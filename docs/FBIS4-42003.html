			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Sugak] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 29 TASS -- The Moscow government's  decision "on the protection of the property rights of Moscow  residents in view of the expiry of the validity of privatisation  cheques" is in no way interpreted as an extension of the  validity of the Russian voucher (cheque) on the territory of  Moscow, Konstantin Buravlev, first vice-premier of Moscow, told  the press centre of the mayor's office in comment on the  decision.    Buravlev said the measure is aimed only at upholding the  property rights of Muscovites who failed to put to use their  privatisation cheques before July 1 for reasons that did not  depend on them.    On July 10 the privatisation cheques issued in Moscow and  not  put to use during the cheque privatisation campaign are to be  accepted by the Moscow savings bank branches for responsible  custody. In exchange, the privatisation cheque holders will be  given special certificates (registered receipts -- form 31).    Privatisation cheques, issued by the Moscow savings bank,  are  to be exchanged for F-31 receipts on presentation of a passport  which should have a notation about residential registration in  the capital at the date of issue of the privatisation cheque  (one per bearer).    Underage children's privatisation cheques are to be accepted  on presentation of the passport of one of the parents. The  passport should have the name of the child entered in it. The  exchange of unclaimed privatisation cheques for F-31  certificates will continue until January 1, 1995.    Within a month, the Moscow authorities are to finalise and  endorse a programme tentatively named Cheque-Moscow. After  that, the Moscow government will offer the Muscovites the shares  of Moscow-based enterprises and foundations and, probably, other  securities backed up by Moscow property.    The Cheque-Moscow programme will be based on current laws  with due regard for the overall economic situation in the  country. Every holder of F-31 certificate will have several  options to exercise his or her property rights.    The programme will be implemented so as not to infringe the  property interests of Muscovites, who have already put their  privatisation cheques to use, or the interests of investors in  Moscow property.</p>

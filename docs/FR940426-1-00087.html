			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 184 does incorporate portions of section 176A by reference. On this basis, one might argue that Congress intended the OTC's power under section 184 to be broader than a commission's power under section 176A, and would thus reach maintenance issues in some manner. Section 184(a) provides that ``a single transport region for ozone (within the meaning of section [176A(a)])'' for the Northeast States is established by operation of law. That subsection further provides that the Administrator is to convene the OTC ``required (under section [176A(b)])'' that results from the establishment by operation of law. These provisions arguably indicate that the OTC under section 184 is also a creature of section 176A, as a transport region ``within the meaning of'' section 176A(b) and ``convened'' under section 176A(b). Indeed, it is section 176A(b), referenced in section 184(a), that authorizes a commission to make recommendations for measures needed to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of course, section 184(c) sets out a process for the OTC to recommend additional control measures that the States must adopt ``within one year'' after EPA's approval and finding of SIP inadequacy. Under section 176A, in contrast, EPA's approval results in a finding of SIP inadequacy but does not result in specific new mandatory control measures. Even if the OTC here has authority through section 176A to recommend that EPA find SIPs inadequate in relation to maintenance, section 176A would not appear to provide for EPA to require specific new control measures for maintenance purposes. Perhaps Congress intended to limit this extra power to create new mandatory control measures to attaining the NAAQS, but not to extend to maintenance thereafter. It might be reasonable to believe that EPA's difficulty in ensuring attainment in the Northeast justified this extra invasion into State discretion, but that Congress trusted EPA would be better able to enforce States' obligations to prevent interference with maintenance elsewhere, once contribution preventing attainment is addressed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In any case, in considering the LEV measure, EPA believes that it may consider maintenance in the course of its analysis here for independent purposes of section 110(a)(2)(D). In other words, EPA's process in responding to the OTC recommendation may provide an appropriate forum in which to also consider what upwind control measures may be necessary for purposes of preventing interference with maintenance downwind. Instead of considering what reductions in current emissions may be necessary to prevent contribution to nonattainment, for maintenance the relevant concern would seem to be the need for additional controls after attainment to counteract growth and prevent emissions that would cause downwind areas to relapse into nonattainment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes it might reasonably determine in this proceeding that States' SIPs would need to control an additional increment of emissions to prevent interfering with maintenance downwind even after it is achieved. EPA might then notify States that their SIPs are inadequate to prevent interference with maintenance of the NAAQS. Apart from mandating particular measures for maintenance under section 184, EPA believes that it could identify the increment of controls that appear to be ``necessary'' to prevent interference with maintenance downwind, and the measures that appear ``necessary'' to achieve adequate emissions control for this purpose. Under such circumstances, EPA believes it has independent authority under section 110(k)(5) to insist that States adopt such controls, or other comparably effective controls, to address the maintenance concern. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, in connection with maintenance, EPA believes that its inability to establish more stringent ``Tier 2'' motor vehicle standards under section 202(i) until model year 2004 is relevant. <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  As noted above, under section 202(a), Congress explicitly provided that EPA may not modify the ``Tier 1'' auto emissions standards specified in subsections 202(a)(3)(B)(ii), (g), (h) and (i) prior to model year 2004. The OTC, in its response to comments, recognized this limitation. The OTC recommendation calls for the LEV standards to apply beginning in model year 1999, a full 5 model years earlier than Tier 2 standards could at the earliest apply under section 202(i). Therefore, EPA should consider the need for LEV standards during those years when Tier 2 could not be available, whether for purposes of reaching attainment or for maintenance thereafter. The OTC, in its response to comments, contends that the earlier implementation of LEV is important for severe areas to achieve attainment by 2005 or 2007. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Subsection 202(i) sets out the scheme for EPA to consider and possibly establish more stringent ``Tier 2'' standards beginning with model year 2004. Under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection 202(i), EPA is to study whether more stringent ``Tier 2'' standards should be adopted beginning with model year 2004, taking into account such factors as the need for further reductions, technical feasibility, cost, and alternatives. EPA is to submit this study to Congress no later than June 1, 1997. Under paragraph (3), based on this study EPA is to determine, through rulemaking, whether to establish more stringent ``Tier 2'' standards to be applicable no earlier than model year 2004 but not later than model year 2006. Finally, subparagraph (3)(E) provides a default to ``Tier 2'' emissions standards specified in Table 3 in paragraph (1), unless EPA affirmatively decides not to promulgate, to postpone or to promulgate an alternative to such standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is considering whether it may account for the possibility of Tier 2 standards beginning with model year 2004 in analyzing the need for the LEV program. EPA's authority to adopt more stringent Tier 2 standards for model year 2004, if necessary, may make less pressing a determination now that LEV is necessary for model years 2004 and after. However, the impact of Tier 2 standards for reaching attainment deadlines in 2005 or 2007 is likely to be small and this consideration therefore may be more important for purposes of the OTR's maintenance needs. Moreover, EPA is aware that it cannot prejudge the outcome of the Tier 2 study that is to be the basis for its Tier 2 rulemaking. EPA questions whether it is at all appropriate for its decision regarding the necessity of the OTC&hyph;LEV program to be influenced by the mere possibility of future federal regulations, where such regulations are not assured and where states have little to no control regarding whether such regulations will ever be promulgated. EPA also notes that the issues relevant to the Tier 2 study are not identical to the issues relevant to the establishment of the OTC&hyph;LEV program. For example, Tier 2 standards would apply nation-wide, and EPA's analysis would balance the relevant factors on a national scale, whereas the analysis of need for the OTC's LEV program should be more focused on the OTR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

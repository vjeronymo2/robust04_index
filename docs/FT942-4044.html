			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Lloyds Bank share price recovery - At a Glance Lloyds Bank's share price suffered briefly on news of the high court ruling which blocked the proposed merger with the Cheltenham and Gloucester building society (see page VII). The judge ruled that the structure of the deal, which involved cash bonuses for C &amp; G customers, was illegal. However, after being marked down sharply on the news, the shares soon recovered, as the setback was seen as temporary. Lloyds is expected to return with a restructured bid shortly.</p>

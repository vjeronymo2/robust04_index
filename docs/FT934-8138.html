			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of World Nuclear Industry (1): Need for a crystal ball - The future of nuclear electricity is shrouded in deepening uncertainty. It is still favoured by developing nations in Asia and the Pacific. But in most western countries, it is bogged down by fears over safety and worries about costs IT IS possible, some argue likely, that the nuclear power industry will grow significantly from the base it has established as provider of about 17 per cent of the world's electricity. But even the optimists acknowledge that it is a long term prospect which may take more than half a century to fulfil. In the next 10 to 20 years the industry will have to content itself with small annual growths in total capacity and a stable perhaps declining proportion of a faster growing world electricity market. Before the year 2000, at least, most of the growth will be accounted for by a handful of Asian and east European countries and France. In most of the rest of the world, nuclear power companies and the companies which build their power stations will struggle to consolidate the gains of the last 40 years in the face of widespread public cynicism about the industry's costs and safety. The legacy of the Three Mile Island accident in the US in 1979 and the much worse Chernobyl disaster of 1986 is that the nuclear industry will have to spend increasing sums of money to make both its existing plants and new stations far safer than would be expected of a unit fired by other fuels. Nor, in the face of growing pressure on government finances throughout the world, will it be easy for power utilities to gain access to the funds necessary to build nuclear stations, as Nuclear Electric of the UK is likely to find in the next two to three years, as it looks for capital to build a second pressurised water reactor station in Suffolk. Capital markets are extremely wary of committing money to nuclear stations which are far more expensive, and take perhaps twice the time, to build than gas, oil or coal-fired stations. The markets are concerned about rates of return needed to recover the capital costs and remain sceptical that utilities make enough provision for future decommissioning and reprocessing costs when making estimates about the costs of nuclear power. The undoubted economic advantage of nuclear stations is that uranium, the raw material needed to fuel them, is cheaper than inputs for virtually all other forms of power and this advantage will grow as resources of coal, oil and gas become scarcer and more expensive. It was partly for this reason that the World Energy Council, a non-government organisation representing more than 100 countries, predicted in a recent report, Energy For Tomorrow's World, that nuclear power is one of two energy sources most likely to meet electricity demand in the second half of the next century, the other being coal. However the council's prediction is based on the assumption that world gas and oil will begin to dry up within 50 years. That is by no means certain. The energy industry's critics believe that oil and gas companies consistently under-estimate reserves as part of an effort to keep prices high. Gordon MacKerron, of Sussex University's Science Policy and Research Unit, is among those who believes reserves may last longer. 'We are discovering gas four times faster than annual consumption and have done for at least a decade,' he points out. If the long term prospects for nuclear power are debatable, controversy also surrounds the short term outlook. Latest figures from the International Atomic Energy Authority are that there are 72 nuclear units under construction against an existing world total of about 424 units. But some forecasters and academics argue that this is over-optimistic because some of the plants will not be completed. In addition some of the new plant will replace stations which are being retired. Prospects around the world vary considerably. ASIA: Japan has the world's largest expansion programme, having set a target of increasing the proportion of nuclear power in electricity generation from under 30 per cent to 40 per cent, but there are doubts about whether it can achieve it. Japan's enthusiasm for nuclear power stems from its lack of natural fuel resources and its experiences from oil price rises. If the plans were met, the current capacity of 35,000 megawatts, supplied by 42 stations, would increase to 75,000MW. Utilities are acutely conscious, however, of the growing power of the environmental lobby and believe the lack of potential sites for building new plants and the stabilisation of Middle East politics will dampen the government's enthusiasm. Korea, like Japan, is also anxious to diversify from other forms of fuel and is constructing three stations to add to the nine providing 7000MW which are already in operation. Among non-nuclear power countries, the most likely new entrant is Indonesia, but it is unlikely to make a decision before 2002. China and India provide perhaps the best hope for the industry in the medium to long term, with the construction of nine plants between them already under way, and more likely to follow. AMERICA. Since the Three Mile Island accident there have been no new orders in the US and several projects have been cancelled. However, US companies are at the forefront of technological advances by developing a new generation of safer reactors and the government is in talks with the industry to ease complications surrounding site licensing. There are hopes of new orders within the next few years. Previous enthusiasm in south America for nuclear power has been dampened by debt problems and is unlikely to revive in the medium term. WEST EUROPE. With the exception of France, and just possibly the UK, prospects are uniformly bleak. France has eight reactors under construction or planned and the UK's Nuclear Electric has requested planning permission for Sizewell C in Suffolk. However, even if Nuclear Electric can gain permission, it faces a far more difficult task in getting finance for a project expected to cost up to Pounds 3.5bn. It also has to steer a successful course through the government's nuclear review, planned to start later this year, and likely to consider whether further nuclear power stations are necessary. Most of the rest of western Europe has imposed moratoria on nuclear power. Optimists place their hopes of revival in Finland - even though its parliament recently turned down plans for a fifth reactor - and in Italy which closed its nuclear stations after Chernobyl but may consider new stations if safety improves. There are also grounds for hope that Sweden may not end up being as anti-nuclear as it has planned. Sweden has a policy of phasing out nuclear energy but nearly half of its electricity come from nuclear power and efforts to replace this are progressing slowly. German prospects look poor amid difficulties of reaching a consensus on nuclear power. The environmental lobby is powerful, one reason why none of the nuclear reactors in the former East Germany are in operation. EAST EUROPE. Russia has revived plans for significant expansion, aiming to increase nuclear's share from 12 per cent to 30 per cent of the electricity generation by 2030. Although it has plentiful supplies of oil and gas it needs to export these for hard currency. But the same lack of resources may force a severe scaling down of the plans which involve the construction of more than 20 reactors. At the very least Russia is likely to need World Bank help if it is to proceed. In the Ukraine, unable and unwilling to buy Russian gas, the parliament recently voted to resume construction of three nuclear plants where work had stopped and the continued operation of Chernobyl. That worries the rest of the world nuclear industry which fears that another accident like 1986, whether at Chernobyl or anywhere else, will put plans for increasing expansion off for years and possibly for ever. The need to reduce the likelihood of a further disaster prompted the industry in 1989 to form the World Association of Nuclear Operators. Since then the association has helped facilitate a series of exchanges between eastern and western nuclear scientists. Mr Remy Carle, chairman of the WANO governing board and deputy general manager of Electricite de France, told the Uranium Institute annual symposium in London recently that avoidance of accidents was one of four lines of attack the industry should pursue to help bring about a revival. The other three were resolving problems over waste, developing 'even safer' power stations and fuel designs, and trying to make nuclear power accepted as a 'perfectly normal energy resource'. Providing these problems are tackled, he says, the industry is set for recovery. 'The nuclear industry will take off again when there is a strong need for it.' That implies what many other people in the industry believe: that conditions for growth depend on the world economy, supplies of other fuels and other factors over which the nuclear industry has little control.</p>

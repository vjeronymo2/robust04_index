			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Food: The Rhone stars shine - Nicholas Lander visits some of France's most serious restaurants I HAVE never forgotten my mother's account of a trip she made down the Rhone in the late 1940s. On the way to the south of France the gastronomic highlight was to be dinner chez Pointe, at Le Pyramide in Vienne, then the Rhone's finest restaurant. The diners failed to allow for the heat, the dust, or the stray animals on poor French roads, and they finally arrived at 11.30pm  - too exhausted even for an omelette, which was the only item on the menu at that hour. Today's travellers along the Rhone face no such problems. The region is served by the TGV and autoroutes. German and Swiss diners are almost as prevalent as locals, and any Parisian could easily be chez Pic or Troisgros in time for lunch after a none-too-early start. There is no shortage of good places to visit, and a wide variety of prices. Les Cedres in Granges-les-Beaumont (75.71.50.67) boasts Jacques Bertrand - at 24 years old the youngest Michelin-starred chef in France. Set price menus here run from FFr140-FFr300. Mondragon has La Beaugraviere (90.40.82.54), a restaurant with a superlative wine list. Guy Jullien, its chef, makes a speciality of truffles at relatively reasonable prices. Even the FFr125 menu at the Chalet de la Boule d'Or (77.26.20.68), in the small town of Feurs (population 8,000), turned into a five-course affair, with a well-prepared main course of roast fillet of salmon and a wonderful cheeseboard. There is a plethora of good restaurants in the Rhone valley and its environs  -there have been been for years - with many at the top of the culinary tree. Le Pyramide, after a lengthy decline, is enjoying a renaissance under Patrick Henriroux. Pic and Troisgros have held three Michelin stars for almost 30 years. Neither restaurant is what it was. I do not mean that they are no longer serving the same food - Troisgros, in particular, has been a standard bearer for a modern, lighter style of cooking - it is rather that their physical aspects have changed markedly. When Pic moved from the countryside to its present location, just before the Second World War, it was to the outskirts of a small town, Valence, which has grown significantly. The restaurant now stands in the suburbs, no more than a mile from the Valence Sud motorway exit. We ate very well at Pic. As at almost all today's top restaurants, the best value lies in one of the fixed-price menus rather than a la carte. One particular dish - points of very fresh asparagus topped with beurre blanc and caviar - was simple but stunning. My most lasting memory of this meal will be of Jacques Pic himself. An extremely sprightly 60-year-old, with a mischievous twinkle in his eye, he was in his chef's whites greeting all his guests at 7.30pm as I walked around the small garden - the pristine kitchen has a large plate glass window overlooking it. He was there, still in his whites, at 11.30pm to say goodnight. When we checked out at 10.15 the following morning he was back in the kitchen. Jacques now cooks alongside his son, Alain. This is similar to the arrangement at Troisgros, where Pierre presides and his sons, Michel and Claude, dispense. But the transformation over the past 50 years of the simple Troisgros restaurant - opposite Roanne railway station - into today's culinary colossus is even more marked. Although its population is only 40,000, Roanne is a wealthy city. An armaments factory and a booming textile industry add up to two good incomes for most families; a joint income quickly spent on eating and drinking well. Until recently Roanne boasted five Meilleurs Oeuvriers de France, the highest qualification a French chef can achieve: two at the Troisgros restaurant, two with their own patisserie shops, and one charcutier. The textile business brought a weekly influx of commercial travellers who walked out of the station and into the nearest restaurant. Jean-Baptiste Troisgros fed them well, and made them feel at ease by providing a large communal table at which to enjoy the restaurant's food, wine and gossip. Roanne has repaid the debt it owes the family by painting the railway station salmon-pink and green in honour of the Troisgros signature dish, escalope of salmon with sorrel. The family, by dint of talent and hard work, now sits atop a culinary empire. Like any empire, it emits good and bad influences. The ultra-modern design of the restaurant is highly controversial; for me, it demonstrated none of the taste which made my meal enjoyable. Neither did the enormous glass showcase - with everything from jams to whiskies for sale - which confronts you as you enter. But once seated, I found the service and the food exceptional; in particular, two fish dishes. Half a lobster perfectly grilled with a chive butter was preceded by a mousse of scallops which contained the last of this season's sea-urchins. It arrived at the table in a small blue and white soup dish, glistening white like a snow ball. After dinner, Michel Troisgros told me that my appreciation of this dish had been surpassed by diners at another table that evening. They had enjoyed this dish so much that they had ordered an extra two servings before the rest of their meal. Pic: 285 Avenue Hugo, Valence. Tel: 75.44.15.32. Fax: 75.40.96.03.

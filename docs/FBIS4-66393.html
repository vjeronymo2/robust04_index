The  microcrystalline layer has homogeneous structure and very fine  grain size (less than 0.1 m) consisting of only _g_-phase,  while the cast alloy is composed of _g_, _g_' and carbides.  The  oxidation resistance of the microcrystalline layer was much  better than that of the cast K17F alloy, and was even superior  to that of the aluminized alloy. At first, the oxide scales  formed on the cast K17F alloy were composed of mainly  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] with small amounts of Cr, Ti and  Ni oxides. However, after 500 h oxidation, the content of  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] in the oxide scales reduced  because of its spallation during exposure, and the oxide scale  was mainly composed of Cr[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and  TiO[.sub]2[/]. On the contrary, the oxide scale formed on the  microcrystalline layer of alloy K17F was found to consist of  only _a_-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] which had excellent  adhesion and did not spall in the duration of exposure. The  beneficial effects of microcrystallization on the oxidation  resistance of the superalloy are briefly discussed.</p>

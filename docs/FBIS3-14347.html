The sources identified the points so far agreed with the  Israeli side as follows:    1. Presence of international forces in Hebron, as a unit  including international observers from Norway.    2. Formation of a Palestinian police unit for deployment in  Hebron. It will have a joint Israeli-Palestinian command and is  expected to consist of several hundred members.    3. Joint patrols of Israelis, Palestinians, and foreign  observers to be formed.    4. Seven days after the final agreement between the two  delegations to the negotiations, a Palestinian armed police  force to enter the West Bank and assume its task of maintaining  security.    5. The "caravans" quarter in the Jericho area to be vacated  and the Jews evacuated from central Hebron three months later,  to be assembled elsewhere, perhaps in the settlement of Qiryat  Arba'.    6. All deportees to be allowed to return to Jericho.    7. The PLO leadership to enter Jericho one month after the  establishment of a Palestinian police headquarters. A vanguard  force may be allowed in before that to pave the way for the  arrival of the leadership.    The sources say that 'Arafat still has not given his final  approval and linked the resumption of the negotiations to the  implementation of practical measures, and that there is still  some disagreement on details such as the size and powers of the  international force. 'Arafat has rejected the idea of  international observers along the lines of the International Red  Cross and the Relief Agency. There is still some disagreement  regarding the status and armament of the Palestinian police  force in Hebron and regarding the evacuation of settlers from  the area of the holy al-Ibrahimi mosque.    According to sources close to the Palestinian president, the  main issue which still worries 'Arafat and which has been the  subject of Arab and international contacts is the PLO's  deteriorating image in Palestinian circles after the Hebron  massacre. That is why he has sought support for moves to compel  Israel to make concessions on matters relating to the living  conditions of the people of the occupied territory, to make them  feel that there has indeed been some change.    Meanwhile, an official spokesman for the Popular Front for  the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], led by Dr. George Habash,  has stated that the second Hebron massacre which was committed  the day before yesterday -- in which five people were martyred,  a large number were wounded, and over 10 houses demolished --  confirmed that Security Council Resolution 904 did nothing for  the Palestinian people and only offered a way out for the  resumption of the negotiations. The spokesman called for an  immediate halt to the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations,  effective international protection for the Palestinian people,  and efforts to dismantle the settlements which, he said, are "a  time bomb set to explode at any moment." The Palestinian  official spokesman said that it is the duty of the world and of  the Security Council to protect the Palestinian people,  implement the UN resolutions, and deter the occupation's policy  of daily massacres, destruction, and murder. The Palestinian  spokesman held Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and his  clique largely responsible for what is going on in the occupied  territory and urged him to resign. He added: The patriotic  forces will continue their struggle by all political and  military means and will escalate the intifadah until the  downfall of the "Oslo-Cairo agreement."</p>

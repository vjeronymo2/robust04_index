			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Observer: Like father, like son Will the Foundation for Manufacturing and Industry - a new body which kicks off today with the mission of bolstering the UK's non-service sector - be just another think tank, or will it genuinely help to galvanise the economy? It has an impressive pedigree, with corporate backers including blue-chip companies such as British Airways, Glaxo and Unilever. And its governing council is staffed by some of the UK's more eminent business figures, led by Sir Trevor Holdsworth, chairman of National Power and former president of the Confederation of British Industry. Its council includes former FT editor Sir Geoffrey Owen (now director of the LSE's centre for economic performance); Sir Michael Richardson, chairman of Smith New Court; and Douglas McWilliams, the CBI's former chief economist. McWilliams, 41, this year left the CBI to set up his own think tank, the Centre for Economics and Business. He says that part of his outfit's services to companies is advising how to hire outside consultancies for important but non-core activities. His advice to FMI will no doubt come in useful. It can also be guaranteed a hearing. For his father, Sir Francis McWilliams, will, on retiring from his year as London's Lord Mayor in November, become chairman of the FMI's trustees.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Damir Kozul report from Benkovac] </F>   [Text] The current cease-fire between the Croatian Army  and the Serbian Krajina army on the Benkovac front is being  observed less and less each day. After a relatively quiet night  and morning, today at 1030 the Croatian Army launched a fierce  tank and infantry attack in the northwestern part of the  Benkovac front in the region of Privega. After the Krajina  army's fierce response, the attack was successfully repelled.  There were no casualties in the ranks of the Serbian army, but  new material damage occurred.    The Croatian Army also shelled our army's positions in the  Obrovac Brigade operational zone. So far we have no information  about casualties. At the moment of filing this report, fierce  artillery duels are in progress on this part of the northwestern  Dalmatia front.</p>

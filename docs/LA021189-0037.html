			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISPARITIES IN PROPERTY TAXES CREATED BY PROPOSITION 13  </P> <P> Some of your readers defended the passage of Prop. 13 by starting that prior to  July 1, 1978, there was doubt whether citizens had the right or the privilege  to own property. This means that Prop. 13 gave everybody the "right" to  ownership. Of course, this happened because someone else is being forced to  pick up their share of property taxes. I wonder what would happen if these  people, who cried out so loudly that taxes were making it impossible to own  their own houses, had to fork over their fair share of taxes instead of forcing  the rest of us to carry part of their burden?  </P> <P> CHARLES D.

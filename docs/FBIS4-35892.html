			<p>BFN     [Text] Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan has said the worst  time of the blockade is over and that only a little remains now,  thanks to the steadfastness of the Iraqis and their rallying  around their symbol leader, struggler President Saddam Husayn.    During a meeting with the chairman and members of the  Executive Bureau of the General Federation of Trade Unions  today, Ramadan said the steadfastness of the struggling Iraqi  people, their jihad spirit, absolute faith in their just cause,  and constant readiness to make sacrifices will fragment the  unjust blockade and thwart colonialist-Zionist schemes and their  evil objectives.    Taha Yasin Ramadan urged direct interaction with the  citizens  and diagnosing their suffering and ways of remedying it through  presenting views and opinions that enhance the steadfastness of  the people and their ability to face the unjust blockade and  foil the remaining chapters of the colonialist-Zionist  conspiracy.    He stressed that the brave jihad position of the Iraqi  people  and their valiant steadfastness in the face of the malicious  blockade have removed all the justifications of aggression and  contributed to isolating the U.S. position that aims at  perpetuating the blockade in order to undermine Iraq's security,  sovereignty, and free, independent will.</p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Letter: Reject the impassioned lobbies Sir, Your leader, 'One cheer for the chancellor' (October 30), affirms the chancellor's right to insist on the maintenance of economically valuable capital spending in a recession. However, not all capital projects currently vying for support fall into this category. One notable example is London's Jubilee line, which has a negative return measured on a cost benefit basis. The credibility of the government's economic policy is to be judged by its willingness to reject such cases despite impassioned lobbying.

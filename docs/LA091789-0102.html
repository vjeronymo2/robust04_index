			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STORE ROBBED OF $500,000 IN JEWELRY  </P> <P> Three robbers brandishing handguns took $500,000 worth of jewelry from a  Sherman Oaks department store Friday night, stuffing necklaces, bracelets, pins  and rings in bags as horrified customers and clerks looked on, police said  Saturday.  </P> <P> It was the second robbery of expensive jewelry from a department store at the  Sherman Oaks Fashion Square in recent months, Los Angeles police said.  </P> <P> No shots were fired and no one was injured during the robbery of Bullock's fine  jewelry department about 8:20 p.m.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bullock's Robbed  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Sgt. Don Holmes said the three men walked into Bullock's at  14000 Riverside Drive and forced one of the store clerks to open the locked  jewelry case.  </P> <P> Then, as other clerks and customers watched, one of the gunmen jumped over the  display counter and grabbed handfuls of assorted jewelry, stashing them in  bags, Holmes said.  </P> <P> "It's kind of unusual that they could get that much" so quickly, said Sgt. Ted  Hanson.  </P> <P> The gunmen, all said to be in their late 20s or early 30s, fled the mall in a  tan station wagon and were last seen driving north on Ranchito Avenue two  blocks away, Holmes said.  </P> <P> Bullock's executives declined to comment on the robbery. The displays were  repaired and stocked by Saturday afternoon.  </P> <P> During a robbery at the mall in July, about $200,000 worth of jewelry was taken  from the Broadway department store at the Sherman Oaks Fashion Square,  officials said.  </P> <P> Broadway store officials refused to comment on that robbery.  </P></p>

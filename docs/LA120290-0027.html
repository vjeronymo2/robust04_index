			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> AND FINALLY: It's just been one embarrassment after another for NARAS, the  industry organization whose voters gave the Best New Artist Grammy of 1989 to  Milli Vanilli, pop's now- disgraced lip-syncing cover boys. The latest? NARAS's  1990 Grammy eligibility ballot, which went in the mail Tuesday to NARAS voters  around the country, still lists Milli Vanilli as candidates for Album of the  Year, Record of the Year, Best Pop Performance by a Group or Duo and Song of  the Year.  </P> <P> The ballots may have been printed before the MV scandal. But NARAS execs made  room for a cover letter noting that several categories listed inside had been  omitted -- why couldn't they have reminded voters that MV were no longer  eligible for another award? As one longtime NARAS member put it: "Geez, what a  foul-up! Just when you thought we couldn't look any worse. You'd think we'd  want to bend over backwards to fix this and put it behind us." . . . And nope  -- that's not a Donald Trump impersonator with Precious Metal. The fading  financial wiz is now a video star, courtesy of the all-gal heavy-metal band,  who cast him as "Mr. Big Stuff," the (dare we say) villain of their current  single.  </P></p>

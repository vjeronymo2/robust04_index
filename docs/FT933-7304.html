			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Brazil shocked by scale of massacre BRAZIL's National Security Council is to hold an emergency meeting today to discuss protection of indigenous people after the official death toll for a recent massacre of Yanomami Indians climbed to 73. An investigation by the National Indian Agency and federal police found 15 men, 20 women and 38 children from the world's oldest surviving tribe had been slaughtered by machete- and gun-wielding gold miners in northern Amazon  -far more than the 17 originally thought. 'The only word for this is genocide,' said a shocked Mr Aristides Junqueira, attorney general, after visiting the bone-littered site of the massacre. Discarding doubts over the high numbers of victims, he added 'there is no way that the number is being exaggerated. . . what I saw there was a scene of war'. Mr Mauricio Correa, justice minister, yesterday rejected federal intervention in the area but admitted fears of further bloodshed between the miners and Indians. Under the 1988 constitution Brazil guaranteed the protection of its estimated 250,000 remaining indigenous people through demarcation of reserves. Two years ago a reserve the size of Portugal was created for the 10,000 surviving Yanomamis and 25,000 miners expelled from the area. But the reserve lies on one of the world's richest mineral deposits and local politicians, business and military are lobbying to overturn the decree.</p>

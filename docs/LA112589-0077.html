			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPIES TAG ALONG WITH REFUGEES  </P> <P> East German secret agents posing as refugees have infiltrated West Germany in  recent weeks, taking cover in the massive influx of East Germans to the West, a  West German magazine reported.  </P> <P> A West German federal court on Nov. 15 charged one East German national with  espionage after his arrival in West Germany via Czechoslovakia, the magazine  Bunte said.  </P> <P> Bunte quoted federal police as saying the East German, who has confessed to  being a spy, swam across the Danube River -- which forms part of the border  between Czechoslovakia and Austria -- together with six other East German  intelligence agents.  </P> <P> West German authorities believe East German secret police took advantage of the  mass exodus of East Germans, who sometimes had to leave all of their  identification papers behind, and sent numerous spies to West Germany posing as  refugees.  </P> <P> Bunte said the agent, whose identity was not revealed, entered West Germany  using a false identity card.  </P></p>

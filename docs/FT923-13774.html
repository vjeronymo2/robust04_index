			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Account closes with renewed losses A FORAY into the FT-SE 2,500-plus territory proved only too brief yesterday and the UK stock market ended the two week trading account firmly on the downward path again. Good news on domestic inflation had been largely discounted and served only to depress shares in the retail store companies which have been forced to trim prices in the face of weak demand. In very early trading, the market was ahead by more than nine points for a Footsie reading of 2,507.0. The mood was brightened by the 30 point gain in the Dow Industrial Average overnight. But the buying orders in London represented little more than the final fling of the bear-closers, needing stock to meet previous selling commitments. Once these technical traders had finished, the market was left to the mercy of the depressing economic and corporate background, enlivened in places by some highly speculative features. The FT-SE Index closed down 7.1 at 2,490.8, moving uneasily in late trading as Wall Street made a slow start to the new trading session. SG Warburg Securities cut its year-end forecast for the Footsie from 2,900 to 2,750 yesterday. News that the UK June Retail Price Index had risen by only an annualised 3.9 per cent helped government bonds for a while but gilt-edged stocks were shading easier at the close. Although it lost only 6.3 last week, the Footsie has shed 43.3 points, or 1.7 per cent over the two week trading account. Investors' confidence has been shaken by downgradings of corporate profit forecasts by brokerage houses and by a flow of misfortunes in the new issue market, ranging from the price reduction of the MFI issue and the failure of The Telegraph share sale. The rally prompted by bear-closers towards the end of the week has been strengthened significantly by heavy demand from the US for the pharmaceutical leaders; Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham have risen sharply - but not Wellcome, whose share placing closes in a fortnight. Some US funds are believed to have turned firmly against the Wellcome placing and are applying funds once earmarked for Wellcome to increasing weighting elsewhere in the sector. Seaq volume moved higher yesterday, totalling 519.5m shares compared with 487m on Thursday, when retail business climbed above the Pounds 1bn mark for the first time this account. Retail, or customer, business in equities has remained at very low levels this week as investors have shied away from a nervous market.</p>

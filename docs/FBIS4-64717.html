			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "They Fear Contagion"] </F>   [Text] The news of the European Parliament's vote urging  Italy to observe the principle of democratic antifascism hit  newspaper and television editorial offices like a bombshell at  2200 yesterday evening. Our continent's most senior body  (elected, let us not forget, by universal suffrage by all the  community's peoples) "demands" --this is the word used in the  document -- that all member states call our country to order and  urge it to observe the founding principles on which the European  Community was created after the disasters of the war and after  the defeat of fascism, which cost bloodshed and lives not only  to the European nations but to the entire world.    This has never happened before. Never has a sovereign body  such as the Strasbourg parliament, a body which derives its  legitimacy directly from the people, issued such a lofty and  solemn signal, such an imperious warning, and never has one of  the member and founding states of the European federative  structure found itself in such a distressing and humiliating  position of international isolation.    Evidently the Europeans -- of whom the Strasbourg parliament  is the representative expression -- regard political events in  our country from a profoundly different viewpoint from the  relative majority of Italians, who voted for the right-wing  alignment 27 March. We said the "relative" majority, and this  aspect of the matter should be stressed: Even if the League is  included in the right-wing alignment, which has always declared  itself to be antifascist, the total amounts to 42 percent of the  votes cast; 58 percent of voters, of the center and the Left,  voted against it.    The attitude of the 42 percent of Italians who voted for  Berlusconi's coalition (though, without the League, the figure  falls to barely over 30 percent) is to forget the past; the  European Parliament, however, has reaffirmed the importance of  memory, of historical identity, of the constitutional legitimacy  on which basis democratic Europe was rebuilt.    Europe fears contagion by Italy: This is the sad fact  conveyed to us from Strasbourg. For that matter, we have  received the same message in recent days from all the European  and Western capitals -- whispered discreetly by government  officials and shouted out loud by the democratic parties and  major newspapers of the West.    The new political class that emerged victorious from the 27  March elections underestimated these events. They paid them no  heed. They blamed them on foreign newspaper correspondents  "manipulated by the Communists," as Mr. Berlusconi  contemptuously declared.    Well, it was, and is still, a much larger issue than that;  the conflict is much more serious than was imagined by a  businessman who within the space of three months has become a  political leader and prime minister-designate. He thought that  management of a television firm was sufficient experience in  order to manage a major country set in its international  context. He thought that his redeeming presence was enough to  cancel out historical and political ascendancies that have never  been disavowed. It is not so. Europe disagrees and is issuing  a warning; Europe is protecting us. It suffered contagion once,  and it does not want that fact, that disaster, that tragedy, to  be forgotten.    Our chief of state has proudly rejected Europe's warning;  our  democratic principles are firm, he stressed, and we do not  accept lessons. And we Italian democrats feel torn by  conflicting feelings. On the one hand, we would like to express  solidarity with Scalfaro in his proud defense of our people's  free and democratic decisions against any foreign interference.    But, on the other hand, we wonder: Is Europe foreign? Are  we not Europeans as well as Italians? Was this not the profound  principle that emerged from the disastrous war? Are we not  members of that same family, and should we not therefore respect  the principles and institutions that we all freely provided for  ourselves?    This is the serious dilemma with which the European  Parliament has confronted the Italian people's political  conscience.    Meanwhile, we learn that Mr. Berlusconi convened the  management of the Fininvest company to examine the situation  last night, while [Northern League leader] Bossi is threatening  to withdraw from the coalition. This is the state we have  reached: the victors still arguing about the sharing out of the  ministries after a month, the prime minister-designate  consulting the managers of his company-party on matters of  state, and Europe alarmed by the prospect of neo-Fascist  ministers.    It is a sad spectacle, and the future is uncertain. The  stock market was the first to recognize the fact, and after so  much euphoria, selling began to increase.</p>

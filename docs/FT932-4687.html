			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Price cutting leaves JFB 38% lower at Pounds 2.07m JOHNSON &amp; Firth Brown, the metals and engineering group, said continued price competition was behind a 38 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the half year ended March 31, writes Roland Rudd. Profits declined from Pounds 3.32m to Pounds 2.07m on increased sales of Pounds 63.3m (Pounds 60.3m). Mr Martin Llowarch, chairman, had expected the devaluation of sterling to help JFB 'fight against some fairly frightening price cuts'. But its German competitors had reacted by reducing their prices by a further 15 per cent. He said: 'Notwithstanding the UK devaluation, our European competitors' determination to maintain market share, given their lack of domestic markets and despite a higher cost base cannot be ignored.' Operating profits from Firth Rixson edged up from Pounds 1.46m to Pounds 1.55m. Viking Metallurgical Corporation, purchased from Quanex for Dollars 12.8m (Pounds 8.5m) in March, exceeded expectations. Light engineering, which manufactures products such as cables and machinery, saw its operating profits fall from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 1.7m. JFB had net cash balances of Pounds 4.8m, excluding medium-term borrowings, after spending Pounds 1.9m on capital investment and Pounds 4.9m on acquisitions in the half year. The interest charge of Pounds 730,000 compared to a Pounds 83,000 credit reflects the investments and lower interest rates. Earnings per share fell from 1.6p to 0.8p. The interim dividend is maintained at 1p.</p>

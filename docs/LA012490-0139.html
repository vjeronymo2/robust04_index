			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC CHORALE STILL HASN'T PAID ORCHESTRA  </P> <P> The Pacific Symphony was still waiting Tuesday for $37,000 it is owed by the  Orange County Master Chorale for having played in the chorale's Oct. 27 and  Dec. 3 concerts at the Orange County Performing Arts Center.  </P> <P> The orchestra was to have been paid in full on Monday, according to statements  reaffirmed by John Rhynerson, chairman of the Costa Mesa-based chorale, last  week when it was learned that the Pacific had pulled out of a Feb. 9 concert  with the chorale because of the debt.  </P> <P> Yet, as of press time late Tuesday afternoon, the money still had not arrived,  according to Louis G. Spisto, the orchestra's executive director.  </P> <P> "We have not heard from them," Spisto said. "At this point, we are just waiting  to hear from them about what they are going to be able to do in the way of  payment."  </P> <P> Rhynerson could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Spisto said that no action has been planned, beyond informing the Pacific's  board of directors of the situation at a regularly scheduled monthly meeting.  </P> <P> "We certainly don't want to do anything that's harmful to the Master Chorale,"  Spisto said. "If they would only give us some clear indications of what's going  on, we'd be delighted and be willing to work with them on the problem."  </P> <P> According to Spisto, the Master Chorale had sent the orchestra a letter last  month proposing a three-payment schedule to retire the debt, beginning Dec. 15  and ending on Jan. 22.  </P> <P> "That hasn't happened," Spisto said.  </P> <P> The chorale plans to assemble its own orchestra for the Feb. 9 concert through  the local musicians' union, with no change planned in the program, according to  earlier remarks by Rhynerson. Frank Amoss, president of the union local, said a  bond for the entire amount of musicians' salaries would be required.  </P></p>

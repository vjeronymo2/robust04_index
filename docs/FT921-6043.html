			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Capital &amp; Counties It is perhaps just as well that Mr Donald Gordon, chairman of Capital &amp; Counties, has been sounding off against open market property valuations for so long. Complaining that the Pounds 325m valuation on the group's largest asset, the Thurrock Lakeside shopping centre, is unfair serves at least as some distraction from yesterday's news that Pounds 130m of shareholders funds disappeared last year despite a Pounds 100m rights issue in August. Some would say, though, that the Thurrock Lakeside valuation is generous given that it implies an initial yield of 4.6 per cent, only reaching 8.3 per cent in 1996 when rents are fully in place.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Stock Exchange to delay USM closure THE LONDON Stock Exchange yesterday bowed to pressure from companies, financial advisers and investors to delay the closure of the unlisted securities market until alternatives had been investigated. The exchange, announcing its decision after a three-month consultation period, said the USM would remain open to new entrants until the end of 1994. Companies would not have to move to the main market before the end of 1996, when European directives making the transition much cheaper are expected to be in place. Mr Martin Hall, the exchange's head of public affairs, said: 'There was a strong feeling it would have sent the wrong signal to close the USM without having a successor in place or thoroughly pursuing the debate.' The exchange also announced the creation of a working party to investigate 'the future capital raising needs of companies which are outside the scope of the Official List'. The number of companies which fall outside the listing requirements is likely to be relatively small, however. Current minimum requirements are a market capitalisation of Pounds 700,000, a three-year trading record, and the issue of at least 25 per cent of the company's shares. Mr Hall suggested that the investigation might discover 'there are types of companies which the stock exchange has never catered for'. The working party would not be restricted to investigating options which only the exchange could implement. Its primary task would be to determine whether there would indeed be an equity gap for smaller companies following the USM's closure. It would also tackle issues such as the creation of a market aimed at professional investors, which might enjoy a lower degree of regulation than one for the public in general. The party will be made up of representatives from companies, investors and financial advisers. Cisco, the City lobby group for smaller company interests, will be invited to take part, as will representatives of venture capital organisations. Mr Richard Balarkas, chief executive of Cisco, welcomed the announcement. Markets, Page 44</p>

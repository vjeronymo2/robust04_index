			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A RELEVANT FACT  </P> <P> Regarding Lawrence Christon's bashing of comedian Jerry Seinfeld ("Laughing on  Empty," Jan. 17):  </P> <P> It is clear that Christon appreciates social relevance. And certainly nothing  is wrong in that.  </P> <P> The problem is that he demands it, as if perpetually posed on the edge of his  seat for some piquant moment when the heavens open to reveal Deeper Truth. The  merely hilarious, then, being short of that moment, apparently causes Larry to  take his toys and go home.  </P> <P> While comedy certainly benefits from the likes of the Lenny Bruces and the Mort  Sahls, to be so myopic as to demand such of everyone discounts the  contributions of the Three Stooges, "I Love Lucy," David Letterman -- and Jerry  Seinfeld.  </P> <P> STEVE TATHAM  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

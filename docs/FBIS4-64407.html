			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Sedat Sertoglu: "Injustice to Turkey"] </F>   [Text] The Clinton Administration's opposition to Turkey's  wish to withdraw the oil in the Turkey-Iraq pipeline, which has  remained untouched for two years now, is a "serious injustice to  our country." That is the mildest way the matter can be  explained. The injustice that has been done to Turkey can be  clearly observed if the developments on the matter are listed in  chronological order as follows:    1. Turkey discussed the withdrawal of the oil in the  pipeline and the prevention of corrosion in the installations  with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Oxman when he visited  Ankara some time ago. Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin  also held talks on the matter when he visited the United States.  Meanwhile, the officials of the two countries discussed the  matter in their bilateral talks. In other words, Turkey  indicated that it does not intend to take any secret action on  the matter.    2. However, the Clinton Administration refrained from  responding to Turkey's appeals each and every time they were  made.    3. The last time the matter was discussed was when Prime  Minister Ciller visited Washington. Considering Washington's  reluctance to express its opinion, Turkey informed the U.S.  Administration again that it will launch a limited operation to  save the pipeline. Turkey was right because the United States  has condoned Jordan's behavior, which conflicts with the  requirements of the embargo on Iraq. King Husayn has been able  to sell anything he wishes to that country. However, Turkey has  been the country that has suffered most from the embargo.    4. It was at about that time that Ambassador Richard Barkley  discussed the matter with Under Secretary of Defense Frank  Wisner and Assistant Secretary of Defense Charles Freeman when  he held talks with them after the downing of two helicopters  over northern Iraq.    5. That was when the United States brought up the question  of the oil pipeline, as if it were the first time the United  States had become aware of that issue. The U.S. officials  insisted that the embargo on Iraq must not be violated.  Ambassador Barkley informed Wisner and Freeman that he would  contact Ankara and brief them on the matter later.    6. In his first message to Washington, Ambassador Barkley  said that Turkey did not plan to violate the embargo. He also  explained that, although the U.S. side was informed, Washington  has not conveyed the proposals it promised to Ankara.    7. However, we have ascertained that the messages Ambassador  Barkley conveyed to Washington later claimed that Turkey had  made an effort to unilaterally violate the embargo on Iraq. His  messages made Washington feel very uneasy.    8. While Ambassador Nuzhet Kandemir prepared to convey  Turkey's official reply to the U.S. Administration in  Washington, Ambassador Barkley called on the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs to complain.    9. The Turkish and U.S. officials discussed the matter for  the last time in New York. Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin  informed Ambassador Albright that Turkey will not use the funds  that will be raised from the sale of the oil in the pipeline.  He gave Jordan as an example. Ambassador Albright informed him  that the U.S. Administration will reply to Turkey in seven days.    10. Meanwhile, the Turkish officials were aware that  Ambassador Barkley conveyed unfavorable reports to Washington  against Turkey. They were also aware of the exaggerated views he  conveyed for the U.S. State Department's Human Rights Report.  Meanwhile, it has been claimed that the way he expressed  himself in reports he sent to Washington on the Kurds in Turkey  prompted the Clinton Administration to place the concept of a  political solution to the Kurdish problem on its agenda.    Turkey made an effort to hold talks with the U.S.  Administration, the White House, and other U.S. establishments  on several problems during the past year. It brought up those  problems even during luncheons. However, Ankara has been  surprised by the way the Clinton Administration has insisted on  not understanding Turkey's position. I wonder whether the  situation would have been different if Ambassador Barkley had  taken the time to consider the matter before he conveyed  messages to Washington? In fact, I believe that things would  have been different.    It is a fact that Ambassador Barkley stands to gain nothing  from the existing tension in relations between Turkey and the  United States. As an ambassador who has disrupted relations  between the two countries, he may find it difficult to secure a  position in the U.S. State Department when he returns to  Washington at the end of his tour in Ankara.    Meanwhile, the tense relations may lead to an "economic  threat" against Turkey. I would not like to be the person  blamed for that state of affairs.    That is a friendly warning while there is still time.</p>

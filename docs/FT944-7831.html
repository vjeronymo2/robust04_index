			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Budget 1994: Business sets out its case to Clarke - How industry is arguing for efforts to stimulate investment Mr Kenneth Clarke knows more than most previous chancellors of the exchequer about the benefits of investment in business. He is a son of the industrial east Midlands - and the grandson of an engineering pattern maker. He may recall, as he waits on the front bench on Tuesday to deliver his Budget, that his early years were spent in a pit village. His father progressed from colliery electrician to owner of a watch repair shop. This background of solid commercial endeavour suits the chancellor's image down to the ground. But will his Budget reflect the pressure from employers for practical help to encourage investment? The need to bolster investment in manufacturing was made plain by the news at the weekend that capital spending by industry was Pounds 2.74bn in the third quarter of this year - 1 per cent lower than the second quarter and unchanged from the same period a year ago. Investment has lagged behind the economic recovery although industry groups had predicted that it would be catching up fast. The disappointing figures may be revised upwards, but they serve as a warning. Earlier this year radical reform seemed to be on the agenda. Mr Stephen Dorrell, then financial secretary to the Treasury, appeared to question in public the high level of dividend payments by companies. The Institute of Fiscal Studies sees the tax treatment of dividends as an incentive for companies to pay profits to shareholders, rather than keeping them to invest in the expansion and development of the business. But the reaction to Mr Dorrell's intervention on taxation and dividends was swift. Lord Hanson, chairman of Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, accused him of 'sounding like a socialist'. Dividends, he said, were for the shareholders and the company to decide. The prime minister appeared to close the door on reform in his response. 'There's no question of dividend control from a Conservative government. Dividend control is socialism. I'm a Tory - dividend control is a non-starter,' said Mr John Major. With Mr Dorrell now at National Heritage, the IFS acknowledges that a move on dividend taxation is unlikely. But the chancellor is still under pressure to do something about corporate investment and his penchant for eye-catching policy, exhibited in the last Budget, promises innovation at least. Mr Ian Thompson, head of economics at the Engineering Employers Federation, is certain action is needed. He said: 'There is a long-term discrepancy in the British economy in that there is too much consumption spending relative to investment.' Last month the federation joined six other industry associations to petition the chancellor to stimulate investment. They called for the introduction of full first-year capital allowances for at least the initial Pounds 200,000 of plant and machinery, and they wanted capital allowances index-linked. They asked the chancellor to reform capital gains tax on corporate equity holdings to encourage continued investment, with the rate reduced according to the period for which the investment has been held. The CBI joined the federation in signing the open letter. Mr Andrew Buxton, chairman of its economic affairs committee, said that while the chancellor's options were limited, he should seek to boost investment and support smaller companies. The CBI is urging the expansion of venture capital trusts, which fill the 'equity gap' for small businesses, and improvements to enterprise investment schemes so they are tailored more for small companies. Mr Richard Brown, the deputy director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, can see no room for changes in corporation tax rates but thinks the chancellor might raise the threshold under which companies pay a basic rate of 25 per cent from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 350,000. Employers' National Insurance contributions might be cut by the chancellor - but only to balance an increase in employees' National Insurance which would be charged on all income in order to bring it into line with PAYE. Dr Ann Robinson, head of the policy unit at the Institute of Directors, said: 'Capitalism needs capital and we are saying to the chancellor that he needs to take a long-term look at the tax system.'</p>

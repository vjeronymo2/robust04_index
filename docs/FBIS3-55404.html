			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Vladimir Kiryanov: "Capitalists </F> of Poland, Unite To Trade With the East!"]    [Text] Warsaw -- Those were approximately the words with  which Stanislaw Ciosek, Polish ambassador to Russia, appealed to  participants in the "Poland and the East" economic forum held  recently in the city of Krynica. Here there was an exchange of  opinions among experts, politicians, scientists, and  entrepreneurs from four neighbor-countries -- Poland, Russia,  Ukraine, and Belarus. They discussed a "hot" topic: how to  establish regional economic collaboration.    "A very necessary exchange of ideas is taking place at our  forum, and impulses are being generated which will help  businesspeople to arrive at real contracts," Yuriy Kashlev,  Russian ambassador to Poland, told ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's  correspondent.    It is hard not to agree that there is a great need for ideas  and powerful impulses at the present transitional stage. As S.  Ciosek noted, Poland and its eastern neighbors at present have  very little chance of competing with giant international  capital. In his opinion, the central-eastern and eastern  countries should pool their efforts and create major economic  structures. Something else is also important. "The governments  must adopt a clear stance," S. Ciosek said. "We all have  similar conditions for the creation of mechanisms to facilitate  an advantageous exchange of goods and services. But the  mechanisms do not yet exist. Unfortunately, bureaucrats in both  countries -- Poland and Russia -- are too accustomed to mere  talk, to slogans and assurances, to consensus that is merely  verbal."    The state should also help to create the necessary  international accounting centers and think about guarantees for  businessmen, the creation of insurance companies -- everything  that, in the West, makes it possible to avoid risk in trade.  There is a lot of talk about this too, but everything stays the  same. "I think the Russians do not really know what they could  buy from us," S. Ciosek lamented. "They think of Poland in  terms of apples and potatoes. So they go to other countries to  look for technology..."    Of course, it is no bad thing that the Poles have learned to  sell us potatoes and apples. But Poland has already been  invited to participate in joint conversion projects with Russia  in the aviation industry, transportation, and other sectors,  projects which will have their application in the 21st century.  Poland, for its part, could offer the Russians some of its own  technologies for joint development.    And here is the opinion of Polish Marshal Jozef Oleksy, who  agrees:    "In central-eastern Europe and Russia," he said, "in the  course of changing the former systems, people have been strongly  attracted to a model of development based on unilateral  cooperation and integration in a Western direction. The time  has now come to reflect on this phenomenon. Whichever way you  look at it, it must be admitted that no system of aid from the  West -- which is selfish and does not always have a full picture  of the extent of real changes in the East, and furthermore has  its own recession and economic difficulties -- can resolve  problems relating to changes in the economic structures and the  economic development of Russia, Poland, Ukraine, and Belarus.  This means that, while maintaining close links with the world  economic system, it is necessary at the same time to seek a  basis for change in our own potential and in the development of  economic collaboration within the region."    It is first and foremost a question of government  regulation, government guarantees and insurance for firms, and  the formulation of customs and taxation agreements. Only then  will private and state firms active in the international market  be able to operate efficiently....    Yevgeniy Rogovskiy, Russia's trade representative in Poland,  noted that support from the governments for the entrepreneurial  activity which we would like to initiate must take the form,  first and foremost, of the creation of permanent information  systems which report to one another not on trivia, but on major  areas of internal demand.    He gave an illustration. It is well known in Russia that  Poland has decided radically to modify its petroleum-refining  industry. It is very much hoped that it will bear in mind the  enormous potential available in Russia and other countries.  Concrete interests could emerge in other sectors too --  electronics, chemicals.    Zbigniew Czezadlo, who works for the well-known Polish  brewery "Zywiec" and brought the product to the "Mining Lands  Fair," noted that at the moment business with the Eastern  neighbors is proceeding with difficulty. If you manage to sell  anything, it is exclusively on a barter basis. Last time, beer  was exchanged for Russian salt. He was very surprised to learn  that Russian enterprises have the right to pay for goods in hard  currency and to transfer that currency to the foreign producers'  accounts.    This may be an isolated case. But it shows how little  businessmen operating on different sides of the border still  know about their neighbors' economic potential, not to mention  their laws. Polish entrepreneurs now want to bring together all  the structures scattered across the country which are concerned  with the East, and to create a Polish business center in Moscow.  Its staffers, working on commercial terms, would take the place  of uninterested state officials. There are a great many other  ideas, such as the plan to develop the Eastern Institute, which  is already preparing a program for a grants foundation to help  students and scientists from the former USSR.</p>

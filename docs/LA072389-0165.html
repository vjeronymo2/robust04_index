			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MINERS IN LARGEST SOVIET COAL FIELD REJECT OFFER TO SETTLE WALKOUT  </P> <P> Miners in the Soviet Union's biggest coal field Saturday rejected a government  offer to end their weeklong strike, and reports indicated that half the coal  industry's 1 million workers remained off the job.  </P> <P> "All mines have stopped," the official Tass news agency reported from the  Donets coal basin in the Ukraine.  </P> <P> Miners in one major coal center, Karaganda in the republic of Kazakhstan, began  returning to work after negotiators worked out a settlement package, Tass said.  But other strikes were depriving vital factories of fuel and threatening  industry nationwide.  </P> <P> The Donets basin has 121 pits with an annual production of 210 million metric  tons.  </P> <P> About 5,000 miners gathered outside government offices in the city of Donets  and rejected the pact, which would have increased vacation time and paid  workers for time spent descending into pits.  </P></p>

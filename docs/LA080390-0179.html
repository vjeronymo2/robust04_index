			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> CNN SUSPENDS VIEWER CHOICE  </P> <P> Cable News Network, which began experimenting with a viewer choice segment on  its "Newsnight" program just last week, said today it will cancel the segment  when necessary because of breaking news.  </P> <P> The interactive news format, which allows viewers to choose two secondary or  feature stories using a special 900 telephone line, was suspended for the first  time Thursday night because of the breaking story on Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.  </P> <P> "The interactive segment is still very much alive. However, we will cancel it  on nights where there is a big breaking story," said CNN spokesman Steve  Haworth.  </P> <P> CNN said it received some calls from viewers Wednesday night complaining that  the network didn't show enough on the Iraqi invasion while it did use the  viewer choice segment on "Newsnight," which airs for an hour beginning at 9  p.m. PDT.  </P></p>

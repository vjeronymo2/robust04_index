Pursuant to the development agreement, in 1995 D will issue $20 million of its general obligation bonds (the 1995 bonds) to purchase land that it will grant to T. The development agreement also provides that, in 1996, D will issue $20 million of its tax increment bonds (the 1996 bonds), secured solely by the increase in property taxes in a special taxing district made under the improvements resulting from the development agreement. Substantially all of the property within the special taxing district is owned by T or D. T will separately enter into an agreement to guarantee the payment of tax increment to D in an amount sufficient to retire the 1996 bonds. The proceeds of the 1996 bonds will be used to finance governmentally owned and operated improvements within the special taxing district that will not give rise to private business use. Treated separately, the 1995 issue meets the private business use test, but not the private security or payment test; the 1996 issue meets the private security or payment test, but not the private business use test. Because the two issues are a part of a plan to provide the benefits of tax-exempt financing to T for its headquarters, however, the 1995 issue and the 1996 issue may be treated by the Commissioner as a single issue for purposes of applying the private activity bond tests. Accordingly, the bonds of both the 1995 issue and the 1996 issue may be treated as private activity bonds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> City E acquires an electric generating facility with a useful economic life of more than 35 years and enters into a 25-year take or pay contract to sell 30 percent of the available output to investor-owned utility M. E plans to use the remaining 70 percent of available output for its own governmental purposes. To finance the entire cost of the facility, E issues $30 million of its series A taxable bonds at taxable interest rates and $70 million series B bonds, which purport to be tax-exempt bonds, at tax-exempt interest rates. E allocates all of M's private business use to the proceeds of the series A bonds and all of its own government use to the proceeds of the series B bonds. The series A bonds have a weighted average maturity of 15 years, while the series B bonds have a weighted average maturity of 26 years. M's payments under the take or pay contract are equal to 30 percent of M's total costs (that is, the sum of the debt service required to be paid on both the series A and the series B bonds and all other operating costs). The allocation of all of M's private business use to the series A bonds does not reflect economic substance because the series of transactions transfers to M significant benefits of the tax-exempt interest rates paid on the series B bonds. Because of this actual transfer of benefits, M's private business use must be allocated on a pro rata basis to both the series B bonds as well as the series A bonds. Accordingly, both the series A bonds and the series B bonds are private activity bonds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The facts are the same as in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> except that the debt service component of M's payments under the take or pay contract is based exclusively on the amounts necessary to pay the debt service on the series A bonds. E's allocation of all of M's private business use to the series A bonds is respected because the series of transactions does not actually transfer benefits of tax-exempt interest rates to M. Accordingly, the series B bonds are not private activity bonds. The result would be the same if the series A bonds and the series B bonds had substantially equivalent weighted average maturities and E and M had entered into a customary contract providing for payments based on a ratable share of total debt service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1.141&hyph;16  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Effective dates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Scope.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The effective dates in this section apply for purposes of &sect;&sect;1.141&hyph;1, through 1.141&hyph;16, 1.145&hyph;1, 1.150&hyph;1(a)(3), and 1.1394&hyph;1 (the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> private activity bond regulations <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

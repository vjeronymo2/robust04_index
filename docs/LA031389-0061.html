			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAYING LEGAL;  </P> <P> A GUIDE TO PHASE 2 OF THE IMMIGRATION AMNESTY LAW;  </P> <P> ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  </P> <P> Farm Workers  </P> <P> The English and civics requirements of Phase 2 do not apply to those who  received temporary residency under the special farm workers program.  </P> <P> These people should apply for permanent residence, but the requirements and  deadlines are different than those for other amnesty applicants.  </P> <P> Those in the Group 1 category, who proved they have worked in agriculture a  minimum of 90 days in 1984, 1985 and 1986, could become permanent residents as  of Dec. 1, 1989. Those in Group 2, who proved they worked a minimum of 90 days  in agriculture between May 1, 1985, and May 1, 1986, could become permanent  residents beginning Dec. 1, 1990.  </P> <P> Green Card  </P> <P> The card for permanent residence -- the "green card" as it is commonly known or  Form I-551 as it is officially known -- is proof of legal permanent residency  in this country. With it, one is eligible to work in this country, and it is  possible to enter and leave the country with very few restrictions.  </P> <P> Loss of Card  </P> <P> In the case of loss or theft of the permanent residence card or if the  applicant changes his or her name, a new card can be requested by filling out  and presenting form I-90 to the Immigration and Nationalization Service.  </P> <P> Change of Address  </P> <P> INS officials have urged applicants who have moved since applying for amnesty  to fill out a change of address form, available at legalization offices.  </P> <P> Leaving the Country  </P> <P> If the permanent resident needs to leave the country for more than one year, he  must request permission from the INS before departing. A number of conditions  must be met for the INS to grant such permission. There are no restrictions on  permanent residents leaving the country for shorter periods.  </P> <P> The Family  </P> <P> If a minor received a permanent residency card when he was younger than 14, the  family should request a new card when the child turns 14. This can be done by  filing form I-90.  </P> <P> Someone who has been granted permanent residence may then apply to have their  spouse or unmarried children considered for legal status. This request should  be made in Form I-130.  </P> <P> Immigration officials in Los Angeles say families in such situations will not  be broken up while these applications are being considered -- which in some  cases can take many years.  </P> <P> These cases come under a section of law in which each country is assigned an  annual quota of 20,000 such applications. Some countries quickly fill their  quota because of the large number of applications. Then, a waiting list is  formed. In the case of Mexico, for example, the wait is a number of years.  Applications are weighed under a system of pre-established preferences. First  preference is given to the parents of U.S. citizens, followed by the parents of  legal residents.  </P> <P> Public Benefits  </P> <P> The 1986 immigration law specifies that newly legalized temporary residents  will not be eligible for federal public assistance for a period of five years  after obtaining legal status, with the exception of certain medical services,  including emergency medical aid, aid to the elderly, sightless or handicapped,  or in case of serious injury.  </P> <P> The INS has stated that it will consider aliens receiving public assistance in  cash as a public burden, and thus ineligible for legalization, although certain  exceptions may be made. A temporary resident who faces an extreme situation  should consult with a community legal aid organization before applying for this  type of assistance.  </P> <P> However, if necessary, temporary residents can freely and without fear of  hindering their prospects for legalization apply for food stamps, housing  assistance, medical attention, Medi-Cal, unemployment insurance, workers'  compensation and Social Security disability insurance.  </P> <P> Temporary residents can also enroll their children in Head Start school  programs and obtain assistance for vocational occupation and on-the-job  training. University students can also apply for certain types of federal aid.  </P> <P> People with doubts about their eligibility for some particular type of  government assistance should consult with a nonprofit agency that offers legal  assistance. Some of these groups are listed on Page 15.  </P></p>

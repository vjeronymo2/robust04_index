			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lhasa, January 4 (XINHUA) -- A gala parade of  elegant floats from dozens of local enterprises on new year's  day in downtown Lhasa fully demonstrated the determination and  confidence of the local government and people to expand economic  reform and actively advance toward the socialist market system  in 1994.    Tibet Autonomous Region is one of the few regions in China  where a highly centralized planned economy system still holds  sway, steps of reform are more prudent because of special  economic conditions.    At the end of last year, the local government formally  called  on people of the whole region to make a concerted effort to  deepen reform and to catch up with the pace of the national  development toward a market economy in 1994.    Enterprises in Tibet Autonomous Region used to depend wholly  on the protective preferential policies of the government for  their operation and management.    Encouraged by the economic boom all over the country,  enterprises in Tibet decided to actively participate in  competition and to improve their image, as part of the effort of  the whole autonomous region to adapt to the national  construction of a market economy.    Many things and words belonging specifically to the market  economy are no longer strange to people "on the roof of the  world".    A broker training course held by a Sino-U.S. joint venture  attracted a large number of local young people and the members  of the first group of about 20-plus futures brokers completed  their studies at the beginning of the new year.    Futures and stocks markets are to be established this year  for the first time in this land with the highest altitude.    Local people have also gradually adapted to the new  mentality  of a market economy, during the frequent economic exchanges with  other parts of the country.    More and more people in state-owned enterprises and  institutions have begun to do business in their spare time in  the "Sunday market" and the newly-opened "festival market".    Modernized commercial facilities have mushroomed in Lhasa  and  laid a firm foundation for its commercial prosperity.    The government of the Tibetan Autonomous Region attaches  much  importance to the implementation of state laws and regulations  on the establishment of a market economy, including the  "anti-unfair competition law" and "regulations on protecting  consumers' interest", in order to create a stable and positive  environment for the development of the market economy in Tibet.</p>

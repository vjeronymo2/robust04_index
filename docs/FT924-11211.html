			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Letter: Comparisons to bank on Sir, Richard Simmonds (Letters, October 24) may or may not be justified in unfavourably comparing a British with a Belgian bank, merely because the latter offered him 6 per cent more sterling for BFr50,000 in the UK. He should also have changed Pounds 1,000 into BFr at both banks in Belgium, and compared the ratio offered there with that in the UK. Then he could have decided whether the disparity reflected British banking greed, or the different values of foreign currency to domestic and foreign banks. Philip Mickelborough, 39 Kingsbury Street, Marlborough, Wiltshire</p>

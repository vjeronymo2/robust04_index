			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Sharp increase in UK insider dealing probes: Stock exchange says rise reflects higher rate of detection rather than greater number of offences There has been a sharp increase in possible insider trading cases detected by the London Stock Exchange, according to a Financial Times analysis based on unpublished official figures. The exchange's surveillance group, whose role is to scrutinise every share deal for signs of criminal activity, has opened 116 cases for investigation so far this year, including more than 75 into alleged insider trading. That represents an effective rise of around 50 per cent over the year before. Mr Michael Lawrence, the exchange's chief executive, wants to make the market safer for investors who do not have inside information. A series of measures is under consideration to ensure anyone buying and selling shares through a London securities house will not be severely disadvantaged if he or she has access only to published information. 'We do not want to have the image of London as a place where you can do insider trading and get away with it,' he said. These measures will be aimed primarily at pre-empting insider trading by making better use of the new computerised Integrated Monitoring and Surveillance System, which the exchange uses to detect unusual price movements or anomalous transactions. In the past nine months, the exchange has referred 10 possible cases of insider trading - the making of illegal profits from trading in shares when in possession of confidential price-sensitive information - to the Department of Trade and Industry. That compares with seven in the whole of 1993. According to officials, this reflects an increased detection rate rather than a rise in the incidence of the offence. The DTI has the power to appoint inspectors to carry out formal insider dealing investigations under the Financial Services Act, after receiving case files from the exchange, and also decides whether to prosecute. So far this year it has appointed inspectors in just five cases, including that of Lord Archer's order to purchase 50,000 Anglia Television shares, and there has been just one trial. The disclosure of the improved performance of the surveillance group is likely to increase pressure on the government to reform the law to improve the chances of achieving successful prosecutions against suspected insider traders. The DTI and the exchange have been widely criticised because, in the 14 years since insider trading became illegal in the UK, just 23 individuals have been found guilty of the offence. 'My concern is that the Exchange itself is brought into disrepute if there is not enough punishment,' said Mr Lawrence. Part of the reason for the low prosecution record is widely believed to lie in the criminal, as opposed to civil, nature of the misdemeanour. The burden of proving beyond any reasonable doubt, as is required in a criminal case, that someone possessed inside information when dealing and then proving that the motive for the transaction was to profit from that information - and that there was no other motive - has frequently been impossible.

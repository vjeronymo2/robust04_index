			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Management: Rolling out the contract Controversy has raged over the British practice of giving many company directors three-year rolling service contracts since the UK's largest pension fund declared war on them a month ago. But few people have stopped to question the difference between rolling contracts and three-year, fixed-term ones. It is not always as great as it seems. Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Postel, who is leading the campaign, says that 'a fixed (and renewable) contract of up to three years gives us no qualms'. Why not, when quite a number of three-year 'fixed' contracts are actually renewed every year? This makes them, in effect, rolling contracts of between two and three years, depending how much time has elapsed. The practice of such annual renewals is well-known to the highly-respected Monks Partnership, which specialises in boardroom pay. In a study undertaken a year ago, two-thirds of the chairmen and chief executives of a sizeable sample of large companies said they were on notice periods of exactly three years. Less than a fifth were on between one year and three, 7 per cent were on less than a year, and almost a tenth were on three years plus. There has been little change since 1992, says Monks, although a few companies have cut notice periods from three years to two. Most of the 36-month notice periods are of the truly rolling variety, but some seem to be 'fixed', the firm adds. With the emergence of this further quirk in British executive feather-bedding, one can only admire last week's action of one large company, GEC, in replacing three-year rolling contracts by a three-year fixed term for new appointees; thereafter, they now get only a one-year rolling contract. Other companies should follow suit.</p>

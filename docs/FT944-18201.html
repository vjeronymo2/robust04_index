			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Japanese salarymen's earnings fall by 0.6%: First decline in private sector pay for 44 years Figures released by Japan's National Tax Administration yesterday showed that private sector employees' earnings fell by 0.6 per cent in 1993 from the previous year, the first fall in average pay since records began 44 years ago. Average annual salary was Y4.52m (Pounds 29,296), down by Y28,000 compared with 1992. Sharp cuts in the sizeable bi-annual bonuses paid to employees, which can amount to 30 per cent of annual salary, were the main cause of the decline. Basic salaries increased by 0.2 per cent on the 1992 figure, but average bonus payments dropped by 3.7 per cent. The long recession that began in 1990 has thus finally taken its toll on employee salaries. In the boom years of economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s, double-digit annual percentage increases in pay were the norm. After a brief deceleration in the early 1980s, salaries soared again during the so-called 'bubble economy' at the end of the decade, when asset prices and company profits jumped. In the last four years, the fall-out from the 'bubble' period has led to a collapse in corporate profitability, but until last year companies had maintained regular salary increases. With price inflation at just below zero, the decline in nominal pay translates into a slightly smaller decline in real terms. But both figures offer a stark illustration of the deflationary forces at work in the economy. Faced with falling prices, companies are being forced to cut pay, heightening the danger of a downward deflationary spiral. While the hard-pressed sal-aryman adjusts to unprecedented austerity, female Japanese employees last year recorded a slight advance. Average women's salaries rose 0.8 per cent, while men's fell by 0.5 per cent. The gender gap is unlikely to be closed soon. The figures showed women earned an average Y2.7m. The highest paid employees (both male and female) were once again in the financial sector, where earnings were an average Y5.5m. Total income tax paid represented 6.5 per cent of total earnings, low by international standards but close to an all-time high for the Japanese, who have long enjoyed the luxury of a low tax base. During the next few years, the figure will decline again as substantial reductions in income tax take effect. In spite of the decline in gross salaries, the low tax take leaves the average Japanese employee with one of the highest take-home pay-cheques in the world, more than twice that of his British counterpart. But the fact that Japanese prices are on average at least 60 per cent higher than in any other industrialised country means real purchasing power is little better.</p>

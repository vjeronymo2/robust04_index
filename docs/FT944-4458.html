			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Technology: The new road sense - Telematics promises to revolutionise transport Government ministers from around the world and about 2,000 expert delegates met in Paris last week to explore the vast implications of transport telematics. Telematics is the pooling of information and telecommunications technology to provide new systems and services. The message after three days of the first world congress on transport telematics is that the technology will: Bring radical change to how cars and trucks are designed and built, with significant safety advances such as automatic collision avoidance; radically change the way cars are used - drivers travelling on 'intelligent' highways may even be denied direct control of the vehicles in which they are travelling, yielding control to roadside computers giving instructions to the car by infra-red beams. Create international networks of these 'intelligent' highways, capable of guiding drivers across continents, around traffic jams and other obstructions to any chosen destination. However, they will also have controversial 'Big Brother' capabilities of continually monitoring the location and speed of entire vehicle populations. Save at least Ecu20bn (Pounds 16.6bn) a year on the cost of congestion, accidents and environmental damage in the European Union alone, according to European Commission estimates. Create vast new markets for the manufacturers and servicers of telematics technology. US expenditure on transport telematics alone is predicted to be nearly Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.6bn) by the beginning of the next decade, according to the Commission's forecasts. In Europe, it estimates the EU market to equip cars with telematics technology will be worth Ecu6bn over the next 10 years. 'Intelligent' highways do not necessarily mean more highways. The technology is aimed primarily at adapting existing highway networks and greatly increasing the 'intelligence' of cars to take the best advantage of them. Vehicles will be able to 'talk' to each other and with 'intelligent' highway control and monitoring systems. There will be on-board computers, micro-sensors, satellite positioning, synthetic voice transmission, digital road maps, radio telephones, infra-red and hyper-frequency beacons and detectors. Cars of the next century, for example, should be involved in far fewer accidents, making a big contribution to transport efficiency. Cars will be equipped with ultra-violet or infra-red headlamps for improved night vision. They will have a radar and infra-red based intelligent cruise control system, automatically maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, and use video image processing systems to stop straying between lanes. Should this fail and the car crashes, on-board sensors will automatically report the car's position to traffic controllers via the route guidance system in the dashboard which is in constant communication with a geo-positioning satellite. The car will exchange transmissions with roadside beacons, also using mainly infra-red, receiving information on traffic congestion, with suggested alternative routes for the route guidance system. It will transmit, via the roadside beacons, information about its intended destination to regional control centres. Most of this technology has already been developed under the just-concluded, eight-year Ecu900m-Prometheus collaborative research programme among Europe's car, truck and electronic systems makers. Cost remains a problem - only volume production can reduce the current cost of several thousand dollars of some of the more complex systems. But some others, such as ultra-violet night vision, could be introduced now for Dollars 500 or less. There are other benefits. Not least, while environmentalists may shudder at Commission estimates that transport demand in the EU will double by 2010, they may take comfort in the fact that the more efficient use of highway space promised by the telematics revolution should mean less land will be taken for new highways. With the technology at hand, the question for the world's transport authorities is how best to exploit it. Among examples of what is possible, Philips Electronique of France demonstrated in Paris the latest developments in its satellite-based Carin in-car navigation system, capable of guiding a vehicle across France, through digital maps on a dashboard display. UK-based Racal Messenger showed Talon, a video-based system for automatic reading of vehicle registration plates - a potential boon for police use. Trafficmaster, also from the UK, displayed its portable route guidance and traffic information system. The Pounds 200 unit - plus Pounds 19.50 a month airtime subscription - uses infra-red sensors and a radio unit mounted on motorway bridges and gantries. When sensors detect congestion, the information is radioed back to Trafficmaster's control centre at Milton Keynes and relayed 24 hours a day, to the map and information screens of subscriber units. The system covers all UK motorways. It is the only system in the world operating in 'real time' on such a scale, and adds substance to the contention of the European Commission that the heavy investments in transport telematics research made by European industry and research teams has provided a short-term technical advantage over competitors in North America and Japan. However, the Commission has just finished drafting an action plan for implementing transport telematics in the EU, to be presented shortly to the European Parliament, which warns the advantage is at risk unless the EU as a whole and member states co-ordinate better in key areas. European manufacturers of vehicles and vehicle telematics systems believe that projects such as Prometheus have given the region a technological lead in many key areas. Prometheus, the biggest collaborative motor industry research programme undertaken anywhere in the world, had a spectacular finale in Paris in October, when more than 90 prototype vehicles demonstrated the complete array of telematics technology. But developments are also moving rapidly in North America and Japan. The US Department of Transportation has just announced a 'national automated highway' research programme - a Dollars 200m, seven-year venture with a GM-led consortium to build a demonstration 'intelligent' highway capable of 'convoying' vehicles: roadside sensors would place the vehicle under the control of computers linked to regional control centres. Vehicles would be bunched much more closely together than in normal driving, with the computer system operating brakes and accelerator by remote signal. Such a system would use road space more efficiently. But many at the congress fear such a project may be overambitious. They point to the safety implications and the question of liability in case of accident. It is the belief that such systems lie further into the 21st century that has led Europe to concentrate more on autonomous systems for use in the car which help or warn drivers, rather than wrest control of the car from them. In Japan, drivers are already using route guidance and in-car telematics aids. As Shoichiro Toyoda, Toyota's chairman, pointed out at the congress, some 700,000 Japanese motorists have already purchased such systems, 350,000 in the past year. Thus while Europe might have a technological edge and North America the political will to lead, in manufacturing terms, the basis for a new industry once again appears to be emerging first in Japan.  -------------------------------------------------------------                 MOTORING-21ST CENTURY STYLE  ------------------------------------------------------------- VARIABLE MESSAGE DISPLAY            COLLISION WARNING SYSTEM  ------------------------------------------------------------- Warns of congestion and             In-car infra-red or radar accidents ahead, and re-            scans the road ahead, routes where possible.              alerting the driver to Data are collected via              obstacles, suddenly sensors built in roads,             slowing traffic and other video cameras linked to             collision risks.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, January 27 (XINHUA) -- Deputy Attorney  General Philip Heymann, the No. 2 official in the U.S. Justice  Department, resigned today because of different "operating and  management styles" with Attorney General Janet Reno.    Yet, in a joint press conference, neither elaborated on what  the operating and management differences were.    In a letter to President Bill Clinton this morning, Heymann,  a Harvard law professor who headed the department's criminal  division during the Carter administration, said: "The attorney  general has concluded that our operational and management styles  are too different for us to function fully effectively as a  management team."    Heymann is in charge of many of the operational functions of  the department and is a key manager in coordinating operations  among department agencies, such as the FBI, the drug enforcement  administration and the immigration and naturalization service.    The deputy attorney said he would stay on for a reasonable  time so that a successor could be found. But he said he  intended to return to teaching at Harvard University this summer.</p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Bunds take inflation data in their stride The German government bond market took the widely-expected rise in August inflation to a year-on-year rate of 3 per cent in its stride. Higher oil prices are believed to have caused the rise. 'The market was prepared for 3 per cent . . . but the rise does not change the view that German inflation is still falling, albeit more slowly than before,' said Ms Wendy Niffikeer, senior economist at IBJ International. She noted that in the cash market, 10-year yields dropped from 7.28 per cent at the opening to 7.23 per cent in the late afternoon. The market was also supported by comments from Mr Guntram Palm, a member of the Bundesbank's governing board, that the central bank was not unduly worried by the acceleration in inflation and that domestic factors spoke for a further reduction in inflation. These comments were interpreted by some dealers as suggesting that one more discount rate cut was possible after all. On Liffe, the September bund future was stuck in a narrow 28-basis point trading range. In late trading it stood 0.26 point higher at 91.63 in moderate trading. UK gilts continued their steady climb, reflecting the ever-stronger view among analysts that the market's favourable fundamentals would result in further gains over the coming months. Gilts were also supported by the numerous leaks from the Confederation of British Industry's monthly trends inquiry for August which is due to be published today. On Liffe, the long gilt future rose  3/4 point to 101 19/32 in the late afternoon. Yesterday's publication of the weekly notes in circulation were also seen as positive for the market. Mr Simon Briscoe at SG Warburg said the rise of 6.2 per cent in the week to August 24 meant that he would be looking for MO to rise by just 0.3 per cent in August. This would bring the annualised three-month rate down below 6 per cent which compared with 8 per cent in May. The Bank of England took advantage of the recent healthy demand for index-linked gilts by offering Pounds 250m of index-linked Treasury stock for sale. By contrast, dealers said the vast proportion of the Pounds 500m worth of conventional stock on offer was still unsold because its price was thought to be around one point too high for the market. US Treasury bonds yesterday afternoon gave back all of the gains struck in Wednesday's big rally. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 15/16 at 99 17/32 , with the yield rising to 7.533 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  3/32 at 100, to yield 6.233 per cent. A mild downturn was not unexpected at the opening, in view of the surprising strength shown by bonds the previous session. True to form, prices eroded during the morning amid a round of light profit-taking. Still, the optimistic tone which had infused the market on Wednesday showed no signs of dissipating. The mood turned by the afternoon. Prices began dropping soon after midday in activity led by the futures market. An expected wave of follow-through buying from retail accounts, which had come off the sidelines to participate in Wednesday's successful five-year note auction, never materialised. As a result, bonds, especially on the long end of the yield curve, were showing big losses as the session was drawing to a close. The sudden reversal was nearly as big a surprise as the rally had been.</p>

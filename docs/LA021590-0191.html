			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NO BLACK ACTRESSES? PLAY MAY BE DROPPED  </P> <P> Santa Ana's Alternative Repertory Theatre is looking for four black actresses  to cast in its next offering, "Yalla Bitch," a coming-of-age drama about a  young black woman.  </P> <P> But when nobody showed up at an open audition earlier this week, artistic  director Patricia L. Terry said the storefront theater may drop the play, which  is to run from April 6 to May 27.  </P> <P> "We're holding another audition," she said. "We'd settle for one black actress  for the lead. If we can't find her, we'll have to look for another show."  </P> <P> Terry, who is white, speculated that the title of the drama by Lorna Hill -- a  black playwright from Buffalo -- might have offended minority actors and kept  them from showing up.

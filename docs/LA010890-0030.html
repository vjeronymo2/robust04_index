			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN SOUGHT IN MURDER KILLED IN POLICE CHASE  </P> <P> A murder suspect was killed in a shoot-out with police in a Wilmington  neighborhood after he shouted, "If you want me, come and get me," authorities  said Sunday.  </P> <P> No officers were injured in the shooting, which occurred as officers chased the  suspect through back yards and into the 1500 block of East Cruces Street about  7 p.m. Saturday, said Los Angeles Police Lt. Kathleen Murcott.  </P> <P> The murder suspect, a 23-year-old man, was not identified pending notification  of relatives.  </P> <P> The suspect was wanted in the Aug. 13 shooting death of Lanny Tapp during an  argument that took place a few blocks from Saturday's gun battle.  </P> <P> Police said they learned of the suspect's whereabouts Saturday from a resident  in the Wilmington neighborhood. Five officers went to Cruces Street, where  another resident pointed out the suspect and said he was carrying a gun,  Murcott said.  </P> <P> A chase ensued, with the suspect ending up in front of a Cruces Street  residence, where Officers Michael Marco, 42, and Matthew Spillane, 24, were  waiting, Murcott said.  </P> <P> When the suspect saw the officers, he pointed a gun and said, "If you want me,  come and get me," and began firing shots at them, Murcott said.  </P> <P> The two officers fired a total of 12 rounds at the suspect, who then collapsed  in the street, she said. He died about 30 minutes later at St. Mary Medical  Center in Long Beach.  </P> <P> Police recovered a .32-caliber semiautomatic pistol at the shooting scene.  </P></p>

Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, chief U.S.  nuclear negotiator with North Korea, will come to Seoul on  March 10 and meet with several South Korean officials the  following two days to coordinate a bilateral stance.    Gallucci will likely be accompanied by David Brown, chief of  the Korea desk at the State Department, and Gary Samore, deputy  chief in charge of non-proliferation.    Tom Hubbard, the top U.S. representative at working-level  negotiations with Pyongyang, is unable to accompany the  delegation because he is acting as assistant secretary in lieu  of Winston Lord, who is on a trip to Asia.    Seoul and Washington will draw up measures expected after  the  IAEA team, currently in the middle of inspections, successfully  concludes its monitoring of Pyongyang's nuclear facilities in  another week or so. They will discuss the agenda and principles  for the next round of North Korea-U.S. high-level talks, set  for March 21 in Geneva.    A key point concerns their demand for an inter-Korean  presidential envoy exchange before the high-level talks can open.    North Korea has yet to indicate that it will meet this  demand. Seoul and Washington are expected to reconfirm their  position that substantive inter-Korean dialogue is a condition  for the March 21 meeting.    Gallucci plans to hold a press conference on March 12 and  leave the following day.</p>

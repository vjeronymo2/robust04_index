			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Failure to disclose full pension information revealed COMPANY ANNUAL reports still fail to provide significant disclosure of pensions information, a survey for last year by actuaries William Mercer Fraser indicates. Only 10 per cent of the top 100 companies provide information on how pension surpluses are spread over the future working lifetime of employees. Two thirds give no information on dividend increases. SSAP 24, the accounting standard dealing with pensions, does not require disclosure, but the contributions can have a significant effect on reported profits. The survey also shows that only five of a sample of 165 companies mentioned the Barber judgment on equalisation of pensions, which is likely to have a strong impact on payments. Nearly a fifth of British companies have adopted the controversial practice of including intangible assets in their balance sheets, according to a survey in the March issue of Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based monitoring service of company accounts. Eighteen per cent of a sample of 630 quoted companies' most recent annual reports show the presence of intangibles, the non-physical assets of a business which contribute to future earnings. The legitimacy of using intangibles is being considered by the Accounting Standards Board in preparation for one of the most hotly debated accounting standards it is likely to draft. The most common - identified in 19 per cent of cases of those companies stating intangibles - is goodwill, the difference between the purchase price of an acquisition and the value of its tangible assets. Patents and trademarks arose in 13 per cent of cases and research and development costs in 12 per cent. Exploration costs, brand names and technical knowhow also occur frequently. Paradoxically, 6 per cent of companies treat items such as oil exploration costs and licences as tangible fixed assets. SSAP 24: Survey of Company Pension Disclosures 1991.

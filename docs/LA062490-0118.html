			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SELLER FINANCING: PANACEA IN SLOW MARKET;  </P> <P> MORTGAGE: BOTH BUYER AND SELLER BENEFIT FROM THIS TYPE OF FINANCING. TO SECURE  IT, BUYER SHOULD INCLUDE THIS CONDITION IN THE PURCHASE OFFER.  </P> <P> Suppose you were asked to name the easiest method of financing a home purchase.  What would you answer? VA mortgage? FHA mortgage? Assume an existing assumable  mortgage already secured by the house?  </P> <P> Those are all good answers. But they are not correct.  </P> <P> The best answer is "seller financing."  </P> <P> Many prospective home buyers have never heard of seller financing.  Surprisingly, many real estate agents have never used it either. Seller  financing means that the seller of the home finances all or part of the sales  price, so the buyer doesn't have to go to a bank, S&amp;L or other lender to  obtain a new loan.  </P> <P> In other words, the seller lends the buyer the money to buy the home. On Wall  Street, it's called a leveraged buyout. The seller's security for the loan can  be a mortgage, trust deed, land contract, contract for deed, contract of sale,  agreement for sale or any other method where the property being sold is the  security for the loan.  </P> <P> To illustrate, suppose you are buying a $150,000 house. You have a $15,000 down  payment, can handle the closing costs, have a good job and a good credit  history. The sellers, a nice elderly couple, own their home free and clear, but  they plan to move to a retirement home.  </P> <P> Your offer of a $150,000 sales price, a $15,000 cash down payment and a  $135,000 seller-financed first mortgage at, perhaps, 10% interest might meet  their needs perfectly. The monthly interest payment of $1,125 will give the  sellers excellent retirement income and a higher yield than they can probably  earn elsewhere with equal safety.  </P> <P> The big advantage of seller financing for the buyer is easy financing. Since  the property being sold is the loan security, most sellers don't even check the  buyer's income and credit history. However, most real estate agents can get a  credit report on the buyer, so the seller will know if he or she pays the bills  on time.  </P> <P> From the buyer's viewpoint, a possible disadvantage might be that many sellers  will only carry back financing for five to 10 years. However, since most buyers  usually don't keep a home longer than 10 years, this really isn't a significant  disadvantage.  </P> <P> The advantages of seller financing are numerous for home sellers. They include  quick, easy sale for top dollar; excellent investment secured by a property the  seller knows well, possible double profit if foreclosure becomes necessary and  the seller reacquires the home to sell again for a second profit and a  higher-yielding investment that is available elsewhere.  </P> <P> The possible disadvantages for the seller include tying up equity instead of  receiving cash, possible foreclosure hassle if the home buyer defaults and the  risk that the house might drop in market value.  </P> <P> Since the advantages of seller financing outweigh the slight disadvantages for  buyer and seller, most home buyers want to know where homes with seller  financing can be found. Unfortunately, few real estate listing agents encourage  their sellers to carry back a first or second mortgage. So it is usually up to  the home buyer to create seller financing.  </P> <P> This is done when making the offer to purchase the home. If the home being sold  is owned free and clear by the seller, this is a perfect candidate for seller  financing. Or, if the home has an assumable first mortgage, such as one of the  older VA or FHA home loans, the buyer can assume that loan and the seller can  carry back a second mortgage.  </P> <P> Until the buyer makes a written purchase offer that provides for seller  financing, many sellers have never considered the advantages of financing the  sale of their home. I will always remember the 83-year-old home seller who  carried back a 10-year mortgage when I bought her house.  </P> <P> She told me the $1,033 I will be paying her each month is more money than she  has ever earned before in her life. It enabled her to move into an apartment  close to her children and to live in financial dignity without have to look to  them for support. Until that lady saw my purchase offer on her kitchen table  and the real estate agent explained the benefits, I don't think she had ever  thought of financing the sale of her home.  </P> <P> I find the best candidates for seller financed homes are those which have been  owned a long time and are being sold by elderly sellers. Another good sign is a  vacant house. That usually means the seller is not just testing the waters, but  really must sell and will listen to any reasonable purchase offer.  </P> <P> An even better signal of a possible seller financed home is when you learn from  the real estate agent that the seller has already bought another home. Chances  are, that seller is worried about the old home being vacant and is very anxious  to have it sold. Seller financing can solve the problems of both home seller  and buyer.  </P></p>

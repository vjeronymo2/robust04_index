			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Praise for Hungary's farmers Hungary's farmers are among the best placed to benefit from a liberalisation in world trade following a successful conclusion of the Gatt Round, according to a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-op-eration and Development. The study finds that the level of agricultural subsidy in Hungary is lower than in any of the 24 developed states bar New Zealand. Hungary has a 'producer subsidy equivalent' of just 8 per cent compared with an OECD average of 44 per cent, according to 1992 figures. Budapest's Agriculture Ministry said that the low level of support put Hungarian farming in a strong position in the event of a Gatt breakthrough. While most countries would have to cut subsidies, Hungary would be allowed to maintain the current level of support and competitiveness would therefore improve, the ministry said.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 11 (XINHUA) -- French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe failed today to convince the United States  to exert pressure on the Bosnian Muslims to accept an imposed  peace plan in the Balkan republic.    Juppe arrived here this morning to meet with U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher in preparation for a foreign  ministers' meeting on Bosnia Friday in Geneva.    Before his discussions today with Juppe, Christopher said:  "The best kind of a settlement is one the parties agree on."    His spokesman, Mike McCurry, added a footnote to the  remarks.    "It's our view that imposing a settlement on the parties is  not the best way to bring it about," McCurry told a state  department daily briefing.    The United States also rejected French and European  suggestions that the international community relax sanctions  against the Serbian Republic to encourage the Bosnian Serbs to  cede some of their captured territory.    Instead, Washington is calling for tougher sanctions and  enhanced enforcement of those already in place.    "There is a strong argument to be made for increasing the  pressure of sanctions, either by increasing their scope, or if  not that, at least their enforcement," McCurry said.    France, along with other European Union contributors of  troops to the UN peace-keeping force in Bosnia, has threatened  to pull out if there are no prospects of a political settlement.    "It's a question of weeks, maybe some months, but it will  not  be possible to have a new winter in Bosnia," Juppe said.    "The time has come for a peace settlement, there is no  military solution for Bosnia," the minister said.    France has some 6,000 troops on the ground in Bosnia. During  the conflict, 21 of them have been killed and more than 300  wounded, reports said.    Members of the United Nations are trying to avert an  escalation of violence in Brcko, another potential hot spot in  Bosnia, which has seen an increase of troops and weapons by all  three warring sides.    The United States has pinned the major blame on the Serbs  for  the two-year bloody war and is sympathetic to the Muslim-led  Bosnian government.    The Muslims are apparently resisting a settlement for the  time being in hope of rolling back some of lands conquered by  the Serbs, who now control some 70 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "We think it's reasonable for the Bosnian government to hold  the view that a cessation of hostilities agreement that doesn't  have a sunset or doesn't expire at some point might run the risk  of keeping in place current lines of confrontation, which then  makes a peace settlement much more difficult to achieve,"  McCurry said.    The Geneva meeting will involve Christopher and Juppe, as  well as foreign ministers from Russia, Britain, Greece, and  Belgium.</p>

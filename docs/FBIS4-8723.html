			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic of  Croatia, today chaired the 40th session of the Presidential  Council for Defense and National Security, held at the  Presidential Palace. The council discussed the current  political situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the Republic of  Croatia. The Council also heard a report by Mate Granic, the  deputy prime minister and foreign minister, after his return  from Turkey and Greece.    Concerning the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, it was  viewed  that relations between Serbs and Muslims and relations between  Serbs and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] and the international  community are deteriorating once again.    The council examined President Tudjman's recent state visit  to Bosnia-Herzegovina and came to the conclusion that the visit  would further consolidate the positive orientation of the  Washington agreement, and also encourage those forces in  Bosnia-Herzegovina advocating a peaceful solution to the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In connection with the cease-fire with local Serbs from UN  protected areas the council reiterated the Croatian leadership's  position that there can be no resumption of talks with the Serbs  outside the Republic of Croatia.

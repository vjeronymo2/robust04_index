			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (13): In with the 'IN' crowd - Intelligent networks TWENTY or more years after their introduction, it is estimated that freephone and other types of so-called 'intelligent network' (IN) calls generate around 18 per cent of total telecommunications income in the US. The market research company, Frost &amp; Sullivan puts US service revenues for these calls at Dollars 19.6bn in 1991, and forecasts a business worth Dollars 34.5bn in 1997. In Europe and Asia, where telephone companies were traditionally less consumer-oriented and the mass telephone habit has been slower to develop, freephone and other IN services were previously neglected. Not so today. With competition to the incumbent operators on the increase, the revenue-earning possibilities of new products such as IN services are attracting the close attention of many PTTs. Interest is not confined to the former monopoly operators. In mid-June, for example, the UK's second carrier Mercury Communications launched its own freephone and low tariff services. The company believes that these types of call are currently worth around Dollars 300m in the UK, and that the figure will double in the next five years as organisations use the services to help maintain established customer bases and attract new businesses. 'Common areas of usage for this service so far include banks, insurance companies, building societies, hotels, airlines and telemarketers,' says Richard Dorgan, freephone product manager at Mercury. 'We anticipate that in time it will be considered unusual for a customer to pay for an enquiry call in nearly all sectors of business.' Freephone is the highly visible tip of the IN iceberg. In essence an IN involves the addition of computer intelligence to the conventional telephone network to allow a number of permutations on the traditional function of connecting one wireline subscriber to another by the most direct route, and charging the call originator for the privilege. As well as reversing normal charging procedures and adding alternative delivery options based on time and location criteria, computer intelligence facilitates the introduction of a whole range of new services. Included are offerings such as virtual private networks, in which unused public network capacity is partitioned off for private company use, credit card calling, calls to personal numbers regardless of an individual's physical location in the network or in the world, the display of in-coming caller numbers, automatic re-routing of calls around a network to accommodate traffic surges following televised appeals or disasters, and pay-per-use telephone information services which encompass anything from weather reports to so-called 'sex lines'. Cellular telephony is itself a species of IN service. Initial IN offerings, such as freephone, were built to be accessed nationwide but, to reduce operator costs, used a small number of large centralised data bases which were interrogated over a special transmission network as the need arose. Future implementations are likely to be more specialised, both in terms of content and geographic availability. Derek Hadden, Mercury's IN Product Manager, believes that one future possibility is for local IN services to be tailored to the needs of one or more large corporate customers, providing switchboard, automatic call distribution and database retrieval functions from within the public network, with the ability to vary operating parameters on a day-to-day basis. At the same time, though, Mr Hadden envisages the extension of IN services on the international front. This could take various forms, including cross border freephone, 'follow-me' telephone calls around the globe, and the selling of IN access from one country to another. 'You could provide a service to other carriers who don't want to spend money on developing their own IN infrastructure' suggests Mr Hadden. Frost &amp; Sullivan says 'everyone loves INs.' Corporate customers of such services are certainly keen and the reasons are not difficult to discover. In a recent Gallup Poll carried out for Mercury, it emerged that 91 per cent of the adult population in the UK was familiar with freephone services and that the presence of a freephone number in company literature would influence 38 per cent of the adult population to respond to that company rather than another. For telecommunications operators, the big 'plus' is that INs represent a relatively low cost method of getting a much better return on existing investments. 'By introducing intelligent networks you can aim to get more traffic over the same infrastructure, and you can start to charge premiums on these services,' observes Robert Harrison, principal consultant with the PA Consulting Group. 'The capital spend on equipment is far lower than the operators have already had to make to digitise the network.' As well as generating additional revenue, IN services can be implemented rapidly and provide better tools for the overall management and control of networks and services. IN equipment suppliers, including Alcatel, AT&amp;T Network Systems International, Ericsson, Fujitsu, GPT, Nokia, Northern Telecom and Siemens, see the technology as both a parallel commercial opportunity to their established exchange products and as a possible way to break into new national and regional markets. Mr Harrison of PA Consulting values the European IN equipment market in 1992 at Dollars 71m, rising to nearly Dollars 408m by 1997. However, IN technology presents problems as well as commercial opportunities for service operators and manufacturers alike. Some types of IN service require that the operators transfer some degree of network control to their customers. How this will be managed, and to what extent it will be permitted, are two of the unknowns of the future IN landscape. 'I don't think that anywhere in the world yet there's been enough experience of operating with a significant amount of user control,' notes Tony Cobbe, group director of GPT's Telecommunications Systems Group. 'We don't know whether there are, or are not, any network risks which arise from that.' INs also slice across traditional PTT management and operational structures, and adapting to their implementation may not be painless. For telephone exchange suppliers, the IN opportunity is distinctly double-edged. While new business may be generated, INs are to a large extent switch-independent, making it possible for PTTs to ignore established supplier arrangements. Also, since network management and data processing are crucial parts of the IN technology mix, suppliers such as DEC, IBM, Stratus and Tandem from outside the mainstream public exchange field are muscling into the act. Some observers envisage the computer industry in the longer term making off with the spoils of the market. Harrison acknowledges that the computer industry will become more active in the sector, but forecasts a marriage of necessity between the two industries - 'they both have relevant strengths. I think they actually need each other - whether they necessarily all realise that, is another matter.'</p>

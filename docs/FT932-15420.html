			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / NUT votes for strike ballot over pay scheme THE National Union of Teachers, the UK's largest teaching union, yesterday broadened its confrontation with the government by voting for a ballot on industrial action over performance-related pay. The move opens the possibility of strike action, if teachers in individual local educational authorities are disciplined for refusing teacher appraisal interviews, and adds to the controversy on the separate issue of boycotting national curriculum tests for children. It could also help the efforts of Mr John Patten, the education secretary, to persuade parents that opposition to the tests is unprofessional and politically motivated. Delegates to the NUT's annual conference over-ruled the leadership and voted by 89,105 votes to 82,472 to call for a boycott of interviews for teachers' appraisal, which is necessary for the planned introduction of performance-related pay. One delegate told the conference the pay scheme was a 'creep's charter', and the union should oppose it with 'all means possible'. Mr Patten, who described the decision as 'very regrettable', said: 'Strikes, boycotts and disruption of all kinds are not what parents want to hear from professionals and can only damage children's education.' Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the NUT, tried to play down the move, and said a boycott by teachers of their appraisal interviews would not affect children. He said the union did not oppose appraisal for teachers, but only its link with performance-related pay. The NUT will now hold two separate ballots next term - the first on testing, and the second on teachers' appraisal. Other teachers' unions and opposition politicians believed the move would deflect attention from the boycott of tests for children under the national curriculum, which seems likely to be enforced by the three biggest teachers' unions. Mr Nigel De Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, said: 'It's a tactical error. On the issue of testing we've got the whole world on our side, apart from Mr Patten and the cabinet.' Mr Don Foster, the Liberal Democrats' education spokesman, said the move would blunt the campaign against the tests. Mr Patten's efforts to save this year's tests received a modest boost yesterday from MPs on the cross-party select committee of education, who decided not to inquire into his handling of the national curriculum tests.

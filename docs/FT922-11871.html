			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Bonds: Hanson Pounds 500m fixed-rate issue tests investor resolve HANSON, the UK industrial conglomerate, yesterday launched the largest sterling fixed-rate Eurobond to date, a Pounds 500m offering via Credit Suisse First Boston. Although the five-year deal was fairly priced, the size was considered extremely ambitious for corporate debt which is not rated by the leading agencies. The resounding success of Hanson's Pounds 500m convertible bond offering last year was not to be repeated. But the deal performed well, despite some scepticism about the size of the transaction. 'The market really needed to tap the broadest investor base possible in order to absorb this sort of size,' one underwriter said. 'CSFB will have to work very hard to make this deal work.' Central banks, which would have been buyers of a large sovereign or supranational bond offering, do not buy corporate paper, and some fund managers cannot buy paper which is not rated by Moody's or Standard and Poor's, the two leading US-based rating agencies. (They only rate Hanson's short-term debt; however, Hanson's long-term debt is rated by IBCA, the UK-based agency.) However, CSFB stood firm, buying back some loose paper through brokers, and managed to maintain confidence in the transaction. By the end of trading, the deal was bid at 99.75, slightly above the fixed price reoffer level, and the spread had tightened from 80 basis points above the five-year US Treasury at launch to 78 basis points. Signs that the deal is set to tighten further, against a steady gilts market, could well bring in further demand in the next few days to mop up any remaining paper. In the longer term, the existence of such a large corporate benchmark is a positive step for the sterling bond market. Alongside last year's Pounds 350m 10-year deal for British Gas, the growing availability of liquid corporate paper is likely to broaden the market's appeal. The return of continental European investors, whose worries about currency weakness have been allayed by the rally in sterling following the election victory of the ruling Conservative party, helped boost distribution of the paper. The deal was unswapped, as Hanson took advantage of the lower rates available in the sterling bond market following the post-election rally in the gilts market. Other UK companies continue to eye the sector, but may decide to await a further interest rate cut before tapping the market. Hanson will use the proceeds of the issue to refinance bank debt, so lengthening the maturity of its debt profile. Hanson currently has up to Pounds 8bn of bank debt, according to a company official. Another aim is 'to widen the type of security available to investors in the international markets', said Mr Derek Bonham, Hanson's chief executive. Attractive swap opportunities in the Canadian dollar market prompted two more offerings totalling CDollars 500m, despite generally thin demand. The swap activity generated by these two transactions appeared to weaken interest on the paying side of the market, reducing further opportunities. A CDollars 300m 10-year deal for Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, the German agency, met firm demand, particularly in the Far East. The attractive pricing of the deal, at a spread of 45 basis points over the comparable government bond yield, prompted steady buying, even though paper from previous deals remains unsold. A CDollars 200m five-year deal for the Osterreichische Kontrollbank, guaranteed by the Republic of Austria, was priced at a spread of 32 basis above the comparable government bond yield. In the dollar sector, a Dollars 200m 10-year deal for the government-guaranteed Japan Finance Corporation for Municipal Enterprises, known as JFM, was well received. The deal was priced to yield 30 basis points above the 10-year Treasury, and was swiftly sold out to investors in Europe and the Far East. The deal was bid around its fixed reoffer level of 99.95. Unibanco, the privately-owned Brazilian Bank, tapped the dollar sector for the second time in two months, raising a further Dollars 100m. The three-year deal was prompted by excess demand for Unibanco's previous two-year deal, according to arranger Citicorp.</p>

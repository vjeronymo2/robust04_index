			<p>BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 19 Apr (AFP) -- Armando Calderon Sol,  the right-wing presidential candidate for the ruling Nationalist  Republican Alliance, could garner as much as 70 percent of the  votes cast in next Sunday's runoff election in which he will vie  for the presidency against Ruben Zamora, who was nominated by a  leftist coalition, an Argentine polling firm announced on 19  April.    According to Mora y Araujo Noguera y Asociados, this figure  is based on voter surveys conducted since August 1993. Some  1,200 people were surveyed in each poll with a margin of error  of 3 percent.    The latest poll shows 52 percent of those polled expect to  vote for Calderon Sol and 22 percent for Zamora. Over the past  three weeks, support for the government of President Alfredo  Cristiani, which has a positive support rating of 68 percent,  has risen.    In the first round of the elections held on 20 March,  Calderon received 49 percent of the vote, while Zamora garnered  25 percent. Zamora lost a great deal of support from December to  January and has not been able to regain it, the report added.  It also estimated voter participation will drop 10 percent  compared to the first round in which 68 percent of eligible  voters did not go to the polls, and another 6 percent were  unable to vote, even though they tried to.</p>

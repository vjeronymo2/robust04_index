			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Violence in Israel hits peace hopes ISRAELI troops shot dead two Palestinians and wounded more than 70 yesterday, as intensified violence in the occupied territories cast a deeper shadow over the prospects for a resumption of Middle East peace negotiations. The mood in the occupied territories and Israel itself contrasts strongly with the upbeat assessment of the peace process by President Bill Clinton and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, after more than three hours of talks at the White House on Monday. A spokesman for Mr Rabin said he would return three days earlier than expected from the US to address the problem of worsening violence. The clashes yesterday between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli troops at the Khan Younis refugee camp in Gaza were said to be the worst since the outbursts that followed deportation of 415 Palestinians by Israel to southern Lebanon in December. Palestinian negotiators insist they will not resume peace talks until Israel makes a public commitment not to resort to further mass deportations. Hospital officials said that two Palestinian youths, aged 17 and 18, were killed in the Khan Younis refugee camp. Israeli troops opened fire several times on stone-throwing Palestinians who had taken to the streets after the lifting of a curfew on the camp. The latest clashes come against deepening concern in Israel over attacks on Jewish civilians by individual Palestinians.</p>

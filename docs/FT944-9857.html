			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Architectire: The picture at Bankside / A look at short-list contenders for the Tate conversion There is a week to go before the announcement of the short list of architects from which will be chosen the designer for the conversion of Bankside power station, near London's Southwark Bridge, into the Tate Gallery of Modern Art. This is an important international competition - one that will have a profound effect on the style of public museums and galleries in the future. So far the competition has been an extraordinary affair - a mixture of good intentions and inevitable confusion. It was a brave idea to open the competition to architects from around the world. Contemporary architecture is an international activity, as is the building of new museums, but it is unusual for competitions to be so open and all-embracing. When a selection committee opens a competition to all-comers it is usually in the hope that they will be able to spot a new discovery, an untried talent, a genius who will change the contours on the architectural map. This is exactly how the original architect of Bankside power station, Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, was discovered. He achieved sudden and early fame by winning the competition for Liverpool's Anglican cathedral in 1904, when he was only 24. He was to go on to create Battersea power station in 1932, which became the model for so many brick giants all over England. By the time he was consultant architect for Bankside he was close to death, and died in 1960 - just before Bankside opened. The symmetry of Bankside is striking, with its 325ft-high central chimney (the station was designed to burn oil, not coke) and its immaculate brickwork. Inside, the great spaces are a challenge to any architect, and they are clearly going to be expensive to convert and even more expensive to maintain. The competition attracted 148 architects. Applicants for the first stage were examined only on the evidence of a few slides and a brief written submission. Because an open competition is so random, many of these early entrants had little or no museum experience. It has to be remembered that many of the best architects in the world are reluctant to enter such wild competitions. The finest architect in Britain, Sir Norman Foster, for example, is not even being considered for Bankside. Many architects - I suspect Sir Norman is among them - will feel as I do that it is sad that the first major building in Britain devoted to the art of the 20th and 21st centuries should be a conversion of a large, but not that distinguished, redundant industrial building. The 13 architects on the long short list have presented a mixture of predictable and imaginative schemes. Michael Hopkins' ideas look the most straight-forward, while the work of the firm of Future Systems has been marvellously presented and has immense character. Nicholas Grimshaw, the architect of the nearby Channel Tunnel terminal at Waterloo, has brought the railway aesthetic into the world of the art gallery. The two Japanese firms both deserve to be on the list. Arata Isosaki and Associates have plenty of museum experience, while Tadao Ando, the current favourite to win, has produced some strangely moving and elemental buildings in Japan that are works of art. His Japanese pavilion for the Seville Expo '92 was a model of respect for the essence of traditional building. The assessors, chaired by Sir Simon Hornby, are a diverse group. They include the broadcaster Joan Bakewell as well as two architects who are poles apart in their stylistic sympathies: Sir Philip Powell, a good if almost old-fashioned modernist from the firm of Powell and Moya, and Hans Hollein from Vienna, who is a glitzy post-modernist and designer of the museum at Monchengladbach in Germany. Whatever the outcome of this competition, it is important to remember that it is a major architectural and cultural event. The removal of the 'modern art' from the other great collections at the Tate, further along the Thames, is controversial in itself. How successfully this is done depends greatly on the right choice of architect for the new galleries.</p>

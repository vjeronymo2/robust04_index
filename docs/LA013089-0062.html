			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPLAINTS PROMPT COLGATE TO CHANGE NAME OF TOOTHPASTE  </P> <P> Darkie toothpaste is being renamed and redesigned to remove its logo of a  grinning black minstrel after several groups complained to Colgate-Palmolive  Co. that the product was offensive, the company said.  </P> <P> The toothpaste is manufactured and sold in Asia by the Hong Kong-based Hawley  &amp; Hazel Group. Colgate-Palmolive, which sells household and hygiene  products worldwide, became a joint partner with Hawley &amp; Hazel in 1985.  </P> <P> Since then, some members of Congress and the Interfaith Center on Corporate  Responsibility, a coalition of church investors, have been putting pressure on  the companies to change what they said is racially offensive packaging.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Acceptable to Coalition  </P> <P> The popular product, which has remained unchanged for 62 years, will be renamed  Darlie in all of its markets -- Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and  Thailand -- within a year, Colgate-Palmolive said Friday.  </P> <P> The company said the logo will be changed to a "to a non-racially offensive  silhouette" -- a racially ambiguous man in a top hat.  </P> <P> "The management of Hawley &amp; Hazel and Colgate-Palmolive have agreed that  the old name and package presentation represents offensive racial stereotyping  that should be changed," Colgate-Palmolive said in a statement.  </P> <P> "We think it's acceptable," said Dara Demmings, a spokesman for the Interfaith  Coalition, which seeks to influence social and financial issues within  corporations through stock ownership.  </P> <P> In addition to pressure from the coalition, three Interfaith members who each  owned at least $1,000 worth of Colgate stock registered objections at a  shareholders meeting in May.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Decision Praised  </P> <P> The shareholders included the Illinois-based School Sisters of St. Francis;  Southern Province of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate in San Antonio,  and a nun who owns shares for the Sisters of Loretta, based in Kentucky.  </P> <P> Similar pressure from outside groups led Quaker Oats Co. to modify its Aunt  Jemima figure in the 1960s to make her look less like a plantation cook.  Likewise, complaints led Sambo's restaurant chain to change its name to No  Place Like Sam's in the 1970s.  </P> <P> Demmings said she believed Colgate-Palmolive officials were hampered by  objections from Hawley &amp; Hazel, who told a group of congressmen as late as  last month that it had no plans to change the product's name.  </P> <P> "It's unfortunate that it took so long," said New York Rep. Edolphus Towns, a  member of the congressional Government Operations Committee, who voiced  objections to the product during a visit to Taiwan in December.  </P> <P> Towns praised Colgate-Palmolive for making "a diligent effort since day one of  their relationship (with Hawley) to correct this insensitive name and  logotype."  </P> <P> Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, another committee member, praised the  company "for its understanding, albeit late," and urged other companies to "act  accordingly."  </P></p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Least bad option: There is no end in sight to the turmoil in western policy on Bosnia You may be perplexed by western policy on the war in Bosnia, and no wonder. Fortunately, I can describe it in one word: turmoil. I have it on impeccable authority in Whitehall: 'We are all in turmoil.' They are in turmoil because the Geneva peace negotiations have collapsed, which seems to imply a fight to the finish by the warring parties and a death blow to the peace process offered by the west. And if the peace process really is dead, the west will have to make a fundamental re-appraisal of policy. That is why there is turmoil: governments are casting around for something else to do, and so far they have found nothing. There are at least three symptoms of disarray. First, there is the stress affecting UN forces on the ground: one Belgian general has withdrawn exhausted and one French general has been sacked for criticising the UN leadership. Partly as a result, we have heard sporadic noises in London and Paris, mainly from the defence ministries, that the two governments may decide to bring their troops home. Why expose their soldiers to the dangers of 'peacekeeping' if the three communities in Bosnia refuse to make peace? Third, and quite contradictorily, the French government is calling for a more forceful western strategy to impose peace on the ground, which would include US military involvement. The US has immediately stamped on the idea: it will not get involved in the war in Bosnia. The French say they will soon put forward a new Bosnia plan anyway. It is hard to imagine what the French can come up with. But neither Britain nor France is likely to withdraw its troops unilaterally. A top French official tells me: 'There is simply no question of just pulling out French troops like that.' A unilateral withdrawal of British troops looks equally unlikely; if there is a change in UK policy, it will be co-ordinated with other western countries. In fact, western governments, starting with Britain and France, may yet conclude that their least bad option is to stick with their present Bosnia policy. It is deeply unsatisfactory from many points of view: peacekeeping is not bringing peace; the humanitarian aid operation is being largely frustrated; and the magic circle comprising the UN, the United Nations Protection Force (Unprofor) and Nato is riddled with double-speak and ambivalence. But the present policy is what western governments were left with after they found all the other options looked worse. When Whitehall completes its current review, it may come to the same conclusion as before: the fact that the war situation has got worse does not mean that new and better peace options have suddenly become available. One argument which may slow down the impetus for the withdrawal of troops is that it could precipitate other actions which could be more dangerous than anything we now face. At one time, for example, the Americans advocated an actively pro-Moslem policy, on the grounds that the Moslems were the victims in an unequal war and deserved a helping hand. They encapsulated their proposal in the catchy little slogan 'lift-and-strike': lift the arms embargo on the Moslems and bomb the Serbs. The US proposal was resisted by Britain and France, partly on the grounds that air strikes would be totally incompatible with UN peacekeeping and humanitarian aid, and would force them to withdraw their troops. But if Britain and France were to withdraw their troops quite independently, then that part of the argument against 'lift-and-strike' would disappear. In fact, there are other, stronger arguments against 'lift-and-strike' - tactical, strategic and political. It is easy to empathise with moral indignation at the barbarity of the Serbs' war of conquest and genocide. But indignation provides no confidence that a partial, indirect, arm's-length intervention by the west on behalf of the Moslems would make us feel better, let alone produce a more satisfactory result on the ground. Let us suppose that such an indirect intervention were to help the Moslem side in the war. Do we think we could nicely calculate, in advance or afterwards, just how much help they should have, or prescribe just how much land they should recapture in the name of justice? Or do we just want a fairer war? This new policy could not be expressed in a UN resolution, as the Russians would veto it. So would it merely be executed by a posse of enthusiastic governments, regardless of the protests of other states? The only certain result of the west helping to arm the Moslems is that Russia and other Slav states would step up their help to the Serbs. The war in Bosnia would then become a much bigger war; and not merely would we have no guarantee that the Moslems would come off better, we would find ourselves embroiled in an open proxy war against the Russians. According to the conventional wisdom, ethnic war on the Yugoslav pattern is likely to be the main threat to peace and stability in Europe in the years ahead. The conventional wisdom is surely wrong. If there were to be a serious threat to western Europe, it would most likely come from Russian attempts to recapture their former empire in eastern Europe; Russian nationalists are already talking threateningly about the Baltic countries. The west has refused to intervene directly in Yugoslavia in terms that might conceivably have curbed the war. It could now respond to the breakdown in Geneva simply by withdrawing all UN troops. That would be brutal and heartless, but rational. But if we were now deliberately to pursue a policy designed to maximise the scale of the war as well as the risks of open conflict with Russia, without any compensating advantage, we should be guilty of harebrained folly.</p>

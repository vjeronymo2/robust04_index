			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Defense Minister General Vitaliy Radetskyy has  issued an open letter appeal to the personnel of the Armed  Forces, families of servicemen, and the Ukrainian people. The  defense minister has been forced to do this by the moral and  psychological situation in and around our Armed Forces.    Time has not yet managed to cure our units and subunits of  the old defects of the Soviet Army, reads the appeal. Today, we  can observe how new viruses are creeping through barrack windows  and checkpoints in military towns to deprave the military  organism. In the opinion of the defense minister, there is  only one way to cure this disease: We will overcome this  disease only if order is restored and the Army is cemented by  strict military discipline.    Appealing to parents whose sons are already serving in the  Army or still studying in school, to soldiers and their  commanders, to pedagogues, to wives of commanders and chiefs,  and to famous patriots and honorable citizens of our country,  Vitaliy Radetskyy says: Only together, as were our forefathers,  can we achieve the desired goal. The time has come to turn our  faces toward the barracks and the Army, reads the appeal issued  by the defense minister, because it is no longer imperial, but  our own Army with the Lvov dignity, Poltava diligence, Odessa  humor, and Chernihiv joyfulness.    Ukrainian Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy believes and  expects  that the appeal will be understood by every conscious Ukrainian  citizen, and that an agreement on looking for common ways of  overcoming the complex situation in the Army will be found.</p>

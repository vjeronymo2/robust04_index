			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Riva falls Pounds 425,000 into the red SHARES OF Riva Group, the USM-traded supplier of electronic point of sale systems, yesterday fell 6p to 27p on news of a swing from pre-tax profits of Pounds 314,000 to losses of Pounds 425,000 for the half year to June 30. Turnover fell from Pounds 28.6m to Pounds 26.4m and operating profits from Pounds 972,000 to Pounds 164,000. Exceptional provision rose to Pounds 252,000 (Pounds 174,000). Trading conditions remained difficult and operations in Europe were severely affected by recession. In January and February trading was poor and led to changes in European operations. Staffing levels in France were substantially reduced, the unprofitable business in Germany was in the process of being sold and at the Spanish subsidiary, which incurred a deficit of Pounds 377,000 during the half year, urgent measures were being pursued to improve performance. However, group trading from March to June had shown an improvement which, combined with further reductions in overheads, had brought a return to profitability on a month by month basis. The directors anticipated some improvement in the second half but warned that the final outcome was dependent on the extent of the cost of remedial actions required in Spain. Basic losses per share were 1.9p (earnings of 1p). A Pounds 21,000 dividend on the cumulative convertible preference shares is being passed.</p>

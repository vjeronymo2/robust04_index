			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press statement by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl given in </F> Brussels on 11 January on the results of the NATO summit held on  10-11 January--recorded]    [Text] [Passage indistinct] Regarding the individual  results I should like to highlight the following:    Firstly, the extremely open and amicable atmosphere of the  talks was most remarkable. The basis of the alliance is and  remains the firm security link between North America and Europe.  President Clinton expressly reaffirmed the further concrete  presence of U.S. soldiers in Europe, and this was highlighted as  being particularly important by all participants at the talks.  At the same time, the alliance supports without reservation the  emergence of a European identity in terms of security and  defense, as stipulated in the Maastricht Treaty.    The Western European Union will, in future, be able to rely  on NATO resources for independent operations, and these  decisions were taken in full agreement with our American  partners. The central questions were the restructuring of our  relations with the countries of Central, East and southeastern  Europe, as well as the successor states of the Soviet Union.  During the dramatic years of transition in these countries the  people have looked to the West for support. We have repeatedly  encouraged the reform states to introduce democracy and the  market economy. That means in consequence that we have to do  everything we can to support these processes. In addition, we  cannot allow these people to feel that they have to live in a  gray zone in terms of security. We Germans, appreciate  particularly keenly the worries of our neighboring countries.  For this reason we want to deepen political and military  cooperation with these countries in order to build a new  relationship which results in a Partnership for Peace.    At the same time, this conference in Brussels has sent a  clear signal that NATO is open to new members in future. The  Partnership for Peace, based on practical and concrete measures,  goes well beyond mere dialogue. For example, there will be  joint exercises, perhaps as early as this year, as well as joint  training for participation in international peace missions.    A decisive element of the partnership program is the offer  to  engage in consultations with partners if they fear a direct  threat to their territorial integrity, political independence,  or security. For the German Government, invitations and programs  connected with the Partnership for Peace are not diplomatic  cliches but a very seriously step, a dynamic process on the way  to later NATO membership. We are of course aware that, in the  present situation, it is not possible to name a concrete date.    We also do not want to and must not open up any new rifts in  Europe. The security and stability of our continent is  indivisible. This means that we want to build a close  partnership, above all with Russia and Ukraine, in order to  create jointly a security system for the whole of Europe. In  order to create a peaceful future for Europe, it is vitally  important that existing borders are not violated and the rights  of minorities are protected. Therefore, the summit has welcomed  unanimously the initiative of the European Union for a stability  pact in Europe as an important ingredient in promoting security  and stability.    Yesterday we discussed very intensively the situation in  Russia, and not just prior to President Clinton's visit here.  The performance of extremist forces at the recent elections is a  serious warning signal, not only for the Russian leadership, but  for all of us. We agreed that, notwithstanding the justified  concern about this development, we must not allow ourselves to  be deflected from continuing to support the reform policies in  Russia and also President Yeltsin's reform policies.    During our talks we gave a lot of attention to the war in  former Yugoslavia. A great tragedy is unwinding before our very  eyes in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The summit has again called on the  warring parties to put an end to violence and to solve the  problems at the negotiating table. This also includes the  efforts made over the past few days in Bonn that unfortunately  did not lead to the hoped-for breakthrough between Croatia and  Bosnia. My colleague Klaus Kinkel will tell you about this when  I have finished.    NATO unanimously supports the peace efforts of the United  Nations and the European Union. This includes the determination  of NATO to enforce the UN mandate through air strikes if  necessary. At the suggestion of our colleagues from Great  Britain, France, and Canada, following the talks yesterday  evening, the following urgent requests to the United Nations  have been incorporated in the summit communique: Firstly, the  urgent work and plans required to secure the replacement of the  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] contingent in Srebrenica provided  by Canada to date, and secondly, to examine how Tuzla airport  can be opened for humanitarian relief operations.    Furthermore, I would like to point out that with regard to  other subjects, NATO has reaffirmed its readiness to support the  international peace missions of the United Nations and the CSCE.  A new element here is the offer to European non-NATO members to  take part in such missions; I will cite Sweden and Finland here.  Secondly, NATO intends to adapt and change its leadership  structures so that it can greatly improve its expanded  cooperation with the Western European Union and its support for  international missions. Thirdly, NATO is increasing its  political and defense efforts against the proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction.    I would like to stress, in particular, that this two-day  meeting in Brussels has shown me how much NATO as a whole and  the European Union complement each other in their efforts to  help safeguard peace and freedom and bring about security and  stability in Europe. Over to my colleague, Herr Kinkel.</p>

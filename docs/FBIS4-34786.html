			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari  reiterated that Mexican Petroleum [PEMEX] will remain state  owned and that it will continue its active modernization to  transform its structures, raise its efficiency, and establish a  more transparent price policy.    He added that so far during his administration, the  state-owned company has reduced its operational costs 30 percent  and that now, its products represent almost half of its sales.  [sentence as published]    When President Salinas de Gortari delivered the National  Institute Prize for Public Administration to Benjamin Garcia  Paez, he said: "The strategic state-owned company is preparing  for Mexico to face 21st century world challenges. The change  has resulted in a strengthening of Mexico's presence in the  world economy."    He stressed that the company plans to reach greater  operational efficiency while simultaneously generating clear  social benefits. The efficient performance of the company  translates into a strategic push for the nation's economy.    Salinas said: "PEMEX will continue being the property of the  Mexican people because it is efficient and meets it social  goals." In this way, he added, equal development is guaranteed,  social consensus is created, and efforts are joined to  strengthen the nation.</p>

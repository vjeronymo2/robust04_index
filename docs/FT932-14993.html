			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Berlin stores attacked by arsonists ARSONISTS set fire to two Berlin department stores overnight yesterday but caused little damage and no injuries, according to the police, Reuter reports. A police spokesman could not say whether the fires, started by incendiary devices hidden in the stories and set off by timers, were related to protests against Berlin's campaign to hold the Olympic Games in 2000. Several banks supporting the Olympic campaign have been damaged by protesters this year, and the Hertie department store chain, owner of the two stores affected on Tuesday night, has also come out for holding the games in Berlin.</p>

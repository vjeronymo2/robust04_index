			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of Kuwait (11): Post-war battle for market share - Telecommunications KUWAIT'S Ministry of Telecommunications faces a dilemma: should it repair and update the country's wrecked telecoms network or should it throw the lot out and start from scratch. The former would be cheaper and it might be all the network needs. The latter might be a better long-term bet, particularly as the government gears up to privatisation in the next few years. A choice between the two is essentially what is on offer from the two main protagonists in the post-war battle for market share, Ericsson of Sweden, and AT&amp;T of the US. The government could take a mix of suppliers, although dealing with three or four separate operators and systems would require different spare parts and technical expertise. Damage to the country's telecoms network was immense. It is likely to cost the government about Dollars 400m to repair and modernise the network. The work will take two to three years to complete. Temporary work on the system has restored domestic and international phone links, but the network is only 'limping along', as one telecoms company puts it. AT&amp;T moved swiftly into the breach to patch up the system in the early days after the war. Now it is hoping to build its market share at the expense of Ericsson, which had just over 90 per cent of the pre-war market. It is likely that AT&amp;T is looking to supply about a third to a half of the post-war market. A third big operator, Alcatel, of France, is also a likely contender for a large chunk of the market. AT&amp;T has enjoyed only a short relationship with the Telecoms Ministry but it has built a lot of good will in that time. It provided a new exchange and international lines via a US satellite within weeks of the war ending, enabling the first post-war international phone calls. Ericsson, on the other hand, has a relationship going back several decades and the ministry says it has been more than happy with the service. The company also carried out immediate repairs to exchanges immediately after the war and its engineers are training Kuwaiti technicians to continue maintenance of the network. The Swedish company says that its old electro-mechanical equipment will have to be fully replaced, but that its second-generation AXE advanced exchanges, many of which were built in the late 1970s and early 1980s, can be fully updated. 'There is no point in the Kuwaiti government spending too much money on what they don't need,' says Mr Rolf Hedenstrom, Ericsson's technical manager in Kuwait. AT&amp;T says more radical surgery is necessary and wants to modernise the whole network virtually from scratch, with AT&amp;T equipment. Mr Abdul Aziz Al-Ayoub, under-secretary at the Telecoms Ministry, says that both companies have as good a chance as any when the big contracts come up for tender. Some of the contracts to replace or repair 11 of the country's 28 exchanges have been awarded, but a large part of the government's investment over the next few years has still to be awarded. The impetus for modernisation has been driven not only by war damage, but also by the government's plans for privatisation. It wants to modernise the network over the next two years before it floats the new company. This includes conversion to a fully - digitalised system - about half the network still operates on the old analogue technology. Among the contracts awarded so far: GPT of the UK has supplied its System X system in a deal worth about Dollars 6m to replace of one of four transit tandem stations at South Sabahiya. This connects the south with the rest of the country. GPT is also supplying an initial 200 pay phones for nearly Dollars 1m. Alcatel of France has won a Dollars 8.57m contract to supply equipment to four switching stations. It is also supplying Dollars 4.2m in fibre optics and a Dollars 4.06m microwave system to link the switching centres. Sprint, of the US, is supplying value added networks, including electronic mail and conferencing. TCIL, the Indian telecoms consultancy, is to repair and replace Dollars 6m worth of telephones and cables. Ericsson and AT&amp;T have both swept up various contracts in addition to immediate repairs and maintenance. Ericsson is going ahead with a pre-war contract to provide a mobile phones system of up to 30,000 lines. AT&amp;T has also squeezed into the private market. The company says it is now supplying 80 per cent of the country's post-war PABX private exchanges to Kuwaiti hotels and businesses. The deals so far are small beer against the investment to come and Kuwait's rival suitors may be just warming up for a long and difficult courtship.</p>

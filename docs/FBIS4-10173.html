			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by National Assembly President Luis </F> Humberto Guzman with unidentified reporters; place not given;  from the "Five O'Clock Sharp" newscast; broadcast in progress --  recorded]    [Text] [Reporter] ...Humberto Guzman, General Ortega  emphatically stated he will not step down under the current  circumstances. What happened? Did he negotiate with you? What  did you talk about?    [Guzman] I do not know if he emphatically stated he will not  step down. He said he is perfectly aware of the temporary  nature of his mandate; he knows it is for a fixed period of  time. It seems to me he is aware of the temporary nature of  that mandate.    [Reporter] Do you agree with the military organization law  being debated in the National Assembly?    [Guzman] It is obvious that movements and deployments by the  Armed Forces should be in accordance with the law.    [Reporter] Ortega said an agreement could be reached within  15 days and that there are problems with the executive branch at  present. What can you say about this?    [Guzman] He told me there are various criteria regarding the  military organization law, but it seems to me that these  differences do not pertain precisely to the nature of his  mandate.    [Reporter] If the military organization law is not  presented, if a consensus is not reached between the executive  branch and Armed Forces, will the National Assembly present its  own draft bill?    [Guzman] According to the Constitu?ion, the National  Assembly is the country's legislative branch, and it must do its  duty.    [Reporter] Will it?    [Guzman] Of course.    [Reporter] Are any draft bills ready?    [Guzman) Yes, there are a few draft bills pertaining to  military organization. I would like to say, however, that the  National Assembly is not trying to create unproductive and  useless crises in the country. We are not setting a deadline  for the government to submit its draft bill. I must say,  however, that we cannot wait indefinitely. We have promised the  country that we would pass a military organization law during  the first half of 1994, and the National Assembly will keep its  word.    [Reporter] Doctor, you stated emphatically that Gen. Ortega  should step down before the year ends, as President Chamorro  said. Do you still hold that opinion?    [Guzman] I maintain that public posts should be temporary.  That includes the post of Armed Forces chief.    [Reporter] The general spoke of a 15-day deadline. Has the  National Assembly reached an agreement with the general  regarding that 15-day deadline?    [Guzman] He told me he expects and hopes that within the  next 15 days he and the cabinet will reach an agreement  concerning a draft bill for the military organization law.    [Reporter] The general said the Assembly cannot prepare a  draft bill without reaching a consensus with the military.    [Guzman] The National Assembly obviously consults with the  people who are affected the most by any given law, just as it  invites bankers to discuss the general banking law or to discuss  the advantages or disadvantages of certain laws. Obviously it  must do the same with the Armed Forces on the military law.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] working on certain topics,  according to Gen. Ortega.    [Guzman] That was the gist of the conversation. He told me  there were difficulties with certain issues on which agreements  had not been reached but that, in his opinion, this debate  should not extend beyond the next two weeks.    [Reporter] He spoke of (?vital) topics. (?What are those  vital topics) [words indistinct] after eight hours of talks.    [Guzman] They involve the Armed Forces' general functions,  but I would like to say that I do not believe the deadline on  the issue of Gen. Ortega's remaining in the Army were among the  issues discussed.</p>

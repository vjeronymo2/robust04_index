Rees] </F>   [Text] Bethlehem March 20 SAPA -- A Pan Africanist Congress  [PAC] government would expropriate all land without  compensation, PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] President Clarence  Makwetu told about 1,000 supporters in Bethlehem's Bohlokong  township on Sunday [20 March]. Speaking at the end of a  three-day election swing through the [Orange] Free State, he  said the land would be restored to the people or held in trust  by the state."All people have equal claim to the land," he said.    Mr Makwetu told the crowd fears that the PAC's land policy  spelt economic disaster were unfounded. While no land would be  for sale between individuals, land allocated to citizens would,  for surety purposes, carry leasehold title with the same force  and effect as freehold titles.    The PAC president said farmers could continue farming, but  only on land sufficient for their purposes. The rest would be  claimed by the state and allocated to other citizens.    A vote for any party except the PAC was a vote for disaster  as other parties promised houses but not land, Mr Makwetu  said."A vote for them is a vote for a constitution which will  never give you freedom or justice, and will perpetuate your  enslavement and misery while entrenching the privileges the  minority continue to enjoy at your expense."    Mr Makwetu said the PAC promised an end to violence and  repression and would deal efffectively with poverty and the lack  of houses and jobs.    Recent events in Bophuthatswana should be a lesson for those  still refusing to allow free political activity in any part of  South Africa, Mr Makwetu said. "It is that there is no amount of  force which will ever silence the will of the people to be free."</p>

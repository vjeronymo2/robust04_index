			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has determined that the revisions to Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program resulting from Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 are consistent with the requirements of the Clean Water Act and its implementing regulations. Consequently, MDNR is authorized to administer Michigan's Section 404 wetland program. The question of whether MDNR remained the same agency or whether it became ``any other State agency'' as a result of Executive Order 1991&hyph;31, and therefore whether it was authorized to administer Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program, is not at issue here. Nevertheless, due to the significant number of comments on this issue, EPA believes it is appropriate to address this question here.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA recognizes that the Michigan Supreme Court has made clear that Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 created a ``new'' MDNR.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Dodak <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Engler <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 443 Mich. 560 (1993). However, the Michigan Attorney General, in a letter dated November 8, 1993, has stated that the Executive Order did not create a new agency. In either event, the question of whether MDNR is a ``new'' agency under state law is not controlling with respect to whether there has been a transfer of authority from an ``approved Agency to any other State agency.'' Instead, it is EPA's regulations which are controlling on this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's regulations at 40 CFR 233.16(c) do not provide clear guidance on whether the reorganization and consolidation of environmental programs accomplished by Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 constitutes a ``transfer'' of authority requiring prior EPA approval. The preamble to the 1988 state wetland program regulations similarly fails to provide any such guidance. See 53 FR 20764 (June 6, 1988). However, the 1980 preamble to the final National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (``NPDES'') state program rule, in addressing language at 40 CFR 123.62(c) which is similar to that at 40 CFR 233.16(c), stated: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> It was not the intent of the proposal nor is it of these final regulations to require EPA review in such cases [``nominal changes'' in state agencies]. Only when controlling Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or supplemented, or when the State proposes to transfer all or part of a program from an approved State agency to another State agency may EPA approval be necessary. Changes solely to the internal structure of an approved State agency, with no changes in the overall authority of the agency, do not require EPA approval. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 45 FR 33290, 33384 (May 19, 1980).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with the above preamble language, EPA interprets the language of 40 CFR 233.16(c) as not applying to a mere restructuring or internal consolidation of environmental programs within a state's executive branch. Instead, the prior EPA approval requirement in 40 CFR 233.16(c) applies in situations where such restructuring or consolidation impacts the controlling authorities by which a state implements the Section 404 wetland program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described above, MDNR has been the approved State agency for implementation of Michigan's Section 404 wetland program both before and after the Executive Order. MDNR's authority and responsibilities under State law pertaining to wetland matters were not affected by Executive Order 1991&hyph;31. Consequently, there have been no changes of any significance to the function or structure of the portions of MDNR that has been approved to implement Michigan's Section 404 wetland program. Therefore, EPA does not agree with the commenters that Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 constituted a transfer of authority from an ``approved Agency to any other State agency.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, a number of commenters requested that EPA provide a public hearing on this matter. Pursuant to 40 CFR 233.16(d)(3), EPA is required to provide an opportunity for a public hearing whenever a proposed revision is substantial. 40 CFR 233.16(d)(3) provides that ``substantial revisions include, but are not limited to, revisions that affect the area of jurisdiction, scope of activities regulated, criteria for review of permits, public participation, or enforcement capability.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has determined that Executive Order 1991&hyph;31, in reorganizing MDNR and transferring responsibilities for assuring interstate, intrastate and federal-state coordination on wetland matters from MWRC to MDNR, has not affected a substantial change in Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program. EPA notes that these changes have not affected any of the items listed in 40 CFR 233.16(d)(3). Moreover, EPA has found that the comments sufficiently addressed any issues relevant to the effects of Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 and therefore has determined that a public hearing would not be useful to aid in this review. EPA, therefore, is not providing an opportunity for a public hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. EPA's Final Determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA, after review and consideration of all the information submitted by Michigan and the comments received, has determined that the revisions to Michigan's wetland program effected by Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 comply with the Clean Water Act and its implementing regulations. Moreover, EPA has determined that the revisions were not substantial. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 3, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Valdas V.

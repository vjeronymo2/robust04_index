			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Yeltsin presses Congress for wider powers RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin closed the Congress of People's Deputies yesterday with a frontal attack on the majority of deputies who had threatened to sink his reform programme, and who have deprived him of a constitution guaranteeing a strong presidency. Warning of a 'constitutional crisis' in the country, Mr Yeltsin, in a powerful and aggressive closing speech to the country's supreme law-making body, said that 'the time of puppet governments is passed'. Although the reform process was salvaged through a messy compromise, drafts of a new constitution - including one which would have given Mr Yeltsin sweeping powers to appoint governments - were not discussed. Earlier yesterday, in an effort to compensate for the lack of a new constitution, he had presented a draft bill to the parliament calling for powers to appoint and dismiss the prime minister, who would then appoint other ministers. According to the draft, he could overrule demands to sack the prime minister by keeping him in power for a year, or by replacing him himself. 'If the Under a formula agreed last week, Mr Yeltsin had to bring forward a bill on the reorganisation of the government within three months, and to appoint a new prime minister to a cabinet which he himself currently heads - although the present government would keep office until December. However, the draft bill was not discussed yesterday, and now passes to the smaller parliament where it is bound to be a divisive issue. He told the deputies that they had achieved little in more than two weeks of often acrimonious debates, citing their refusal to tackle the critical state of agriculture and to pass a law allowing private ownership of land. He hinted that he had been ready to go to the people with a referendum to give him the powers he sought if the Congress had not backed down on the issue of economic reform. Implying that the former Communists in the Congress had mounted a concerted attack on his government, he said that 'the nomenklatura reaction did not go through at this congress' - adding that the calls from many deputies to restore the Soviet Union were 'demands for the creation of the parallel structures of a second power'. In a final kick against Mr Yeltsin, the Congress refused even to discuss another bill tabled by him on Monday demanding that he be given the right to appoint the central bank chairman - presently responsible to the parliament. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliament speaker, said such a proposal would never succeed while he was in the chair. Nuclear arms confusion, Page 3 From catastrophe to mere crisis, Page 18</p>

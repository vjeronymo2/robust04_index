			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Wheeler-dealers with bottomless wallets - Pharmaceuticals / Nearly Dollars 25bn has been spent this year within the industry - but why? What on earth are drugs companies doing? On Monday, Switzerland's Ciba raised its stake in Chiron, a US biotechnology company, from 4 per cent to 49.9 per cent, valuing the 13-year old California business at Pounds 2.7bn. On Wednesday, the UK's SmithKline Beecham sold its animal health business for Dollars 1.45bn to Pfizer, a US drugs giant. These deals were just the latest in a series in which almost Dollars 25bn has been spent in pharmaceuticals this year. But there appear to be few common threads other than the vast sums involved. Take SmithKline Beecham. Like Ciba, it has small stakes in biotechnology companies. But, in May, it spent Dollars 2.3bn buying a US drugs distributor and another Dollars 2.9bn in July on a company specialising in over-the-counter branded medicines. The seller in the second deal was Eastman Kodak, which sold the rest of its drugs business - prescription products - to Elf Sanofi of France for Dollars 1.7bn. Meanwhile, Switzerland's Roche, which already has more than 60 per cent of one of the biggest biotech companies, Genentech, paid Dollars 5.3bn for a conventional US drugs company, Syntex. Another drugs company, American Cyanamid, went to rival American Home Products for almost Dollars 10bn, while US drugs-maker Eli Lilly picked on a distributor and paid Dollars 4bn. Such furious deal-making is exceptional in any industry but doubly so for pharmaceuticals: during the 1980s, there were a a mere handful of large mergers and virtually no acquisitions. In those days, though, drugs company executives were happy with their lot and confident of the future. In the US, especially, new products were launched at premium prices. Patients demanded the best, doctors prescribed the new products - and billed the insurance company. Not surprisingly, the profits of drugs companies increased every year. No more. In the 1990s, those who pick up the bill are learning how to drive a bargain. Outside the US, this means government legislation to cut prices: earlier this year, Japan forced through a 6 per cent cut, while Italy reduced the number of drugs available on its national health service. In the US, the payers are mostly employers who offer health insurance to their staff. A decade ago, they began to use companies called health management organisations (HMOs) to buy medical services and drugs cost-effectively. Today, one-fifth of those holding health insurance policies in the US are in 'managed care'. Their doctors are under pressure to prescribe drugs from an approved list of products which the HMO has obtained at cut prices. The effect has been salutary. 'Drugs company chiefs recognise that profits are going to be harder to come by,' says Jacqueline Cantle, pharmaceuticals analyst at stockbroker Smith New Court. 'One solution is to get bigger - hence the deal-making.' Yet, as any corporate raider will tell you, finding good buys is difficult. Each of the acquisitions this year appears to have flaws. The distributors are tiny businesses in highly competitive markets. Syntex and American Cyanamid are companies which have seen better days. The biotechnology sector is having one of the worst years in its short history. The average price of the 250-odd quoted US biotechnology companies has fallen by almost 30 per cent. In the UK, three companies were among the worst performers of the 130-plus stock market flotations of the past year. Only SmithKline Beecham has so far put its deal-mania into a wider setting. It says it is now a human health-care provider. It does not treat animals and is not confined solely to drugs. That means a halt to the deal-making, said Jan Leschly, its chief executive. He added: 'I can't rule out further acquisitions, but what's next is to make sure that we make the most of our investments through synergy and restructuring.' Still, while one company apparently bows out of the deal-making arena, another steps in. William Steere, Pfizer's chairman and chief executive, indicated that he had only just begun his series of acquisitions. And many other companies - notably Glaxo, Europe's biggest drugs company - have yet to start. The fountain of cash from the drugs sector has not dried up.</p>

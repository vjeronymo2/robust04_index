			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Car chiefs reject plea for price cuts THERE IS no scope for any general reduction in the price of British cars, leading figures in the motor industry told Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, yesterday. They said there was no 'pot of gold' in their pockets and the public was being misled into believing car prices in Britain were unjustifiably high. Mr Heseltine met Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain; Mr William Ebbert, chairman of Vauxhall; Mr Geoffrey Whalen, managing director of Peugeot Talbot; Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive of T&amp;N and president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, and Sir Hal Miller, SMMT chief executive, for 45 minutes. The meeting was held against the background of a recent European Commission report identifying differentials of more than 40 per cent in the prices of some car models across Community markets. Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, has called on carmakers to improve price transparency and reduce differentials. Sir Hal said after yesterday's meeting that he and his colleagues had told Mr Heseltine that no further investigation into prices could be justified. A recent two-year investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission largely cleared the British motor industry of anti-competitive practices. Sir Hal said: 'There is a whole lot of nonsense being talked about car prices, as if there were a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and at the wave of a magic wand prices can come down. The general public has been misled into expecting somehow that car prices will be reduced.' The UK motor industry leaders voiced their concern that the government might unilaterally lift restraints on Japanese car exports to Britain. The SMMT said that 'would run the risk of disturbing the already fragile agreement between the EC and Japan and could encourage other EC member states to block the free circulation within the common market of cars made in Britain by British workers at Britain's Japanese factories'.</p>

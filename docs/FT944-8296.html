			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Arts: Gloria - the sweet and sour porker / Huddersfield Festival Though it may seem an improbable place to anyone who never ventures north of Watford, Huddersfield has boasted Britain's pre-eminent festival of contemporary music for many years now. This year's festival, both wide-ranging and intensive - for as usual it highlights particular composers, by way of supplying focus - is unusually rich, and it has something special to celebrate: a new theatre. Since the old Victorian Theatre Royal was demolished more than 30 years ago, Huddersfield has had none. In the new Lawrence Batley Theatre, constructed within an elegant 1819 building which used to be a huge chapel, the town now has just what it needed, and so does the festival. The interior is trim, airy, acoustically excellent, comfortable to sit in (it holds an audience of about 475 people), and pleasing to behold. For good measure there is a smaller studio theatre, too. The festival is eagerly making plans for at least one contemporary opera per year. The inaugural choice was HK Gruber's Gloria, 'a pigtale' - Gloria von Jaxtberg in the original German, but this porcine comedy-fable has been transferred in Amanda Holden's bright translation to the Pennines. Not, however, the staging, which is a co-production with Opera North and the Big Bang Theatre Munich; it was Helmut Danninger of the latter company who first wanted the opera from Gruber, and he has directed it as for the Bavarian audience who will soon see it at their Volksoper. That, I think, has proved a mixed blessing. The story is sour-sweet and simple. Gloria, the prettiest pig around, is rejected by her jealous sty-family, but dreams of a handsome prince who will find her. Never having learned the meaning of 'sausages', she mistakes the farmhand who comes to lead her to the slaughter for her romantic saviour; there is a nick-of-time rescue. All the roles are taken by five singers, and the curious little band consists of seven players doubling on various wind and percussion instruments, a harpist and a single violin (rather a virtuoso part). The composer draws bracing, racketty, quirky sounds from his orchestra. Superficially there are plain echoes of Kurt Weill, but Gruber's off-centre basses, cunningly irregular rhythms and cross-tonal tricks are very much his own. There is grateful music for the singers, though - in this account, at least - with less lyrical glow than in his splendid concerti. After two hearings, I still think that Danninger's production and Marc Deggeller's designs do the singers no favours, not at any rate for a staging in Britain. Despite the transposition to the Pennines, with suitable local references, the costumes are cod-Bavarian and mostly in shiny black and white plastic. In fact pigs and farmhands alike look to a British eye like German fashion victims (not to put too fine a point on it), poor, pretty Gloria as much as the rest. The gestures and movements visited upon the hard-working actors are of a mock-naive archness that recalls the worst of children's television, as do the sets. Character is barely sketched, because everyone is kept so busy hopping, waving and laboriously shifting extraneous props. One can imagine Gloria in a far crisper, wittier production, and some day we must hope to see one. Mary Hegarty's sweetly vacuous heroine has her moments, and the other Opera North singers work hard. Stefan Asbury conducts an excellent band very efficiently. Among several concerts on Saturday - the Huddersfield programming is always generous - two stood out. The Danish Wind Quintet, wonderfully cultivated players, delivered very early, faded Henze, but also wistful Hans Abrahamsen (their compatriot), three evocative Jonathan Harvey fragments from 1978 and a sort of vaudeville by another Dane, Mogens Winkel Holm. The real discovery was an 'Eichendorff-quintett' by Gruber's colleague Kurt Schwertsik, tiny pieces after single lines by that poet: every one odd, magically expressive and perfectly musical. That evening brought the Cambridge New Music Players, conducted by Paul Hoskins, who confirmed their rapidly growing reputation. Besides early, pungent Maxwell Davies (Antechrist) and recent chips from the workbench of Harrison Birtwistle ('Songs by Myself', all with a sullen gleam), there were several young Cambridge products of varying promise. Far and away the most striking was Living Toys by Thomas Ades, tingling, brilliantly intricate and fascinating - just as Max Loppert reported here several months ago. A lot of people are watching the progress of young Ades's career with avid interest; some others, no doubt, with envy too. Festival continues until 27 November (Festival office 0484-425082); Gloria visits Newcastle, Aldeburgh and Leicester before reaching the Queen Elizabeth Hall on December 8</p>

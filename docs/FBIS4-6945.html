			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Message of His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king of </F> Cambodia, to His Excellency Khieu Samphan, chairman of the Party  of Democratic Kampuchea"; dated 24 April -- read by announcer]    [Text] After receiving your important and detailed letter  concerning especially the issues of your security and a totally  neutral place in Cambodia or in a friendly country, I am honored  to inform you as follows:    1. I have provided Samdech Chea Sim, Samdech Krompreah  Norodom Ranariddh, and Samdech Hun Sen with the choice of the  following two formulas:    In my opinion, the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK]  headed  by yourself could be satisfied with the PDK delegation's  residence in the Royal Palace near the Khemarin hall, which is  presently occupied by His Excellency and Madam Khek Sisoda and  Chinese doctors, who have agreed to move out of the building;    Or you want our roundtable meeting to be held in my  residence  at (Fang Sun-on) near Pyongyang in the DPRK. [as heard]    2. Samdech Chea Sim, Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh,  and Samdech Hun Sen have just given me an unanimous answer that:    a. You will be staying in your office next to the Royal  Palace, but outside the palace's perimeter. The three samdechs  will guarantee 100 percent security for you and your PDK  delegation during your stay in Phnom Penh for the round-table  meeting.    3. The three samdechs object to your moving the roundtable  meeting outside the Kingdom of Cambodia.    As for myself, I am of the opinion that if you disagree with  the three samdechs on any aspect of the above formulas or have a  contradictory request, our roundtable could be held in the  future. Somehow, should you agree with the above formulas  proposed by the three samdechs, our roundtable would take place  as scheduled at the Damnak Chan pavilion in the Royal Palace in  Phnom Penh from 2 to 7 May 1994.    Security guards to ensure security for you from Pochentong  [Airport] to Phnom Penh and vice versa will be provided by the  Kingdom of Cambodia's Royal Government.    Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen,  co-prime ministers of the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC],  will be in charge of guaranteeing the security of you and your  delegation during your stay in Phnom Penh.    Your Excellency, please accept my regards and deepest  fidelity.    [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk    [Dated] Phnom Penh, 24 April 1994.</p>

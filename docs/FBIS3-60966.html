			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by leader of the revolution Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi to </F> the masses of al 'Assah region; date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Now there is another  confrontation, in another era, with different methods. So far,  the battle has not reached the level it had attained with the  Italians, with rifles, bullets, and machine-guns. So far, the  battle continues with the enemy, but with other weapons and  other methods. We want to be very careful this time. We do not  want the enemy to laugh at us. The enemy fears us. It says:  This land has an armed and trained people, prepared for  confrontation. It will bring us other methods. We must be  careful about this. [Crowd chants slogans: "Hang them in the  public square," "O leader, do not show mercy to any traitor"]    Yes, the enemy sometimes takes into consideration the fact  that we are a people prepared to fight, prepared for armed  resistance. Sometimes it avoids military confrontation, but it  enters the battle with us in another way. We must be vigilant  to this. [passage omitted]    We are a trained and armed people and more numerous in  number. Our population is larger now than in the past. We have  industry, agriculture, water, and potential. We can fight and  continue the battle for a longer period. [passage omitted]    We are now in a situation as if we were fighting against  America, so we are not importing American goods. We are doing  without them. We are as if we were fighting against France and  Britain, and we are not importing goods from Paris and London.  Our independence, sovereignty, and honor are above goods.  [passage omitted]    The traitor now is not just afraid of being referred to  public prosecution and the court, he is afraid that his family  and his house may be burned, and the masses may storm him. Who  can prevent the masses, when on a night of anger they stampede  into a farm, a house, two houses, or a whole quarter, and burn  and destroy them? In fact, neither the police nor anyone crying  out over a loudspeaker is going to stop a deluge. However much  you shout, you cannot stop a deluge. The masses are like a  deluge. [crowd chants]    There is no place for treachery now. One cannot say that  those who have betrayed would be subject to the law and the  court. No, there are the masses. All the Libyan tribes are  determined to storm the house and property of a traitor, and to  burn him and his family. The situation has become unbearable.  In fact no one can prevent them. I regret that the situation  should come to this, but those are the masses. [passage omitted]    Al-Ja'akah's [a Libyan national reported to have supplied  evidence concerning the Lockerbie incident to the West] family  were about to be cut to pieces in front of me. The masses said:  Even if you provide guards for any traitorous family, we will  storm the guards. We will regard them as protectors of  treachery.    Confrontation is now in this manner. The Muslim brothers are  treacherous; the Islamic Liberation Party is treacherous;  al-Takfir wal Hijrah [Islamic movement in Egypt] is treacherous;  the Da'wah, the Jihad, the Zandaqah, all these movements have  foreign intelligence behind them. They are involved in  smuggling; they deal in dollars, foreign exchange, consumer  goods; they run after Western goods. All this is treason. If  we were to face up to the enemy we must be at a high level of  awareness, comprehension, and determination. We must know what  weapons are required for the battle.    If hundreds of kilometers separate you from the enemy, I do  not believe that one should get hold of a rifle or a revolver,  aim at the enemy and shoot him, because there is a weapon that  corresponds with a long distance. When you are face to face  with the enemy, sometimes even the rifle is no good, and steel  weapons are used. That is the best weapon in this case. One  should know the right weapon needed for close combat. We must  know the right weapon for the battle now raging between us and  the West so that we may defeat the enemy. If the enemy is  shooting at you with a machine-gun and you have a revolver, then  that is not it. The machine-gun has a range that a revolver  cannot reach. You would not be able to touch the enemy, who  would defeat you.</p>

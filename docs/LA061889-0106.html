			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey's Fianna Fail party failed in its gamble  to win a majority in snap parliamentary elections, but he vowed to form a new  government and remain in power. Official results showed the party fell six  seats short of a majority, winning 77 seats, four fewer than it held before  Thursday's election. The main center-right opposition party, Fine Gael, was  second with 55. Left-wing parties made a strong showing, with the Labor Party  and Workers Party capturing a total of 22 seats.  </P></p>

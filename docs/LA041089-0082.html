			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GANGS FACE OFF IN S. MISSION BEACH PARKING LOT  </P> <P> Members of two gangs faced off with guns in a South Mission Beach parking lot  Saturday night, firing at least a dozen shots before the fight was broken up by  police.  </P> <P> At least two men are believed to have been wounded in the gun battle, police  spokesman Bill Robinson said.  </P> <P> The incident took place about 7 p.m. Saturday in the crowded beach parking lot  at the southern end of Mission Boulevard. More than 100 people were in the lot  when the two groups began arguing and shots rang out, Robinson said.  </P> <P> Two police officers patrolling nearby ran to the scene and called for more  officers, Robinson said. A 9-millimeter pistol and a .357 Magnum were recovered  at the scene, but no arrests were made, Robinson said.  </P> <P> About half an hour after the incident, a man checked into Physicians &amp;  Surgeons Hospital with a gunshot wound to the leg. He said he was an innocent  bystander at the fight, Robinson said.  </P> <P> Later, another man arrived at Sharp Memorial Hospital with gunshot wounds to  the elbow and side. He said he had been shot in an incident in Southeast San  Diego, but police believe he might also have been at the brawl in Mission  Beach, Robinson said.  </P> <P> Neither man was arrested.  </P> <P> Robinson said it was not immediately known why the groups were fighting. The  Police Department's gang detail will continue the investigation today.  </P></p>

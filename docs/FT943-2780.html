			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Referendum promise eases unionist fears: Paisley's deputy welcomes 'step forward' Mr John Major's explicit commit-ment to submitting any decision on the future of Northern Ireland to a referendum in the province appeared last night to have reassured several leading unionists. It was also welcomed by Mr Albert Reynolds, prime minister of the Irish Republic, and Mr Dick Spring, the republic's foreign minister. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, who has been strongly critical of the peace initiative, described the commitment as a 'step forward'. Just over a week ago after a stormy meeting with Mr Major in Downing Street he joined his leader the Rev Ian Paisley in accusing the government of reaching secret deals with the IRA. Last night, however, Mr Robinson indicated that he was prepared to put such conspiracy talk behind him. 'The prime minister's announcement has taken us beyond that . . . the issue is now one of consent,' he said. Mr Reg Empey, a former mayor of Belfast, described the government's announcement as a 'very major step forward' which would encourage unionists to commit themselves more fully to the peace process. 'For the first time, it opens up the possibility of people participating in their future,' he said. Mr Reynolds said the holding of referendums north and south of the border on any substantial new agreement would be a 'logical development of the Downing Street peace declaration'. He was supported by Mr Spring, who said Mr Major's commitment was 'in line with the position in our government programme that the final outcome of such negotiations would need to be acceptable to the people, north and south'. He added: 'It will, I hope, reassure those who at present hesitate to engage in the process of political dialogue, which is so necessary if the potential of the present situation is to be realised.' The holding of a referendum was implied in the joint Anglo-Irish declaration last December, but yesterday's more specific reference was aimed at reassuring unionist opinion against the background of threats of loyalist paramilitary violence. Since the IRA ceasefire was announced some unionist politicians have been claiming that Sinn Fein and the IRA are dictating the pace and scope of the peace process. Some unionists last night still said that the government had made unjustified concessions to the IRA by lifting the broadcasting ban and some border controls. Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, one of the areas affected by the opening of border controls, said last night: 'Law abiding people . . . quite simply do not want concessions given to Sinn Fein without some certainty that a ceasefire is permanent.'</p>

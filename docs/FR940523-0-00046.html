			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Possible Effects of Consumption of Animal Feeds Containing APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II on Animals and Their Gut Microflora  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment argued that empirical evidence should be gathered to assess the potential effects of modified foods on animals and their gut microflora.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is aware of no information that APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II would affect animals or their gut microflora any differently than any other protein in the diet, nor did the comment provide such information. The comment may have been referring to the theoretical potential for APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II in animal feed to affect efficacy of neomycin administered to animals, and the theoretical potential for the gut microflora to take up the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene and become resistant to neomycin. As discussed above, the likelihood of transfer of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene to gut microflora of food animals is extremely remote. Also, as discussed above, FDA has evaluated the study presented by Calgene addressing the possibility of inactivation of neomycin by APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II in animal feed and has concluded that the therapeutic efficacy of neomycin in animals would not be affected by consumption of feed containing transgenic cottonseed and rapeseed modified through the use of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=3 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Labeling of Foods Containing the Kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=5 f=3 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  Gene and APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment asserted that APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II should be labeled as an ingredient. The comment further stated that, if FDA exempted APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II from ingredient labeling requirements (based on its classification as a processing aid that is present at insignificant levels in a finished food and has no technical or functional effect in that food), FDA should require special labeling if the ingestion of food containing APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II could compromise the clinical efficacy of orally administered kanamycin or neomycin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA's authority over food labeling is based on section 403 of the act (21 U.S.C. 343). Section 403(i) of the act requires that, in the case of foods fabricated from two or more ingredients, a food product bear on the label the common or usual name of each ingredient, unless compliance with the requirement for labeling is impracticable or results in deception or unfair competition. FDA considers an ``ingredient'' to be a substance used to fabricate (i.e., manufacture or produce) a food. FDA does not consider those substances that are inherent components of food to be ingredients that must be disclosed in the food's label.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A genetic substance introduced into a plant by breeding becomes an inherent part of the plant as well as of all foods derived from the plant. Consistent with FDA's general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach on ingredient labeling, the agency has not treated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as an ingredient a new constituent of a plant introduced by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breeding, regardless of the method used to develop the new plant variety. The comment provides no basis for FDA to deviate from its current practice in the case of APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Accordingly, FDA has determined that neither the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene nor APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II is an ingredient that, under section 403(i) of the act, must be individually identified in labels of foods containing them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Furthermore, APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II satisfies the definition of ``processing aid'' in &sect;101.100(a)(3)(ii)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> c <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ) (21 CFR 101.100(a)(3)(ii)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> c <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> )) and will be regulated as such by this final rule. As the comment acknowledges, FDA's labeling regulations exempt processing aids like APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II from the labeling requirements of section 403(i)(2) of the act. Thus, even if APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II were properly considered an ingredient, its presence in a food would not be required to be disclosed in the food's labeling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA has also determined that the presence of APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II is not a material fact that must be disclosed in the labeling of foods that contain the enzyme. Under section 403(a)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 343(a)(1)), a food is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading. Under section 201(n) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(n)), labeling is misleading if it fails to reveal all facts that are ``*&blank;*&blank;* material with respect to consequences which may result from the use of the article *&blank;*&blank;*.'' As discussed at length above, FDA has determined that the ingestion of food containing APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II will not compromise the clinical efficacy of orally administered kanamycin or neomycin. Because the consequences alleged in the comment_compromise of clinical efficacy_will not occur, the presence of APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II is not a material fact requiring disclosure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Conclusions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material and concludes that the proposed use of APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II as a processing aid in the development of new varieties of tomato, oilseed rape, and cotton is safe, and that 21 CFR parts 173 and 573 should be amended as set forth below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Inspection of Documents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with &sect;&sect;171.1(h) and 571.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h) and 571.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h) and 571.1(h), the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making the documents available for inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / International Company News: Hang Seng issues HK CDs Hang Seng Bank, the Hong Kong banking subsidiary of HSBC, has tapped the capital markets for up to HKDollars 2bn with the launch of the colony's biggest certificate of deposit issue by a domestic bank. The three-year floating-rate CDs, arranged by HSBC Markets (formerly Wardley Capital), also represent the lowest cost of funding yet seen by a Hong Kong bank, reflecting Hang Seng's solid and cash-rich balance sheet. It is initially seeking HKDollars 1.2bn, and the all-in borrowing cost for co-managers is around 45 to 50 basis points above the Hong Kong inter-bank offered rate (Hibor). Hang Seng, although second only to Hongkong Bank in size, is the last entrant into the market. Last year Hongkong Bank raised Dollars 3bn through 10-year subordinated collared floating-rate notes. Bank of East Asia and Shanghai Commercial Bank, both past issuers, borrowed at some 65 to 70 basis points over Hibor. Mr Chung Chun-tung, general manager of the bank, said it was prompted by a changing attitude and a move to participate in all aspects of banking. Hang Seng has traditionally trod a very conservative path, which has been partially responsible for its low loan to deposit ratio of 42 per cent. However, it also highlights a desire to play a role in the colony's infrastructure projects: money raised through the CDs will put Hang Seng in a better position to exploit these opportunities, said Mr Chung. The offer, which will be open for two weeks, is expected to appeal to foreign banks seeking an exposure to the Hong Kong market and, to a lesser extent, institutional investors.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> A-PLANT PROJECT HALTED  </P> <P> Poland will suspend plans to build its second nuclear power plant because of  the "doubts and fears expressed by society," state radio said. Plans to  construct the nuclear plant in the Pila province town of Klempicz had aroused  protests in western Poland. The plant, to have been finished by the year 2000,  would be about 30 miles north of Poznan, a city of 585,000. Industry Minister  Mieczyslaw Wilczek met with governors from western Poland whose provinces are  near the proposed plant and told them he favored a "comprehensive review of the  development program of the nuclear power industry in Poland." Poland's first  nuclear power plant, scheduled to begin producing power in 1991, is being built  in Zarnowie, on the Baltic coast.  </P></p>

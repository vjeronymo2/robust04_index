			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Plea to lift electricity curbs Failure to deregulate the European electricity industry could hamper widespread introduction of more environmentally sound processes at European oil refineries. Mr Tomihiro Taniguchi of the International Energy Agency told a Financial Times conference yesterday that an environmentally friendly gasification process existed to turn high-sulphur fuel oil and other unwanted refinery residues into fuel for highly efficient combined cycle power plants. But the economics of such projects were 'crucially dependent' on refineries being able to sell the electricity. Only deregulated markets were likely to offer prices high enough to justify such investments, he said. France in particular has consistently opposed moves within the European Union to deregulate electricity. Conference speakers predicted that European demand for fuel oil would continue to contract.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "is": "The Development of the Economy Is Worse </F> Than Expected"]    [Text] Bratislava--Provided that the talks with the  International Monetary Fund are successful, the first  approximately $110-million installment of the standby credit  from the IMF should be released before the end of the year. The  drawing of the standby credit should be followed by the drawing  of the second installment of the STF [strategic transformation  facility] loan of approximately $90 million that Slovakia  obtained last year. The second installment of the standby  credit would then represent the sum of $60-$70 million. This  was stated by Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova in  connection with the current 10-day visit by an IMF mission.    According to Schmognerova, her talks with the mission's  representatives did not concern the creation of the social fund  or the introduction of wage regulation. Wage regulation should  be introduced only in the event of a marked widening of the gap  between the growth of wages and the decline in labor  productivity. As for the social fund, she said that it will be  created; the only question is how. "It will most probably be  created only at the beginning of 1995." The government is also  considering increasing the number of products that will be  subject to the higher value-added tax rate. Brigita Schmognerova  voiced the assurance, however, that the increase would not  concern products of everyday use. Measures to retain budget  balance should not affect the level of transfer payments,  according to her words. "Our endeavor is to distribute social  burdens evenly so that the weakest social groups are not  affected," the deputy prime minister added.    As she went on to say, the development of the economy this  year is worse than originally expected. The government  therefore has some crisis measures in reserve. "We would like  society to realize that we need support and that the  implementation of the set targets will establish better  prerequisites for the future. We have opted for measures that  will not concern the budget alone and that will lay the  foundations for positive developments and will have the least  social impact," Schmognerova stressed. According to her, the IMF  mission appreciated the fact that a new government was formed in  a very short time and that this government was able to prepare  its economic program quickly. The mission also appreciated the  government's endeavor to accelerate privatization and make it  more transparent and the [planned] launching of the second wave  of coupon privatization. Referring to the suspension of talks  between the former government and the IMF, the deputy prime  minister said that the former government had implemented  virtually nothing of its commitments toward the IMF, though  these have been known since December 1993, which makes the  starting position of the present government all the more  complicated.    [Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak on 6 April on pages 1  and 2 carries a 600-word Igor Zvach article on Deputy Prime  Minister Schmognerova's comments on her talks with the IMF  mission. The report includes the following passage: "Asked  whether the talks concerned devaluation or the measures adopted  by the previous government to limit some imports, Schmognerova  said that they did not. The Slovak Republic's foreign exchange  reserves are developing so that devaluation is not necessary.  The import surcharge had been introduced temporarily and  following consultations with GATT, and it is therefore pointless  to talk about it. Asked by NARODNA OBRODA whether some tough  IMF demands were discussed, such as measures in the sphere of  taxation and prices or cuts in the social sphere, the deputy  prime minister admitted that some IMF recommendations are  heading in this direction. The issue will be how to minimize  their impact on the population. No general tax or price  increases or drastic cuts in the social sphere are in the  offing. It is possible, however, that it will be necessary to  reconsider the tax burden with respect to certain groups of  merchandise. However, this will not concern articles of  everyday use."]</p>

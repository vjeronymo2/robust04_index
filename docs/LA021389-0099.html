			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Generally light snow was scattered around the Great Lakes and in parts of the  West, with light rain in the southern plains. Wind picked up moisture from Lake  Ontario and produced "lake effect" snow across northern New York state. Snow  also fell in Upper Michigan and central New York state. Snow showers extended  from southern Idaho across northern Nevada, Utah, eastern Colorado and  southeastern Wyoming, and from northwestern Kansas into Nebraska. Up to 5  inches of snow fell near Cedar City, Utah. Two inches were reported at Grand  Junction, Colo., and 1 inch of snow fell at Salt Lake City; Syracuse, N.Y., and  Mt. Washington, N.H.  </P></p>

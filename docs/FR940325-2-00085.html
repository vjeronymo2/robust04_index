Applications will be ranked and generally considered in order of the average scores assigned by reviewers. However, highly ranked applications are not guaranteed funding since the other factors deemed relevant may be considered including, but not limited to, the timely and proper completion of projects funded with OCS funds granted in the past 5 years; comments of reviewers and government officials; staff evaluation and input; geographic distribution; previous program performance of applicants; compliance with grant terms under previous DHHS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grants; audit reports; investigative reports; and applicant's progress in resolving any final audit disallowances on OCS or other Federal agency grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OCS reserves the right to discuss applications with other Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or non-Federal funding sources to ascertain the applicant's performance record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5.

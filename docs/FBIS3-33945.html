			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 2 Feb (INA)--The newspaper BABIL says that  Clinton's efforts to perpetuate the unfair embargo imposed on  Iraq, advancing hollow arguments and flimsy pretexts that are  not supported by any legal grounds, reflect his own bankruptcy,  as well as his violation of the international community's will  and laws.    In an article published today, the paper adds: Iraq has  implemented Section C of Resolution 687, as well as Resolution  715 on future monitoring. This requires the immediate lifting  of the oil embargo, as well as an all-out lifting of the  sanctions.    The paper goes on to say: There are no provisions in the  relevant UN Security Council resolutions that speak of a  "probation period." As for waffler Clinton's talk about  democracy and human rights, this is foolish talk.    BABIL says: At a time when well-intentioned parties all over  the world have continued to make statements on the need to lift  the embargo, and when the positions of most permanent members of  the UN Security Council on the embargo have undergone positive  changes, Clinton, in his report to the Congress, reveals himself  as a heretic.    The paper adds: Clinton professes to be a staunch defender  of civilized conduct at a time when he continues to slay elderly  people, children, and women in Somalia. It was Clinton who  ordered the missile attack on innocent civilians in Baghdad,  causing the death of men and children on the night of 26-27 June  1993, when there were no hostilities between Iraq and the United  States.    The paper concludes by saying: Iraq's steadfastness, the  determination of leader President Saddam Husayn, and the  enhancement of the march of construction and jihad will remain  the means to end the embargo, whether Clinton likes it or not.</p>

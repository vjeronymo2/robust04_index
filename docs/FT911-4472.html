			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Observer: Illuminating The curriculum vitae of South Africa's new ambassador in London, Kent Durr, portrays an envoy of some distinction. He has not only been minister of trade, industry and tourism, an underwriting member of Lloyd's, and managing director of a successful property company. He was among the top 12 students when he qualified for the Chartered Institute of Estate Agents. What's more, he holds an 'illuminated scroll and citation' from the South African institute of same to mark his contribution to the property industry. Such attainments, the CV adds, have earned him a place in Who's Who in the World and Men of Achievement, 1980-89. His recreations include mountaineering, yachting, gardening, and reading (particularly history)  - 'wide and diverse interests held together by his enormous energy.' A further distinction somehow omitted from the list is that 49-year-old Durr was one of only two English speakers in his country's otherwise Afrikaans cabinet. But that, I'm assured, does not mean Pretoria has downgraded the London embassy.</p>

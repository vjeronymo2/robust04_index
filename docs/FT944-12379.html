			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Japan to press Apec on trade liberalisation Japan will signal its clear support for a degree of regional trade liberalisation at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum summit in Bogor, Indonesia, in two weeks' time. It will press for a middle way between the free trade zone advocated by the US, Canada and Australia and the loose regional alliance preferred by east Asian members of the 17-nation forum, said Mr Tetsuya Endo, Japanese ambassador for Asia-Pacific co-operation. Until recently, Tokyo has taken a mildly negative back seat at Apec, reflecting a split between the foreign ministry, slow to accept the forum's value, and the ministry of international trade and industry, eager to push Apec as a trade and investment opportunity. Support from Indonesia, this year's holder of Apec's rotating chairmanship, is one factor in tipping the government in favour of Apec. The summit is expected to make a commitment to liberalise trade between Apec members by a target date, possibly 2020. Japan is eager to see Apec, representing half the world's trade, make this modest step forward from the vague accord of the first leaders' summit in Seattle last year, Mr Endo argued. But for agreement on a liberalisation deadline, details of what free trade entails must be left for later summits, said Mr Endo. That would leave it up to Japan, which takes the Apec chairmanship in 1995, to produce practical free trade steps in time for next year's summit in Osaka. 'Whether we like it or not, the burden will fall on Japan,' said Mr Endo. Japan 'is not adamant at all on the creation of a free trade area,' but does support a first small step in that direction, the unconditional granting of Most Favoured Nation trading status between Apec countries, he said. Tokyo shares some of the US preference for encouraging Apec to develop into a trade negotiating forum, but only for settling trade disputes that cannot be resolved bilaterally or by the new World Trade Organisation. A three-layered world trade system, of the WTO, regional bodies like Apec and bilateral relations, was 'best for Apec and Japan,' said Mr Endo. Japan accepts that moves to free trade in Apec need to be accompanied by government and private sector efforts to help poorer members to modernise, likely to be an important point of the Bogor talks, said Mr Endo. Tokyo and other rich members will push for the Apec summit to agree on more concrete steps, such as a code on cross-border investment rules. This is likely to be agreed by trade and foreign ministers before the leaders' summit. They are also expected to set up a committee to work for common Apec-wide standards for manufactured goods and food and joint customs procedures.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / US court boost for gays in military US MILITARY opposition to the admission of homosexuals was dealt a further heavy blow yesterday when a federal appeals court ordered the Naval Academy to graduate a student it had expelled six years ago when he admitted to being gay. The case in question pre-dates separate legal challenges to the Clinton administration's current 'don't ask, don't tell' policy, under which the military no longer asks about a potential recruit's sexual orientation but retains the right to dismiss anyone who is openly homosexual. But the language of the appeals court's unanimous judgment in reversing a lower court ruling was sufficiently sweeping to call into immediate question the chances of overturning the current policy. Chief Judge Abner Mikva wrote that it was 'inherently unreasonable' that the military should justify a ban on gays on the presumption that 'a certain class of persons will break the law or the rules solely because of their thoughts and desires.' The ruling also rejected the contention that service in the armed forces removed some of the constitutional protections afforded private citizens. 'There is no 'military exception' to the constitution,' it said. 'Indeed, even when the Supreme Court has deferred to military judgment, it has been careful to do so only within the confines of ordinary constitutional analysis.' 'When the military fails to accord individuals the equal protection of the laws, it treads upon an area of expertise that has long been conceded to the courts,' the judgment declared. 'America's hallmark has been to judge people by what they do and not by who they are.' The court's logic is very similar to that advanced by President Bill Clinton whose controversial insistence on ending the 50-year ban on homosexuals has been rooted in the argument that only conduct in uniform should be the determining factor in a person's fitness to serve. The case concerned Mr Joseph Steffan, expelled from the Naval Academy in 1987, just before he was due to graduate, after a navy investigation had confirmed that he had told a fellow cadet he was homosexual. His initial appeal against expulsion was dismissed by a lower court.</p>

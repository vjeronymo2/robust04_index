			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASHLAND OIL FINED $2.25 MILLION FOR SPILL THAT FOULED TWO RIVERS  </P> <P> A federal judge Thursday fined Ashland Oil Inc. a record $2.25 million for a  1988 oil spill that fouled two rivers in three states and threatened to disrupt  drinking water supplies for more than 1 million people.  </P> <P> Justice Department officials said it was the biggest penalty ever imposed  against a company for a fuel spill.  </P> <P> "It was something more than simple negligence that the company was guilty of,"  U.S. District Judge Gustave Diamond said.  </P> <P> A dime-sized flaw in the World War II-era steel of a tank at Ashland's Floreffe  Terminal caused the vessel to collapse on Jan. 2, 1988, and unleash its  contents of 3.8 million gallons of diesel oil, authorities said.  </P> <P> More than 700,000 gallons escaped a dike and entered the Monongahela River 25  miles south of Pittsburgh, in one of the nation's worst inland oil spills. The  river is a source of drinking water for suburban Pittsburgh, and is a tributary  of the Ohio River that is also a source of drinking water.  </P> <P> The tank burst as it was being filled after having been dismantled outside  Cleveland and reassembled beside the Monongahela. Ashland admitted violating  industry standards in reconstructing the tank.  </P> <P> Ashland spokesman Roger Schrum called the fine excessive but said the company  had not decided whether to appeal.  </P> <P> The company had pleaded no contest to two misdemeanor counts under the Clean  Water and Refuse acts. Each count carried a minimum fine of $200,000.  </P> <P> Ashland has paid about $18 million in cleanup costs and civil claims from  residents and businesses affected by the spill.  </P> <P> The Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined Ashland more than  $50,000 for safety violations, and the Environmental Protection Agency fined  the company $145,000 for alleged deficiencies in its spill prevention plan.  </P> <P> About 23,000 suburban Pittsburgh residents endured a week without tap water  while the river carried the pollution past their water intakes.  </P></p>

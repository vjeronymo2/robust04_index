			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / S African miners scrap profit-linked pay deal THE South African National Union of Mineworkers' (NUM) decision to scrap a profit-and productivity-linked wage deal was the first shot across the bows of mining houses in the run up to annual wage talks, analysts said, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. 'It might well be the start of a push for a differently structured arrangement for 1992-93, and one at better terms,' Mr Rob Gillan, analyst at Frankel Max Pollak Vinderine, said. However, if the NUM's new demands were unrealistic, employers, hit by weak gold prices, would be forced to shed more workers, he said. The NUM's outgoing acting general secretary, Mr Marcel Golding, told a news conference at the weekend that the union would pull out of the agreement at the June wage talks because of members' dissatisfaction with the bonus system and the way most mine employers were applying it. The NUM and the Chamber of Mines signed an historic performance bonus agreement last year, whereby a minimum annual wage increase is supplemented if the gold price reaches a trigger level. The gold price did not trigger the bonus in the first half of the July-June, 1991-92 year covered by the agreement. But, in terms of cost containment and productivity schemes, some mines have paid out bonuses of up to 12 per cent, on top of a minimum 4 per cent wage increase for the year, analysts said. Mr Andries Treurnicht, leader of the Conservative Party, yesterday formally spurned an offer by President FW de Klerk to put his party's proposal for racial partition on the agenda of multi-party democracy talks, Reuter reports from Cape Town. Mr Treurnicht told parliament in Cape Town that Mr de Klerk's offer was a 'cynical' attempt to draw his party into negotiations.</p>

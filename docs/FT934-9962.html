			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / International Company News: Viacom raises Paramount offer THE BID battle for Paramount Communications, the US film and book publishing group, intensified at the weekend when Viacom, the cable television company which is Paramount's friendly suitor, increased its offer. It appeared to have stolen the initiative over its rival, the QVC Network home shopping group, by raising its bid by Dollars 5 in cash per share to Dollars 85 a share, valuing Paramount at just over Dollars 10bn. Paramount welcomed the move while QVC was silent. Until the weekend, Viacom and QVC had offered the same price for Paramount: Dollars 80 a share, valuing the company at just under Dollars 9.5bn. Viacom's decision to increase its offer gives it a firm advantage and QVC seems certain to have to increase the value of hostile bid significantly to regain the initiative. One possibility that emerged at the end of last week is that QVC will bring in BellSouth, one of the US regional telephone companies, as a partner. BellSouth would spend Dollars 500m buying the 22 per cent stake in QVC now held by Liberty Media and would make a further Dollars 1bn available to QVC to enable it to increase the value of its bid for Paramount. Viacom's decision to increase its offer on Saturday seems to have been aimed at pre-empting such a move, and will force QVC and BellSouth into fresh calculations about how much money it will take to finance a winning bid. The timing of Viacom's announcement appears to have been determined by securities regulations which require a tender offer to be open for at least 20 business days and a revision to be open for at least 10 business days. By announcing the revision yesterday, Viacom will still be able to close on November 22, two days before QVC's bid. That will force Paramount's shareholders to take a decision on Viacom's bid in isolation, rather than choosing between two bids.</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (16): An idea that took off HOW TO GET AHEAD IN BUSINESS by Tom Cannon (editor) Virgin Books, Pounds 9.99 260 pages This is an instant book. Its very existence proves what tightly-focused management can achieve when objectives are simple and clear. With hard work, and a team from Virgin Books frantically getting permissions to publish extracts of others' works, you can have copy ready for the printer in 31 days, which is what Tom Cannon did this summer. The rush arose because Virgin accidentally created the book's market. Last summer the airline ran a teasing TV advertising campaign featuring celebrities, including Branson himself, reading a book called How to Get Ahead in Business. The answer, the second half of the campaign, was supposed to be 'Fly Virgin'. The book was a dummy and only there to make viewers ask the question. But many of them - Branson says thousands - started asking for the book instead. Virgin decided to publish one, but it had to be done quickly to match and catch the campaign. Cannon, an erstwhile director of Manchester Business School who was consulting for Virgin, seized the opportunity. The book is great fun. It even provides some valuable clues on how to get ahead in businesses. Cannon is an irrepressible scouser who proved a little too entrepreneurial and independent for Manchester University last year. The flavour of Cannon - and why there are often clashes between practical management educators and the differently-driven, meticulous academics who distrust his like - comes over. As with any anthology, the general thrust comes from the selection and the way the constituent parts are linked by display, classification, headlines and juxtaposition. As with any anthology, the problem is maintaining it. Cannon does it in 14 chapters, using 84 main sources and a liberal sprinkling of jokes, aphorisms and cartoons so as to achieve some element of surprise and delight on nearly every page. This is a book for dipping into, but also one for learning from - and for sampling works some may feel worth deeper study. The rush to publish shows. The reader is left to guess that the passages in italics are a linking commentary by Cannon himself. But its substance and thrust are strong enough to overcome this. Generally the theme seems to be: analyse, keep it simple, communicate well, get on with it, re-evaluate, deter bureaucracy, fight fossilisation, innovate and learn from your mistakes. Authors range from Machiavelli to Mark McCormack, from Stephen Potter to Parkinson and Peters, from Rudyard Kipling and Tom Wolfe to Philip Kotler and Theodore Levitt, from Aristotle to Peter Drucker. One-liners from Heller ('The first myth of management is that it exists') or Launegayer ('Asking dumb questions is easier than correcting dumb mistakes') join the laws of Murphy and Finagle to let both insight and typographical light into the text, increasing readability.</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Management: No longer the ugly duckling Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial group, wants to spend more money in Britain. Keen to cut costs, it has embarked on a thorough search for sources of supply cheaper than high-cost Germany. Now that the UK has largely shed its strike-prone image, and Germany has acquired one of its own, Daimler feels the time is ripe to look for reliable, quality-minded suppliers. 'For several years now, we have ceased to be concerned about British suppliers' performance,' says Klaus Engelhardt, Daimler's purchasing director. Last year, the company bought DM57bn (Pounds 19.3bn) worth of parts and supplies, but only 15 per cent came from overseas. The group's aim is to raise that share to 20 per cent in the next few years. It is concentrating on the UK partly because it is fairly close and, as Engelhardt says, 'we can see that the UK motor industry is starting to flourish again'. At present, the UK is third on the list of foreign suppliers, just behind France and the US and accounting for DM1bn of group purchasing. Daimler decided to make a big splash in London last June with a one-day supplier conference, its biggest ever. Around 340 companies wanted to come, but only 95 could be accommodated. Daimler is still in contact with most of them. 'We don't just look at the naked price,' Engelhardt explains. Seemingly big price advantages can be eroded by freight, packaging, insurance and other costs. If there is still a pricing edge of at least 5 per cent Daimler will take parts for testing and later place firm orders. Altogether, the process from initial talks to final ordering takes around two years. Engelhardt's department works closely with the divisions using the bought-in components. The main thrust now is on the car side, where cost pressures are most acute. There is a twist to Daimler's interest in the UK. Attracted by the Japanese-led resurgence in the UK motor sector, German suppliers like Siemens, VDO and Bosch have set up components subsidiaries in the UK; others are following. So Daimler may find itself buying British with a German flavour.</p>

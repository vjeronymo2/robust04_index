			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Asahi Glass warns of tough year THE Japanese business environment will remain severe for most of this year. Asahi Glass, the country's leading glassmaker, warned yesterday when it reported a 33.5 per cent fall in ordinary income for the year to the end of December. Asahi Glass' sales fell by 1 per cent to Y1,011bn (Dollars 8bn), operating income fell by 46.9 per cent to Y25bn, ordinary income was cut to Y40bn, and net income declined by 44.6 per cent to Y20.4bn. The company's consolidated sales rose by 5 per cent to Y1,316bn, but its operating income fell by 32 per cent to Y42bn and net income declined by Y35.6 per cent to Y24bn. Asahi Glass said it was pressing ahead with a three-pronged restructuring programme, to cut costs, improve co-ordination between its Japanese and overseas subsidiaries and put more emphasis on more sophisticated, higher value-added products. The glassmaker has been badly hit by a fall in demand from the Japanese car and electronics industries and the stagnant construction sector.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Pacific Ocean" Program] </F>   [Text] Bureaucrats of the Russian Government apparatus  have condemned the Pacific Fleet servicemen to a famished  existence. The debt of the Russian Armed Forces for the supply  of food products alone amounts to 60 billion rubles.  Nevertheless, the financial administration of the Russian  Defense Ministry continues to hold a defensive position, and  shrugs off the numerous appeals -- from the Pacific Fleet among  others -- for payments for provisions delivered on credit.  According to a report of the Pacific Fleet press service, the  fleet command wasted a mountain of paper sending requests for  financing of military units to obtain the barest necessities.  However, both the Russian Government and the Ministry of  Defense remain indifferent to these requests.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Gilts auction disappoints THE FIRST auction of UK government bonds since sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism in September proved a disappointment yesterday as foreign investors stayed away from the gilts market, leaving domestic buyers to pick up the stock. The Bank of England, which had put Pounds 2.5bn of gilts on offer, received bids totalling only Pounds 3.15bn, which was seen by the market as a very low cover ratio. 'The auction has confirmed the general view that UK interest rates are unlikely to come down substantially in the short term,' said Mr John Kendall, economist at Baring Sterling Bonds. The gilt issue on offer, 8 per cent Treasury stock due 2003, had been expected to appeal to overseas investors. The issue is expected to take over as the new 10-year benchmark, which is used as a reference for the rest of the market because of its size and liquidity. Overseas investors normally like bonds with a 10-year or shorter maturity, but since sterling left the ERM, foreign investors have been particularly wary of the UK government bond market. European investors are exposed to a greater exchange rate risk, and the recent sharp cuts in the base rate have rekindled fears that inflation may start to rise again. Adding to the gilt market's worries is the government's heavy borrowing requirement. The government has forecast a public sector borrowing requirement of about Pounds 44bn for 1993-94, which means that the Bank of England will have to issue about Pounds 50bn-Pounds 55bn in gilts - roughly Pounds 1bn a week - once the repayment of maturing issues is taken into account. The auction cover - which represents the ratio of bids to the amount on offer - was considered low at only 1.26 times, and indicates the low level of interest in the auction. At the last auction, at the end of August, the cover was also low at 1.24 times, due to pressure on sterling on the foreign exchanges. Lex, Page 22 Gilts tumble, Page 29 Money markets, Page 31</p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOLDEN SEES CHANGE IN TRUCK-BAN FOES  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden held a meeting of the council  Transportation Committee Thursday to hear objections to rush-hour restrictions  on truck traffic and said he believes those who oppose the plan will come to  support it.  </P> <P> "I think we are on the right track," Holden said.  </P> <P> More than a half-dozen speakers representing public agencies, private firms and  associations voiced their concerns at a City Hall meeting held by Holden,  chairman of the Transportation Committee.  </P> <P> Reservations included questions about the delivery of perishable products to  grocery stores, the problems of violating noise ordinances at off-hours and the  necessity of renegotiating labor contracts with unions representing truck  operators.  </P> <P> After the meeting, Holden said he hopes truck-traffic restrictions, proposed by  Mayor Tom Bradley about two years ago, can be adopted by the first of the year,  if it can be done without "putting people out of business or causing them undue  hardship." He said that he had never opposed the plan, despite recents reports  in The Times that he had.  </P></p>

Prime Minister Intends To Sign Accord  With Moscow on Any Terms"]    [Text] "The merging of the monetary systems of Russia and  Belarus is impossible without Belarus' losing its independence  and statehood," said parliament opposition leader Zenon Poznyak,  speaking in the Supreme Soviet. He painted grim prospects  awaiting the country, thinking that if it joins the ruble zone:  "This would be the capitulation of the Belarus economy and the  Belarus state to a more powerful Russian capital and  entrepreneurship. Our enterprises and banks would be swallowed  up, and the property bought up. In the end, we would remain on  our soil, but it would no longer belong to us.... We would turn  into a free-ride corridor for the duty-free transit of Russian  gas, oil, and raw material to the West."    On behalf of the Belarus People's Front, Mr. Poznyak called  the country's citizens to a nationwide political manifestation  to demand the resignation of the government, the dissolution of  the Supreme Soviet, and early democratic elections. He also  pledged support for the free trade unions and strike committees  that are preparing a general political strike slated to go ahead  on 15 February.    New Belarus Parliament Speaker Myechyslaw Hryb reacted  nervously to the opposition statement. He interrupted Mr.  Poznyak's address with the words: "We do not need such  documents," and ordered the microphone turned off.    In the meantime, the Russia-Belarus expert-level talks on a  mechanism for the merger of the monetary systems continue near  Minsk in anticipation of Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit. The  meeting is taking place behind closed doors. Asked for comments  on the progress of the talks, Myechyslaw Hryb replied that they  are proceeding "normally, in a coordinated and orderly way."  According to reports from informed sources in the Belarus  Government, the premier intends to sign an agreement on a single  ruble space in any shape, and on whatever conditions the Russian  side insists.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS RETRIEVE HIRMEZ, SEND GARCIA TO LAZERS  </P> <P> Waad Hirmez, the high scorer in last season's Major Indoor Soccer League  playoffs while helping the Sockers to their sixth indoor championship, returned  to the Sockers from the Los Angeles Lazers Tuesday in a trade for forward Poli  Garcia.  </P> <P> Hirmez, who joined the Lazers as a free agent last summer, has scored 11 goals  and nine assists in 30 games for Los Angeles this season. Garcia, who played  for the Lazers from 1982 to 1987 and scored 50 goals for the St. Louis Steamers  last season, had played only sparingly for the Sockers this season and scored  just one goal.  </P> <P> "We're ecstatic about this," Sockers' Coach Ron Newman said. "We had an  abundance of offensive talent here, and Poli just couldn't find much playing  time. We needed help in the midfield, and we already know that Waady can  provide that for us."  </P> <P> Hirmez, who went to Point Loma High School, started his career with the Sockers  as a defender in 1984. He moved to the midfield midway through last season and  scored a career-high 30 goals. In the playoffs, he scored 15 goals and had nine  assists, including a hat trick in the Sockers' MISL championship-clinching 7-4  victory over the Cleveland Force.  </P> <P> "I can't be any happier about this," Hirmez said. "Things just didn't work out  for me in Los Angeles, and I'm happy to be coming back to San Diego."  </P> <P> Hirmez will return to the lineup in time to play against the Lazers in Los  Angeles Thursday night.  </P> <P> Socker Notes  </P> <P> Coach Ron Newman said the Sockers are still somewhat interested in re-acquiring  goalkeeper Jim Gorsek from the Lazers, but talks are on hold. "There's been  some preliminary talks, but that's it," Newman said. "We're unsure whether or  not we need a third goalkeeper because we don't know about the status (of  Zoltan Toth, who's been out for more than a month with bunions). But they (the  Lazers) have three goalkeepers, so they could be looking to move one of the  them." . . . Amid rumors that it might be looking for a new commissioner, the  MISL announced that Bill Kentling has until March 15 to decide whether or not  he wants to return for the 1989-90 season. Kentling, speaking after Tuesday's  MISL owner meetings in Dallas, said he hasn't started thinking about what he  wants to do. But owners have already put together a committee, headed by Stuart  Weitzman, the Baltimore Blast's managing general partner, to begin looking for  a new commissioner in the event Kentling doesn't come back.  </P></p>

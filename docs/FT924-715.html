			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / Late-running rise reaches BR staff 32 years after they first claimed it. Rail unions say it was 1960 when they first argued that senior signalling staff should be paid extra for training their juniors, a task that was not in their contracts. According to the RMT union, BR refused to entertain the claim, saying remuneration for training had been addressed in pay reviews occasioned by technological change. BR insisted, however, that the claim had been lodged only two years ago. The RMT yesterday accepted BR's offer, noting that the claim had outlasted three of its general secretaries, 17 transport secretaries and seven British Rail chairmen. Staff have settled for 15 per cent on top of basic pay for every shift worked with a trainee. The RMT rail union calculates that staff will walk away with between Pounds 4.40 and Pounds 6.80 a training day. The RMT said: 'Christmas has come early, even if the settlement is late.' The union will raise the question of backdating the allowance for those few of the 15,000 or so signalling staff employed in 1960 who are still on the payroll. BR said: 'The claim was lodged in December 1990 and the final offer was lodged in July this year. It seems curious that they should not have pursued the claim if they really did lodge a claim in 1960.' BR said there were many local agreements under which some signalling staff were paid the allowance. Editorial Comment, Page 10</p>

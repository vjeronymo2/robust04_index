			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONROVIA;  </P> <P> NO VOTE ON POLICE STATION  </P> <P> A plan to let voters decide in November whether the city should build a new  police station was scrapped at Tuesday's meeting of the City Council, which  voted to delay any citywide election until next year.  </P> <P> Jack Bonholtzer, chairman of the Police Facility Citizen's Advisory Committee,  recommended that the council delay the vote because the committee believes that  there would not be enough time to campaign on behalf of the new station and  because of the complexity and length of the November ballot.  </P> <P> "We think this is a vital issue for the city and we're afraid that if we try to  move too fast, the people of Monrovia won't get the right information,"  Bonholtzer told the council.  </P> <P> The committee has recommended that the city build an $8.8-million police  station and fund it by assessing each Monrovia household $49 annually for the  next 27 years.  </P></p>

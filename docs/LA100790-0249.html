SUCH TIES BECOME  MORE,NOT LESS, IMPORTANT AS WE AGE AND ARE THE ONLY ONES WITH THE POTENTIAL TO  LAST FROM THE CRADLE TO THE GRAVE.  </P> <P> GWEN, 60, HAS SEEN MORE of her older sister Bette, 63, since moving to  California several years ago than she did when they both lived in the same  state. "I think it's because absence makes the heart grow fonder," Gwen says.  "Bette got married when I was 18 and we never spent much time together until I  moved out here. She's been here twice to visit, and we spend two or three weeks  together -- which is about the most time we've spent together in 40 years. We  talk a lot about our mom and dad and about old times. She remembers a lot more  than I do. She talks about what a brat I was when I was a teen-ager -- she  remembers a lot of things I don't, but when I hear them, I know they're true."  </P> <P>  Gwen and Bette are the rule, not the exception. When we're old, even more so  than when we're young, our brothers and sisters are likely to be among our best  friends.  </P> <P>  Researchers have found that the proportion of people who say they feel close  to their siblings rises with age. From their 30s on, most sisters and brothers  not only see each other more often but also say they feel closer to each other  emotionally.  </P> <P> From the story of Cain and Abel to the tale of "Hannah and Her Sisters," the  power of the complex bond between brothers and sisters is hard to deny. Yet  until about 15 years ago, psychologists tended to relegate relationships with  siblings to a poor fourth place, after ties to children, parents and mates.  </P> <P> Says Carol Holden, a University of Michigan psychologist: "Relationships among  sisters and brothers were thought to be either pale reflections of their  relationships with parents or defined almost entirely by sibling rivalry."  </P> <P> Now, an increasing number of psychologists believe that relationships with  siblings can be among the most important in life. And a growing body of  research suggests that sibling ties become more, not less, important as we age.  These relationships form the clearest blueprints we have for later relations  with peers. Says Holden: "The way you got along with your sisters and brothers  when you were young can influence your choice of friends and marriage partners.  It can also have a strong influence on how you get along with co-workers."  </P> <P> In "My One and Only: The Special Experience of The Only Child," (William Morrow  and Co., 1989), San Francisco author Ellie McGrath describes her own childhood  and weighs the advantages and disadvantages of being an only child. "Most only  children, myself included, believe that had they grown up with a sibling, they  would have learned how to deal with others sooner and more smoothly. They feel  that they are a bit slow sensing the dynamics of peer relationships or learning  the art of negotiation." Not to mention learning how to fight.  </P> <P> Another reason our relationships with siblings are among life's most important  is their sheer longevity. As marriages crumble and friendships fade, "the  sibling relationship becomes for many people the only intimate connection that  seems to last," observes University of Hartford psychologist Michael Kahn,  co-editor with family therapist Karen Lewis of "Siblings in Therapy." The  sibling relationship is the only one that has the potential to last from the  cradle to the grave. In fact, Kahn notes, a brother or sister is the most  likely of all relatives to be at your side when you die.  </P> <P> Even Hollywood has recognized how important brothers and sisters can be to each  other. Besides "Hannah and Her Sisters," Kahn cites "Crimes of the Heart,"  "Fanny and Alexander," "Ran" and "The Color Purple" as examples of recent films  in which sibling relationships eclipse romantic ties. Add to this list the  critically acclaimed "sex, lies and videotape" and the Australian sleeper,  "Sweetie," in which two sisters compete for their inattentive parents'  attention.  </P> <P> Given the importance of the sibling relationship, it's not surprising that for  some people the major psychological "work" of middle age consists of settling  old scores with siblings, according to Wesleyan University psychologist Stephen  Bank, co-author with Kahn of "The Sibling Bond." The first thing to understand,  he notes, is that it's not normal to feel distant from or angry toward a sister  or brother. "Most adults have cordial, mutually supportive relationships with  their brothers and sisters," says Bank.  </P> <P> Those who do not, Bank believes, can at least learn to stop seeing their  siblings as the cause of the problem and, through therapy, begin to understand  that both they and their siblings are victims of the same twisted family  dynamics that may have been in operation for generations. In other words, in  middle age, estranged siblings may finally begin to fathom the depths of their  family tragedy.  </P> <P> "Psychotherapists are the audiences for modern sibling legends," Bank says. "We  don't hear sagas of heroic nomads from great tribal families -- like Jacob and  Esau. But we do hear about disconnected modern brothers and sisters, living  miles apart in distant suburbs, who've become alienated and angry" at one  another. When siblings are at war, sometimes it's a fight to the death, and  some people never achieve that closeness.  </P> <P>  "I tried for years to get along with her," says Hazel, 65, explaining why she  wouldn't call or visit an older sister who'd just had a major heart attack. The  sister had stopped talking to Hazel and other family members many years before.  "I bear no malice against her anymore, but I can't put up with her bitterness,  the way she still blames Mamma and Poppa for everything bad that happened to  her. I love her and I hope she doesn't suffer a lot. She's my sister, but I  just cannot put up with her." As a teen-ager, another sister, the youngest in  this same large family, moved as far away from the others as she could and for  most of her life didn't call or visit anyone in her family of origin. A brother  disappeared, cutting off all contact with his children, nieces, nephews and  sisters.  </P> <P> Such "disowned sibling relationships" -- in which adult sisters and brothers  stop speaking or wind up exploding at each other when they do get together --  are often the fallout of parental uninvolvement, neglect or abuse, according to  Bank. But by far the most common cause is pathological favoritism. The case of  Rebecca, a professional woman in her early 50s whose husband was threatening to  leave her because she was frigid, is one of many Bank has seen in which the  effects of favoritism are felt long after the parents are dead. Rebecca's  parents always celebrated her younger sister's talents and achievements. They  praised the younger sister's looks as well as her brains, and believing their  praise, the sister projected a self-confidence that made her a magnet for men.  Feeling hopelessly outclassed, Rebecca gave up trying to imitate her sister.  "Because she felt so inferior and believed she wasn't attractive at all  compared with her sister," Bank says, "she rejected her own sexuality."  </P> <P> Although the reasons parents favor one child over another vary from family to  family, the underlying dynamics behind pathological favoritism are similar,  Bank maintains. "All parents like one thing about one child and another thing  about another child," he says. "The question is, at what point do they start  comparing them and does it all get out of hand? In a normal family, everybody  gets to be the scapegoat and everybody gets to be the favorite. You take turns.  One child is catching heat one day and being treated well another day. It  rotates. In troubled families, one child remains the scapegoat and one remains  the favorite, which leads to all sorts of things, including lifelong sibling  discord."  </P> <P> Even in normal families, though, myths often develop about the personalities  and talents of siblings that may have little to do with reality. These myths  have a way of persisting into adulthood, influencing how grown-up sisters and  brothers feel about themselves and each other.  </P> <P> A classic study by pediatrician Frances Fuchs Schachter confirmed the existence  of the "Cain and Abel syndrome," the tendency of parents to believe that their  first two children are "as different as night and day." Schachter asked 140  mothers to compare their children, two at a time, on a series of personality  attributes. She found that 80% of the mothers thought their children had  opposite characteristics. If one was viewed as an introvert, the other was seen  as an extrovert. If one was seen as fast, smart or strong, the other was likely  to be viewed as slow, stupid or weak. Often, siblings themselves act out these  differences, so that if parents make a big deal out of one being "good," the  other starts acting "bad."  </P> <P> Schachter also found that college students said they were different from their  siblings about twice as often as they reported being alike, suggesting that  they have internalized their parents' opinions. While most brothers and sisters  manage to find their own identities, sometimes their "de-identification" with  each other becomes even more pronounced with age.  </P> <P> Much of the time, though, the differences between sisters and brothers are far  less dramatic. "I'm an older sister with a younger sister," says Carol Holden,  the Michigan psychologist who has studied the experience of being an older  versus a younger sibling. "There's two and a half years and nine days between  us. But who's counting? My sister and I have gotten along quite well over the  years, but a lot of the popular misconceptions have been applied to us, like  the older one is the smart one, the younger one is the pretty one."  </P> <P> In her study of 60 college students, Holden found other, more realistic  differences between what it feels like to be the older versus the younger  sibling in a family of two children -- still the most common number, according  to the U.S. Census Bureau. Older children are much more likely to express guilt  about how they treated their siblings during childhood. "Older siblings  remember a lot of very conscious wishes to harm their younger siblings," Holden  says. "They have a lot of memories of pushing their sister or brother down or  hitting them over the head."  </P> <P> Although most siblings Holden interviewed said they were very happy with how  they were now getting along with their brothers and sisters, there was one  notable exception. The older sisters of younger brothers were much more likely  than others to be unhappy with their relationship. "Having a younger brother is  a lot more disruptive than having a younger sister," explains Holden.  </P> <P> Not only does the second child destroy the first-born's privileged position as  the sole recipient of parental time, love and attention, but if the second  child is a boy, the first-born girl can't help but notice that he's talked to  and handled differently by both parents. "In a culture where boys are highly  valued, it's a double displacement," she says. "If you believe any of Freud's  concepts of penis envy, it fits right in with this because when their brothers  were born, the girls (in the study) tended to be right at the age (2) when sex  differences are first noticed.  </P> <P> "This sample is small, so I hate to make generalizations," Holden says, "But  when I think about having children, if I have one of each, I'm hoping the boy  comes first."  </P> <P> As sisters and brothers graduate from college and start careers of their own,  they often drift apart, communicating indirectly through their parents, getting  together for holidays once or twice a year. When they marry and have children  of their own, though, their need for contact with each other often increases.  </P> <P> Marilyn, 42, and her sister Diane, 38, talk to each other on the telephone  almost every day and visit whenever they can. While they were in college,  months went by without either of them making contact. "We didn't get along when  we were growing up," Marilyn says. "And when we went off to college, we were  both glad to put a little space between us." But after they gave birth to  daughters within a year of each other, they became closer than ever, as many  sisters do.  </P> <P> As aging parents need more help, middle-aged brothers and sisters may find old  patterns reactivated. The decision to assume the major responsibility for an  ailing mother or father may reflect the wish to outgrow a childhood role.  </P> <P> At 40, Margaret was the youngest of three sisters, the mid-life baby. "Nothing  was expected of me," she recalls. "I roamed the meadows. I wrote poetry. When I  asked what I should bring for Thanksgiving, the answer was usually 'rolls and  pickles.' " When her 80-year-old mother developed Alzheimer's-related dementia  and could no longer live alone safely, Margaret was the one who quit her job,  uprooted her family and moved to a different town to take care of her ailing  mother, even though her two older sisters lived in the same town as their  mother. "I think the real reason I did it was I thought, 'Geez, here's my  chance to prove that I'm finally responsible.' "  </P> <P>  Other women taking care of ailing parents report feeling angry about the lack  of support brothers and sisters provide. "My sister has only visited once in  the last year, and then she had the nerve to criticize what I was doing for  mother," says one woman. "My brother didn't help at all," says another, who  took care of a mother with Alzheimer's Disease for several years. "I can't  forgive him for it." "My sister's furious that I'm using part of our mother's  money to hire a part-time helper," says yet another woman whose elderly,  incontinent mother lives with her. "She doesn't seem to understand I need a  break. We haven't spoken for more than a year now."  </P> <P> Dr. Barbara Silverstone, author of "You and Your Aging Parent," believes that  while siblings sometimes turn their backs and leave one sister holding the bag,  life isn't often that simple. "Usually there's something going on between the  sisters and brothers that needs to be explored," she says. The sibling taking  daily care of an aged parent may push her brothers and sisters away, fearing  she'll be criticized for not taking good enough care of the ailing parent or  wishing to become -- at long last -- the most important person in her parent's  life. Or, the caretaker may be haunted by the suspicion that, despite all her  sacrifices, her parent still prefers a brother or sister.  </P> <P> Although settling scores with sisters and brothers may be important in  middle-age, add a few more years and most siblings start to mellow. The death  of a parent can bring sisters and brothers closer to each other. "After an  elderly parent dies, some families become more distant," says Andrew Scharlach,  a University of Southern California researcher who is studying the impact on  adults of parents' deaths. "But others become closer. One sister or brother  begins to act in loco parentis, becoming the new head of the family or the kin  keeper."  </P> <P> According to Purdue University psychologist Victor Cicerelli, the life cycle  that begins with two or more siblings being each other's closest companions and  best friends often ends the same way. Cicerelli interviewed more than 300  brothers and sisters and found a low level of rivalry among elderly sibs: 10%  reported having arguments; 6% reported being bossed or attempts at domination  by a sib; 8% reported feelings of competition -- and that only rarely -- and  only a handful reported outbreaks of jealously, hostility, or snobbishness.  </P> <P> Instead of bickering or feuding, Cicerelli found that older sisters and  brothers spent a good deal of time reminiscing -- a way of bringing back what  they had together and of exorcising any remnants of sibling rivalry. "Sisters  seem to have the closest relationships," Cicerelli reports. "At least they  report lower morale and more depression if they're not getting along with their  siblings."  </P> <P> In middle-age, almost 70% of the people Cicerelli interviewed said they felt  close or extremely close to a sister or brother. In old age, more than 80% did.  Even those who did not seemed to recognize how valuable the relationship is.  </P> <P> As one man told Cicerelli: "Sure, I hate my brothers. But after all, they're  family."  </P></p>

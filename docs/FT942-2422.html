			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Carter solution awaits the test of time: Questions remain on North Korean nuclear issue The next few weeks are likely to determine if former US President Jimmy Carter's trip to Pyongyang has produced a possible solution to the North Korean nuclear dispute or whether it will prove to be another diplomatic mirage. The essence of the proposed agreement, which Mr Carter reached after two meetings with North Korean President Kim Il-sung last week, is a pledge by Pyongyang to freeze its nuclear programme if the US holds another round of high-level talks on possible diplomatic recognition and agrees to help supply North Korea with safer light-water reactors. If the deal is concluded, it would prevent North Korea from possibly building more nuclear devices but leave unanswered the question, for the time being at least, of whether North Korea has already acquired one or two atomic bombs as claimed by US intelligence. 'All of the agreement will be confirmed through official channels, which might take several days, but I think that the crisis which was possibly approaching war has been defused,' said Mr Carter before returning to Washington to meet administration officials. 'We think we should explore this,' Mr Anthony Lake, US national security adviser, told Cable Network News. 'In the meantime, we will continue with the (United Nations) Security Council on our consultations for a sanctions resolution.' North Korea also asked for a security guarantee from Washington that it would not be subject to a nuclear attack by the US or other countries. 'I was authorised to say that in the context of the North-South (Korean) declaration on denuclearisation, that the US will be willing to join in on such an assurance,' Mr Carter said on Saturday in Seoul after returning from Pyongyang. Mr Carter's statement suggested North Korea must adhere to the 1991 denuclearisation agreement with Seoul in return for the US non-nuclear guarantee. The agreement has not been implemented, thanks to disagreements between the two Koreas on some of its provisions, including mutual inspections. North Korea has sought inspections of US military bases in South Korea as part of the agreement, while Seoul wanted to conduct inspections of suspected nuclear facilities in the North. Mr Carter indicated the US was willing to accept North Korean inspections of its military bases to assure Pyongyang that it was not storing tactical nuclear weapons. One issue that remains to be answered is how long the North's freeze would last on its nuclear activity, including suspending the operation of its 5MW reactor. Mr Kim said that he would freeze his country's nuclear activities only while there were talks between Pyongyang and Washington on diplomatic recognition, but added that the freeze would be extended 'if there is an assurance of light-water reactor technology being available to North Korea'. But Mr Carter said it was 'unclear' whether North Korea would suspend nuclear activity for the five to eight years it would take to build a light-water reactor. Another unresolved issue is whether North Korea would suspend the construction of its much bigger 50MW and 200MW reactors, expected to be completed in 1995 and 1998 respectively, that could produce considerable amounts of weapons-grade plutonium. The replacement of the North's current gas-coolled, graphite-moderated reactors with light-water ones would curb its ability to produce weapons-grade plutonium and force Pyongyang to rely on outside sources for its reactor fuel. The US last year expressed support for North Korean acquisition of the light-water reactors but added it would not supply the technology and finance the estimated Dollars 2bn cost. Mr Kim 'understands that the US itself is not prepared to finance or furnish the equipment', Mr Carter said. One noticeable gap in the deal outlined by Mr Carter is whether North Korea is willing to accept full inspections demanded by the International Atomic Energy Agency to determine if Pyongyang diverted plutonium from its 5MW reactor in 1989 to build one or two nuclear devices. The disagreement over IAEA inspections triggered the nuclear dispute 15 months ago. North Korea has blocked complete IAEA inspections, possibly as a negotiating ploy to gain US diplomatic recognition. Mr Carter expressed his support for US diplomatic recognition of Pyongyang, while calling the threat of UN sanctions against North Korea 'counter-productive'. Mr Kim promised that two IAEA inspectors could remain at the North's nuclear complex at Yongbyon to verify that Pyongyang was not reprocessing and extracting plutonium from spent fuel rods recently removed from its 5MW reactor. The US had feared North Korea would use the absence of inspectors to reprocess the plutonium to build four or five nuclear devices. The US has refused to hold recent talks with North Korea until it accepted routine IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities. But it would appear under the Carter proposal that the US might agreed to discuss the IAEA inspection procedures as part of the negotiations with North Korea in return for Pyongyang stopping the clock on its nuclear programme. Government officials in Seoul expressed cautious optimism about Mr Carter's proposals. They had expressed concerned that North Korea was using the talks as another delaying tactic.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, May 30 (AFP) -- The constituent assembly  of the new Croat-Moslem federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina on  Monday approved Kresimir Zubak, a Croat, as its president for  the next six months. His appointment was counterbalanced with  the naming of Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic, a Moslem, to  the same office in the new federation.    Zubak, who has been the Croat leader since January when he  replaced the extreme nationalist Mate Boban, is untainted by  charges of ethnic cleansing against Moslems. A moderate, he was  chosen by Zagreb to put some order into Croat affairs in  Hercegovina and to make peace with the Moslems. Haris Silajdzic,  Bosnia's current prime minister, was nominated premier of the  new federal government. Croats will occupy six of the 17  ministerial posts: defence, finance, justice, trade, health and  one minister with no portfolio.    The new federal institutions will not replace the existing  ones of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, whose president  remains Alija Izetbegovic, as long as peace negotations with the  Bosnian Serbs continue.    The federation agreement was negotiated in March and April  in  Bonn, Vienna and Washington under the auspices of special U.S.  envoy for ex-Yugoslavia Charles Redman. The new federation is to  consist of cantons with a high degree of autonomy over  decisionmaking.</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / People: Shipping group recruits new helmsman David Cobb, 58, a naval architect, is to take the helm of James Fisher, the Cumbrian-based shipping group, which lost Pounds 5.6m pre-tax in its last financial year. He is expected to take over as full time chairman after the company's annual meeting this month. Fisher has been seeking a new chairman for several months following the departure of John Hornby, who is understood to have been forced out by shareholders unhappy with the company's performance. Charitable trusts own nearly half the company's equity and their income has been sharply reduced following the company's failure to pay a dividend. Cobb has been managing director of Cochranes of Selby, chairman of Rowbotham Tankships and was chief operating officer of Ingram International in the mid-1980s. He will move his home to Barrow.</p>

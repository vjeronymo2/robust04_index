			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Majors weigh India's alumina potential India, which has the world's fifth largest bauxite reserves, will be emerging as a significant supplier of alumina to the world, the international aluminium majors believe. Their faith in India can be seen in the recent conclusion of joint ventures formed with the local companies for mining bauxite and producing alumina for export. Impressed with the vastness and quality of Indian bauxite reserve, Alcoa of the US has chosen Larsen &amp; Toubro, India's largest engineering company, for a project aimed at producing and exporting 1m tonnes of alumina a year. Norsk Hydro of Norway will be working with Indian Aluminium, an associate of Alcan of Canada, and Tata Industries, part of India's largest industrial group, to build a 1m tonne export-oriented alumina plant. Both projects are located in Orissa which accounts for nearly half the country's bauxite reserve. Gujarat Alkalies &amp; Chemicals is talking to Kaiser Aluminium for technology for its proposed 500,000 tonne alumina project in the Kutch district of Gujarat. Kitply Industries, India's biggest producer of plywood, has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Madhya Pradesh Industrial Development Corporation to build a 1m tonne alumina project. Mr Goenka, chairman, said that Kitply was talking to some aluminium majors in the US and Europe about technology, equity participation and marketing assistance. At the same time the Andhra Pradesh Mineral Development Corporation, a state undertaking, is looking for a private sector partner to mine bauxite at Srikakulam-Vizianagaram belt and refine it into alumina. However, the lack of infrastructure and a growing extremist movement in the region may make the search for a partner difficult. RPG Enterprises, India's fourth largest business house, also wants to build an alumina plant. Meanwhile, Nalco is raising the alumina refining capacity of its existing plant to 1.35m tonnes from 900,000 tonnes. The company exports around 400,000 tonnes of alumina a year. Explaining the reasons for the growing interest of aluminium majors in alumina ventures in India, Mr Tapan Mitra, managing director of Indian Aluminium, said: 'We are the least costly producer of alumina in the world. The alumina production cost in our proposed export-oriented project is estimated at Dollars 80 a tonne, which is much lower than the world average cost.' While the 1m tonne Indian Aluminium project will cost Dollars 800m, a similar project elsewhere in the world will need an investment of at least Dollars 1bn, according to Mr RN Parbat, director. He points out that the foreign companies were particularly impressed that a major portion of proven Indian reserves of about 3bn tonnes of bauxite is of the Gibbsitic variety which allows refining at a low temperature and low pressure. It is found along India's Eastern Ghats running through Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yu.S. Matochkin, head of Russia's </F> Kaliningrad Oblast Administration, by Lyudmila Sherova of  POSTFACTUM; place and date not given: "Yuriy Matochkin: Our  Oblast Has a Special Status"]    [Text] Kaliningrad Oblast, separated by two borders from  the main territory of Russia, has recently moved substantially  closer to us. Its problems have been at the center of the  Russian authorities' attention. ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's  correspondent talked of this with Yuriy Matochkin, head of  Kaliningrad Oblast Administration.    [Sherova] Yuriy Semenovich, as far as is known, a treaty  between Kaliningrad Oblast and the federal government is  currently being prepared. Whose was the initiative, and will it  be comparable with the treaty signed with Tatarstan?    [Matochkin] It is a mutual initiative. The treaty is being  drawn up within the framework of the president's and the  government's decision. The treaty process began to develop  between the center and the components of the Federation after  the adoption of the new Constitution. The first such treaty was  signed with Tatarstan. The treaty with Kaliningrad Oblast is to  be the second. This is connected with the fact that we have  previously advanced proposals to grant the oblast a special  status, taking into account its position as an enclave.    Naturally, we do not wish to copy the treaty with Tatarstan.    [Sherova] Which of the center's powers would you like to  take over?    [Matochkin] Powers in respect of relations with neighboring  states: Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and others, i.e. with states  through which freight for Kaliningrad Oblast passes. Not all  the powers, of course; just sufficient to decide questions  promptly, not through Moscow.    [Sherova] Do you not have this opportunity now?    [Matochkin] At present we have been granted such rights only  in relations with Poland. By decision of the Russian Federation  Government I was appointed its plenipotentiary in implementing  the intergovernmental agreement with Poland. I act as Russia's  representative in talks with Poland on questions of cooperation  between Kaliningrad Oblast and Polish voivodships.    In addition, we would like independently to resolve  questions  connected with land use and ownership. We intend to include the  following conditions in the treaty with the federal authorities:  If the Ministry of Defense disbands some unit, the property must  be transferred to the oblast, and if the Ministry of Defense  decides to send in additional troops, this question must be  agreed with the oblast authorities.    [Sherova] Russian territories now are frequently divided  into subsidized and profitable territories. Which is your  oblast?    [Matochkin] The oblast is said to have become a subsidized  one, but it depends on how you calculate it. Here it is  necessary to link the territory's significance from the  viewpoint of its strategic position in Russia to the load that  the oblast bears from the Ministry of Defense. For example,  there are now 130,000 retired servicemen standing in line for  apartments in Russia, including 17,500 in Kaliningrad Oblast.  At the same time Kaliningrad Oblast amounts to less than 1  percent of Russia in terms of area, population, and industrial  potential.    [Sherova] To return to subsidies, does this mean that the  taxes that are collected on the oblast's territory are  insufficient for its needs?    [Matochkin] They would be sufficient for us if we did not  transfer some of the taxes to the center. They take 35 percent  away from us. In working on the treaty we plan to write into it  our right not to surrender taxes to the center for five years  but to leave them for the oblast's development.    We have now begun talks with the Ministry of Finance on the  conclusion of a treaty for credit to the tune of 150 billion  rubles. This is roughly the amount that, taking possible  inflation into account, we will have to transfer to the center  in 1994. In addition, we would like to keep the customs duties  which today all go to the center.    [Sherova] Do you have any problems with the inviolability of  borders?    [Matochkin] Our borders are violable; only the border with  Poland is guarded according to the old Soviet system, and so it  is reliable. There is a full system of border security  installations there [inzhenernaya systema]. As for the border  with Lithuania, it virtually does not exist. Today our border  troops guard administrative points on the border between  Kaliningrad Oblast and the Lithuanian Republic. Talks  concerning the border are under way, but that is all. I am not  in favor of fully equipping the border, and we do not have the  money for this. It is necessary to set up checkpoints on the  traditional traffic routes and conduct inspections. Endeavors  must be made to create civilized European borders.    [Sherova] Yuriy Semenovich, you are now a senator. What  interests you most of all in the Federation Council?    [Matochkin] For me everything connected with Kaliningrad  Oblast is important: the budget, relations with the Ministry of  Defense and with our neighbors. As for the Baltic countries, I  believe that the Federation Council must adopt the text of a  statement on the formulation of a special economic policy in  respect of the Baltic countries, with due regard for the  interests of Russia and Kaliningrad Oblast. Such a policy does  not yet exist today.</p>

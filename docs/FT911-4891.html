			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE JUNE FT-SE futures contract made one last futile attempt yesterday at testing 2,600 before the weight of sellers proved too much and it slumped back below 2,550. A surprisingly strong overnight close on Wall Street initially left floor traders on the London International Financial Futures Exchange short and prices were marked higher with June FT-SE hitting 2,592 at one stage. But a sell note from UBS Phillips and Drew encouraged a bout of profit taking and, with little support from the cash market, equity futures quickly gave up their gains, dragging the stock market lower in the process. At one stage June FT-SE was trading just 20 points above the spot index, compared with the 30 point premium which brokers' calculate is necessary to take account of future dividend payments and the cost of finance. June FT-SE closed at 2,549, down 27. In after hours dealing it slipped to 2,542. Hanson puts were bought and calls sold as investors who had taken up the Pounds 500m bond issue hedged themselves. Speculation that Hanson may use the extra cash to bid for either Pilkington or Trafalgar House triggered busy trade in their options. Cadbury Schweppes was lifted by selling of August 420 calls and buying of 390 puts.</p>

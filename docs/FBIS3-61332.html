The supplies have "melted away" considerably  more rapidly and in larger volumes than was anticipated,  according to calculations of specialists. And it was not  possible to restore them fully by January.    Nonetheless, as they think in the Ministry of Fuel and  Energy  of Russia, through the combined efforts of miners and operations  workers the situation is stabilizing to a certain degree. Active  work is being done to conclude agreements for the delivery of  fuel during the first quarter and throughout the year as a whole.    At the same time the administrations of many regions are  trying to solve these problems by old administrative-economic  methods, particularly by prohibiting the shipment of petroleum  products outside their territories and also by exporting fuel  that was intended, according to paid agreements, for other  regions of the country. And this is being done under the guise  of concern for "their own" residents and enterprises.    The roots of this practice lie, apparently, in the recent  past when the state granted all regions special-purpose credit  for purchasing fuel and preparing for winter. But at that time,  obviously, they counted on spending it more advantageously for  other purposes, above all for things that produce a rapid return  on capital and considerable profit. Or they simply left the  matter to its own accord, hoping that the government would not  allow the cities and large industrial enterprises to freeze.  According to figures of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, a  total of more than 200 billion rubles [R] was not used to pay  for fuel--about 40 percent of the credit allotted.    Thus according to information from the Komineft Joint-Stock  Company, of the R8 billion in loans allotted in November of last  year to the government of the Republic of Komi to settle  accounts with suppliers of petroleum products and coal and for  additional purchases of energy resources, the republic petroleum  industry has not yet received a single ruble. Nobody knows where  and to whom this money went. And petroleum workers of the region  are now on the verge of financial ruin: they have no money  either for wages or for settling accounts with the suppliers or  for payments into the budget. In the final analysis, all this  threatens to shut down wells, suspend deliveries of oil for  processing, and orient the enterprises toward selling it to  commercial structures.    And what is especially alarming is that such a situation is  not an exception, the ITAR-TASS correspondent emphasizes, but  rather the rule. The consumers prefer not to pay for energy  resources and, taking advantage of the fact that the enterprises  cannot stop the continuous process of extraction, they are  forced to turn over their products practically free of charge.  In the opinion of the leaders of the fuel and energy complex, in  such a situation it is necessary to use not so much economic  methods but methods of state pressure on the structures that are  impeding the arrangement of normal market relations.</p>

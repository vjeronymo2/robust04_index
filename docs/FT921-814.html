			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Burmah Castrol Yesterday's 8.5 per cent jump in Burmah Castrol's shares tended to obscure the fact that the market was rather vexed at the group's annual results. Six months ago, Burmah was determinedly talking down expectations. Investors were only too willing to listen, not least because the takeover of Foseco in late 1990, while grudgingly accepted in strategic terms, was looking ill-timed as its traditional markets were hit by recession. In the event, Foseco had a resilient second half. The Pounds 44m sale this week of its ceramics and abrasives business eased worries that Burmah would be left warehousing a set of rapidly diminishing assets. Castrol managed a record year despite lower worldwide demand for lubricants, confirming Burmah's ability to make the most of the brand. And the company has continued to sharpen its focus, notably by putting its numerous oil and gas interests in Pakistan up for sale. The question is whether the re-rating should go further. There are grounds for caution in the short term. The group has an unenviable tax problem and, treating its convertible as debt, gearing of 64 per cent. But even after yesterday's adjustment, the shares are on an undemanding prospective multiple of 11. If Burmah performs as well in recovery as it has in recession, its shares will deserve a premium rating. Investors tempted to buy will doubtless concede the sense of doing so sooner rather than later.</p>

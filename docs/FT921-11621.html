			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Bethlehem Steel to shed 6,500 jobs in restructuring BETHLEHEM STEEL, the second largest steel producer in the US, yesterday announced a restructuring to stem its losses, including a 24.5 per cent cut in its labour force, the sale or closure of several businesses and the omission of its quarterly 10 cent-a-share dividend. The package means a Dollars 575m (Pounds 318.6m) charge against fourth-quarter earnings, producing a net loss of Dollars 638m. The moves will cut jobs by 6,500 to around 20,000 over the next two years. Bethlehem, which two months ago abandoned plans for a joint structural steel venture with British Steel, has already experienced years of restructuring, and after pulling back from near bankruptcy in 1986 it become one of the US's most successful integrated steel manufacturers. However, it has long acknowledged that it requires several more years of reshaping to be fully profitable, and the need for action has been intensified by the current US recession. Weak demand for steel products has hit all the integrated companies hard, as has intensifying competition from low-cost mini-mills, which have been taking an increasing share of the market for less sophisticated products. Yesterday's plan includes selling as a whole or in parts Bethlehem's division making bar, rod and wire - a market now dominated by mini-mills and low priced imports. Bethlehem had been discussing a possible modernisation of the loss-making division, which employs 2,600, with the United Steelworkers' union (USW) for more than a year. But the two sides failed to agree on a new labour pact and Bethlehem said its deteriorating finances now made modernisation out of the question. It will also sell or close its loss-making railway track switch plant and put up for auction its coke-making operations at Lackawanna, in New York state, which it said was complementary to its recently announced plan to sell most of its coal operations. Bethlehem's Dollars 638m loss for the quarter, which worked through at Dollars 8.47 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 515.8m, or Dollars 6.91 a share, in the same period of last year, when it took a Dollars 550m charge in connection with the British Steel venture. Sales dipped from Dollars 1.2bn to Dollars 1.03bn. For the full year it lost Dollars 767m, against Dollars 464m.</p>

The proposed penalties include life imprisonment or a death  sentence for "snake heads," as the mercenaries engaged in the  traffic have been dubbed.    The members of the standing committee of the Eighth National  People's Congress (NPC) were today deliberating a draft  supplementary decision on the punishment of organizers of  illegal emigration and border crossing.    The lawmakers said the draft decision is ready to be  promulgated in the current fifth session of the NPC Standing  Committee.    Such a decision is expected to help the country in combating  illegal emigration and border crossing, to maintain border order  and protect the legitimate rights of Overseas Chinese, according  to the lawmakers.    The draft said that snake-heads could face life imprisonment  or the death penalty if they committed other serious crimes  against emigrants they organized.    Lin Liyun, member of the NPC Standing Committee, said that  some snake-heads become involved in crimes of violence, murder,  drug trafficking and selling human beings.    "Life of overseas Chinese are disturbed by the crimes and  their legitimate rights infringed upon because of the  influence," Lin said.    Member of the NPC Standing Committee Cai Cheng said the  decision was necessary to curb the illegal border crossing and  illegal emigration along China's vast border areas, and is  conducive to stability in border areas and the nation's security.</p>

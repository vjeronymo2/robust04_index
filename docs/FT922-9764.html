			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Bonds: Citicorp turns to dollar floating-rate note sector THE SUPINE body of the dollar floating-rate note market gave another twitch yesterday as Citicorp became the second US bank holding company this year to raise funds - a clear sign, according to some, that the market was coming back to life. Citicorp itself, coming on the heels of BankAmerica in February, had not been to the market for five years. Indeed, it had not been to any public debt market for five years, thanks to the credit concerns that had hit the US banking sector in general, and Citicorp (which has an A2 rating from Moody's) in particular. The signs of a recovery in the US banking sector, though, have brought the banks back to the public markets, with Citicorp this year already having raised Dollars 150m through a domestic subordinated debt issue and Dollars 175m in preference share capital. It's arrival yesterday in the Euromarkets signalled a further return to acceptability in the eyes of the investing public, with the  7/8 percentage point spread over Libor offered on its two-year, Dollars 150m deal generally regarded as fair. At that level, Citicorp offers a higher yield pick-up than BankAmerica's Dollars 200m issue earlier this year. That five-year transaction came with a 50 basis point spread over 3-month Libor, a level at which it is still trading, though BankAmerica is considered a more attractive name in the market. Despite Citicorp's disappearance from the public market, it has maintained an almost permanent presence in the medium-term note market. Its reason now for going public: the tighter yield spread, thanks to the perceived marketability of a public issue (though much of the two-year paper is expected to be locked up until maturity by investors looking for the higher yield). According to one estimate, it would have had to pay 95-100 basis points over Libor by issuing MTNs. Despite the favourable reaction to Citicorp yesterday, though, it will take rather longer for the floating-rate note market to be declared fully open once again to US banks. A floater of a different kind emerged yesterday from HMC, the UK mortgage lender. Its Pounds 140m asset-backed issue is only the second this year from a UK mortgage company, thanks to the depressed state of the housing market. At a spread of 58 basis points over Libor for investors, the HMC deal - expected to get a AAA rating, thanks to the structured nature of the transaction - was also considered fairly priced and was said to have met firm demand from UK and continental European investors. The Republic of Turkey is set to come to the international bond market later this week with its first Ecu transaction, led by Paribas Capital Markets. The Ecu150m, three-year deal is expected to offer a spread of 180-200 basis points over Libor when swapped.</p>

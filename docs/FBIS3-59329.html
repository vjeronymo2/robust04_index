There is a proper set of  procedure to follow, and there are strict rules and requirements  at every step. For this reason, ZHONGGUO JINGJI TIZHI GAIGE sent  a reporter to interview Sun Xiaoliang, general manager of China  Enterprise Shareholding System Consulting Company. He explained  the method and procedure for converting enterprises into  shareholding companies in simple layman's terms based on his own  practical experience and according to current laws and  regulations. His approach not only complies with government  policies but is also workable. It is hoped that this article  can be of help to those who want to restructure their  enterprises according to the shareholding system and those who  are interested in the subject.    In a recent interview, Sun Xiaoliang, general manager of  China Enterprise Shareholding System Consulting Company, talked  about his own ideas and suggestions on how to convert  state-owned enterprises into listed shareholding companies.    Sun said, since Comrade Xiaoping's Southern tour speech,  comrades from many localities, departments, and enterprises have  gone to his firm asking how they could restructure state-run  enterprises into listed shareholding companies. He said, since  the founding of the China Consulting Company, more than a dozen  enterprises have sought its services. Among them were companies  that intended to list their securities in the Hong Kong and  Shanghai exchanges, and there were also companies that wanted to  be listed in Beijing's two corporate shares circulation systems.  Based on these practical experiences and in accordance with the  relevant laws and regulations, to convert a state-run enterprise  into a listed company, essentially, one must follow five major  steps:    One, the enterprise must submit an application and get  permission to set up a shareholding system experimental  point.    In this step, the enterprise must consider four things:  First, what form of shareholding system should it choose?  Second, what are the expected benefits? Third, what are the  anticipated problems? Fourth, what are the possible risks?    There are two choices under the shareholding system--limited  liability companies and corporations. When choosing the  corporate format, one must decide whether to raise capital  privately or go public, and in the former case, one must also  decide whether to list the securities in the corporate share  circulation system. Which format best suits the company will  depend on what is practical and realistic. One must start out  from practicality and consider the possible benefits as well as  the risks. The risks referred to here may come from three areas:  1) Investment risks. Some enterprises do well and others do not;  stock prices go up and down, and therefore, when buying stocks,  some people make money, others lose money. This kind of risk is  borne mostly by the investors. 2) Listing risks. Some listed  companies are successful; others fail. Listed companies must be  prepared to take the risk of failing in the market.  3) Risk of market collapse. This is an inevitable result of the  stock market's bubble economy. When stock prices soar as a  result of speculation, it is like a bubble that must eventually  burst. Stock market disaster can cause serious social problems,  and one must be prepared to take such risks.    When the government department considers approving an  application to set up an experimental point, it must consider at  least five things: 1) Does the application meet the state's  industrial policy requirements? Enterprises that meet the  state's industrial policy requirements have a better chance of  being approved. 2) Is the applicant enterprise in a business  approved by the state to implement the shareholding system? For  example, enterprises in the banking industry and those in  businesses pertaining to state secrets are not permitted to go  public and implement the shareholding system. 3) Are the  applicant enterprise's construction projects part of a state  plan? 4) Is the enterprise qualified to and capable of making  its own management decisions? For example, if many of the  enterprise's products are under mandatory state plans or are  required to accept unified state-set prices, its chances of  getting approval are slim. 5) Can its stock generate a rate of  return comparable to other stocks? Stocks yielding too low a  rate of return will not qualify.    Sun Xiaoliang pointed out that, for now, after this first  step is approved, the enterprise must still get a stock issuing  quota which the state allocates to individual provinces  (municipalities). This is necessary at this stage so that the  state can control the number of stocks being listed.    Two, the enterprise must formulate and seek approval  for an overall program to convert to the shareholding  system.    The overall program for conversion must clearly explain five  points: 1) The purpose of converting to the shareholding system.  That is, what kinds of enterprise development problems can  converting to the shareholding system solve? Such problems must  be real, and the explanation must be convincing enough to move  "God"--so convincing that the department in charge feels obliged  to give its approval. 2) The feasibility of converting to the  shareholding system. There are two important points: Will there  be an attractive profit to investment ratio to give the  investors a convincing return on their investments? Will the  state get even more taxes and dividends from the enterprise  after it converts to the shareholding system? 3) Plans for  restructuring the assets. The key lies in reducing related  transactions, increasing the profit rate, and getting rid of  assets which should not be brought into the shareholding  company. 4) Plans for issuing shares, including the total amount  of capital stock, equity structure, method of issuance, and  listing location and so on. 5) It must get instructions on  specific issues, such as who represents the state's equity  rights, how to deal with the enterprise's share of mandatory  plans, how to coordinate government-controlled prices, how to  adjust its tax rates, and so on. There are more than a dozen  questions, and since situations vary among different  enterprises, there are different ways to deal with them  accordingly.    Sun Xiaoliang said that this step is the most troublesome  and  most complicated. To successfully get through this phase, he  suggested paying attention to the following 12 points: 1)  Reexamine the enterprise's development program. The  capital-raising scope should be based on need, and the  enterprise should formulate its development plan based on the  best rate of return on capital and make that the basis for  determining the number of shares to be issued. 2) Sort out and  define the property rights. This step is even more complicated  for enterprises in the ownership-by-the-whole-people system. 3)  Examine its major contracts and credits and debts. 4) Examine  plans for implementing the restructuring of company assets. 5)  Readjust the previous year's profit to investment ratio and next  year's profit to share capital ratio using the accounting system  of a shareholding company. 6) Study ways to handle the state's  mandatory plan and state-set prices. 7) Study the feasibility  and method of adjusting the enterprise tax policy. 8) Study its  land-use rights and method of using that as an input under the  shareholding system. 9) Study ways to resolve the issue of  paying for the on-leave and retired workers' living expenses.  10) Clarify the state's representation with respect to equity  rights. 11) Study ways to take responsibility for the profits  and losses with regard to non-productive assets. 12) Study and  designate a promoter and sign a promoter's agreement. Sun  believes that the above tasks are very specific and very  practical, but if they are done properly, the conversion plan  should be quite simple.    Step three is for the enterprise to apply for and  receive permission to form a shareholding company.    There are eight pieces of documents to be submitted when  applying to form a listed company: 1) Application to form a  shareholding company. 2) The promoter's agreement. 3) The  feasibility report. 4) A draft of the company charter. 5) The  property appraisal report. 6) The asset verification report. 7)  The prospectus. 8) The industry management department's review.  Before submitting the application form, the enterprise should do  two things: First, convene a promoter's meeting and submit an  incorporation resolution. Second, choose the law firm,  accounting firm, property appraiser, and stock underwriter.  After making the selections and commencing work, each can then  do its part to prepare the documents accordingly.    Step four is to propose and obtain permission to issue  shares after its application to incorporate has been  approved.    When applying for permission to issue stocks, 12 pieces of  documents are required. They are to be prepared by the lawyer,  accountant, appraiser, and the stock underwriter, respectively.  For example, the prospectus should be prepared by the  underwriter; the accounting report should be prepared by the  accountant, and the property appraisal should be prepared by the  appraiser. The enterprise must facilitate their work and  regularly check their progress. In addition, it should set an  agenda for listing the securities. This should be coordinated  by the underwriter who should set the daily work schedule and  completion time and hold meetings to coordinate all tasks.    Step five is for the enterprise to seek permission to  list its securities at the exchange.    The enterprise should apply for listing at the stock  exchange  of its choice (currently, the choice is between Shanghai and  Shenzhen). After applying for and receiving permission from the  stock exchange, it may proceed to issue shares. When all shares  are successfully issued and the share capital collected in full,  it can then convene a shareholder's meeting to set up the  company. It must register with the local industry and business  management department within the stipulated time. At that point,  the conversion of the state-run enterprise into a listed company  is complete.    Sun Xiaoliang warns all entrepreneurs that the  reorganization  of enterprises under the shareholding system is a very  complicated and stringent process. In the above-described five  steps, it is easy to discern that if an enterprise wants to reap  the benefits of a listed company, it must pay a price. Recently  nine large state-run enterprises began making preparations to  list their securities in Hong Kong and had to go through a very  stringent auditing process and disclose every aspect of their  businesses. The procedure was so complicated and the  requirements so stringent that many were shocked. Thus, any  enterprise thinking about listing its securities in the market  should be mentally prepared.</p>

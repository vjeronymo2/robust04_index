			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ewa Stenberg: "Christian Democrats Heading </F> Toward 30th Anniversary Crisis"]    [Text] Now that the Christian Democratic Party (KDS) has  grown up and become established it is time for its 30th  anniversary crisis. When the party celebrates its anniversary  tomorrow, it will be a profile-seeking group that gathers for  the festivities.    The Christian Democrats' 30th anniversary crisis is not that  different from those of other 30-year-olds. After being in the  opposition and refusing to conform to established patterns, they  are now quite settled, generally accepted, and more conservative  than they were shortly after they began their career climb and  are beginning to consider what the cost has been. Has the color  faded and the soul gone out of the party?    For the KDS the crisis has been striking. From being an  antiestablishment opposition party that refused to conform to  the bloc system and asserted its own Christian dimension in  politics, the KDS has become an established and responsible  government party.  <H5>  Silence Not Good </H5>   "The KDS may have paid a little too much attention to  stability and a good climate of cooperation in the government.  The strategy of silence is not a political strategy, we will win  no elections on that basis," said Riksdag member Ingvar  Svensson, KDS party strategist and a member of the party's  executive committee for 28 years.    "We should have sat in the Riksdag for three or four years  before we entered a government coalition. That would have  enabled the voters to see our policies for a period of time  before we were forced to make all these compromises," said Nina  Ekelund, who is vice chairman of the Christian Democratic Youth  League, KDU, and a cabinet office adviser.    But the party's low profile was in part its own choice. To  entice many general nonsocialist voters, the KDS needs to tone  down its Christian profile -- cut the pious veneer, as Svensson  put it. But when the party does this and wins the support of  general nonsocialists voters, those who form the party's hard  core do not really feel at home.    The KDS is also criticized by member groups that are  attracted by the radical aspects of the party's message on  solidarity with weaker and impoverished countries, trusteeship,  and a good environment.    Ekelund belongs to this group, and it disturbs her that the  KDS is increasingly toning down its radical profile to maximize  the number of votes it gets from general nonsocialist voters.    "The KDS should stress the party's environmental and  distribution policies as well as equality between women and men.  We should be able to pursue the demand for a state policy on  equal wages for women and men, for example," Ekelund said.  <H5>  Ethics and Morality </H5>   The KDS started out as a party of conservative values, and  its political core is the defense of the family and Christian  ethics and morality. In addition to this core the party acquired  a radical economic policy and an environmental policy in the  1970's and early 1980's.    Since the mid-1980's the party has changed course and moved  to the right. The altered course was confirmed by the change of  the party's name to the Christian Democratic Social Party in  1987.    DN [DAGENS NYHETER] has compared the 1984 party program with  the current one. The difference is clear. In the 1984 program,  the KDS advocated joint rule and repudiated a right-left  political scale. The party supported alcohol rationing and  opposed abortion on demand. Now the KDS is part of a  nonsocialist government that supports unrestricted abortion  rights and has dropped the demand for alcohol rationing.    There was a much stronger emphasis on Christianity in the  1984 program, and the economic policy was entirely different  from the policy the KDS pursues now.    Today the KDS's economic policy is characterized by a strong  belief in a market economy, deregulation, and privatization. Ten  years ago the program advocated a mixed economy and state  regulation.    KDS has also changed its view on the existence or  nonexistence of the state church. One more example of the  party's altered view of the state.    According to political scientist Olof Wennas, writing in the  most recent issue of KRISTDEMOKRATISK DEBATT, the KDS is in a  period of ideological upheaval.    "Equality and solidarity do not have the same place in the  new program of principle as they did in the previous one, nor  does the concept of brotherhood. Criticism is aimed at socialism  and liberalism, but not at conservatism and individualism.  Several of the fundamental ideas of classic conservatism have  been included, for example the concept of making haste slowly,"  Wennas wrote.</p>

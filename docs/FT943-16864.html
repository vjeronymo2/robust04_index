			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Bhutto in missile warning India's plans to deploy a medium-range missile system with its armed forces threatens to trigger a regional arms race in southern Asia, Ms Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's prime minister, warned in Dublin yesterday. On a three-day official visit, she said Pakistan has shown 'tremendous restraint' by not responding in kind to India's testing of a nuclear weapon and the successful test-firing of its Prithvi missile system. 'We have not detonated a (nuclear) device, although India has detonated a device. We have shown tremendous restraint.' But the increase in India's defence budget and its recent decision to deploy the Prithvi missile system with its artillery corps have been 'highly provocative, (and) threatens to trigger a missile race in the sub-continent'. The Prithvi is believed capable of carrying a nuclear warhead up to 250km.</p>

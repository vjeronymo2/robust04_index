			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> HEATHER FARR FACES FURTHER TREATMENT AS CANCER RECURS  </P> <P> Heather Farr, who made a comeback on the LPGA Tour this year after breast  cancer surgery in 1989, has had a recurrence of the disease and will undergo  chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant.  </P> <P> "My breast cancer has returned inside the bone," Farr, 25, said today.  </P> <P> "There is a spot in the back of my skull and a spot in a back vertebrae."  </P> <P> The former Arizona State standout was coming off her most successful year on  the LPGA Tour when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in July, 1989, and  underwent a mastectomy.  </P> <P> After a series of chemotherapy treatments, Farr received a clean bill of health  this summer and was looking forward to rejoining the tour.  </P> <P> But Farr said she had to stop golfing in November due to a pain in her back and  now finds that even common chores are becoming difficult.  </P> <P> Farr's problems are not limited to the stress of fighting cancer. She said her  medical insurance dropped her this fall and she does not know how she will pay  for her operation, estimated by her doctors to cost between $150,000 and  $200,000.  </P> <P> She will begin chemotherapy probably next week at the Cedars-Sinai Medical  Center in Los Angeles for about six weeks.  </P></p>

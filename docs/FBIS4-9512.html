Three of them were described as failures due to flaws in  security measures. The report that the State Office for Nuclear  Safety drafted for the government states that the emergency  signaling systems were activated 12 times in 1993. Despite this,  the State Office for Nuclear Safety considers the operation of  the Dukovany nuclear plant to be safe and reliable.</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> ROSTER SHOULD KEEP THEM GUESSING  </P> <P> The Raiders have some important roster decisions to make before Sunday's key  divisional game against Kansas City, but they seem willing to keep the Chiefs  guessing until the last minute.  </P> <P> Eligible to return from injured reserve are cornerback Garry Lewis (collarbone  injury), tight end Mike Dyal (hamstring injury) and tackle Bruce Wilkerson  (knee injury).  </P> <P> Will they or won't they play?  </P> <P> Only Raider Coach Art Shell knows for sure.  </P> <P> Lewis, the starting left cornerback, seems the surest bet to face the Chiefs.  "There's a good chance he'll be on the roster," Shell said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Wilkerson? "He's looking pretty good; he's feeling much better," Shell offered.  "There's a chance he may be on the roster."  </P> <P> Dyal? "We're not sure right now."  </P> <P> The Raiders are also fairly sure that defensive end Mike Wise will return this  week from an ankle sprain. CHRIS DUFRESNE  </P></p>

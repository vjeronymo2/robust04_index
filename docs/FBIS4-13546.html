			<p>BFN     [Text] During the opening ceremony of the Great Hajj  Congress-73 [1373, Iranian year beginning 21 March] held this  afternoon at the Immaculate Mausoleum of the founder of the  Islamic Republic of Iran, Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin  Reyshahri, the representative of the Supreme Jurisconsult, and  the supervisor of the Iranian pilgrims to the House of God,  spoke on the programs of the congress and the policies of the  government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, in that respect.    Also, in continuation of the congress, Hojjat ol-Eslam val-  Moslemin Haj Seyyed Ahmad Khomeyni, made some remarks saying:  The Abrahamite Hajj is the cry of the oppressed Muslims against  the arrogants of the world. Hajj is also a rallying point for  the resolution of problems and strengthening of brotherhood  among Muslims. If Muslims had truly trodden the path of unity  and equality, today Muslims of the Middle East would not have  succumbed to the superpowers to such an extent.    At the conclusion of the congress a statement was read out  in  which the silence of the so-called human rights organizations  was condemned. The statement says: We, the participants of the  Great Hajj Congress, announce our sympathy and solidarity with  the oppressed Muslim nation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and condemn  the deceitful silence of the UN Security Council and the actual  collusion of the UN secretary general, and say yes to the call  of the Guardian of the Cause of the world Muslims and announce  our readiness for any kind of assistance, including jihad in the  field of that unequal battle, and call on Islamic nations to  make their cries heard by the world and turn their decisiveness  in the holy arena of hajj into a hammer to smash arrogance,  polytheism, and belief in polytheism.</p>

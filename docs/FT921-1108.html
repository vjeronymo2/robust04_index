			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Reviving Argentina's entrepreneurial spirit:  A dearth of energetic venture capitalists after decades of stifling over-regulation TO WORK, capitalism needs capitalists. But in Argentina, struggling to establish a market economy, the entrepreneurial spirit burns low. In less than three years, President Carlos Menem has reversed the protectionism, statism and over-regulation that strangled Argentina for six decades. After slashing the public sector and establishing the rudiments of a free market, the 'new Argentina' that he and energetic economy minister Domingo Cavallo want to build will increasingly depend on its capitalists. While companies are not happy about facing foreign competition and losing government support, Mr Cavallo has given them a juicy carrot - privatisations. They are buying up the assets they helped build as government contractors. Techint, a big family-owned industrial group active in privatisations, has been forced to practically split in two. 'The old guard will handle traditional business in the traditional way. New business will be handled by younger people not contaminated by the old way,' says a Techint executive. All companies are grappling with similar changes, but not all will be successful. Describing Perez Companc , a big family-held diversified company, equity analyst Christopher Ecclestone, said: 'Perez Companc is a mess. The unwinding of the tangled structure to release value is 10 years away if it will ever happen.' A senior international banker added: 'I don't think that more than half Argentina's big companies will be around in a few years' time.' Nearly all Argentina's companies are family-held. To grow, they must raise equity capital - long term loans hardly exist - and infuse management with new blood. But often this is strongly resisted, because owners fear losing control and becoming accountable to outsiders. Furthermore, Mr Eduardo Sguiglia, a sociologist who has studied Argentina's biggest companies, says few owners show great innovative zest. Like many others, he is worried that the free market environment is allowing a few big companies to become too powerful. He criticises the government for not enforcing anti-trust legislation. Mr Cavallo says Argentina needs strong groups to survive in international markets. He is relying on imports and utility regulators to check their power. But Argentine bureaucrats have shown themselves notoriously inefficient and prone to corruption, and not all companies are in businesses subject to international competition. For the time being, companies are keeping busy with privatisations. The government is selling all its enterprises, utilities and railways this year, and every company that can is making bids with foreign investors. But the most dramatic change could come from smaller, more responsive companies that have already restructured. One such company is SICA, a small family-owned electrical goods company. It has tripled its investment budget to Dollars 1.5m in three years as sales have boomed. However, its vice-president, Mr Cesar Wengrower, complains that 'we need capital to grow, but there are no long-term loans'. Wealth is heavily concentrated. Mr Ecclestone says 'the holders of capital are lazy. They do not want the risk of becoming venture capitalists. It is a rentier mentality; they want to be aristocrats. This outlook is dragging companies down.' Argentine industrialists are demanding an industrial policy, a euphemism for subsidies, import controls, devaluation and less taxation. Mr Cavallo is resisting demands that would mean the end of reform. Undeterred, foreign investors are hunting for opportunities. They are attracted by strong economic growth forecasts, the scope for raising profits by improving the productivity of underperforming assets, and Argentina's well-educated work force and relatively sophisticated management. Executives who fled the upheavals of the 1970s and 1980s are trickling back from Europe and the US. Capital markets are being reformed and have already expanded rapidly. They could grow even faster if about Dollars 50bn in offshore capital were repatriated. But only a small part of this flight capital has returned - mostly to the stock market, which boomed in 1991. Apart from privatisations, there have been few large industrial investments. A leading US business consultant with years of experience in Latin America believes Argentina's greatest limitation is lack of ambition. 'To really grow, they have to be competitive, entrepreneurial, aggressive. But the average Argentine is kind of middle class, who just wants to be an employee.' He argues that except for low value-added primary industries, Argentina has few obvious sources of wealth and manufacturing industry lacks economies of scale. However, stability and free markets may unleash pent-up creative energies. In the early decades of this century, Argentina was one of the wealthiest nations on earth; it had vibrant, energetic entrepreneurs. But they were stifled by the great depression and the decades of chaotic statism that followed. Perhaps their spirit can still be revived.</p>

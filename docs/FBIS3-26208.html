While  inspecting Zhuhai, Li Peng said that in the surging tide of  reform and opening up, Zhuhai's construction had been  successful, and Zhuhai's experience should be spread to the  whole country and should be learned from by other parts of the  country. It was learned that Li Peng also instructed Zhuhai to  quicken the development of Hengqing Dao, and called the island a  piece of treasured land. Li Peng also gave important  instructions on the construction of primary and secondary  borderlines and other important basic projects in Zhuhai. In  addition, Yang Rudai, vice chairman of the National Committee of  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC],  and Hu Ping, director of the State Council's Special Economic  Zone Affairs Office, also inspected Zhuhai recently.    Li Peng arrived in Zhuhai on 29 January. During his stay in  Zhuhai, Li Peng listened to work reports by Zhuhai Mayor Liang  Guangda, who is also secretary of the city party committee, and  he also inspected Zhuhai's western district and some enterprises  and projects in the city in the company of Liang and other  Guangdong officials.    It was learned that when inspecting Zhuhai, Li Peng said  that  in the surging tide of reform and opening, Zhuhai's construction  had been successful, and its experience should be introduced and  disseminated to all parts of the country. Li Peng expressed  satisfaction and appreciation for the achievements made by  Zhuhai in its economic construction in the last few years.    Reportedly, Li Peng called for quickening the development of  Hengqing Dao, saying that the island is a very special piece of  treasured land and should be properly developed as soon as  possible.    According to sources, Li Peng also affirmed the border  management policy of "relaxing control on the primary line and  tightening control on the secondary line," and instructed Zhuhai  to continue to run the special economic zone well, thus playing  an exemplary role for the people of the whole country.    In addition, Yang Rudai, vice chairman of the CPPCC National  Committee, and Hu Ping, director of the State Council's Special  Economic Zone Affairs Office, also inspected Zhuhai separately  on Monday [31 January] and Tuesday [1 February] of this week.  Yang Rudai said that Zhuhai had raised construction funds  through its land, and wasted hills have been transformed into  treasured land. More land is being prepared in the course of  development. Thus, Zhuhai has turned itself into an  economically prosperous and beautiful city without needing any  money allocated by the state. It has gained some very  successful experience and has painted a good picture. It is  hoped that Zhuhai will become "China's Singapore."    After inspecting Zhuhai, Hu Ping also said that the special  economic zones should still be special and should create a  special microclimate to heat up their economies. In the course  of reform and opening and in the process of developing the  socialist market economy, the special economic zones should play  a leading role. Hu Ping inspected Yazhou Fangzhen Company, a  biochemical pharmaceutical factory, a shopping center, some  duty-free shops, and some large construction projects in the  western district of the city.</p>

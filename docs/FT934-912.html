			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Closing the yawning gap in seasonal generosity Sir, Your Observer column, under the headline 'Changing places' (December 20), kindly made note of Chase's unprecedented seasonal gesture of an extra day's holiday and Dollars 300 for all 34,000 staff worldwide. However, comparing this generosity with that of the recent Goldman Sachs bonuses is a slight case of apples and oranges. Chase's 'thank you' for a remarkable year is, in fact, in addition to the performance-related bonuses the bank will be paying at all levels. If this really is, as you said, a 'symbol of the yawning gap between commercial and investment banks' then reaction to it here certainly suggests it is one that the investment banks might well consider closing. Stewart Prosser, corporate communications manager, The Chase Manhattan Bank, Woolgate House, Coleman Street, London EC2P 2HD</p>

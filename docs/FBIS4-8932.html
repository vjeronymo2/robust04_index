			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bruno Francheschi: "Governor of National Bank of </F> Bosnia-Herzegovina Predicts: After War--Convertible Bosnian  Dinar"]    [Text] Sarajevo--The governor of the National Bank of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kasim Omicevic, expressed his hope that the  recovery of the country's economy, with the help of the  international community, will make it possible to create a  strong and convertible dinar.    But for now the central bank is just a plan--the National  Bank of Bosnia-Herzegovina lacks the means to influence the  financial reality of the country. It has contented itself with  printing up coupons for Sarajevo on poor-quality paper, the  value of which, in theory, is equal to the Bosnian dinar. This  new Bosnian dinar, printed in April 1992, shortly after  Bosnia-Herzegovina gained independence, has never actually  circulated in Sarajevo because of the siege by Bosnian Serb  forces.    In an interview with a journalist from FRANCE PRESSE,  Governor Omicevic says, "We have given a lot of thought to the  banking system that we will establish after the war. It will be  set up on criteria common to Western Europe and criteria  recommended by the International Monetary Fund. Our banking  system will follow the economy closely on the basis of the  principles of free enterprise, while in reality we will  continually save for democracy, because that was our basic  motivation in signing the new federal constitution for  Bosnia-Herzegovina."    Present-day reality is completely different, he admits: The  black market is flourishing, and all transactions are conducted  in German marks [DM]. "We cannot eliminate that type of market  through an ordinary administrative decision. For now, the black  market is the market," says Omicevic.    A strong and convertible dinar in a recovered economy will  itself eliminate the black market and completely supplant the  German mark as a means of payment, the governor contends.    In Sarajevo, everything is paid for in marks. One mark is  worth 500,000 dinars in coupons, which is equivalent to the  average monthly wage. A kilogram of meat costs DM90, and DM35  must be put down for the same quantity of potatoes. And that is  the impossible dream for the approximately 350,000 inhabitants  of Sarajevo.    Fed by free humanitarian aid packages that arrive in  Sarajevo  by airlift, residents mostly use their coupons to buy bread or  the daily OSLOBODJENJE. Now they will be able to buy streetcar  tickets for 30,000 dinars as well. International aid will be  running dry before long, the governor emphasizes, but much  remains to be done.    The government has estimated the cost of reconstruction at  around $3 billion. The bank has a small quantity of foreign  exchange, $50 million, while the country has $1.6 billion in  reserves, deposited before the war at the central Yugoslav bank  in Belgrade. In June 1991, the national debt was estimated as  $1.5 billion.    Even if the governor is not deluding himself into thinking  that it will be possible to collect all or even part of the  foreign exchange reserves, he does believe that there will be  new negotiations on settlement of the debt, and he is also  counting on significant support from the international  community. "We were supposed to pay off $250 million annually,  which we have been unable to do because of the war," he explains.    Restoring the banking system also depends on the confidence  of the populace. That is why the government is preparing a bill  that would guarantee to depositors the return of deposits  entrusted to banks before the war over a period of two years  after the end of the fighting. In the meantime, banks could  issue letters of credit to depositors, which would be used to  engage in commercial transactions.    For now, all Sarajevo banks except the National Bank of  Bosnia-Herzegovina are closed. Only the employees of that  institution can be seen at its cash desks, because there are no  depositors....</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Small tour operators hope for spring break: The industry is split by an OFT inquiry expected to report soon Mr David Crossland, chairman of the Airtours package tour group, tells the story of how, as a travel agency employee in the 1960s, he won a holiday on the Costa Brava as a reward for his sales performance. There is nothing new in tour operators offering travel agency staff incentives to sell their holidays rather than those of a rival. Independent travel companies complain, however, that the practice is increasingly used by large tour groups to deprive smaller operators of business. Within the next few weeks, the Office of Fair Trading is expected to announce whether it is to refer the package holiday industry to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The OFT announced in June last year that it was investigating the industry. It is understood to have completed its investigation and to be preparing to announce its decision. The OFT inquiry has divided the holiday industry into two camps. On one side are Thomson and Airtours, the two largest tour operators, which respectively own Lunn Poly and Going Places, the two biggest travel agency chains. Both groups have argued that the travel market is so competitive that it is ridiculous to talk of customer choice being restricted. Airtours says it sells only 4 per cent of its holidays through Going Places. In the other camp are the small travel companies, many represented by the Association of Independent Tour Operators. Mr Christopher Kirker, the association's chairman, says: 'We hope the OFT will take the view that the march of the multiple travel agents in the high street is increasingly restricting consumer choice.' Mr Kirker says his members find it difficult to get their brochures displayed on the racks of the large retail chains. When they do persuade large chains to sell their holidays, they are asked for increasingly high commissions, he says. The small companies have recently won a new ally in the form of Owners Abroad, the third-biggest tour operator, in which Thomas Cook, the third-biggest travel agency chain, has a 21 per cent stake. Mr Francis Baron, Owners Abroad chief executive, says this relationship is an arm's-length arrangement and does not give his group the sort of advantages Thomson and Airtours enjoy through outright ownership of travel agents. He says the practice of giving counter staff cash payments for selling their parent company's holidays makes it difficult for his group to compete. The most detailed allegations have come from Ilkeston Consumer Co-operative Society, which has nine Midlands travel agents. The society is taking legal action against Thomson for allegedly restricting the supply of brochures to its shops. It also alleges Thomson threatened to deny it access to its computer system unless it promised not to offer bigger discounts on other operators' holidays than on Thomson's. The chain said it received a letter from Thomson last December that said: 'We very much hope that during the period from December 27 to February 28 you will not be discriminating against Thomson in your discounting campaigns.' The letter added: 'We intend to review our distribution policy in the first quarter of next year. We will be examining every aspect of our commercial relationship with retail partners. Those who support us will see benefits; those who do not support us will lose some of the benefits they currently enjoy.' Thomson said it would 'defend the action vigorously'.</p>

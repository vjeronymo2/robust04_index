			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Rescue plan for Eurofighter project RADICAL CHANGES in the European Fighter Aircraft programme, including a switch to one engine instead of two, are being considered by industrial partners in an attempt to rescue the Pounds 20bn project. Mr John Vincent, managing director of the Eurofighter consortium developing the aircraft, said studies were under way to see if performance targets could be matched by a single-engine fighter. At the Farnborough Air Show, he said different radar systems for the aircraft were being considered. These included the variants of the current ECR90 radar being developed by a consortium led by GEC-Ferranti of the UK. The radar choice was decided two years ago after a row between Germany and the UK. Germany said this summer that it would abandon the EFA programme after the development phase was completed and would not go ahead with production. The other countries involved are Britain, Italy and Spain. Mr Vincent said yesterday that despite Germany's position, 'the four-nation element of the entire programme is still being maintained'. Senior British officials, however, say they have little or no hope of bringing Germany back into the project as it is currently conceived. Mr John Weston, chief of British Aerospace's defence division, said the performance requirement still pointed to an aircraft 'very similar' to the EFA. It is thought that the strong position taken by Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, would exclude any aircraft resembling the EFA project. Mr Weston said the partners were looking at every possibility for cost reduction but still had 'a long way to go' in preparing their studies. These are expected to be finished by the end of October in order to be forwarded to ministers of the four countries. He denied reports that the studies included a possible equity stake in the project by Saudi Arabia. Mr Roberto Mannu, the Italian chairman of Eurofighter, said the partners aimed to provide 'a kind of shopping list' of elements which partners could draw on to obtain different variants of the planned fighter. The partners in Eurofighter - BAe, Deutsche Aerospace, Alenia, of Italy, and Casa of Spain - were studying ways of rationalising work-shares and possible gains by buying components off the shelf, he said.

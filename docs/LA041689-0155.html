			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL IS NOW VICTIM  </P> <P> La Jolla Country Day School has now become the victim in this whole incident  with the Rogers family.  </P> <P> Rep. Bill Lowery and others are giving a very biased picture of the Rogers'  situation. They expound on the theory that La Jolla Country Day is knuckling  under to terrorism by wanting to ensure safety for their faculty and students.  </P> <P> And where are the Rogerses during all this publicity? Secreted away in a safe  place with 24-hour armed guards that accompany them everywhere.  </P> <P> Is going into hiding not knuckling under to terrorism? If it is so safe for  Mrs. Rogers to go back to school as a teacher, why don't the Rogerses go back  to their home and show that they don't want to knuckle under to terrorism? Why  should not La Jolla Country Day be extremely cautious about the safety of the  children they are entrusted with, when the Rogerses are being even more  cautious about their own personal safety?  </P> <P> We can be fair in saying that La Jolla Country Day has been placed in the  middle of an extremely difficult and unique situation. Try as they may, they  cannot make everyone happy.  </P> <P> MARY FREEMAN  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> POLICE LOOK FOR MOTORISTS TOO FULL OF HOLIDAY CHEER  </P> <P> In what is becoming a holiday tradition, South Bay law-enforcement agencies  have teamed up to patrol local streets for drunk drivers, while other agencies,  including the Torrance Police Department, are conducting sobriety checkpoints  on their own or adding more patrol cars.  </P> <P> During a two-hour sobriety checkpoint in Gardena on Friday afternoon, police  stopped 387 cars on El Segundo Boulevard but made no arrests, Sgt. Gary Garrett  said Saturday. In Inglewood, police made 11 drunk driving arrests Friday night  at a checkpoint on Century Boulevard and Doty Avenue, but the number of cars  that passed through the checkpoint was not available, said Sgt. John Hough.  </P> <P> And at a sobriety checkpoint from about 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. Thursday night,  Torrance police stopped 1,066 drivers along Torrance Boulevard, Sgt. Ron Traber  said. Of those, 15 were investigated for drunk driving and four were eventually  charged, Traber said.  </P> <P> "I really don't think (the checkpoint) came as a surprise to anybody," Traber  said, adding that Torrance police used the checkpoint primarily as an  opportunity to educate people about the dangers of drinking and driving. Police  handed out leaflets that recommended designating a non-drinking person as a  driver.  </P> <P> "The idea was to deter people," Traber said. "For our purposes, it went very  well."  </P> <P> Palos Verdes Estates police have added an extra patrol car to look for drunk  drivers, cruising mostly along Palos Verdes Drive West and Palos Verdes Drive  North, Sgt. Ron Echols said.  </P> <P> And sheriff's deputies have added two patrol cars to be on the lookout for  drunk drivers in Rolling Hills, Rolling Hills Estates, Rancho Palos Verdes and  Lomita, said Lt. Stephen Huss of the Lomita Sheriff's Station. The Sheriff's  Department provides law enforcement for those cities.  </P> <P> Elsewhere in the South Bay, seven cities and the California Highway Patrol are  working in concert to ferret out drunk drivers.  </P> <P> Police departments in Gardena, El Segundo, Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach,  Inglewood, Hermosa Beach and Hawthorne are pooling resources and officers with  the CHP to patrol streets throughout those cities.  </P> <P> Each department contributed one or two officers and a patrol car, said Lt.  David Morgan of the Gardena Police Department.  </P> <P> In addition to the joint task force efforts, most departments said they are  beefing up patrols within their own city boundaries, particularly on New Year's  Eve.  </P> <P> "I would say if you're planning on drinking and driving, plan on bringing a  toothbrush and a change of underwear," said Morgan, explaining that such  drivers risk spending a night in jail.  </P> <P> This year, sobriety checkpoint and special patrols in Gardena, Redondo Beach  and Inglewood were held earlier than usual to target revelers headed home after  office Christmas parties, police said.  </P> <P> Lt. Ken Kauffman of Redondo Beach said studies have shown that police  departments concentrate their efforts to arrest drunk drivers during evening  and late night hours, but drunk drivers are also on the road during the period  just after working hours.  </P> <P> "Apparently a trend has emerged where we were missing dangerous periods, the  hours after office parties being one of them," Kauffman said.  </P></p>

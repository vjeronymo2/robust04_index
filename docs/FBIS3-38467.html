			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Milan, Italy, Feb 2 (AFP) -- The Italian Communist  Party (PCI) received a bribe of one billion lire ($600,000) in  connection with Enimont, the former president of  Ferruzzi-Montedison, Carlo Sama, told a court here on Wednesday  [2 February].    Sama had said on December 21 that the PCI had received funds  from the company in return for allowing Enimont to be attributed  tax advantages.    The PCI has since broken up into the Refounded Communist  Party and the Democratic Party of the Left.    Ferruzzi, a private group and Eni, the state energy holding  company, set up a joint venture called Enimont. This fell apart  and revealed a huge scandal of political corruption in which 150  billion lire was siphoned into the coffers of political parties  and the pockets of people elected to positions of authority.    Sama has been charged with corruption in connection with  this  but was appearing on Wednesday as a witness in a case against a  key figure, Sergio Cusani. Sama, in his earlier statement, had  not put a figure on the amount of the bribe paid to the  communists.    The court hearings have progressively revealed that all of  the parties, led by the Christian Democratic Party and the  Socialist Party, received big illicit commissions in connection  with the Enimont deal to finance legislative elections in April  1992.    Sama was forced to leave the company as a result of the  discovery of a hole in the accounts which threatened to lead to  bankruptcy. He told magistrates that in 1993 he learnt that the  communists had been paid. He alleged that the funds had been  provided by Cusani and by Raul Gardini, the former president of  Ferruzzi-Montedison, who committed suicide as the corruption  came to light. The money was paid to someone whose identity he  did not know, Sama said.</p>

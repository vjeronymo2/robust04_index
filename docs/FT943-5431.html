			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Wife wants her money faster I lived and worked overseas for 10 years with my husband, who is a foreign national, but I have now returned to the UK with our two small daughters. We decided to separate as he wants to live in his own country. Before applying for a divorce, we agreed to divide our savings in half, with my portion being transferred to the UK. In order to make tax-efficient investments, we have begun using a personal equity plan under my name to bring in the money. But it would take about 10 years to transfer it like this. Is there a better way to do it? It might well be in your own interests, and those of your children, to ensure that the division of savings be carried out immediately rather than be prolonged over 10 years. As an individual, you are allowed to put Pounds 9,000 a year into Peps - Pounds 6,000 in a general Pep and Pounds 3,000 in a single company PEP. In addition, Tessas (tax-exempt special savings accounts) enable a total of Pounds 9,000 to be invested over a five-year period. As for investing the balance, this depends on the amount of money involved and your personal circumstances. As a rough and ready suggestion, it could be well be worth looking at high quality investment trusts where the investment criteria is very low or nil income but maximum capital growth. Thus, your income tax situation could be minimised and, providing you use the annual exemption for capital gains tax to mitigate CGT as much as possible, you should be able to run a simple, tax-efficient portfolio for yourself.

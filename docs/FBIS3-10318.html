			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Alberto Briceno] </F>   [Text] The government will earmark 230 million colones of  the national budget this year to pay for land expropriated from  U.S. citizens, Deputy Presidency Minister Alejandro Matamoros  has stated. The official has said that the allocations were  included in the regular budget for this period, as well as in  1993's extraordinary budget.    The payments will be made in installments, based on the  decision by the appropriate bodies, such as the Direct Tax  General Directorate, Finance Ministry, or the arbitration courts  established to that effect.    Matamoros has said the Qualls family will receive 23 million  colones in two installments before the current government ends,  based on a decision against the state by the arbitration court.  It will be up to the next administration to allocate 92.8  million colones, which must be paid for the expropriation of a  farm measuring 1,439 hectares in Sierpe, Osa Caton, Puntarenas.    Regarding the Titisa case, the authorities will make two  payments of 22 million colones each, according to a ruling by  the arbitration court, which will settle the dispute over the  499-hectare farm in Golfito. There will be another allocation  to pay Richard Bell for property measuring 7,176 hectares in  Potrero Grande, Buenos Aires Canton. The first payment of 45  million colones is to be made in May out of a total of 90  million colones that were included in the national budget for  this year. The arbitration court has ordered the government to  pay 183 million colones.    Matamoros has said the next administration has to settle the  dispute over the Santa Elena farm with U.S. citizen Joseph  Hamilton. The property is presently being measured to pass that  information to the World Bank court later.</p>

In a statement received in Cyprus, the Iraqi National  Congress (INC), an alliance of opposition groups, said the  blasts occurred early Tuesday outside an army headquarters, a  state-run oil company building and near a giant portrait of  President Saddam Husayn painted on a wall.    The INC is based in Salah al-Din, in Kurdish-controlled  northern Iraq.    Karkuk, an important oil city with nearly one million  inhabitants, is near the Kurdish-held areas.</p>

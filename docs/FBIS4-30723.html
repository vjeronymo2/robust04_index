			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Fri. [24 June] -- DAP [Democratic  Action Party] secretary-general Lim Kit Siang today urged the  Cabinet to review the Home Ministry's ban on the Tamil biweekly  newspaper THOOTHAN, following its publication of reports  extremely embarrassing to MIC [Malaysian Indian Congress]  president Datuk Sri S. Samy Vellu.    In its latest issue dated June 22, which could not hit the  news-stands because of the June 21 ban, THOOTHAN reported that  about 50 taxi permits meant for the Indian community had been  "diverted" to a company.    In the last three months, THOOTHAN had published exclusive  interviews with former Samy Vellu confidant and MIC public  relations committee chairman V. Subramaniam Barat Maniam, who  had confessed to being the main "co-ordinator" in the Maika  Telekom shares issue.    Lim, in a statement, said the banning of THOOTHAN for  exposing political and financial scandals would make a mockery  of the fight against money politics.    "Apart from raising the fundamental issue of Press freedom,  democracy and human rights, it also raises the question as to  whether the Government is serious about fighting corruption in  all forms."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first </F> prime minister of the Royal Government of Cambodia, by a TV and  Radio Cambodia correspondent on 5 April; place not given --  recorded]    [Summary from poor reception] [Correspondent] Highness, I  represent the national TV and Radio Cambodia Network.  Concerning the peace and security question, the general public  has asked why there is insufficient stability in the country  despite the fact that the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] has  been set up for months as the legitimate government of the  country?    [Ranariddh] "Thank you. First, I would like to thank you,  who represent the national tv and radio network, for  interviewing me today on questions that are of concern not only  to the people and Buddhist monks in general but also to His  Majesty our august king, who continues to closely follow  developments in the Kingdom of Cambodia, especially the on-going  bloodshed between Cambodians.    "The government is not happy with the current situation  despite the fact that the so-called general war has been  transformed into a mere state of insurgency. The RGC is not  pleased at all with this insurgency war. Compared with the  overall peaceful situation of the country, however, we see that  this insurgency is very marginal. Nevertheless, the concern of  His Majesty the king as well as that of the general public is  most understandable. And it is the responsibility of the RGC,  for the duty of the RGC born out of the elections is to seek  peace and security for the people."    In addition to this question of peace, there is the Khmer  Rouge problem. As first prime minister of the RGC, I would like  to inform the public of the following: I am very saddened by  what is happening between us and the Khmer Rouge. We still have  this Khmer Rouge problem to solve although we already held  elections, reintroduced the monarchy, formed the RGC, and wrote  the Constitution. After being nominated prime minister, I  agreed to make so many concessions to the Khmer Rouge. Some of  my cabinet ministers even criticized me for tarnishing the  prestige of the legal, elected government by consenting to meet  with Khieu Samphan. "They said: Khieu Samphan has never  officially recognized you as prime minister. He always  addresses you only as chairman of FUNCINPEC [National United  Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative  Cambodia]." But I still agreed to meet with him. This shows  that the RGC and I have never hesitated in trying to put an end  to the conflict between Cambodians.    We have always supported His Majesty the king's five-point  proposal for peace, a proposal which demands that the Khmer  Rouge dissolve their army, a cease-fire be declared, and the  Khmer Rouge be included in the government if they wish. When I  talked to Khieu Samphan, he said these conditions were designed  by the Vietnamese. I just mentioned above that these conditions  were proposed by His Majesty, but Khieu Samphan insisted they  were proposed instead by the Vietnamese.    Another of our concessions is that we always refer to the  Khmer Rouge as PDK or Party of Democratic Kampuchea. While we  recognize the PDK, the PDK never recognizes the RGC. "The Khmer  Rouge said they want to become government advisers or government  members, but they have refused to recognize the RGC. This shows  that they are not sincere." When I proposed to Khieu Samphan  that there should be a cease-fire first, he answered no. He  said: How can there be a cease-fire if the Vietnamese continue  to attack us? "So, the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF] have no  choice but to continue the struggle. The Khmer Rouge do not  consider us as Cambodians, but as Vietnamese. Therefore, we  have to fight them."    As I have already mentioned above, the PDK does not  recognize  the RGC. They keep talking about the quadripartite setup.  This quadripartite setup is outdated. The four parties no  longer existed after the elections. There is now only the RGC  born out of the elections. The three parties forming the RGC  cannot be regarded as separate entities. They already form the  RGC. So, there are only the RGC and the PDK.    I tell you of all this to show that the RGC is sincere in  seeking to solve the problem. In spite of everything, we are  always prepared to follow the instruction of His Majesty our  king. If His Majesty wants us to talk with the Khmer Rouge  today, we will talk with them today. "Although the KRAF have  won great successes at Anlung Veng and Pailin, we are still  prepared to talk. Some said that Anlung Veng was a defeat for  us. Let me tell you that the RGC did order the KRAF to pull out  of Anlung Veng. Why? Because Anlung Veng is no longer a town.  [Khmer Rouge commander] Ta Mok burned down everything there.  How could we stay in a burned out location and wait to be  bombarded from the outside? The objective of the KRAF was to  prevent the Khmer Rouge from using Anlung Veng as their  economic, political, and military base from which to launch  attacks against Siem Reap." In this goal, we were 100 percent  successful.    Concerning Pailin, before our campaign many people were very  harsh with the KRAF, saying they were not capable of ending the  Pailin tragedy, unable to stop the region from being raped and  the Sangke river from being soiled. Now that we have attacked  Pailin, they still criticize us, saying we are responsible for  bloodshed. Allow me to stress here that this is our duty, the  duty of the KRAF. Our constitution pointedly forbids secession  of any part of our motherland. The KRAF have done their job and  have upheld the Constitution.    Once again, I would like to emphasize that we are always  ready to comply if His Majesty the king instructs us to hold  talks with the Khmer Rouge.  . Moreover, of the estimated $1 billion, $585 million has  already been spent. The people could not believe that so much  money has been spent on Cambodia and nothing concrete has been  achieved. Let me tell you, this international aid was slotted  for technical assistance. It could not be translated into cars,  tractors, or equipment. But mind you, the UN Development  Program is in full control of this aid. The people should not  worry that the government will mishandle aid at all.    "In my opinion, what we need is not arms. What we need is a  better life for the people. When the people have food, clothes,  schools, medicines, roads, running water, electricity, and  employment for the youths, when the people's living standard has  improved, the problem of insurgency will be completely solved."    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]    [Ranaridddh] Thank you again for reminding me of this issue.  I would like to take this opportunity to recall that for 23  years we have been through so many wars, many killings, many  destructions. It would take us another 10 years to become as  prosperous as we were under Sangkum Reas Niyum [Sihanouk's  pre-1970 ruling party]. "Nonetheless, the RGC is striving hard  to set the foundation and this foundation is underground,  invisible to the eyes. Yet, we need a strong foundation in  order to build a sturdy house." This is not an easy job. We  have to revise, to rationalize the structure. We have hundreds  of thousands of state employees to manage and reorganize and we  must reform our legal system to cope with new national  requirements. It all will take a lot of time. Priority should  be given to so many domains, such as education and the  infrastructure. However, to achieve that we need favorable  conditions: security and social stability.    Under the current circumstances, some of us believe that we  are wanting in security and stability. I have just returned  from Europe and countries over there think differently. They  marveled at our capability to achieve and maintain peace.  Before leaving for Europe, I was a little worried that they  might stop caring about what is happening in Cambodia. Giving  us $773 million already shows how sympathetic and kind they are  toward us. But the international community still cares about us  because they have seen that we are serious about trying to help  ourselves. In the economic field, they see that we have market  stability, a stable riel currency, and an inflation rate below  10 percent. Our main concern now is with agriculture. I have  informed the international community that they should give less  attention to spending their aid on training our cadres. I just  told the Americans that we received too much training; instead,  what we Cambodians want to see are tractors, excavators, and  water pumps. We should not make a fuss about technical  training. Months have passed and nothing concrete, except for  the Cambodia-Japan friendship bridge, has been visible. And  already $585 million of the aid has been spent, just on  training. Those people who are misinformed will surely believe  that Ranariddh and Hun Sen have lined their pockets with all  that money. So, I have urged the donors not to spend to much  money on training.    [Correspondent] As head of the RGC, what is your impression  on the plight of the refugees forced to flee across the border  in the wake of the large-scale government operations against  Pailin?    [Ranariddh] I do not have enough words to comment on this  matter. We are very concerned about the refugees' well-being.  Seeing the young and old people turned into war refugees after  months have eclipsed since the formation of the RGC is  heart-rending. I have ordered our Red Cross to be prepared to  take good care of the refugees. In my opinion, the right  procedure should be to request the UNHCR [UN High Commissioner  for Refugees] and the ICRC [International Committee of the Red  Cross] to take charge of the refugees. They should be in a  position to allow the refugees to decide where they want to go  and then provide them with the means to go there. This,  however, was not what happened when our refugees fled from  Pailin into Thailand. The Thais said they recognize the RGC.  So, I said, we should hold talks at governmental level. I  proposed that the UNHCR and the ICRC interview the refugees and  help take them to where they want to go. If a sanctuary is  needed, then we will set up one. But the Thai authorities,  without informing us, instead forcibly repatriated our people to  a region known to be under the control of the Khmer Rouge.  "This does not conform with what the Thai authorities  repeatedly assured me when I returned from Tokyo, that is, that  they recognize only the RGC. They said: We do not help the  Khmer Rouge. Highness, please believe us. What they just did,  however, belies this assurance."    I have learned that some of the refugees said they wanted to  go back to Kompong Cham where they first came from. I have also  learned from Battambang that a few of the forcibly repatriated  refugees had escaped from that area and revealed to us that  hundreds more wanted to flee. I ordered our authorities to do  their best to contact and help them out.    At least, we should give a free choice to the refugees to go  where they want to go. Madame Ogata of the UNHCR and the ICRC  have always been prepared to assist the refugees.    The press are closely watching the government's record on  press freedom since the editor of a local newspaper was  arrested. What is your comment?    [Ranariddh] "Thank you for raising this issue. It reminds  me of an incident. This morning AFP wrote that I had claimed to  be in possession of a picture clearly showing Pol Pot escaping  in a car on a road inside Thailand. I would like to make it  clear now before there is further misunderstanding by  emphasizing that I really have a picture, but it is a picture  taken by our agent showing a convoy of trucks transporting Khmer  Rouge soldiers with pots, pans, and other belongings riding on a  road in Thai territory from an area near Pailin to another area.  I have this picture, but I have never said I have a picture of  Pol Pot. I have a picture of Pol Pot's troops being  transported, but not a picture of Pol Pot. I would be very  happy to own one because Japan has promised to give $1 million  to any person who can produce a picture of Pol Pot. So, I do  not have a picture of Pol Pot, but I have a picture showing Pol  Pot's men fleeing. I have to make this clear so that AFP will  not report something that I did not say. However, I did stress  that such a tarmac road with a white dividing line in the middle  does not exist in the Pailin region. Where else can this road  be?"    Yesterday, our Parliament was debating a press bill in  conformity with our Constitution. Our local press seem to be  not very happy with the present state of press freedom in the  country. The French press are even more strident in their  protest. But what we are talking about here is only a bill yet  to be passed by Parliament. We should not compare ours with the  press freedom of the French who have had theirs since 1789.  Moreover, we have a lot of things in this bill that the French  do not have, such as a clause protecting the journalist  profession for Cambodian citizens, and so on.    Nevetheless, I am more concerned about the question of  security than press freedom. There should be limits to all our  undertakings. I told the cabinet meeting yesterday that His  Majesty the king had sent us letter after letter urging us not  to deprive this journalist of his right. However, while we must  have a law on press freedom, we also must have some  restrictions. A foreign newspaper said that I have gagged the  national TV and radio network. You have my word, I have never  asked His Excellency Ieng Muli or any other personalities to  curb the TV and radio comments at all. I only once urged  everybody not to make excessive additional comments on events,  not to put words in other people's mouths. For that I have been  accused of gagging the media.    I swear I have never told His Excellency Ieng Muli to cover  anything up. I only begged for cooperation in respecting press  freedom and also the right of other people. The press should be  informative, educational, and useful to society. At the same  time, the press should support the RGC in its difficult mission  of rehabilitating the nation. This is my appeal to the press.  I am proud that our country, after years of wars, has now  entered a very liberal period. I hope that the press will have  a high national conscience to transcend that liberal stage,  become the pride of the nation, and refrain from  spawing what is known as diplomatic incidents.</p>

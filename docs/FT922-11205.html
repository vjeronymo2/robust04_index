			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / European puts itself on course for full recovery WHEN THE late Mr Robert Maxwell wanted to influence the direction of The European he simply picked up the telephone - frequently. On one occasion, Mr Maxwell even broke into an office after deciding he should become editor-in-chief and direct operations himself. The new proprietors of the international weekly newspaper, Mr David Barclay and his brother Frederick, who own ships and hotels, do things differently. Whenever they think it is time for a discussion about strategy or the future of the venture, they invite Mr Charles Garside, the editor, and Mr Alan Chamberlain, the managing director, for a good lunch in a top hotel in Monte Carlo, where they live. No picture of the Barclay brothers has appeared in The European. They still have not set foot in the paper's office in London and may never do so. Mr Garside, who at the beginning of January was not only editor but the only employee of the paper, said: 'They read the paper from cover to cover and they have been delighted with the way the paper has been progressing.' Next month there will be small but sure signs of progress. The European will bring back Elan as a separate third section covering everything from arts to lifestyle, and start promoting the title again. Last week the paper took on 18 people, half of them journalists, to add to a staff of 50. Circulation is believed to be starting to pick up and is between 150,000 and 200,000. The official circulation figure for the last six months of 1991 was 167,000. Mr Garside said: 'We gave an immediate guarantee that we were selling over 150,000 on the day we took over. We are doing better than that but it will be our policy to let the ABC (official circulation figures) speak for themselves.' He will not be drawn on how the paper is doing financially. Observers believe that before the threat of closure the paper was losing about Pounds 1m a month and is unlikely to be losing more than Pounds 1m to Pounds 2m a year now. Mr Chamberlain, who has worked for the publicity-shy Barclays for about 10 years, said: 'It's the most exciting job I have ever had. We are serious players and we are running a business. People are starting to feel comfortable dealing with us.' Mr Garside, remembering Mr Maxwell, who always promised editors freedom and could never keep his hands off, said editorial independence is not only what he was promised but what he actually got from the quiet brothers in Monte Carlo.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: China urges HSBC not to raise Midland bid CHINA yesterday re-entered the debate on Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's bid for Midland Bank, urging it not to increase its offer for the UK clearer. The semi-official China News Service (CNS) said it would be 'unfair' to Hongkong Bank shareholders if it bettered the terms of its offer for Midland. It said Midland's shareholders would be the losers if the bid did not go though on Hongkong Bank's terms. It is unclear what prompted CNS to make these comments but they coincide with reports that Lloyds Bank would consider making an offer for Midland when its board meets today. If this happens the Hongkong Bank might be forced to increase its offer. That said, yesterday's comments on the Midland bid were, by implication, the most positive a mainland Chinese organ has made on Hongkong Bank's offer in that they suggested China was comfortable with the deal as proposed. The news service, however, questioned whether Hongkong Bank should use its inner reserves to pay for the takeover of Midland. It asserted that the bank's inner reserves should have been HKDollars 30.6bn (Pounds 2.25bn), instead of the HKDollars 25.3bn it declared in its offer documents. But CNS misunderstood the Hongkong Bank's offer document. The bank declared its reserves gross of Pounds 190m merger costs and an estimated Pounds 200m tax liability. These remain contingent on the bid's acceptance and are conservative estimates of what it might have to pay.</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow hits new peaks on quarterly reports Wall Street US MARKETS soared to new highs yesterday following further quarterly reports which indicated that business conditions are improving, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 47.63 at 3,353.76, the second consecutive record close for the blue-chip index. The gains were less spectacular for broader and secondary markets. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished up 3.82 at 416.21, while the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks rose 5.23 to 600.04. Turnover on the NYSE was 231m shares. As on Tuesday, positive company earnings reports provided the momentum for solid gains across the board as investors purchased shares in anticipation of a big improvement in corporate profitability over the coming quarters. Investors favoured not only cyclical stocks which are most likely to benefit from the economic upswing, but also spread their buying across a range of sectors. The market has also been underpinned by hopes of further monetary easing by the Federal Reserve. The Fed cut its fed funds rate last week, raising expectations that a more positive step, most likely a reduction in the discount rate, may soon follow. Among individual stocks, AMR, parent group of American Airlines, rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 71 after reporting first quarter net income of Dollars 20m, a substantial turnaround from the Dollars 195m loss incurred at the same stage a year ago. A variety of stocks moved in response to earnings reports, not all of them in a positive direction. Among them were: Merck, down Dollars 4 at Dollars 151 1/4 on disappointing net income of Dollars 1.47 a share; Upjohn, down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 36 3/8 on news of a slight increase in earnings; CBS, up Dollars 7 1/2 at Dollars 185 1/2 on a return to profitability; and Sprint, up Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 23 3/4 in turnover of 2m shares following the announcement of a big increase in first quarter profits. Caterpillar jumped Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 53 7/8 on the news that the United Auto Workers Union had told striking workers at the company to go back to work. At least one broking house, Wertheim Schroder, raised its rating on Caterpillar because of the end of the strike. Several stocks continued to draw strength from Tuesday's earnings announcements, including Goodyear, up Dollars 4 at Dollars 75 3/8 , International Paper, up Dollars 3 7/8 at Dollars 76 1/4 , General Electric, up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 78, and Alcoa, Dollars 3 higher at Dollars 74 1/2 . On the over-the-counter market Microsoft jumped Dollars 11 7/8 to Dollars 128 7/8 in turnover of 4.6m shares after a federal judge threw out most of Apple Computer's arguments that Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard had breached copyright on certain characteristics of Apple's Macintosh computer. The news persuaded two broking houses, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, to raise their ratings on Microsoft. Centocor slumped Dollars 12 3/4 to Dollars 18 1/2 in turnover of 17m shares on the news that the Food and Drug Administration has said that it had not seen sufficient evidence to approve the company's drug for the treatment of septic shock after surgery. Canada THE TORONTO market finished mixed, as falling gold shares offset gains in other sectors. Based on preliminary data, the composite index ended 1.31 points lower at 3,411.33, although advancing issues edged declines 287 to 256. Volume was 33.8m shares, inflated by two block trades, against 28.2m shares on the previous day, and trading value was CDollars 350.6m against CDollars 318m. The gold sub-group plunged 4.20 per cent on index, as gold sank Dollars 3.30 to Dollars 336.25 an ounce in New York. The energy sector fell slightly and mining was unchanged.</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / UK Company News: GrandMet sells its 20% stake in Remy Cointreau GRAND Metropolitan, the drinks, food and retailing group, is to sell its 20 per cent stake in Remy Martin and Cointreau, the French cognac and liqueur companies, acquired two years ago for Pounds 100m. GrandMet announced that it was exercising its option to sell the equity to the controlling shareholders, Remy Cointreau, after a review of the worldwide distribution strategies of both groups. No price was disclosed but GrandMet is expected to show a profit. The holding was acquired by International Distillers &amp; Vintners (IDV), the drinks division, with a view to cementing and possibly extending its trading relationship with Remy Cointreau. IDV, Cointreau and Cinzano, the Italian wines company, have joint venture distribution companies in France, Germany, Spain and Italy. And the IDV drinks portfolio would have been strengthened by the addition of leading cognac and champagne brands. But Mr George Bull, IDV's chairman, said: 'It became apparent that within the exactly matching strategies of the two companies to control their own distribution networks, the retention of the shareholding no longer served a useful purpose.' Since the merger of the family-controlled businesses in 1990, Remy Cointreau has also been rationalising and extending its own distribution system. European sales of most Cointreau products will be integrated into the group's network within the next three months. Sir Allen Sheppard, GrandMet's chairman, was paid a total of Pounds 713,391 last year, a rise of Pounds 74,266 or 12 per cent. The group's annual report also reveals that, apart from Sir Allen, 28 per cent of the pay of the group's executive directors was in the form of performance-related bonuses.</p>

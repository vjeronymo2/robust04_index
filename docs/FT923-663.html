			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Deal near on extra BSkyB channels BRITISH Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television broadcaster, is close to a deal that would bring at least three more television channels within a single subscription package on the Astra satellite system. The deal would involve scrambling and then charging for Sky One and Sky News, the two remaining Sky Television channels for which no charge is made. The three new channels that would go on Astra if the deal is completed are Discovery, a channel based on documentaries; Bravo, a classic film channel; and The Children's Channel. All come under the banner of United Artists Programming. The aim would be to create a new subscription package for viewers which would contain at least five channels and which would cost perhaps Pounds 2.99 a month. The new method of charging would be introduced in a year and would mean that the pattern of satellite television would resemble cable television where customers buy a basic package of channels and can then chose individual premium channels such as those showing recent films. It is possible that UK Gold, the new general entertainment channel soon to be launched by Thames Television and the BBC - which is backed by Cox Enterprises of the US - could also join the new package. However, talks on that are believed to be less advanced. The deal would allow other cable and satellite channels to use the existing 'smart card' charging system developed by Sky. The new policy is also a recognition that, although satellite channels are interested in advertising revenue, subscription revenue is always likely be more important. BSkyB is a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake.</p>

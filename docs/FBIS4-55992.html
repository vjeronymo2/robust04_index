			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Budisa Chairman, Kovacevic Secretary"] </F>   [Excerpt] Osijek -- The second day of the Fifth Convention  of the Croatian Social Liberal Party [HSLS] began with the  election of the party president, vice presidents, secretary  general, members of the Grand Council, and other posts. Several  candidates were nominated for all posts, except that of  president. Former [HSLS] President Drazen Budisa was reelected  for the next two-year term. He received 914 out of 930 votes.  Bozo Kovacevic, former secretary general of the party, was  reelected to that post. Dr. Zlatko Kramaric, Velimir Terzic,  Jozo Rados, and Mladen Vilfan were elected party vice  presidents. Out of 88 candidates, the convention elected 33  members of the Grand Council. Five members of the Statutory  Committee and five members of the Control Committee were also  elected. Kovacevic received 600 and Zoric 325 votes. Nine  ballots were invalid.    While the votes were being counted, the convention continued  to present and debate the resolutions of the convention, which  encompassed many major issues concerning Croatia's development.  The long and open debate and the proposing of amendments to the  resolutions included many participants, so the debate on  positions on the HSLS resolutions lasted well into the  afternoon. For instance, as many as three proposals on the  resolution on local administration and self-administration were  made and a compromise version was adopted at the end. Among  other things, a decision was made that the HSLS will advocate  amending the Law on Local Self-Administration and Administration  and the Law on the Territory of the Self-Administration Units in  order to increase the power of local self-administration units  regarding matters that are of interest to the citizens on their  territory. The HSLS will devote special attention to isolated  and underdeveloped insular and other regions, about which it  demands financial help from the central state authorities.  [passage omitted]</p>

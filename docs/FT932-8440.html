			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Major pledges to bolster industry MR JOHN MAJOR last night pledged to give substance to a new partnership between government and industry by directing all of Whitehall's energy towards broadening the economic recovery and strengthening the manufacturing base. In a speech to the Confederation of British Industry the prime minister underlined his personal commitment to improving Britain's competitiveness. That meant backing exporters, fostering public/private sector partnerships to improve the nation's infrastructure, promoting free trade, removing unnecessary government regulation and translating scientific research into industrial innovation. Mr Major had been told earlier by Mr Howard Davies, the director-general of the CBI, that business wanted the government to listen to industry rather than to its own rhetoric. The prime minister said in his speech that the climate for industry to flourish was in place. Admitting the mistakes that led to the inflationary boom of the late 1980s, he added that the government had now delivered low inflation, low interest rates and low tax rates. Mr Major added: 'We have all learnt the hard lessons of those years. We will not let inflation drive Britain off its course again.' But he acknowledged that government also had a more direct role in helping business at home and abroad. Decisions taken in Whitehall could help or hinder industry in a 'thousand ways'. Mr Major told the industrialists' annual dinner: 'All our policies - not just our economic policy - need to be focused on the future strength of the British economy.' He said that partnership between government and industry would go well beyond the cash help for exporters and the tax cuts for industry announced in the Autumn Statement and the Budget in March.</p>

He said that the stoppage of RFE broadcasts decided on  Tuesday by Vladimir Zeman, chief director of the  Telecommunication Department in the Transport Ministry, was  unlawful and contradicted the valid agreement. He said that any  interference in the current state could be made merely by the  competent parties -- the Slovak telecommunications and RFE.    Slovak officials on Tuesday stopped relaying RFE broadcasts  from two transmitters, in violation of the still valid  agreement providing for medium-wavelength RFE broadcasts.</p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Finance and The Family: Sellers continue to set the pace - Directors' transactions IT MIGHT BE high summer, but directors are not taking a break from trading. Selling still outweighs buying but there has been increased activity across the board. Christopher Broadbent, the managing director of BWD Securities, a stockbroking company, sold more than 1m shares at 97.2p. At the beginning of the year, they were trading around 40p; now, they are about 100p. The sale by Johnson Wallace of shares in Willis Corroon, an insurance and re-insurance broker, was technically made during the company's closed period in anticipation of interim results. In a statement to the Stock Exchange, though, the company explained the transaction had been carried out by trustees acting for Wallace. Despite instructions in June to deal, the sale was not made until recently. Activity on the buying front ranges from industrial giants to companies with market capitalisations of just over Pounds 10m. Ross Group is involved in a variety of industrial services. After an up-beat AGM statement, six board members invested in shares at 26p. This marks the first dealing in the company by directors for several years. Sir Michael Edwardes, the chairman of Charter Consolidated, has increased his holding by 20,000 shares.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           No of Company                  Sector       Shares   Value   directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Amersham                   Hlth       15,000     123         1* Berry Birch &amp; Noble        InsB       10,000      17         1 Betterware                 Stor      127,000     318         1 BWD Securities             OthF    1,075,748   1,046         1 CRT Group                  BuSe      550,000     517         1 European Motor Hldg        Motr      285,714     366         1 Forminster                 Text      100,000     535         1 Granada Group              H&amp;L       100,000     407         1 Hambros                    Merc      270,000   1,007         2* Intercare                  Hlth       16,000      25         2 Kleinwort Benson Gp        Merc       15,000      73         1 London Merchant            Prop       23,500      23         1 Marks &amp; Spencer            Stor       60,000     217         1* Menvier Swain              Elcs       10,000      61         1 Morris Ashby               Metl       34,900      63         1 Pelican Group               H&amp;L      495,000     299         1 Prism Leisure               H&amp;L       50,000      65         1 Salvesen Christian         BuSe        6,704      24         1 Tops Estates CULS          Prop      150,000     201         1 Unigroup                   BdMa       50,000      34         1 Vodafone                   Tele       84,000     405         1* Wessex Water               Watr        5,000      30         1 Willis Corroon             InsB       73,570     162         1 Yorklyde                   Text       20,000      36         1 Yorkshire Water            Watr        7,700      39         2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES Boots                      Stor        8,000      37         1 British Telecom            Tele        8,900      36         2 Brunner Inv Trust          InTr        8,347      17         1 Charter Cons'dated         OthI       20,000     132         1 Cooper Clarke               n/a      125,000     106         1 El Oro Mining               n/a        2,500      14         1 Eldridge Pope A            Brew       29,700      31         2 English Nat IT Def         InTr       20,000      45         1 Excalibur                  Misc      200,000      31         1 Hartstone                  Misc       46,000      25         2 Radius                     Elns      150,000      56         1 Rank Organisation           H&amp;L        3,000      22         1 Ross Group                 Misc       92,000      24         6 St Ives                    Pack       10,000      30         1 Yorkshire Chemicals        Chem        3,000      11         1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Both INGAA and AGA argue that the requirement to modify other obstructions in the line section whenever a replacement is made will potentially increase the cost of compliance with the final rule to over $100 million per year. However, very little cost data was provided to support the argument. Moreover, based on information now available about numbers of gas transmission lines that will not accommodate smart pigs and the estimated frequency with which operators must install replacements in lines, RSPA believes the costs to be substantially less. The economic evaluation prepared for the final rule was based on available data relating to costs and frequency of replacements made in gas transmission lines. That evaluation estimated costs at $1.05 million per year. Now under the heading_Requests for Information from Commenters_this notice requests the operators to provide up-to-date information on the gas transmission lines that are the subject of this notice. Thus, gas operators and petitioners will have an opportunity to provide specific information on the length of affected lines that are currently unable to accommodate smart pigs (for reasons other than lack of launchers and receivers) and the extent of replacements made in recent years for reasons other than to accommodate smart pigs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, RSPA finds that the cost of compliance with the final rule would not exceed $100 million annually. In addition, the relief proposed in this notice will further reduce the cost of compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> AGA argues additionally that RSPA violated Executive Order (E.O.) 12866, titled ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' since ``the costs of compliance with this rule could potentially reach over $100 million annually'' and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) did not review the final rule. RSPA disagrees. In the first place, as already noted, RSPA believes the costs of the final rule to be well below $100 million annually. Second, E.O. 12866 provides for OMB review of only ``significant regulatory actions'' unless OMB declines to review such a significant action. The procedure for determining that a regulatory action is not ``significant'' and for obtaining the concurrence of OMB with that determination is laid out in Section 6(a)(3)(A) of E.O. 12866 and ``Guidance for Implementing E.O. 12866.'' The latter is a memorandum from Sally Katzen, Administrator for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, to the heads of executive departments and agencies dated October 12, 1993. RSPA routinely follows this procedure by submitting lists of planned regulatory actions to OMB and obtaining its concurrence in designations of ``significant'' and ``nonsignificant.'' OMB concurred in the designation of this final rule as ``nonsignificant'' on February 23, 1994. Finally, RSPA notes that E.O. 12866 is an internal management tool of Executive branch of the Federal Government and does not create any right to OMB review enforceable by any person against RSPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the final rule complies with the requirements of E.O. 12866 and OMB, as explained above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> To begin with, I am a loyal fan of NBC and I watch it faithfully.  </P> <P> My favorite days are Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. However, the network  recently moved "Dear John" from Thursdays to Wednesdays to make room for the  new comedy, "Grand." Why they call it "Grand" is beyond me. After two viewings,  I was hoping for a grand finale.  </P> <P> George Torok, Lynwood  </P></p>

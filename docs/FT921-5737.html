			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Aids co-discoverer under investigation DR Robert Gallo, US co-discoverer of the Aids virus, faces new investigations for alleged patent fraud and perjury on top of a long-running inquiry into alleged scientific misconduct at his laboratory in the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The latest federal investigations are expected to focus on patent documents and sworn statements which Dr Gallo made in connection with a 1987 agreement between the US and France. That agreement was supposed to settle the vexed issue of who discovered the virus (now known as the Human Immunodeficiency Virus or HIV). Dr Gallo and Professor Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute in Paris would share scientific credit for the discovery, and royalties from HIV tests would be divided equally between the two countries. However, it has emerged since then that the virus originally isolated in Dr Gallo's laboratory in 1983/84 was derived from a sample sent by Prof Montagnier in France. Although Dr Gallo's cell culture may been contaminated accidentally by the French virus, his critics allege that his sworn statements deliberately concealed the similarity between his virus and Prof Montagnier's. Dr Gallo has always insisted that his discovery owed little to the French work. He now maintains that he believed in 1983/84 that the two viruses were quite different. The initiative to pursue the allegations of patent fraud and perjury comes mainly from the House of Representatives subcommittee on oversight and investigations, whose chairman Mr John Dingell is upset that an internal NIH inquiry has not found Dr Gallo guilty of scientific misconduct. Mr Dingell has brought the congressional watchdog, the General Accounting Office, into the inquiry. It is understood that the federal Department of Health and Human Services, which is responsible for NIH, is also investigating. At the same time, the Pasteur Institute is pressing the US to renegotiate the 50:50 royalty sharing agreement. The French claim that new information shows Dr Gallo merely 'rediscovered' the original virus sent to him from Paris. The royalties at issue amount to about Dollars 5m a year from HIV blood tests. More important, at least in French eyes, is the honour and glory of being undisputed discoverer of the Aids virus. However, with Dr Gallo continuing to deny all significant allegations against him, no early resolution of the affair is in sight.</p>

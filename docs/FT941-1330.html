			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Bruntcliffe at Pounds 835,000 In its first set of preliminary results since obtaining a full listing in May 1993, Bruntcliffe Aggregates returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 835,000. Turnover totalled Pounds 4.77m and basic earnings per share emerged at 2.2p. A single dividend of 0.5p is proposed. All turnover and profits relate to continuing operations from acquisitions during the year. With order books remaining buoyant the directors looked for a satisfactory year ahead. They said acquisitions would be the primary engine for growth but that they would only consider opportunities that were cash generative, profitable and had strong market positions.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Hopes for house kit imports Japan hopes to reduce its Dollars 60bn (Pounds 40bn) trade surplus with the US by importing North American wooden house kits, Paul Abrahams reports. The Japan External Trade Organisation (Jetro) is sending a 70-strong team to the North American west coast to encourage manufacturers of ready-to-assemble houses to try the Japanese market. 'The initiative's aim is not only to redress some of the trade surplus, but also to improve the quality of life in Japan,' said Mr Shusaku Hirano, Jetro's director of import promotion. North American wooden housing was believed to last twice as long as Japanese equivalents, he said, and their sound-proofing and insulation were said to be better. American housing would have to be adapted to the Japanese market, however. Besides instructions in Japanese, the kits required aluminium or steel shielding to cover the wooden window frames. These cannot be exposed to the elements under Japanese construction regulations. Even if Japanese consumers take to American homes, it will be an uphill task to cut the trade deficit. Of the 1.48m housing starts in Japan last year, only about 50,000 used North American methods, and of these no more than 2,500 were imported, Jetro says.</p>

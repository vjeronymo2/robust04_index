			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> ATTRACTING BUSINESS TOPS CITY'S AGENDA  </P> <P> Encouraging redevelopment, balancing the budget and working to enhance air  safety are the major concerns facing Buena Park in 1990, Mayor Donald L. Bone  says.  </P> <P> "We would like to finish the master plan for redevelopment," Bone said in a  recent interview. "Although much of the plan was completed last year, there are  still some i's to dot and t's to cross."  </P> <P> Bone said one of the biggest challenges is completion of "Auto Row," a string  of dealerships on Manchester Avenue at the Santa Ana Freeway. City officials  also hope to attract more new businesses to the city's entertainment corridor  along Beach Boulevard, which now includes Knott's Berry Farm and the Movieland  Wax Museum.  </P> <P> Bone said planning is under way for expanding redevelopment areas, possibly to  include the Buena Park Mall. Planners are also analyzing the potential  development of a 300,000-square-foot office building on Orangethorpe, next to  the Sequoia Athletic Club.  </P> <P> The city might revive a lapsed program offering low-interest loans to city  business owners who want to expand or improve, Bone said.  </P> <P> Air safety will continue to be a concern at Fullerton Municipal Airport, which  borders Buena Park, Bone said. Several incidents in the past year, including a  crash last fall in a Buena Park neighborhood, have led to clashes between  political leaders of the two cities, he said.  </P> <P> Buena Park leaders will try to "identify common concerns about the airport and  the crashes that have occurred recently," Bone said. "This situation has caused  relations to be somewhat tense. My goal is to relax that tenseness and find a  common ground."  </P> <P> Perhaps most immediate is the city's effort to eliminate a budget deficit, Bone  said.  </P> <P> The budget for the current fiscal year, ending in June, is $35 million, with a  projected deficit of more than $700,000. Salary increases for police and  firefighters have increased that gap, Bone said.  </P> <P> "When you look at the figures, you see one year," said Bone. "If you project  out and look at two and three years downstream, that's where we begin to come  into problems."  </P> <P> This month, planning for next year's budget will begin in earnest.  </P> <P> Bone said he expects "a thorough review of our fiscal policies and how we spend  our money."

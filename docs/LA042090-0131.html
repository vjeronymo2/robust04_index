			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EX-DETAINEE TELLS OF TIME IN PADDED ROOM  </P> <P> Testifying in a soft voice and occasionally weeping, an 18-year-old woman  described Thursday how she was carried, kicking and screaming, into a padded  room at Juvenile Hall during an angry outburst there three years ago.  </P> <P> The young woman, identified in court only as Letycia H., was the first former  Juvenile Hall detainee to take the stand in a class-action lawsuit challenging  a host of procedures there, including putting adolescents in "rubber rooms" and  tying their arms and legs to a bed with soft cloth restraints when they are  deemed to be out of control.  </P> <P> Letycia said her August, 1987, outburst began after staff members discontinued  a food-service job she held at Juvenile Hall -- a benefit doled out to the few  who "were good," she said -- and ordered her to move from her dormitory-style  accommodation with other girls to a single room in another unit of the hall.  </P> <P> Angry, the 15-year-old insisted on an explanation and got none. When she  refused to move out of her room, several staffers picked her up and carried her  to her new room, Letycia said. She screamed and pounded the door with her fists  and feet. No one tried to calm her down, she said. Instead, five minutes later,  three or four staff members came in, handcuffed her and carried her, kicking  and yelling, to the padded room, Letycia said.  </P> <P> "They took off my shoes and put me in the room, face down on the mattress on  the floor," she said. "They took off the handcuffs and told me I had to stay  there until I calmed down. . . . I hit the walls and screamed. I was still  upset.  </P> <P> "I didn't feel I needed to be in there. It made me feel like I really did  something wrong," she said, crying softly.  </P> <P> Letycia, dressed in a blue and white suit with her black hair smoothed into a  ponytail, testified that all she wanted was an explanation for why she was  being taken off food-service duty and moved out of her room with the other  girls.  </P> <P> When she asked to use the restroom, staffers responded "that there was a little  drain in the floor somewhere," Letycia said. She added that she was too  embarrassed to use it.  </P> <P> Letycia, formerly of Garden Grove, said in an interview that she was in  Juvenile Hall for several months in 1987 for giving a false name to a police  officer and for leaving the facility before she was officially released. She  had been there at least once before, for possessing a hypodermic needle.  </P> <P> On cross-examination, Kenneth Kasdan, an attorney for the county, portrayed her  as a malcontent who filed flurries of grievances over her treatment at the  hall.  </P></p>

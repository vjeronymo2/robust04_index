			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Crisis in Orange County rebounds on bond market Mr Arthur Levitt, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, said yesterday the financial crisis in Orange County, California, was 'significant' for investors and the market, and conceded that better disclosure might have brought it to light sooner. Fears the county may be forced to liquidate its Dollars 20bn (Pounds 12.8bn) fund portfolio have caused sharp widening of credit spreads in US domestic and Eurodollar bond markets. Orange County filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday after being hit by a loss of Dollars 1.5bn from dealings in the bond market. This has fuelled speculation that it will be forced to sell much of its Dollars 7.5bn portfolio of bonds, triggering a flood on to the world's markets and suppressing prices. These fears sent spreads - the difference in the yield on agency and corporate bonds and that on US Treasury bonds - significantly wider as the price of US corporate and agency bonds fell relative to the higher credit rated US Treasury bonds. The widening was initially more pronounced in the US domestic market but the nervousness spread to the Eurobond market yesterday, where spreads widened by about 5 to 10 basis points. Orange County's portfolio consists mainly of municipal and agency bonds, and the spreads on these instruments were hit hardest. 'There was a flight to quality and this put pressure on spreads,' said one bond trader in London. The market was also unnerved by rumours that other municipal funds might be concealing huge losses. San Diego County, also in California, said it had paper losses of Dollars 357m on a fund worth Dollars 3.3bn, largely because of its holdings of derivatives. Mr Paul Boland, county treasurer, was quoted as dismissing comparisons with Orange County, saying his fund was not leveraged and had no liquidity problems. Mr Levitt said the SEC had been monitoring Orange County before the crisis erupted there, and was watching other unspecified investment pools across the country. 'I would hope the balanced, calm approach to Orange County on the part of all participants will continue,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Democratic Kampuchea representative Chan </F> Youran by unidentified correspondent at the 15-16 June  roundtable talks in Phnom Penh; dated 23 June -- read by  announcer]    [Text] [Correspondent] Greetings, Your Excellency. You  recently attended the meeting in Phnom Penh of the roundtable  commission for national reconciliation and peace. On behalf of  the Voice of the Great National Union Front of Cambodia radio  [VGNUFC], please comment on the two items on that meeting's  agenda. Why did the meeting fail to agree on the agenda as  called for by the Cambodian nation and people, who want national  reconciliation and peace?    [Chan Youran] I would like to express sincere thanks to our  VGNUFC for giving me the opportunity to talk about this meeting.    On 15 June, the meeting, chaired by Samdech Nhoek Chulong,  representative of the king, agreed to abide by the king's  guidance by adopting the following agenda. First, an  unconditional, immediate, and permanent cease-fire nationwide.  Second, the minimal policy program proposed by the Party of  Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] to the meeting which has received the  king's consent.    During the discussion about the agenda, our Democratic  Kampuchea [DK] delegation expressed the following views:    1. The PDK was attending the meeting as a Cambodian side,  equal to all other Cambodian sides, with rights equal to other  Cambodian sides to discuss the two items.    2. Legally, these two items have the same status and value.  The meeting's responsibility is to discuss the two items  because they form an entity for national reconciliation and  peace. If only one item is discussed and the other left out,  this is neither just nor correct. This cannot solve the  Cambodian problem and achieve national reconciliation quickly.    Our nation and people very much want a quick end to the war  and their great suffering and hardship in order to have ordinary  lives again. Our nation and people want genuine national  reconciliation and national concord. Therefore, we ask that all  sides take this opportunity to respond to the sacred aspiration  of our nation and people by discussing the two items and  striving to solve the problem gradually.    The representative of Prince Ranariddh, chairman of  FUNCINPEC  [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful,  and Cooperative Cambodia], and the representative of Chea Sim  and Hun Sen of the Cambodian People's Party, puppet of communist  Vietnam, did not respond to these views. They only talked about  the cease-fire, but refused to discuss proper and strict  supervision. They did not accept a competent committee to deal  with this issue. So, our delegation said this: You are cheating  on this cease-fire because it is not genuine and definitive  throughout the country. It is not a cease-fire within the  framework of national reconciliation. It is a cease-fire without  proper and strict supervision by a competent committee or  technical group. Furthermore, you did not say a word about  national reconciliation because you are afraid of this. You  refused to talk about the minimal policy program, which is the  basis of the national reconciliation and peace policy. You only  talked about the cease-fire to dupe national and international  public opinion in order to continue fueling the war in Cambodia.    These people could not answer. They remained quiet; they  were stuck.    Samdech Nhoek Chulong, chairman of the meeting, and many  observers noted that our side's stance is correct and  reasonable. For this reason, Samdech Nhoek Chulong decided to  let our delegation read the PDK clarification on the minimal  policy program. I read our address dealing with the minimal  policy from the beginning to the end. These people had their  heads down.    In sum, these people categorically oppose national  reconciliation and peace. They oppose a genuine national  government and national army in accordance with the sacred  aspiration of our nation and people.    Our nation and people and the PDK, however, are absolutely  determined to achieve national reconciliation and peace so that  our Cambodia will not become a second Kampuchea Kraom [former  Cambodian territory now part of southern Vietnam].</p>

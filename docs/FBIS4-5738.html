			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hoang Van Hau] </F>   [Text] In early 1993, Binh Duong village in Vinh Phu  Province and Cuong Thinh village in Yen Bai Province were chosen  by the 2d Military Region headquarters as "pilot sites" for  youths to perform their military service locally in militia  units.    It is not that the enforcement of this policy has been  carried out without a hitch. Questions have arisen: What is  the growing role of the militia force as youths are now allowed  to perform their military service locally in militia  detachments? Will this policy have any impact on annual  military conscription criteria? How will operating funds be  guaranteed? These worries and questions have been gradually  ironed out and redressed.    The cadre-related task must be tackled first. All the  comrades selected must be those having a high sense of  responsibility and good skills in management and military  training. The contingent of instructors is reported to have  been reinforced by district military affairs agencies with  officers who have good training experience.    Thanks to satisfactory didactical propaganda, 100 percent of  the local youths of military age have volunteered to apply for  joining local militia units. This policy has won sympathy and  support from the people and from the families of the youths  concerned. After two months of training, trainees will be  equipped with political, technical, and combat tactics-related  knowledge equivalent to the level required from a new recruit.  In addition to their basic training program, trainees will also  study local economic development tasks, experiences on the  carrying out family economies, and stock-breeding and crop  cultivation techniques.    In order to ensure room and board facilities and every-day  life during the training course, various militia units have  successfully carried out the motto "Localities, families, and  individuals care together." Apart from the assistance provided  by the localities concerned, the families of the youths  concerned and their parent militia units have devised plans to  do economic businesses for self-sufficiency purposes such as  accepting contracts for tree planting, forestry protection,  stock-breeding, and farmland irrigation services.    After one year of implementation, although there remains a  number of newly-arising problems to be resolved, the qualities  of the local militia force have improved noticeably. Public  security and social order and safety in various localities have  been firmly maintained and social vices have been gradually  dispelled. Trainees have familiarized themselves with the  collective life and have been equipped with a military bearing.  Each member of militia detachments has become a positive factor  of their relevant localities and families in complying with  party policies, state law, and other regulations of the  localities concerned.</p>

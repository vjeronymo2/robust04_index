			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Windsor back in the black with Pounds 102,000 WINDSOR, the specialist sports and leisure industries insurance broker, has returned to the black following an internal reorganisation. The group recorded pre-tax profits of Pounds 102,000 for the six months to March 31, against losses of Pounds 373,000 last time. Operating income fell to Pounds 3.21m (Pounds 3.82m), largely reflecting the impact of the sale last November of Bishops-court Financial. Earnings per share of 0.21p compared with losses of 1.13p. Overall, the group generated about 20 per cent of its income from sports insurances, of which about a tenth is earned in the US. Mr Mike Eagles, chief executive, identified various types of prize indemnity insurances - technically known as contingency policies - as attractive growth areas. These policies cover the cost of paying bonuses to successful players or teams or prizes to winners of competitions designed to promote particular sports events, such as grand prix or golf tournaments. Windsor has recently broadened its base away from traditional property and liability insurances for the UK's football league clubs to develop its business in golf, motor racing, snooker, tennis and boxing. It also specialises in leisure industries sectors such as advertising agencies, commercial radio, restaurants and hotels, which contribute between 25 and 27 per cent of its income. It also places insurance in the London market on behalf of retail brokers specialising in high risk areas such as demolition contracting and asbestos removal.</p>

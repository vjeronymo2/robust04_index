			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Survey of International Standards (5): UK has 36 official groups Quality control in the UK is carried out by 36 accredited bodies, the largest and best-known of which is the British Standards Institution, writes Sheila Jones. These bodies assess management and production systems as well as product quality. Before operating, they are assessed by the National Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies, the central organisation responsible for ensuring that those seeking the right to give products their stamp of approval have first won approval themselves. Once an approved body is up and running, it is reviewed by the NACCB twice a year and reassessed every four years. In the global markets of the 1990s, manufacturers ignore quality systems and standards 'at their peril,' according to Mr Paul Hewlett, who has just retired as NACCB secretary. His successor, Mr Robin Bullock-Webster, takes over at the NACCB at a difficult time. The way in which quality control and certification is carried out in the UK has been much criticised in recent years. The criticism reached a crescendo earlier this year with the publication of a report - UK Quality Management - by the Science and Engineering Policy Studies Unit. The report asserted, among other things, that there was little to inspire confidence in a system that attracted its 'share of cowboys'. Mr Bullock-Webster concedes it is legal for anyone to set themselves up as a quality control assessor without NACCB approval. In addition to the 36 approved bodies, there are many organisations and consultancies selling advice on the implementation of standards and quality control. 'In this country there are many hundreds of consultants making a living out of 5750 (the BSI's production systems standard). I'm sure that the vast majority of those are fair, reasonable level-headed and well-meaning. There are inevitably some that are not.' Certification that is 'meaningful', says Mr Bullock-Webster, is 'that which has gone through the accredited process. There are possibly some 30,000 certificates which are now accredited on the market within the UK and I think that that probably, to a degree, speaks for itself. I'm not saying that we've got it all right, but we are trying to ensure that we do control the situation.' The NACCB has tightened up its surveillance of certification bodies and is carrying out market research among UK businesses 'to establish exactly where they think we're going right or where they think we're going wrong'. It is also running workshops on quality control and the NACCB's role. A further criticism, of the relationship between the NACCB and the BSI, has prompted the two organisations to break a link that has existed since the NACCB was set up. The BSI is itself split into two sections: BSI, which sets British standards; and BSI-QA, the quality assurance arm. BSI-QA is just another NACCB-approved certification body, perhaps best-known for its kite mark stamp of approval on products. However, the BSI is also responsible for NACCB funding. Mr Bullock-Webster points out that the while funding for pay and administration is chanelled through the BSI, the organisation has no involvement in policy, pay levels or recruitment. Nonetheless, the 'umbilical cord will be cut some time shortly.' The decision to break the link follows assessment of the NACCB last year by the European umbrella body for accreditation bodies, the EAC, as part of the process of harmonisation. The EAC broadly approved of the NACCB's operations but it felt that the BSI link 'could be construed as tying us rather too closely to the BSI,' according to Mr Bullock-Webster.</p>

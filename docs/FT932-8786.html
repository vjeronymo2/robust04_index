			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Query for UBS on fund claim THE Swiss Federal Banking Commission has asked Union Bank of Switzerland, the country's largest bank, to comment on statements by Mr Florio Fiorini, the imprisoned former head of the collapsed Sasea Holdings group, implicating the chairman of UBS in Italy's political corruption scandals. Mr Fiorini has told Geneva prosecutors Mr Nikolaus Senn, UBS chairman, assisted in the transfer of funds from Eni, state-owned Italian energy group, through a UBS account in Lugano to the Italian Socialist party in the late 1970s. Mr Fiorini was finance director of Eni at the time. Mr Senn, who was then UBS chief executive, initially denied the charge, published in the Swiss financial newspaper Cash two weeks ago. He then admitted to Cash that Mr Fiorini had met him in 1981 and asked that information on the account - which had been closed - be treated with the utmost discretion. In an interview with another newspaper published yesterday, Mr Senn said he could not rule out that Mr Fiorini had said the funds were destined for the Italian Socialist party.</p>

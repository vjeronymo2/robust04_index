			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> GROUP TRIES TO LIMIT CITY COUNCIL TERMS  </P> <P> A group of Newport Beach residents has begun a petition drive to limit City  Council terms to two.  </P> <P> This week, Newport Residents to Limit Council Terms filed the preliminary  documents necessary to amend the City Charter.  </P> <P> They plan to start collecting signatures by the end of next week, spokeswoman  Janine Gault said. Amending the City Charter would require a referendum on the  November ballot, she said.  </P> <P> Four of the council's seven members -- Ruthelyn Plummer, Donald Strauss, John  Cox and Evelyn Hart -- are in their third terms of office.  </P> <P> Strauss and Hart are up for reelection in November, 1990. There is no limit now  to the number of four-year terms that a City Council member may serve.  </P> <P> The petition drive began because "a lot of people would like to run for the  City Council, but choose not to run against incumbents," Gault said.  </P> <P> "We're not out to unseat anyone," Gault said, but believe "the two-term limit  would be in the best interests of the community."  </P> <P> The group has until July 1 to gather enough signatures from at least 15% of the  43,322 registered voters in the city, she said.

			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSITION 132;  </P> <P> TOO BIG A NET  </P> <P> Proposition 132 would ban the use of nets designed to grab fish by the gills or  trap them in folds of fine plastic line. The ban on gill nets and trammel nets  would cover all waters off the California coast for a distance of three miles.  </P> <P> The goal of the proposition probably is impeccable, even though commercial  fishermen who use both kinds of nets say the measure's purpose is not to spare  sea otters terrible deaths but to reduce the commercial catch so that sport  fishermen can land more.  </P> <P> But reaching the goal by writing the ban into a state document already three  times longer than the national Constitution is the wrong way to go about it.  </P> <P> Supporters of the ban say they need a constitutional amendment to make certain  that the Legislature could not lift the ban under pressure from commercial  fishing fleets. But an initiative statute would give virtually the same  protection to porpoises, sea otters and other creatures who are caught and  killed in gill nets by mistake.  </P> <P> Standard language in such ballot propositions forbids the Legislature to change  the will of the people except with amendments that strengthen the purpose of  the initiative. Even a change in the right direction requires a two-thirds vote  in both chambers.  </P> <P> Gill nets are fiendish devices, never more than when they break free from boats  and slide through waters killing everything in their path.  </P> <P> It would be different if amending the Constitution were the only hope for  marine life. But it isn't. A no vote on 132 is simply to suggest that the state  Constitution shouldn't be a laundry list.  </P></p>

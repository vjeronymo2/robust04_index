The replacement of Janez Jansa with  Jelko Kacin, former Democratic information minister and, before  that, Jansa's deputy in what was then the Secretariat for  Peoples' Defense, thus marked the political spring that could  quickly turn into a political winter. We can merely guess what  tilted the scales against the defense minister. However, it  seems that, this time, the prime minister did not find a magic  formula with which he could at least partially satisfy the main  protagonist of this -- as we have subsequently learned --  criminal game. Besides Jansa, it also involved Christian  Democratic [SKD] Interior Minister Ivan Bizjak, and primarily  President Milan Kucan, the likely mastermind of the entire game,  who was also instrumental in the downing of Peterle. Let us  just recall Kucan's carefully chosen, ominous words about  disqualifications and liquidations after the organization that  is supposedly backed by Kucan's circle realized that the Defense  Ministry had established the presence of its agents, even though  it did not identify them yet.    We would be naive to think that Drnovsek decided for the  replacement (only) because of the overstepping of their  authority by the defense ministry employees and the violation of  constitutionally guaranteed human rights. These were precisely  the arguments that a part of the former committee for the  protection of human rights put to him. The foundation stone for  the replacement was laid when the Democrats abandoned their  several-months-old pro-Demos policy and, together with some  political organizations, finally cut back on the defense funds.  By joining the Liberal Democratic Party, they covered their  backs in the face of an increasingly unfavorable outcome of the  [Maribor] arms' affair, whose main protagonists they were. The  interior minister of that time, Igor Bavcar, and the director of  VIS [Security-Information Service] Dr. Miha Brejc (as the latest  testimonies and the Maribor public prosecutor's indictment  suggest) with the cooperation of the president of the state  arbitrarily and independently of the Defense Council and the  Defense Ministry, which is authorized to issue permits for the  transit of arms, brought arms for Hasan Cengic to Maribor  airport. And how did the Christian Democrats, who will now be  the only "right-wing" party in the government, decide? It is  not very likely that the Social Democrats will stay in the  government -- despite Drnovsek's offer -- and accept another  ministerial post. This was implied by Jansa's clear warning to  Drnovsek immediately after the prime minister's decision was  announced to the public. The stance of the Christian Democrats  was not decisive enough. Their public statement demonstrated  that -- despite the demands for an investigation with clear  results -- they allowed Drnovsek to have a free hand. They only  added a warning that -- if the investigation shows so -- the  president of the state should also resign. However, how the  investigation will continue without Jansa is quite another  matter.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Brokers gloom on GMTV GOOD MORNING Television, the new commercial breakfast station, will not break even at the pre-tax level until 1996 according to James Capel, the stockbroker. In a generally gloomy assessment of ITV's financial prospects, the report says the deteriorating television advertising environment will be offset by GMTV, which succeeds TV-am, cutting its cost base. Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at Capel, has however increased his forecast loss for GMTV in its first year from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 3.5m and suggests that operating break-even will not come until 1995, and the first pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.5m not until 1997. GMTV is owned by Carlton Communications, LWT (Holdings), Scottish TV, Walt Disney and the Guardian and Manchester Evening News. Capel believes the outlook for UK television advertising has worsened since September.</p>

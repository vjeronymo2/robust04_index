			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / The peacekeeping trap With the end of the Cold War, the United Nations seemed at last able to live up to its charter mandate as the foundation of a better world order. And since the Gulf crisis of 1990-91, it has gained credibility as the legitimate enforcer of the international rule of law, with a rapid expansion of peacekeeping operations in crisis areas across the world. The war in Bosnia is about to test these expectations in the fire of reality. And the chances are that the United Nations, and the leading members of the Security Council, will come out of it badly burned. Ever since this savage war began, the outside world has feared to get involved, and has strained to keep it at arm's length. But television has made indifference impossible; progressively the international community is being dragged from humanitarian aid to political commitment, and now it is reaching the bar of desperate military decisions. With the no-flight ban, the United Nations Security Council last week took a significant and possibly fateful step down a road which could lead to direct military involvement in Bosnia. Nato member states made preparations to provide the combat aircraft to put the ban into action. And if this fails to bring the Serbs to an accommodation under the Vance-Owen peace plan, the Security Council will debate tougher sanctions against Yugoslavia. Certainly, bringing peace to Bosnia seems a logical extension of the UN's expanded peacekeeping role. Two years ago, the organisation had 15,000 peacekeepers around the world; today it has nearly 55,000 deployed in 14 different operations, from Cambodia to Somalia. Two years ago, in the two-year budget period 1990-91, the cost of UN peacekeeping operations was Dollars 819m; last year the cost of peacekeeping rose to Dollars 1.5bn. This year's peacekeeping budget is Dollars 2.5bn; but expanding activity means the final figure could work out at anything between Dollars 4.5bn and Dollars 7.5bn. Peacekeeping is now by far the organisation's single biggest activity, costing 50 per cent more than the UN's non-peacekeeping budget. The central problem in the peacekeeping equation concerns the use of force. If the blue helmets are only there to monitor a ceasefire that is already in place, the operation may be simple, cheap and uncontroversial. In Somalia, substantial force was required to guarantee humanitarian aid; but intimidation of the war-lords was not too difficult, and the UN may now be able to help restore the state. With the war in Bosnia, however, the UN is in territory which is not just uncharted but dangerous. The dilemma is that the international community is progressively getting hooked on a commitment to make peace in Bosnia before there is any reliable prospect of a peace agreement. If the warring parties sign an agreement, on the basis of the Vance-Owen peace negotiations, the UN will be bound to send troops to enforce it. Given what we know of Serbian war-aims, it seems likely that even an 'agreed' peace would have to be imposed by force. In short, the UN could find itself dragged progressively from peacekeeping into peacemaking, from the monitoring of peace to the making of war. Western governments can see the dangers all too clearly; and their generals have no desire to get into a no-win situation, which could lead to a military disaster, but which cannot provide a military solution to a political problem. On the other hand, the UN Security Council is now getting so deeply committed to the search for a solution, that it cannot easily declare the problem insoluble and simply walk away. The UN suspended its rescue convoys from Srebrenica after seven women and children died in the crush; but world opinion will inevitably demand that the rescues resume, because the need is so great. So the rescues will have to take place on a bigger scale. The hard lesson we may have to learn from the war in Bosnia, is that when peacekeeping is most desperately needed, it is likely to demand more than the international community is ready to give. This is not mainly a matter of money: last year's UN peacekeeping operations cost less than the New York City Police Department, and was a tiny fraction of one per cent of what the world spends on defence. No, the real trouble with this kind of peacekeeping is that it will quickly come up against three harsh limitations: military resources, the political will of national governments, and international consent. If the UN wants serious military capability it can get it only from three countries and one organisation: the US, France and Britain, and the Nato integrated command. But the UK is already alarmed at the strain on its military resources, even by its present rather modest commitment to Bosnia; it is demanding in advance a commitment to rotation by other countries. The Germans cannot go, and the Russians will inevitably collaborate with the Serbs. So where will the UN find other military forces that are both professional and politically disciplined, for an operation that is bound to last for years and years? But even if these three countries were able and willing to take on the burden, it would look terribly like a neo-imperialistic intervention, despite the blue UN helmets. That is surely not the kind of peacekeeping the rest of the world would want to endorse. In short, our vastly expanded expectations of the UN's peacekeeping role may already have out-run what is possible. Indeed, they may even have out-run what is desirable.</p>

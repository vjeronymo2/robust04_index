			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kyrgyz </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Orthodox Christmas message by President Askar Akayev; place </F> and date not given -- live or recorded]    [Text] Dear compatriots. Orthodox believers are  celebrating their great festival on 7 January, the birthday of  Christ. I congratulate in a most heartfelt way all our  Christian citizens on their great holiday and wish every success  in their work for the benefit of our motherland, health, and  happiness. May this solemn festivity unite Kyrgyzstanis around  the ideals of good, justice, mutual tolerance, and respect. We  highly value the activity of the Orthodox church aimed at  consolidation of compatriots irrespective of their outlook and  political beliefs, for strengthening of civil peace and  interethnic accord, and for spiritual renewal of our existence.    Our state sees its duty in helping people to share eternal  spiritual values. The new constitution of the Kyrgyz Republic,  which guarantees rights for freedom of belief and for spiritual  and cultural freedom opens up the way to a civilized human  communication based on cooperation, mutual help, and unification  of all creative forces.    I am convinced that this will play an important role in  overcoming the current difficulties and creating the life which  our people deserve. Happy Christmas!</p>

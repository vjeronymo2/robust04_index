			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPETING FOR THE HAWAIIAN SKIES;  </P> <P> AIRLINES BATTLE WITH FARES AND GIMMICKS TO WIN BIGGER SHARES OF A GROWING  MARKET.  </P> <P> With the purchase of troubled Hawaiian Airlines, former baseball commissioner  Peter V. Ueberroth and Newport Beach businessman J. Thomas Talbot are trying  their luck in one of the nation's toughest airline markets.  </P> <P> Led by Honolulu-based Hawaiian Airlines, U.S. airlines have often lowered fares  to attract passengers at the risk of reduced profits. "It's a very competitive  market," said Thomas Wogan, marketing manager for Delta Air Lines in Honolulu.  "It's a real challenge to make a profit."  </P> <P> On Sunday, a group that includes Ueberroth and Talbot made a bid for the  carrier, which has lost money for the last two years because of costly repairs  to its aging fleet and destructive fare wars. At their $22-a-share price, it  would cost the group nearly $22 million to gain 51% interest and nearly $43  million to buy all of the shares.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inter-Island Travel Up  </P> <P> Most major U.S. airlines fly to Hawaii. They are led by United, the largest  U.S. carrier in the market with 14% of the passengers, according to airline  industry analysts. Delta ranks second. In November, Phoenix-based America West  is scheduled to begin daily flights to Honolulu, which will intensify the  competition.  </P> <P> The battle for passengers isn't confined to trips from the mainland to Hawaii.  Hawaiian Airlines and its island competitor, Aloha Airlines, have flown  passengers between the five Hawaiian islands for years.  </P> <P> But recently, United Airlines entered the inter-island market, flying  passengers from Honolulu to Maui, Kona and Kauai. And in December, a new  airline, Discovery Airways, is expected to start flying between the Hawaiian  islands.  </P> <P> The airlines are attracted to Hawaii by statistics that show the market is  healthy and growing. According to the Hawaiian Department of Transportation, 9  million people flew between the Hawaiian islands last year, up from 7 million  in 1983.  </P> <P> The Transportation Department in Hawaii says 8 million people visited the state  from overseas destinations last year, compared to 5 million in 1983.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Popular Honeymoon Spot  </P> <P> Spurred in part by increased advertising by the state and bad weather in  Mexico, tourism in Hawaii swelled this year. According to the Hawaiian Visitors  Bureau, travel from the mainland is up 10% this year. The bureau had  anticipated just 3% increase.  </P> <P> Besides vacationers, Hawaii has long been a popular honeymoon spot for West  Coast newlyweds, and according to United Airlines spokeswoman Sara Dornacker,  the state is one of the airline's most popular destinations for free trips  under its frequent-flier program.  </P> <P> But despite its popularity with travelers, Hawaii isn't an easy place for  airlines to make money. Delta's Wogan says that, because of intense fare  competition, Delta takes in between 5 and 7 cents a mile for each passenger it  flies to and from Hawaii. On the mainland, Delta takes in 12.5 cents a mile for  every passenger.  </P> <P> "You can see what that implies for profits," said Wogan.  </P> <P> To attract customers, most airlines, including Hawaiian Airlines, have tie-ins  with big tour operators, an arrangement considered crucial to fill planes.  Airlines have tried a number of gimmicks to reach passengers.  </P> <P> United, for example, is serving passengers on its domestic flights Hawaiian  meals, such as sesame chicken with chocolate covered macadamia nuts for dessert  to create an interest in its Hawaiian service. A tiny orchid is placed on each  meal tray.  </P> <P> But the main area of competition is fares.  </P> <P> Most tickets to Hawaii are deeply discounted. Currently, the airlines offer a  $348 round-trip fare between Los Angeles and Honolulu that requires an advance  purchase and can't be refunded. That compares to United's unrestricted coach  fare of $1,032 round-trip.  </P> <P> Hawaiian Airlines, the discount leader, offers an even lower once-a-week fare  from Los Angeles. That special fare is $298 round-trip. No airline has matched  that fare, which is regarded as too low to be profitable.  </P> <P> "We look at their fares on a market-to-market basis," said Wogan. "Before you  match them, you have to decide if it makes prudent business sense."  </P> <P> HAL INC.

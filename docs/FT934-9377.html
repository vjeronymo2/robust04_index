			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / A Russian constitution for Yeltsin's time: Written for the president alone, the document's permanence is not guaranteed The great powers of the president, connected with his duration in office, will lead to oppression and ruin, said the columnist 'Cato', writing in the New York Journal in 1787, during the passionate debate over the US constitution. The immediate reaction to the Russian constitution, widely published for the first time yesterday, has been much the same. In both cases, the assertion of a new central power after the collapse of an old one has been seen as containing a potential for tyranny and for division. But most commentators have followed the lead given on Tuesday by Mr Vitaly Tretyakov, the editor of the Nezavisimaya Gazeta, who said the constitution was fashioned for Mr Yeltsin alone and could thus not stand for future presidents. Mr Alexander Tsipko, a leading candidate for the centrist Civic Union bloc, said yesterday that 'what was needed after October was something which unites the country, but this merely divides it into those who are for and those who are against the president'. Mr Nikolai Travkin, head of the Democratic party, talked of a constitution which could not gain the trust of the people. While Mr Gary Kasparov, the world chess champion, who is a candidate for the Russia's Choice group most closely associated with the president, dismissed the document as 'clearly temporary'. The central problems for the drafters of the constitution were the legacy of the Soviet era - in which all power was actually centred in the party but was titularly vested in the parliament; the recent tragic struggle between parliament and presidency following the blockage of political and economic reform; and the actions of the 89 republics and regions, which in the past two years have become increasingly assertive of their own rights and independence. They have thus attempted to construct a document which gives the presidency powers that are superior to those of the parliament. Like the French constitution, which was its largest influence, it gives the president the right to form governments and dismiss parliaments, lays out a complex impeachment procedure and has indirect regional elections to the upper house. However, the country lacks the French experience with a democratic system, and there is no guarantee that Mr Yeltsin would appoint a government from the largest bloc in parliament, if it were not to his liking. Mr Yeltsin, in his address to the nation on Tuesday night, said that the provisions for his impeachment by parliament and his ability to dismiss the deputies were, like nuclear weapons, there to preserve stability, and not to be used. In the thin fabric of Russian democratic practice, however, they could easily be used - especially if the majority parliament found itself in strong opposition to the president but baulked of any other means for expressing that opposition. Second, the constitution's drafters have insisted on the equality of the 89 subjects of the federation. That means that the 21 republics will have the same legal status as regions big and small, and the two cities of Moscow and St Petersburg. For some of the republics - especially the self declared independent republic of Chechnya, which will not hold elections on its territory and Tatarstan, which will not hold a referendum on the constitution - this dismisses the rights they enjoyed in the Soviet era (even if these were mostly on paper). In this sphere, much will depend on what powers are given to the subjects of the federation in the Federation Treaty - which has yet to be thrashed out. Finally, the constant change of mind and last-minute additions to the constitution by the president and his team is a sharp reminder to the future deputies of how little they could do about the status of parliament before it existed. Originally planned for a four-year term, its first term will be only two years. The deputies of the upper house (or Federation Council) will be elected for the first term, then will be selected by the regions in ways apparently left to their leaderships - which leaves the first term deputies looking rather spare. The very site of the new parliament has been proposed (though not yet decided) for the Academy of Administration on the outskirts of Moscow - hardly underscoring its prestige. Mr Yeltsin, having promised he would stand for president in pre-term elections next June, will now serve his full term apparently irrespective of what the new parliament thinks. The parliamentary democracies among the seven leading powers are the constitutional (and titlar) monarchy in Britain, Canada with a British model, and Germany, Italy and Japan with parliamentary systems reconstructed after the last war to avoid a future dictator. The presidential states are France and the US, both with revolutionary traditions from which their constitutions and their presidencies derive. Russia, it is clear, will join the latter group - but with no guarantee that this will be the final stab at a constitution.</p>

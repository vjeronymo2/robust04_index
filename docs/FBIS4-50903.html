			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 20 (CNS)--Policy-oriented dialogue  should be made between the two sides of the strait under the  premise of one China in order not to bring cross-strait  relations to a deadlock, the Chairman of the Taiwan Straits  Exchange Foundation (SEF) Mr Koo Chen-fu said yesterday. He  added that some Taiwan officials in charge of decision-making on  the Mainland policy showed differences with Mr Li Teng-hui on  his idea of the Mainland policy. The SEF chairman said that the  level which was responsible for such decision-making should be  upgraded to a higher level.    Mr Koo pointed out that the cross-strait relations was  considered the most important in Taiwan's external relations.  He added that he expected tense state in relations between the  two sides of the strait in coming August and September when  Taiwan would raise the issue of participation in the United  Nations. With this in mind he said that it was necessary for  the two sides to hold negotiation and that policy-oriented  dialogue should be made based on the framework of one China.  The SEF chief added that should no talk between the two sides  take place, it would lead to an impasse which was not beneficial  for the two sides of the strait.    The officials in the Mainland in charge of decision-making  on  the Taiwan policy were the officials at the top, according to Mr  Koo. In Taiwan it was another case. The Mainland policy held by  some Taiwan officials was different from that of Mr Li Teng-hui  while some officials just guessed at what kind of idea the  higher level held in regard to the Mainland policy or even based  on speculations. Mr Koo, therefore, has long since advocated  that the level responsible for decision-making on the Mainland  policy should be raised to a higher level.    The SEF chairman was convinced that the routine consultation  across the strait did not go conflict with dialogue between the  high levels of the two sides. He said it did not matter even  though no favorable outcome was made from such dialogue. Mr Koo  believed that mutual trust would be built up mainly by means of  frequent face-to-face communications. He suggested that the  routine talks between the two sides should cover economic topics  in addition to the current agenda.</p>

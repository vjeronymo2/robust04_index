			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: A tax cut that you'll hardly see It is not every day that the government sets a tax rate at one level, only to reduce it a few weeks later, writes Richard Lapper. But this is exactly what has happened with the insurance premium tax, announced in the November Budget. Unfortunately changes in the way the tax will be charged will offset the impact of the reduction and consumers will hardly notice the difference. The tax, which affects home, motor and some other insurances, will now be charged gross rather than net - before, rather than after, brokerage commission is deducted. The change will make it easier for insurance companies to collect the tax, and the rate has been lowered - from 3 per cent to 2 1/2 per cent - so as to reduce the extra burden on insurers and their customers which would have resulted. The yield - the amount of money raised - from the tax will now be about Pounds 760m in its first full year, rising to Pounds 835m in 1996-97. That compares with forecasts - calculated on the basis of a 3 per cent rate - of Pounds 775m and Pounds 840m. Policyholders will still face average increases of 35p a week on buildings, contents and motor insurance, although some companies have promised to absorb the tax rather than passing on costs to customers. Some readers are wondering if the insurance tax can be avoided by pre-payment, adds Bethan Hutton. But the government has taken steps to prevent this. Tax specialist Maurice Fitzpatrick, of Chantrey Vellacott, points out, however, that by shortening the term of annual insurance policies so that they expire in September, then renewing them for a year before October 1, you will escape liability for the tax for another year. Whether insurance companies agree remains to be seen.</p>

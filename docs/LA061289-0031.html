			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLONIALISM  </P> <P> Having exhausted his list of cliches and recycled a stack of banalities, Walter  Russell Mead ("Bashing the Japan Bashers," Opinion, June 4) attacks the British  with an outburst of scandalous revisionism.  </P> <P> Specifically, he refers to British colonialism as one of "unparalleled  cruelty," and in the next sentence dismisses Japanese colonial atrocities as  being "on a smaller scale." Now I hate trouble his thesis with historical  facts, but in one summer in Nanking, Japanese troops slaughtered more than  300,000 unarmed people. That is more civilian casualties than the British  incurred in two centuries of ruling two-fifths of our planet! And has Mead even  passing acquaintance with the history of Europe's other colonial powers? Not to  mention the United States, which came into existence through raping and  exterminating one Indian nation after another.  </P> <P> Indeed, democracy is Britain's most successful export, and in this league it is  unchallenged. Currently, 2 billion people live in freedom in countries that  were formerly colonies of Great Britain -- hardly a legacy of "unparalleled  cruelty."  </P> <P> MICHAEL WOODMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

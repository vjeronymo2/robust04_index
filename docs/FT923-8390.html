			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / World Trade News: China prepares to launch Australian satellite CHINA will try again to launch an Australian satellite on Friday, five months after a fire halted the last attempt and threatened to undermine its efforts to offer such commercial services, Daniel Green writes. Also hoping for success are BellSouth of the US, Cable and Wireless of the UK and the Mayne Nickless group of Australia, members of the Optus consortium owning the satellite. The consortium has paid Dollars A200m (Pounds 77m) to buy, launch and insure the satellite, to provide pay TV for Australia and New Zealand. The satellite, Optus B1, was built by Hughes Aircraft, part of General Motors. The rocket vehicle is the Long March 2E, a converted ballistic missile. A technical fault in the first stage of a Long March-2E rocket on March 22 caused a shutdown of its motors shortly before lift-off, aborting the programme. The failure raised doubts about China's ability to enter the world of commercial satellite launchers. The market is dominated by the US (General Dynamics, McDonnell Douglas and Martin Marietta) and Europe (Arianespace). Success for China would give it a lead over the other likely new entrant, Russia. Commercial launches by Japan and India are several years away. Optus B1 is to join the company's three-satellite network, the Optus A series, in orbit over Australia, servicing Australia and New Zealand. The second B-series satellite is set to be taken into orbit by a Chinese rocket in December.</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Oslo agrees Ekofisk field terms The Norwegian government yesterday agreed terms with Phillips Petroleum for new facilities for the ageing Norwegian North Sea Ekofisk field, ending two years of uncertainty over the future of the field, the hub of the world's largest oil transportation system. The development of new facilities for NKr20bn (Pounds 1.83bn) is the biggest investment in an oil field in the Norwegian North Sea sector in six years. The agreement also demonstrates the government's willingness to be more flexible on operating conditions: it extends production periods in Ekofisk for oil companies which have been delaying commitments to develop new oil and gas fields, claiming Norway's tax regime is too stringent at a time when oil prices are relatively low. In 1992 the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the oil industry watchdog, threatened to close the 250,000 b/d field by 1996 for safety reasons. Phillips last year submitted interim plans to improve the safety and operational reliability of the field which were rejected as inadequate by the authorities. However, the safety issue has been resolved because the old facilities will gradually go as new investment takes place. Phillips Petroleum Norway, which holds 37 per cent of Ekofisk, had been reluctant to invest further in it because its operating licence ran only up to 2011, long before production was due to end. Under the deal, Mr Jens Stoltenberg, the industry and energy minister, said the government would extend Phillips' licence to 2028 and waive a production tariff for the new facilities during the period 1999-2028, saving an estimated NKr900m.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Gummer plans bonds guidelines THE government is to issue guidelines to ministerial departments which demand performance bonds from construction companies which are awarded work, Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said yesterday. Contractors have become concerned at the use of 'on-demand' bonds which allow customers to withhold payments without having to prove first that contractors are in default. Mr Gummer said: 'There appear to be circumstances where departments consider it reasonable to seek bonds linked to specific conditions. We need to be sure, however, that where they are used the practice across government reflects best procurement policy. 'The guidelines will take as their starting point the unacceptability of on-demand bonds encashable without regard to performance. Such bonds are unfair. They can restrict industry's funds and undermine the recovery.'</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Arts: Cherubini's Beethoven - Concert Not old Cherubini the Franco-Italian opera composer, but the young(ish), all-German Cherubini Quartet, who are delivering the complete 'cycle' of Beethoven quartets at the Wigmore Hall. Though they have not yet recorded anything by their eponym, their recent recording of all Mendelssohn's quartets has excited admiration and delight. On Wednesday, during the first three numbers of Beethoven's opus 18, one could hear what excellent Mendelssohn interpreters they must be. About their Beethoven I was less persuaded. Since they are not merely born-again Mendelssohnians but highly cultivated performers, they offered many passing rewards and suave insights; transparent balance too, unimpeachable tempi, a cool, intellectual grasp of structure - and even some calculatedly playful moments. Yet there was never much muscle, despite their incisive fortissimo playing, nor much sign of young Beethoven's truculent thrust. Their leader, Christoph Poppen, is a violinist with a soft, sensitive timbre of no great amplitude. In the romantic drama of the 'Adagio affetuoso ed appassionata' of the F major quartet, for example, while the lower strings grew properly forceful and doomy his own song - which should carry warmly over it all - remained gentle and wan. In the G major, where Beethoven plays at being gracious whilst emitting constant hints of something more rumbustious, graciousness was all. More typical of their best strengths was their subito diminuendo, an artful drop into keen whispers, which they exploited often; also their delicate, knowing indentation of musical paragraphs, accomplished with unanimous fluency. Finesse of that kind is ideal for Mendelssohn, a precociously conservative composer who never needed to advertise himself, whose radical turns were always disguised by perfect polish. The Beethoven of the opus 18 quartets, however, was determined to show not only how well he had mastered the arch-Classical medium, after Haydn and Mozart, but how much unfamiliar, unsettling power he could invest in it. That was scarcely to be felt here. At the Cherubini's hands, the young Turk was made to sound like a serenely assured old pro. Far from aiming to recapture the original force of the music, they dressed it reverently in period costume. It should be interesting, at least, to hear how they adapt their pretty style to the towering last quartets which come at the end of their cycle on July 7, 9 and 10.</p>

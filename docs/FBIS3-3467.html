While the gap between the two regions  is historical, however, it's widening is real.    During the current National People's Congress session,  although western deputies still called for state support and  preferential treatment in terms of policies, funds, and  projects, more and more people started laying more emphasis on  facing the reality that called for a quick catch up. The  phenomenon has unveiled an important fact: the western region is  awakening.    First of all, it is necessary to point out that there are  many difficulties in developing the western region: geographical  restraints, relatively poor infrastructure, late start, exodus  of qualified personnel and funds to the east, and others. It is  completely reasonable for them to request for state help. What  is commendable is that more westerners are now focusing their  sights on the inner layers of the problems.    In what ways has the western region been inferior to the  eastern region?    -- Lagging behind in thinking and concept. Several deputies  from the minority nationalities in Ningxia and Xinjiang have  pointed out: While others have been using air travel in pursuing  the four modernizations, we have to stop riding a donkey in  search of a meal. To accelerate development in the minority  nationalities regions along the frontiers, it is essential to  continue emancipating minds, renew concepts, overcome the  mentality of "a little fortune will be enough to bring a sudden  change and not getting rich does not mean no comfort," and  really take "conducive to three causes" [conducive to developing  the productive forces of our socialist society, increasing the  overall strength of our socialist country, and improving the  people's living standard] as the sole yardstick in gauging our  work. The change in concept heralds the awakening of the  western region.    -- Under development of village and town enterprises.  Deputies from Sichuan Province stated that, although the  production value of Sichuan's village and town enterprises  increased 95 percent last year, its absolute quantity is still  far less than the developed coastal region. In comparison, the  difference of per capita value of total social production among  agricultural population between the western and eastern regions  is 5,897 yuan, of which segment of village and town enterprises  accounted for 84.5 percent. The western region's backwardness  lies in village and town enterprises; it is also in these very  village and town enterprises where we find potential and hopes.    -- Small steps in opening up to the outside world. Western  deputies have discovered that, although the doors of the  provinces, counties, and mountain villages are wide open, people  may still not be coming; yet, despite mountain after mountain  and river after river, nothing can block the flow of qualified  personnel and funds toward the east. This is mainly due to the  role of market mechanisms. According to them, as far as opening  up is concerned, there is no such thing as being situated at the  rear; what is intolerable is sitting idly at the doorstep and  waiting for guests to appear and blaming everyone and  everything but oneself. To channel in funds, technologies, and  qualified personnel from other provinces and countries, the  western region must rely on their own superiority and take the  initiative in launching the offensive.    What are the western region's advantages? It's resources.  Unlike the past, when westerners refer to the definition of  resources today, they do not merely mean "the rich natural  resources on and under the ground." They have further  discovered that its untapped big markets, ample labor supply,  existing state-owned large and medium enterprises, "third-line"  enterprises, universities and colleges, and scientific research  academies and institutes are all valuable resources of the  western region.    Western deputies said: With help from the state, support  from the eastern region, opportunities brought about by a market  economy, and joint efforts of the westerners, the western  region's resources superiority will certainly be translated into  comprehensive economic superiority that will gradually narrow  the gap between the eastern and western regions before a sure  economic takeoff.</p>

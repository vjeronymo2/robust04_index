			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Chunnel contracts go-ahead near THE European Commission looks likely to approve the basic contracts to provide freight, passenger and sleeper rail services through the Channel tunnel before the August holidays, following a long competition inquiry. But Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, wants to establish the principle that private operators can compete with state railway companies, even if there is little pressure at the moment from potential rival services. If the Commission decides to outlaw or substantially amend the contracts, that could further delay the opening of the tunnel, due in early 1994. Even so, Mr Van Miert, who used to oversee EC transport policy until he took over the competition portfolio in January, is said to be keen to encourage the cross-Channel link. His spokesman said yesterday that an announcement was expected 'pretty soon'. Eurotunnel, which will operate the tunnel, and British and continental European railways have sought clearance under EC competition rules for a series of contracts. Most important is the deal between Eurotunnel, British Rail and SNCF, the French state railways, which gives the railways the right to take up 50 per cent of the tunnel's capacity for passenger through-trains during Eurotunnel's 55-year operating concession. The other 50 per cent will be used by Eurotunnel itself for shuttle services between the two ends of the tunnel. The Commission was originally examining the possibility of reducing the length of the contract, perhaps to as little as 30 years, to let private operators compete with BR and SNCF. The Brussels authorities are now considering how to leave the contract open to competition without jeopardising the financing of the link. The Commission is also completing its consultations on the exclusive contracts for freight and sleeper services. Yesterday, it published the official notice inviting comments on European Night Services (ENS), the sleeper joint venture majority-owned by BR in partnership with French, Dutch, German and Belgian railways. Parties have been given 30 days to submit views on the agreement, which the Commission believes could infringe competition rules. In practice, however, there are few potential competitors who could meet the high cost of entering the sleeper market. ENS has already placed an order, said to be worth Pounds 100m, for 139 sleepers to be built by Metro-Cammell, a subsidiary of GEC Alsthom. The deadline for comments on freight services through the tunnel passed at the end of March.</p>

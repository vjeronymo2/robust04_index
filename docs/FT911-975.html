			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Tace board prepares to fight as Norwich Union steps up attack THE BOARD of Tace, the embattled environmental control equipment group, yesterday said it would fight Norwich Union's efforts to install a new board after last week's institutional shareholder revolt. Tace said the requisition for an extraordinary general meeting to decide on Norwich Union's proposal to install Mr Michael Beckett as chairman at the head of a new board was 'damaging and unjustified'. It said Tace shareholders should continue to back the team led by chairman Sir David Nicolson, who was installed against the wishes of the institutions earlier this year. In a sharp attack on interference from institutional shareholders, the board said Norwich Union's pressure last year on the Tace board to find a buyer for the company had cost the group Pounds 500,000. This referred to the fee charged by Hambros for time spent seeking a buyer. After no buyer emerged the institutions continued their pressure and forced the resignation of Mr Jock Mackenzie, Tace's founder, who had let head office costs run out of control. Tace said Norwich Union's actions were unjustified because pre-tax profits had risen by 24 per cent to end-September last year and because overheads had already been cut by Pounds 750,000 per year. Norwich Union rejected Tace's comments. Pre-tax profits were still lower than 1987 levels, earnings per share had halved over the period and that apart from the chairman, management was unchanged. The insurance company also said that institutions had been calling for overhead cost cuts for a year. The cuts had only been made because of Mr Beckett's brief stint on the board before he resigned last month after falling out with Sir David. Norwich Union and Framlington together control 21 per cent of Tace but claim to have institutional backing from shareholders controlling 40 per cent. Tace said it has 'indications of support' from shareholders controlling 29 per cent of the equity but this does not include any major institutions. The group did not say when it would hold the EGM. It is required to set a date within 14 days of Norwich Union's requisition notice on May 3. The meeting can be held up to four weeks after the date is set.</p>

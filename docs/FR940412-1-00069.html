			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Twenty-five new materials are proposed for inclusion in 46 CFR part 148 as materials which require special handling when transported in bulk by water. All of the twenty-five are covered by the BC Code; in addition, eleven are regulated by the HMR (49 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter C), and five are currently subject to Coast Guard Special Permits. Twelve of the materials proposed for inclusion in 46 CFR part 148 are classified as MHB in the BC Code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are ten materials, classified as MHB in the BC Code, which have not previously been regulated by the Coast Guard, either in 46 CFR part 148 or by Special Permit. It is the Coast Guard's position that these materials, if handled improperly when loaded as bulk cargoes, pose an unacceptable risk to the vessel and crew. For many of these materials, monitoring of the cargo space for toxic or flammable gases and oxygen will be required under Chapter VI of SOLAS 74/83 as amended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The intent of this proposal is to include in 46 CFR part 148 the above mentioned twenty-five materials and any special handling procedures associated with these materials, including those requirements which will be imposed by Chapter VI of SOLAS 74/83 as amended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As of April 1, 1993, the Coast Guard had the following 45 Special permits outstanding:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 4,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,xl25,xl25,xl25,xl25 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> SP 8&hyph;78  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 2&hyph;85  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 7&hyph;90  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 2&hyph;92  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SP 9&hyph;78  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 5&hyph;85  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 8&hyph;90  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 3&hyph;92  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SP 1&hyph;79  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 6&hyph;85  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 1&hyph;91  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 4&hyph;92  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SP 7&hyph;79  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 3&hyph;86  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 2&hyph;91  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 5&hyph;92  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SP 1&hyph;80  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 1&hyph;87  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 3&hyph;91  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 6&hyph;92  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SP 5&hyph;82  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 2&hyph;87  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 4&hyph;91  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 7&hyph;92  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SP 6&hyph;82  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 3&hyph;87  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 5&hyph;91  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 8&hyph;92  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SP 4&hyph;83  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 5&hyph;88  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 7&hyph;91  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 1&hyph;93  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SP 7&hyph;83  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 3&hyph;89  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 8&hyph;91  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 2&hyph;93  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SP 8&hyph;83  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 5&hyph;90  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 9&hyph;91  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 3&hyph;93  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SP 1&hyph;84  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 6&hyph;90  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 1&hyph;92  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 4&hyph;93  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=22 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> l  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> l  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> SP 5&hyph;93 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The above Special Permits, which affect bulk solid cargoes such as ammonium nitrate fertilizers, ferrosilicon, and metal ore concentrates would be terminated as of their expiration dates following publication of a final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated earlier, sixteen comments were received in response to the ANPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Five of the comments requested that the Coast Guard reconsider the necessity of regulating unmanned inland barges in the same manner as oceangoing vessels. It was never the intent of the Coast Guard to require unmanned barges to comply with the same requirements as manned vessels. This position is evidenced by question nine in the ANPRM. Barges would be specifically exempted from complying with the stated requirements in several places in the NPRM. For example, barges would not be required to carry any gas monitoring equipment. The Coast Guard recognizes that the SOLAS Convention applies only to self-propelled oceangoing vessels, and that to require vapor detection equipment on unmanned barges would be unnecessary and impractical since the primary purpose of the equipment is to protect the vessel's crew from being exposed to harmful vapors or entering spaces which lack the oxygen necessary to support life. Placing personnel on the vessel to take measurements would increase the likelihood of introducing a source of ignition that would not otherwise be present. This equipment would also be of little benefit on open hopper barges, where any vapors generated escape to the atmosphere.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. One comment suggested that the responsibility of the shipper to provide shipping papers be stated with more specificity. The Coast Guard has adopted this suggestion. Paragraph (a) of &sect;148.60 would contain a provision requiring that the shipping paper be prepared by the shipper. Additionally, in several sections, including &sect;&sect;148.15(a) and (b), 148.25(a) and 148.90(c), the responsibility of the shipper would be further clarified. These sections would state that it is the shipper's responsibility to determine if a Special Permit is required, and to apply for the Special Permit. The shipper would also be responsible for producing the originating shipping paper, and, most importantly, the shipper would be responsible for passing information to the master of the vessel (or the tug or towboat operator) concerning the nature of the cargo to be loaded and any necessary precautions to be taken while loading and transporting that cargo.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Several comments stated that classification of previously unregulated materials as hazardous would impose unforeseen burdens on the shippers of these materials. The comments expressed concern that the materials would be subject to regulations covering all modes of transport, including truck and rail, and that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements for Material Safety Data Sheets and Hazard Communication Programs would be applied to shipments of the material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

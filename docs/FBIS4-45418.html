			<p>`Protecting'   Traffickers   <F P=102> 94WB0041B Mexico City PROCESO No 914 in Spanish 9 May 94 pp  20-21 </F>  <F P=103> 94WB0041B </F> <F P=104>  Mexico City PROCESO No 914 </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gerardo Albarran de Alba] </F>   [Excerpts] According to the former attorney general of the  republic and current Mexican ambassador to France, Ignacio  Morales Lechuga, the increase "in violence, killing, and drug  trafficking" in Baja California [BC] "is partly explained by a  very close relative" of Governor Ernesto Ruffo. In a telephone  interview, Morales Lechuga remarks: "It is obvious that the Baja  California authorities have been protecting the Arellano Felix  group since November 1992."    He adds: "The incidents in Tijuana are hard evidence.  Neither  the Attorney General's Office [PGR] nor Baja California society  has any further doubt that the state justice system is  responsible for the protection given to drug traffickers, and  for the wave of violence associated with that phenomenon."    Just days before the arrest of the Baja California state  deputy attorney general, Sergio Ortiz Lara, Morales Lechuga gave  his version of the relationship between the Baja California  government and the Attorney General's Office while he headed  that department.    From the beginning of his administration, the drug  trafficking problem has hounded Ruffo, who even told Lechuga  confidentially that "certain persons had approached his family.  He did not say much, but referred to drug traffickers. He told  me this incidentally, in a casual manner, while waiting for a  hearing. He never made any further comment about it." [passage  omitted]    Lechuga gave his own account: "It is public knowledge that,  during the investigation of the incidents that occurred at a  discotheque in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, credentials in the  names of drug dealers were found, accrediting them as Baja  California Judicial Police agents. This was officially reported  to that state's attorney general and governor (there is even a  specific report in the respective preliminary investigation), so  that the authenticity of those credentials and, particularly,  how they were obtained, could be investigated. No results of the  investigation have yet been published. Of course, if there is a  culpable default, it will have to be established based on the  previous data that have been reported nationally.    "Furthermore, the Baja California governor would have to be  asked whether he is familiar with Article 120 of the  Constitution, because that regulation requires the local  executive branch to ensure compliance with federal laws. In  other words, if he knew of the existence of violations or  crimes, he should have acted, and not merely given notice. He is  the responsible official elected by the population for that  purpose, and is answerable to the nation for anything that  occurs in his state's territory. We officials do our duty with  acts and results, and not with alleged charges and reports.    "All of us, including the aforementioned governor and the  Baja California population, would fully agree that the violence,  killing, and drug trafficking have increased since his  government took office. Part of the explanation lies with a  close relative of the state's chief executive." [passage omitted]    According to Morales Lechuga, Ruffo "minimized or  underestimated the state's serious insecurity problem. His  explanation always was that the drug traffic was a federal  responsibility.    "The governor acted contrary to Article 120 of the  Constitution, which not only authorizes, but obliges Mr. Ruffo  to relinquish his pretense, so as to fight and take action  against the drug traffic." [passage omitted]    "Governor Ruffo never provided us with evidence or proof  regarding murders connected with the drug traffic. I would be  satisfied if he had explained to me the origin of his Judicial  Police credentials, and the way in which those drug traffickers,  later killed in Puerto Vallarta, obtained them.    "We are striving to counteract antisocial behavior, not  against the governor, nor on behalf of anyone in particular."  [passage omitted]    PROCESO: Governor Ruffo also complained that the  Federal Judicial Police were involved in the drug traffic and in  the disappearance of the existing information.    Lechuga: I made that statement publicly and  privately. I told him several times: Any PGR public servant who  commits violations of the law should be the object or subject of  the pertinent legal procedure. The fact that one holds a federal  position is no license for impunity, nor for undermining the  power of the local authorities. I asked that of all the  governors: that they not be permissive, just as I was not. Do  you know how many remands we made to courts for crimes of PGR  public servants?    PROCESO: No, I do not know.    Lechuga: It was 376, between 1 June 1991 and 31  December 1992. We remanded 258 Federal Judicial Police agents,  26 commanders, 34 group chiefs, 34 agents of the Federal Public  Prosecutor's Office, and 24 civil servants from other PGR areas.  <H5>  Ruffo Should Be Investigated: Clark Alfaro </H5>   Moreover, the Binational Human Rights Center (CBDH)  petitioned the Baja California Congress (for the second time in  less than three months) to investigate Governor Ruffo and the  state's now ex-attorney general, Juan Francisco Franco Rios,  "for concealing and tolerating the drug traffic."    According to Victor Clark Alfaro, director of the CBDH (a  nongovernmental agency in Tijuana), the petition is based "on  its own investigations, on meetings with high-ranking officials  of the Attorney General's Office, and on investigations  3355/DGM93 and 540/94, opened by the PGR."    On 9 March, the CBDH petitioned the local congress for the  first time to investigate the governor and the then still state  attorney general. Ruffo's investigation was requested "for  acting irresponsibly, concealing information, and not taking  appropriate action"; and Franco's, for the confrontation between  State Judicial agents under his command and Federal Judicial  agents, on 3 March, in Tijuana.    Now, with the arrest of Deputy Attorney General Ortiz Lara,  the CBDH claims to be "encouraged to see the PGR finally  deciding to intervene in the matter with two investigations. For  the first of them, at least, it has all the evidence at hand for  taking appropriate action against Ruffo's officials."    It admits that this move is being made "in a highly  dangerous  environment, with politico-electoral connotations, because  anything associated with corruption in Baja California assumes a  different dimension, since it has the first PAN [National Action  Party] government in the country.... Until yesterday, that had  deterred the PGR from acting."</p>

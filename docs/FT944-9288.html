			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / MAM calls halt to accepting 'soft commissions' Mercury Asset Management, the UK's largest fund management company, has decided that from next January it will no longer accept 'soft commissions' - free goods or services - from brokers it agrees to channel business through around the world. MAM's move comes as regulators in the US, UK and Hong Kong are scrutinising the rules on soft commissions out of concern they can lead to a subtle form of bribery which harms the interests of the clients on whose behalf funds are managed. Fund managers may pay more for securities than they ought to in order to generate the agreed level of business. In the UK, the move is likely to heighten pressure on MAM's competitors to adopt a similar stance as pension fund clients seek greater transparency in fees they pay to their fund managers. 'We have seen and very much felt the move towards clean fees,' said Mr Colin Clark, marketing director at MAM. He said that MAM has taken a tough line on soft commission for several years and that the value of services which they receive under soft commission arrangements is 'under Pounds 2m' per year. Imro, the UK self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, has recently issued a discussion document which proposes restricting the types of goods and services which fund managers can accept under soft commission arrangements. 'Regulators internationally have felt there was scope for abuse around the boundaries,' said Mr Robin Clark, director of monitoring at Imro. 'It is one thing to accept (soft commissions) for research and another for travel to warm sunny climates,' he said. Earlier this year, Imro fined a division of Abbey Life for allowing its fund managers to accept free travel to the US and Asia under soft commission arrangements. Under soft commission arrangements, brokers agree to the provision of such things as research, performance measurement services, Reuters or Bloomberg screens in exchange for a fund manager's guarantee that a minimum amount of business will be executed through the firm. Soft commission services are typically those which fund managers would normally have to pay for out of their own pocket. It would be considered an abuse to use soft commissions to pay for office furniture, rent or entertainment expenses. Imro intends to issue guidelines banning fund managers from accepting certain goods and services paid for by commissions with strings attached. In Hong Kong, where the use of soft commissions is widespread, the Securities and Futures Authority has provoked outcry among the broking community by announcing it would undertake a similar review of soft commission arrangements. The US has recently increased disclosure requirements for mutual fund managers who accept services with strings attached and is under pressure to do more. A difficulty is enforcing restrictions on foreign business.</p>

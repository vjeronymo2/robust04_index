			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CANADA TRUCKERS BAR U.S. LANE  </P> <P> About 30 Canadian truckers blocked a lane of truck traffic bound for the United  States today, the second protest in five weeks over high taxes and government  policies they say threaten their livelihood.  </P> <P> The parked trucks did not impede cars from crossing the Ambassador Bridge  between Detroit and Windsor as traffic moved freely in another northbound lane  of Route 401.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, about 12 trucks parked along the Peace Bridge between Ft. Erie,  Ont., and Buffalo, N.Y., shortly after midnight.  </P> <P> Despite the truckers' call for a nationwide border protest, no other blockades  were reported along the 4,000-mile U.S.-Canadian frontier.  </P> <P> The drivers say they are losing work to U.S. truckers who pay less for fuel and  have lower taxes and insurance costs.  </P></p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: First-quarter rise at BankAmerica due to cost cuts BankAmerica, the second largest banking group in the US, yesterday reported a modest increase in first-quarter earnings to Dollars 513m, or Dollars 1.27 a share. In the same quarter last year, the bank earned a profit of Dollars 484m, or Dollars 1.19. The improvement in earnings, however, was due entirely to cost reductions and lower loan loss provisions, which helped offset reductions in trading and net interest income. Like the rest of the industry, BankAmerica suffered in the latest quarter from the sharp rise in US interest rates, which squeezed its net interest margin, and from unfavourable conditions in the equities, bond and currency markets, which cut into trading profits. BankAmerica said that net interest income declined by 3 per cent to Dollars 1.79bn as the bank's net interest margin shrank by 27 basis points to 4.46 per cent. The total of loans outstanding in the quarter was little changed compared with a year earlier, at Dollars 123.4bn. Non-interest income fell 8 per cent to just over Dollars 1bn, a reflection primarily of a drop in trading income to Dollars 74m from Dollars 164m a year ago. Various fee and commission incomes, however, held steady. Non-interest expenses fell almost 3 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 1.78bn, its lowest level since the 1992 merger with rival California bank, Security Pacific. Provisions for loan losses were Dollars 125m, almost half what they were in the same quarter a year ago. Yesterday's results had little impact on BankAmerica's share price, which edged Dollars  1/2 higher to Dollars 42 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / MGN to guarantee pension payments BANKS controlling more than half of Mirror Group Newspapers' shares have agreed, after weeks of negotiations, to require any new owner to make up the shortfall in its pension funds. Ms Ann Scurfield, solicitor at Berwin Leighton which represents current MGN employees, said the banks - and the company's administrators - had been persuaded 'by sheer commercial logic' that the guarantee is needed to reassure current employees that their pensions will be safe regardless of who owns the company. MGN's management has already agreed to make up the shortfall in the pension fund - an amount estimated at Pounds 300m over the next 10 to 20 years - left by the fraud of the late Mr Robert Maxwell. A spokesman for the Mirror Group Management Consortium, a group headed by Sir Peter Parker which is seeking a management buy-out of the paper, yesterday welcomed the new clause. 'It puts other bidders on the same footing as ourselves,' the spokesman said. The group had offered to make up any deficit in the pension fund, although the company's administrators had said there was no legal obligation for any new owner to do so. The amendment to the trust deed will create that legal obligation, but only if the scheme is wound up, said Mr John Pearson, of solicitors Lovell White Durrant which represents MGN Under complex arrangements to salvage the pension funds, three new schemes were set up. The first, which holds all the assets not stolen by Mr Maxwell  -estimated at Pounds 115m to Pounds 150m - and any assets recovered from banks, is being used to meet payments due to current pensioners. The second, which is intended to pay past service pensions, has no assets except for the annual contributions from MGN. The third is a new scheme covering pension obligations of current employees and funded by contributions from workers and the company. Berwin Leighton also said steps have been taken to ensure the independence of the pension scheme's current board of trustees. In addition to seven management representatives, there will be five employee representatives, two pensioner representatives and an independent chairman.</p>

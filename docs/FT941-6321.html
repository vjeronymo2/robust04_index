			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: GKN/Westland Westland's defence document is notably short on pictures of burning bridges. Perhaps that is because GKN will hold 45 per cent of Westland's shares even if the bid fails completely. So whatever the outcome, the two companies will have to live together. Yet while Westland avoided rough and tumble, it did not cede much to GKN either. The gentlemanly nature of the campaign may not be sustainable if both sides become entrenched. Westland's defence rests firmly on prospects for EH101 orders and the possibility that the Apache will become the next British Army attack helicopter. Veterans of the 1985-86 capital reconstruction will remember that large claims were made for the Black Hawk, and the orders never materialised. Still, while there are risks in relying on projections to the year 2000, Westland's new management has a good track record. Loyal shareholders may wonder why, having waited so long, they should grab a bird in the hand now when there could be more than two in the bush. There is a case for supporting Westland, at least until it fails to meet its projections. GKN's best point is that it could bolster Westland's strong but small balance sheet. Customer stage payments should cover Westland's working capital needs, but there is little margin for error. With Westland's shares 15 per cent above the offer, the market clearly thinks GKN is going to have to pay substantially more for victory. Whether GKN is prepared to raise its offer and its gearing enough is another question.</p>

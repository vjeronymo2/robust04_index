			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / World Trade News: US, Japan closer to machine tool deal THE US has agreed with Japan key elements for phasing out by the end of 1993 'voluntary' quotas on machine tools, the US trade representative's office said yesterday. The deal comes after five months' talks following the announcement by President George Bush in December that the industry, which he said was vital to national security, should have another two years of quotas. In 1986, Japan and Taiwan agreed to limit their exports to their 1981 market share in several categories of machine tools. Both governments, especially Taiwan, have been less willing this time. A Japanese official said Tokyo would sign only after the US had agreed a similar pact with Taiwan. Under the pact, Japan will keep its US market share for numerically-controlled lathes, machining centres and numerically-controlled punching and shearing machines to the present level this year, limiting any increases to 2.31-2.8 percentage points next year, Japanese officials say. Under the 1986 pact, Tokyo limited its market share to 57.47 per cent (lathes), 51.54 per cent (machining centres) and 19.25 per cent (punching and shearing machines). An Association For Manufacturing Technology official said the pact with Japan was expected to provide leverage for a Taiwan deal. Extra pressure is being supplied by Congress. The arrangement would allow imports from Japan to rise over their 1987-91 Voluntary Restraint Agreement levels by 264 units in 1993, with two-thirds of the increase coming in the second half of the year. Included in this would be 125 lathes, 119 machining centres, 14 punching and shearing machines and six milling machines. Two senators and two congresswomen have introduced legislation to freeze quotas at their original levels, but in its present form, the bill has little chance of passage.</p>

Proposals cannot combine NIS countries with those of Central and Eastern Europe. The Agency's main objective is to foster interaction between American and foreign youth. Consequently, extensive interaction is a requirement. Proposals should demonstrate how American and foreign youth will interact in a way that encourages the exchange of ideas, values, culture, and information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This competition will give priority consideration to projects taking place in Russia in areas other than Moscow and St. Petersburg, and to projects taking place outside of capital cities in all the eligible countries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

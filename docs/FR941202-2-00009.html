At the request of the Department of Commerce (the Department), the petitioners filed a supplement to support and clarify the data in the petition on November 22, 1994. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.12 (1994), the petitioners allege that manganese metal is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of Investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The subject merchandise in this investigation is manganese metal, which is composed principally of manganese, by weight, but also contains some impurities such as carbon, sulfur, phosphorous, iron and silicon. Manganese metal contains by weight not less than 95 percent manganese. All compositions, forms and sizes of manganese metal are included within the scope of this investigation, including metal flake, powder, compressed powder, and fines. The subject merchandise is currently classifiable under subheadings 8111.00.45.00 and 8111.00.60.00 of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> United States Price and Foreign Market Value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The petitioners based United States price (USP) on observations of price quotations obtained for manganese metal from the PRC from December 1993 through May 1994. The terms of the prices observed in the salepersons' call reports included delivery to the customer. In calculating USP, the petitioners deducted a ten percent trading company commission, a U.S. port-to-customer delivery charge, imputed ocean freight, and U.S. duty. The Department did not allow the ten percent trading company commission as a deduction to U.S. price because petitioners could not support their assumption that the ten percent trading company commission applied to imports of manganese metal from the PRC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioners contend that the PRC is a non-market economy (NME) country within the meaning of section 771(18)(A) of the Act. The Department has determined in all previous investigations that the PRC is an NME, and the presumption of NME status continues for purposes of initiation of this investigation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Certain Paper Clips from the PRC,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 59 FR 51168 (October 7, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, foreign market value in NME cases is based on NME producers' factors of production, valued in a market economy country. Consistent with Department practice, absent evidence that the PRC government determines which of its factories shall produce for export to the United States, we intend, for purposes of this investigation, to base FMV only on those factories that produced manganese metal sold to the United States during the period of investigation (POI).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

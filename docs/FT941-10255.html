			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Mr Hosokawa must say no The summit in Washington on Friday between Japan's prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, and US president Bill Clinton is unlikely to be a success. But this need not be a bad thing. As US negotiators were fond of saying in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, better no agreement than a bad agreement. If the US were to obtain all it wants, this summit would be a disaster. The background to the meeting is long-standing US resentment over the Japanese trade and current account surpluses and the low penetration of the Japanese market by imports. To these complaints have been added more immediate worries about the Japanese economy, stagnant since the fourth quarter of 1991. In pressing US concerns on the Japanese authorities, the Clinton administration has made two innovations: first, it has made the relationship with Japan among the highest priorities for its foreign policy and, second, it has demanded Japanese agreement to qualitative and quantitative criteria for assessing success. So far the Clinton administration's attempt has failed. Mr Jeffrey Garten, the US commerce undersecretary, has even claimed that the two sides 'do not seem to have even a common understanding of the problem, let alone a consensus on the solutions'. This is not that surprising, since US trade demands represent almost perfect examples of the mercantilist fallacy. Where the US makes more sense is on macroeconomic policy. The difficulty here is that, however desirable a strong recovery in the Japanese economy would be, such things cannot be secured to order. The Japanese government's announcement this week of agreement on a Y15,250bn (Pounds 95bn) stimulatory package of tax cuts, increased spending and loans should help. But the US is entitled to be cynical about the effectiveness of such packages, since this is already the fourth one since August 1992. It is questionable, for example, whether Japanese consumers will start spending in response to a tax reduction in effect for just one year If Mr Clinton needs to recognise the limits on what he can hope to obtain over macroeconomic stimulation, how much more is this true of trade policy? In the former area at least, he is trying to push the Japanese in the right direction. In the latter he is doing the opposite. Why would the quantitative indicators sought by the US be such a dire error? One reason is that an indicator is bound to become a binding target, as has been demonstrated only this week by the hostile reaction of US industrialists to a decline in the foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market to 18.1 per cent, less than two percentage points below the agreed level. How could the reaction be otherwise, when it is suspicion of Japan that justifies these indicators in the first place? Given the suspicions, failure to achieve any indicator will be taken as proof not of the difficulties, but of bad faith. The very act of acceptance by the Japanese government implies agreement that it does control industry. But it also represents a commitment to increase that control. Every failure to achieve a target would then be condemned as malfeasance and every success as proof that the government does have the means to deliver on such targets. Either way, the result would be both more quantitative targets and more rigid administration of existing ones. Since the European Union and other partners would join in, pretty soon Japan would be as cartelised as its critics already say it is. What is more, these demands will inevitably spread to other bilateral trade relationships. Mr Hosokawa must say no, because the alternative would be dreadful. Saying no could well have horrible consequences too, particularly if Mr Clinton cannot be persuaded to take on the Japan-bashers in Congress. The outcome could even include a spate of Congressionally-mandated actions against Japan. Japan's only possible response would be to make this debate multilateral, which is what it should have been all along. However difficult it may be for Mr Hosokawa, what the world now needs from Japan is imagination and determination.</p>

Following the withdrawal of five  comrades, 352 candidates are vying for 81 seats in the National  Assembly. The stakes in this legislative election are high. It  is to provide our Constitution, which was overwhelmingly  approved on 27 September and promulgated on 14 October 1992 by  the president of the Republic, with an important organ which is  the National Assembly. The presidential group is hoping to get  a majority of seats in parliament to consolidate the executive's  power base, while the goal of the opposition is to win the  legislative elections and therefore be able to choose a prime  minister from their ranks.    French and Burkinabe civilian and military observers sent  throughout the country are seeing to the smooth running of the  polls. Hundreds of foreign personalities, who are experienced  observers, went to several polling stations in Lome and the  provinces to ascertain the regularity of the polls. Security is  ensured near the polling stations by members of the Operation  Reconciliation-Security 93 Force. Polling stations were closed  at 1800 for the cities in the provinces while they were closed  at 1900 in Lome, the capital. The Ministry of Territorial  Administration and Security announces that polling stations have  been closed since 1800 throughout the country.    On the whole, the elections took place in calm without any  incidents reported. President Eyadema, who insisted on going to  Yamoussoukro to participate in the last tribute to Ivorian  President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, could not go to the polling  station in Pya, his hometown where he is registered to vote,  because of his tight schedule. He therefore voted by proxy in  his hometown because the provisions of the electoral code do not  allow him to vote in Lome where he is not registered on any  voters list.</p>

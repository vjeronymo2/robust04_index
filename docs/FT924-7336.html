			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Warburg joins Hoare as joint broker to British Gas British Gas yesterday announced that SG Warburg Securities has been appointed joint broker with Hoare Govett, which was taken over by the Dutch bank ABN Amro earlier this year, writes Roland Rudd. Hoare Govett was recently forced to give up being sole broker to RTZ, the mining group, which appointed Cazenove as joint broker. Mr Peter Meinertzhagen, Hoare Govett's chairman, said he was not concerned by the decisions since most of the UK's big companies had joint brokers.</p>

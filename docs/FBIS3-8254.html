			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enes Osmancevic from Tuzla] </F>   [Text] Early this morning units of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Army left the area of Dubrave [Tuzla] Airport and at 1300 Tuzla  airport was officially handed over to the UN Protection Forces  [UNPROFOR]. This was done by signing an agreement between the  representatives of our republican authorities and UNPROFOR, that  is to say, UN officials.    Although members of the Nordic Battalion took over control  of  Tuzla airport yesterday, UNPROFOR will be officially accountable  for the safety of the airport, which has been under its control  for several hours, as of today.    To recap, approximately 300 soldiers of the Nordic Battalion  took up positions to secure the airport in the course of  yesterday. Six Leopard tanks are positioned in the vicinity of  the runway, which have the authority to protect this airport by  force if need be, that is to say, to respond to possible fire  from the Serbian aggressor's positions with fire.    It is worth mentioning once again that the runway has been  ready to receive aircraft for over 18 months. We have learned  unofficially that as of today all other preparations to make  Tuzla airport operational have been accelerated.    Official forecasts say that this should happen on 18 March;  however, sources close to UNPROFOR anticipate that it might  happen before this date.</p>

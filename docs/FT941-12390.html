			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Right wing defiant over SA elections South Africa at the weekend stepped closer to ethnic conflict as black and white right-wing groups demonstrated their opposition to April's all-race elections, increasing the pressure on government and the African National Congress to accommodate their views. Both the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party and the white right Afrikaner Volksfront (Afrikaner People's Front) stressed they would take no final decision on participating in the poll until after today's planned talks with the ANC and government. But supporters from both organisations, meeting at separate weekend conferences, made clear their rejection of the elections. Militant AVF supporters forced Gen Constand Viljoen, the moderate AVF leader, to leave the stage when he proposed to a gathering of 10,000 Afrikaners in Pretoria that they should vote in the April 27-29 election. Gen Viljoen, who has battled to find a negotiated settlement, was shouted down by an angry crowd of supporters of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement). Ultra-militant AWB leader Eugene Terre'blanche replaced him at the podium. He insisted that Afrikaners would vote only in a separate election for their own homeland, although moderate AVF leaders later scaled down this demand, calling for Afrikaners to vote on a separate ballot paper on the same day as the national elections. After the conference, at which the AVF declared symbolic independence from South Africa by electing its own interim representative council to rival the transitional executive council, Gen Viljoen pleaded for flexibility from the ANC and government. 'You have seen the anger of the people,' he said, adding that violence would inevitably result if Afrikaners could not achieve a homeland by negotiation. Last night, Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, appeared to go some way to meeting the demands by indicating he was behind the proposal to allow Afrikaners a vote during the elections on whether they wanted a separate homeland. Both Gen Viljoen and Inkatha leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi clearly hope that weekend demonstrations of popular support for an election boycott will concentrate the minds of ANC leaders, who have so failed to offer significant compromises to accommo date the right's demands for regional autonomy and 'self determination' of the Zulu and Afrikaner people. Inkatha's conference in Ulundi, the KwaZulu capital, yesterday adopted a resolution calling for further talks, but Chief Buthelezi made clear that his party would boycott the poll unless constitutional changes were made. He urged the congress to adopt the 'politics of resistance'. 'We will not be bullied into accepting a constitution agreed without us,' he told reporters.</p>

Yuichi Ichikawa, a chief negotiator for the coalition  parties  who chaired the council, declared an end to a series of talks  which had continued intermittently since Wednesday to iron out a  concessionary plan to salvage the government's reform package by  the Saturday deadline but failed to reach agreement on how to  amend the bills.    After the end of the talks at the council, leaders of the  seven coalition parties and the government were meeting to work  out a new strategy to help realize Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's commitment to political reform. Hosokawa told  reporters he will propose a meeting with Yohei Kono, president  of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), in a  last-ditch effort to enact the reform measures.    The LDP, rejecting the compromise plan offered by the ruling  parties at the joint committee, presented its own reform plan  before the end of the day. But the coalition parties also  turned it down, saying it lacks strict anti-corruption measures  necessary to alter Japan's politics, notorious for repeated  bribery scandals involving key figures.    The coalition could now call a second vote on the bills in  the House of Representatives on Friday, coalition sources said.  The bills, which were passed by the lower house last November  but rejected by the House of Councillors last Friday, would  become law if two-thirds of the powerful lower house members  approve them.    The bills would become law if two-thirds of the members of  the joint council approve a compromise plan and the amended  bills pass the lower and upper houses by Saturday. The joint  council is made up of 20 members -- 10 lower house members who  voted in favor of the reform package and 10 upper house members  who voted against it, including seven LDP members.    Hosokawa, who staked his premiership on enacting the bills,  said earlier in the day that he would not hesitate to step down  if his political reform campaign fails. He told a meeting on  political reform that, "I will not stick for a minute to the  post of prime minister if political reform is not realized."    Since taking office as premier last August after dislodging  the LDP from its 38-year grip on power, Hosokawa has vowed to  get the bills passed by the end of the current Diet session. If  he fails to do so, he could be forced to resign or dissolve the  lower house to win a new mandate, political analysts said.    The LDP's offer would increase the number of single-seat  constituencies in the lower house to 300 from 274 in the  original electoral reform bill, as well as cut the number of  proportional representation seats to 171 from 226. This  compares with the coalition's compromise plan which calls for  280 for single-seat and 220 for proportional representation  seats.    At present the lower house has 511 seats, all elected from  multiseat constituencies and with no proportional  representation. In addition, the LDP plan would split the seats  under proportional representation into 47 prefectural units  while the coalition proposed breaking them into seven electoral  units, instead of a single nationwide electoral unit in the  original bill.    On political fund-raising, the LDP said political donations  by an enterprise or a group to a maximum of 240,000 yen a year  to individual politician's two fund-raising bodies should be  allowed. But the coalition said it could only backpedal from a  blanket ban on corporate donations to individual politicians in  the original bill by allowing members of local assemblies to  accept such donations for five years after the reform bills are  enacted.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Debts to exporters fall by 15% The amount of money outstanding to British exporters through late payment of bills by customers in key European Union countries fell by 15 per cent in the year to March, NCM Credit Insurance, the UK's largest supplier of export credit, said yesterday. Losses caused by non-payment of debts by these countries also went down over the same period, although the position in the rest of the EU worsened slightly, it said. The company said the drop in cost of payment delays reflected a gradual lowering of interest rates in continental Europe.</p>

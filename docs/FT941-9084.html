			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Restructure planned at Boise Cascade Boise Cascade is the latest North American forest products company to restructure, with a plan to spin off the bulk of its newsprint and uncoated groundwood paper business to its Canadian subsidiary. The wholly-owned Canadian unit will also be given greater autonomy, including the ability to fund its own capital needs. A recapitalisation and a sale of equity to outsiders are being considered. Idaho-based Boise said it would now concentrate on its white paper, containerboard, building products and office products distribution businesses. Proceeds from the deal with the Canadian subsidiary will be used to reduce debt and for general corporate purposes. Terms of the spin-off have yet to be settled, but the enlarged Canadian company is expected to have annual sales of about USDollars 350m. The main addition will be a pulp and paper mill in West Tacoma, Washington, which produces up to 190,000 tons of recycled-content newsprint a year. The Canadian company will also take over the marketing of up to 420,000 tons of newsprint a year produced at Boise's big wood-products complex in DeRidder, Louisiana. Boise Cascade Canada operates two pulp and paper mills in Ontario, one of which is being expanded to include a recycling facility.</p>

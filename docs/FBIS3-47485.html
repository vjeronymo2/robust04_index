			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- The Steering Committee of  the House of Councillors voted Thursday [13 January] to confirm  the January 17 date set for a public hearing on the government's  political and electoral reform bills.    The vote in the committee was 12 for and 12 against, and the  motion was carried with Akira Omori, the committee chairman,  exercising his casting vote.    The public hearing, to be held in Tokyo, is a prerequisite  to  putting the bills to a vote in an upper house plenary session.    The bills are aimed at revamping the electoral system for  the  House of Representatives and tightening political fund-raising  controls.    The upper house's Special Committee on Political Reform  voted  Monday to set the date for the public hearing for January 17.    The reform bills cleared the more powerful lower house on  November 18 but have become bogged down in the upper house in  the face of stiff opposition from the Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP) and the Japanese Communist Party (JCP).    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has vowed to pass the  package during the current Diet session, which expires January  29.    Several upper house members of the Social Democratic Party  [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], one of the ruling coalition parties,  have expressed opposition to the bills and could vote against  them or abstain.    In the upper house, the ruling coalition has 131 seats, the  LDP 99, the JCP 11, the Niin Club five, and independents five.    At a session of the special committee Thursday, the JCP  submitted a motion demanding the coalition let Hosokawa's former  political funds manager Masatoshi Miyama testify before the Diet  as a sworn witness.    The JCP wants Miyama to testify about 100 million yen  Hosokawa said he received as a loan from the scandal-ridden  Sagawa Kyubin trucking group and later paid back.</p>

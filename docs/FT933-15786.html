			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / 3i surges despite large write-offs 3i, Britain's largest venture capital company, has nearly Pounds 1bn available for investment, but despite an upturn in activity has yet to experience a surge in demand for funds. A turnround in performance in the second half saw pre-tax profits increase 39 per cent to Pounds 56m for the year to March, the company announced yesterday. This included an Pounds 8m exceptional gain in the form of interest on a Pounds 32m tax rebate. Sales and flotations boosted profits from disposals to Pounds 115m from Pounds 89m. But provisions increased sharply from Pounds 61m to Pounds 171m, including a Pounds 72m write-off of the stake in Isosceles, the parent of Gateway supermarkets. A further Pounds 69m was written off on UK investments and Pounds 30m on those overseas. 3i made 644 investments worth Pounds 310m compared with 822 investments worth Pounds 415m the year before. It strengthened its balance sheet, reduced its borrowings and achieved a Pounds 200m improvement in its cash flow position during the year, Mr Ewen Macpherson, chief executive, said. Operating costs had been reduced by staff cuts and a streamlining of its regional office network. 3i increased its share of the market for smaller company finance from 45 to 48 per cent. Dividend earnings from investments rose 14 per cent to Pounds 89m while interest earnings fell 6 per cent to Pounds 118m, reflecting generally lower interest rates. Fees and other earnings, including the Pounds 8m of interest on the tax overpayment, increased 21 per cent to Pounds 35m. Net assets rose by 4.7 per cent to Pounds 1.33bn over the year after falling by 6.4 per cent during the first half. Net assets per share advanced by 4.6 per cent to 563p. Earnings per share grew 16 per cent to 15.8p. A final dividend of 8.2p makes a total of 11.5p, an increase of 5.5 per cent. 3i is expected to announce at its annual meeting on July 28 that Sir George Russell, chairman and chief executive of Marley, the building materials group, is to become its new chairman. He is a non-executive director. The previous chairman, Mr Alan Wheatley, resigned in April when the company announced it had indefinitely postponed plans for a flotation.

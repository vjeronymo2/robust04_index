			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Toyota planning second assembly plant in Canada Toyota is to double production capacity in Canada to 205,000 cars a year by the late 1990s. The Japanese carmaker is planning to invest CDollars 600m (Dollars 450m) to build a second assembly plant at Cambridge, Ontario, with capacity to produce 120,000 cars a year. Output at its current plant is 85,000 cars a year. The new plant, due to begin production in August 1997, will increase Toyota's capacity in North America to more than 900,000 cars and light trucks a year by 1998, and will help Toyota counter the impact of the yen's appreciation. The main model to be produced at the new plant will be the Toyota Corolla small family saloon. It is already assembled at Toyota's plant in Ontario and at the New United Motor Manufacturing (NUMMI) plant at Fremont, California, Toyota's joint venture with General Motors. A rebadged version of the Corolla produced at the NUMMI plant is sold by GM in North America. Toyota said it would cease exporting the Corolla from Japan to North America, when the new plant in Canada begins production. Toyota, the leading Japanese vehicle maker, announced recently that its production in North America was expected to rise to 790,000 vehicles in 1996, a 50 per cent increase from last year's output of 533,000. North American produced vehicles are expected to account for 60 per cent of Toyota's sales in the US and Canada in 1996 compared with 46 per cent last year. Toyota is also increasing its car exports from North America, chiefly to Japan, Taiwan and west Europe, and exports from the US and Canada are forecast to rise to 80,000 a year by 1996 from 50,000 last year. It is seeking to increase the local content of its North American produced vehicles with plans to raise engine production in the US and Canada to more than 440,000 a year in 1996 from 207,000 in 1993. Toyota said that the planned expansion in Canada would satisfy the local content requirements of the North American Free Trade Agreement allowing the cars to be shipped freely between Canada, the US and Mexico.</p>

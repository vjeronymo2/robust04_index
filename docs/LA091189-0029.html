			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POOH CORNER  </P> <P> Walt Disney Co. has changed its mind and decided to allow a giant statue of  Winnie the Pooh to be built in the Canadian town near where the famous little  bear was born. Disney -- which holds copyright to all reproductions of Winnie  the Pooh -- turned down a request made earlier this year by the town of White  River, Ontario, saying it had other "contractual commitments" for Pooh. Tom  Bagdon, president of the White River Chamber of Commerce, thinks adverse  publicity may have caused the Disney Co. to relent. "When we were refused and  that went public they were swamped with calls," Bagdon said. "Once they  verified the claim that Winnie the Pooh was a real bear and our story was  accurate, their lawyers said we could go ahead and put up our statue."  According to Bagdon, Pooh, the bear on whom British writer A.A. Milne based his  children's stories, was born near White River in 1914. The cub was later taken  to Europe and left at the London Zoo where Milne and his son, Christopher  Robin, spotted the gentle American black bear. Shauna Snow and ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

Austrian, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish diplomats all  confirmed that their foreign ministers had raised objections to  the package.    "We are very disappointed and deeply concerned," the Finnish  Foreign Ministry said after hearing the final offer made  yesterday.    A senior Austrian negotiator said the EC position was  "completely unacceptable."    The two key areas of concern are agriculture and regional  aid. The EC has demanded that the four must harmonise  agricultural prices with EC levels from the moment of entry,  which poses enormous problems for Norway and Finland, where farm  subsidies push prices far higher. In Finland prices are roughly  twice the EC level.    The cost of any transitional relief payments to farmers  would  also have to be met by the individual governments.    The four countries were also disappointed that the EC  rejected a list of regions which they said should receive  development aid.    The three Nordic countries proposed their Arctic regions,  and  Austria its Alpine ones. All four governments need to show  voters they are getting a healthy slice of money in return for  funds paid in. Otherwise, referendums on EC entry are likely to  produce a "No" vote later this year.    The problem is that the proposed regions are too rich to  qualify for aid, but the four argue that the rules discriminate  against them, and that the EC has regularly breached them  anyway. Spain and Portugal, major beneficiaries of the fund,  blocked acceptance of the list.    Austria also has a problem with a system that limits the  number of lorries which use it as a short cut to East Europe.  It won the right to keep the system until 2005, but the EC  wants to cut this back to 1998.    It also bans foreigners from owning holiday homes in its  Tyrol region, and has been told -- principally by Germany --  that this must stop.</p>

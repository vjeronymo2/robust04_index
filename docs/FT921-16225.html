			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Letter: Shareholders need more information to assess the value of listed companies Sir, Deborah Hargreaves ('Evaluating the worth of oil', January 2), shows the difficulty that investors face in assessing the true value of an oil company, and prompts the question whether it is time for shareholders to be given more information in order to make a fair and just assessment of the value of the companies listed on the stock market. In assessing the value of an oil company, a discounted cash flow model can be applied if it has producing crude oil and gas assets. The problem then becomes the reference price for crude oil and the escalation factor employed. For example, the projected crude oil price used by certain models in industry and financial circles in the early 1980s has factored in a crude oil price for 1992 approaching Dollars 100 per barrel. Clearly a high crude oil price helps establish a higher present value for an asset. The real tricky question comes in assessing those intangible items that are not in the public or private domain, such as discoveries and the potential impact such an exploration success will have on the share price. It takes a considerable amount of time and effort to be certain of the reserves in a field which, even after it is producing, can be revised upwards or downwards. The health warnings that habitually accompany the drilling results of a successful exploration well should be taken seriously. There is one area where the Stock Exchange, however, could add to the dearth of impartial information on oil companies' assets by insisting that they publish a table on the present value of their worldwide producing assets. A standard formula and the same discount factor would be used by each company so that shareholders would have at least one solid fact on which to build a general assessment of a company's net worth. The impact of discoveries and other such matters on a company's net worth would then be left to the imagination or acumen of the individual. In the US the Securities and Exchange Commission insists that oil companies publish a discounted cash flow statement on their producing assets. It is time the London Stock Exchange introduced such a practice. Dr BS McBeth 73 Princes Street Oxford OX4 1DE</p>

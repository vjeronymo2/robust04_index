			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Konrad Schuller: "The Social Democracy Party of </F> Romania Advocates a Grand Coalition in Romania"]    [Text] The Social Democracy Party of Romania (PDSR), the  strongest force in the nominally suprapartisan government in  Bucharest, has repeatedly been stressing its willingness for  economic and social reforms. Its Executive President Nastase,  who is also president of the Chamber of Deputies, even offered a  grand coalition to the market-oriented opposition in an  interview with FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE. Representatives of the  largest opposition alliance, the Democratic Convention of  Romania (CDR), however, expressed the suspicion that such offers  are only tactical and primarily designed to exert pressure on  postcommunist or chauvinist parties that reluctantly support the  Romanian minority government in parliament. A grand coalition  would reduce the influence of these parties. Also, the PDSR no  longer wants to be considered an opponent to reform abroad.    Nastase stated that his party, which has so far determined  the hesitant policy of the independent Prime Minister Vacaroiu,  is in agreement with the opposition on the objectives of foreign  policy. There is full accord that closer ties should be  established with the West. The PDSR, which is considered a  reservoir of former communist elites by its opponents, today  advocates a European-type social democracy "with a liberal  touch." As far as the economy and privatization are concerned,  it has numerous elements in common with the opposition. Since  the beginning of the year, contacts have been established with  all parties to win them over for more radical economic reforms.  Romania has committed itself vis-a-vis the IMF to carry out  resolute reforms. In return, it received promises for a credit  worth 1.16 billion German marks. Nastase stressed that his  party wants to accelerate the privatization of the economy.  This year, a total of 300 enterprises have been privatized. It  is quite natural that this should lead to a rise in unemployment  (11 percent). The population and the trade unions are not  afraid of reforms. In spite of the government's "very tough"  reform policy, polls show that the PDSR has not yet scared off  its supporters. Parliament must now draft a competition law and  a law on local taxes that would give the communities more power.  For these and other projects, the PDSR needs the support of the  opposition. The PDSR wants to end the domestic "cold war" and  begin a "phase of cooperation" with the opposition.    Deputy Ciumara, a leading member of the National Peasant  Christian-Democratic Party (PNTCD), the strongest force in the  opposition alliance CDR, views such offers with suspicion. He  believes that the unofficial government party PDSR does not want  to give up its monopoly of power. Nastase, who likes to stress  the government's readiness for reform, is only pretending  because the government and the PDSR depend on the old directors  and cadres of the former regime who are opposed to reform. The  300 privatized enterprises about whom Nastase is talking are not  important at all.    According to Ciumara, the PDSR ignores the most demands by  the opposition in its offers. It is neither willing to comply  with the demand that, in a cabinet of a grand coalition, no  party must receive more than 50 percent of the seats nor with  the request that every minister should be given complete freedom  in his office. Also, it ignores the decision by the parties  united in the CDR that talks on alliances should only be held  jointly. The PDSR is seeking contacts with individual members  of the alliance to split the CDR.    Nastase speaks of a grand coalition as one of the other  possibilities. He demands that "formal aspects," such as the  composition of the government, not be stressed too much, and not  "party interests" but "common issues of interest" be given  priority. Yet this would mean that his PDSR ministers alone  would keep their positions and that the circles surrounding  President Iliescu could continue to play off the communist and  nationalists against the conservative opposition in Parliament.  The PDSR has succeeded in so doing recently. Its satellite  parties have accepted the agreement with the IMF, despite the  fact that they had always vehemently rejected the submission to  demands by foreign institutions. Nastase explained their  support by pointing out that they did not want to topple the  "center-left government" because they might get a "center-right"  government which they would no longer be able to influence.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Management: Forced to plough new furrows - As competition increases UK farmers must sharpen up their sales skills It's a story that would make Popeye green with envy. An old, established farming family sets out to transform the popular image of spinach as a bitter-tasting vegetable covered in soil, which turns to gritty slime when cooked and is only forced down because it does you good. The family cuts the young leaves above ground level to avoid the dirt and packs them in oxygen-filled, perforated bags to increase their supermarket shelf life from a few hours to three days. Britons subsequently develop a taste for American-style spinach salads and the family company raises its share of the UK fresh spinach market from 20 per cent to 75 per cent in four years. John and William Emmett's vision won them an award from Adas, the British government's agricultural development service. It says they provide a shining example of what can be achieved through successful marketing, a technique under-used by farmers in the UK. This deficiency in marketing skills is part of the reason for Britain's Pounds 5.9bn trade deficit in food and drink, nearly half of last year's total deficit. In comparison, most of Britain's north European competitors, with similar climates and types of agriculture, have food trading surpluses. This difference in performance has prompted a serious bout of soul-searching, including the personal intervention of Prime Minister John Major. He has set up an Initiative on Food Marketing, chaired by David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, and brings together senior representatives of the food industry. Industry leaders in Britain believe that more than half of the country's food trade gap could be filled with home-grown produce. To find out why retailers and processors import food rather than purchase home-grown produce, Adas conducted an anonymous survey of 100 leading food buyers, published this summer. Their answer was that British farmers excelled in producing clean, fresh, flavoursome food, but fell down badly on effective marketing and responsiveness to customers' needs. 'If I ask British producers for something different, or a slight alteration to their product, it's like coming up against a brick wall,' said one respondent. Another complained: 'If I want to source cauliflowers in the UK, I have to rush about for hours trying to find a suitable supplier. By making one phone call to the Netherlands, I can get a fax back within the hour, specifying availability, prices, delivery and everything else I need to know.' The survey produced indignant protests from UK farmers. Adas, however, is unrepentant in pressing home its message that more market-orientation is needed now than ever before. With the European single market, the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the chances of a successful outcome to the Gatt talks, it believes the writing is on the wall for farmers who refuse to adapt. 'They can't be blamed for ignoring marketing in the past, because high support prices under the CAP have encouraged the sale of commodities into intervention stores,' says Chris Bourchier, head of agricultural development at Adas. 'But times are changing. With increasing competition and the prospect of reduced subsidies, our producers will have to provide not only a competitive product but a competitive service too, every bit as good as producers abroad.' North European marketing success has been built on the work of co-operatives. These have brought together large numbers of small farmers, ensuring supplies throughout the year to the standards demanded by the increasingly concentrated and powerful food manufacturers and retailers. They have successfully produced a closer relationship between the growers, processors and retailers. Co-operatives sell 55 per cent of agricultural output in the Netherlands and 50 per cent in France, compared with only 10 per cent in the UK, according to Food from Britain, the promotional agency set up in 1983. Earlier this year, a government-funded study of food marketing in Britain and the Netherlands - which has a Pounds 10bn trade surplus in food and agricultural products - found that Dutch farmers take a longer-term view of their markets and show greater innovation. The report, by Wye agricultural college, urged British farmers to show greater understanding of the changing needs of their final customers - and the big food buyers. 'These are not trite phrases, they are fundamental to attaining marketing success and too few UK agricultural businesses have come to terms with them,' it said. There are some highly successful co-operatives in the UK, especially in sectors that have not been swaddled by EC farm supports. Kentish Garden, for example, has captured 40 per cent of supermarket soft-fruit sales by extending the growing season and improving presentation. From 15 members and turnover of Pounds 160,000 in 1970, it now comprises 58 growers and expects sales this year of Pounds 14m. Some co-operatives have collapsed and others have been ineffective, partly because of farmer interference in their management and marketing efforts. This has discouraged an industry known to prefer tried and tested ways. It also seems that in general British farmers, being bigger and more independent than their continental counterparts, have felt less need for collaboration. Operating in isolation from each other has meant being isolated from some parts of the food supply chain. And the success of the big supermarkets has resulted in resentment from some sections of the farming community. Out of the Pounds 70bn spent by consumers on food in the UK last year, farmers received just Pounds 14bn. Moves to improve communications within the food chain are under way. The Strathclyde project, set up by Safeway in 1991 and managed by Strathclyde University, aims to do just this by bringing together producers, manufacturers, retailers and caterers. Teresa Wickham, Safeway's director of corporate affairs, is optimistic. 'The British producer is waking up to the fact that you have got to have export quality produce on the home market,' she says. But she accepts that 'people can't switch their whole attitude overnight'. Safeway now buys 82 per cent of its produce in Britain and hopes to raise this to 85 per cent by 1995. At the producer end, the National Union of Farmers has been trying to open up export opportunities and improve the image of British food abroad with its Food from the Countryside campaign. Marketing efforts have done little in the past to reduce the food trade gap, but many in the industry believe these new projects will be more successful. The reason for this optimism is that economic circumstances have changed and farmers must therefore change too. Market forces are, for example, being imposed on farmers almost overnight in the dairy sector, with the ending of the Milk Marketing Board's monopoly next year. Government intervention of this kind has an important role, according to the Wye college report, but change has to come from within. 'It is farmers, collectively and individually, that must instigate improved marketing performance, driven by desire for economic survival and financial gain.' That cultural change, if it happens, will be led by producers such as the Emmetts. Recognising a market for their spinach all year round, they have forged links with Spanish and Italian producers to supply them with produce of the same quality in the winter months when home-grown spinach is not available. The company is now investing Pounds 300,000 in new machinery to double production to 8m packs a year. Chris Kersley, sales and marketing director, says they have the Dutch and Scandinavian markets in their sights and plan to 'export with a vengeance'.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DEALERS reported another reasonably quiet trading session in the derivatives markets, writes Steve Thompson. In stock index futures, the December contract opened lower at 2,585, weakened by worries about the latest decline in sterling and deepening economic gloom, before edging ahead to the day's high of 2,603 in mid-morning. Thereafter, it declined steadily, eventually touching what proved to be the day's low point of 2,570 just as Wall Street opened. However, a gentle squeeze developed as the market close loomed, taking the future up to a final 2,590, some 11 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of around 32 points. Turnover in the December was 7,092 contracts, compared with Wednesday's 6,651 contracts. Dealers expect substantial activity prior to the expiry at 10.30am today of the October FT-SE Index option in which there is sizeable open interest in the 2,500 and 2,550 calls. News that Moody's, the US credit-rating agency, had put Barclays and NatWest on 'credit-watch' put considerable pressure on the underlying share prices and triggered a flurry of activity in Barclays options where 2,415 contracts were traded. Otherwise there was disappointingly low activity in stock options. British Gas also attracted plenty of interest after switching activity in the underlying stock, with 1,507 contracts traded.</p>

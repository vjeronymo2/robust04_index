			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 25 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- China has  decided to raise the cotton procurement price by a large margin  as of 1 September 1994 when newly harvested cotton is to be sold  on the market. The price for standard ginned cotton is to be  raised from 330 yuan to about 400 yuan per 50 kg. In addition,  some cotton producing provinces also will introduce some other  preferential measures to encourage peasants to grow cotton.    Cotton output slumped in 1993 owing to natural disasters and  other factors. Statistics by the end of January this year  indicate that the country's total cotton procurement was only 67  percent of the procurement for the same period last year.  Hebei, Shandong, and Henan -- the major cotton producing  provinces of China the cotton output of which used to account  for half of the country's total cotton output -- witnessed the  greatest decrease margin in cotton production which has directly  affected the country's cotton procurement as a whole.    To ease the grim situation in cotton production and  marketing, and to encourage peasants to grow cotton, the state  now has decided to raise the cotton procurement price by about  21 percent this year, in addition to the 10-percent price rise  last year. Meanwhile, the amount of subsidies to cotton growers  also will be increased appropriately to make up the price  difference between parity and the negotiated prices for chemical  fertilizers and diesel oil. This will be another round of  substantial raises in the cotton procurement price in China  after a series of price rises over the past few years since 1988.</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Superstate nightmare troubles Hurd Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, yesterday criticised what he called the 'nightmare' scenario of a European superstate, and declared he was confident that the 'centralising tendency' in Europe was at an end. Speaking in Bologna, Italy, in his first important speech on Europe since the German constitutional court ratified the Maastricht treaty last month, Mr Hurd insisted that the principle of subsidiarity should now be the touchstone for the European Union. 'Subsidiarity is not only about rolling back the frontiers of the Community, where these have advanced beyond common sense; it also means moving forward with a lightness of touch,' Mr Hurd said in comments which resonated with the British government's relief that the pace of European integration had faltered in recent months. Legislation was a key area where the powers of Europe should be trimmed, since EU legislation had now become so intrusive and extensive that it risked devaluing the EU's reputation, Mr Hurd said. He insisted Community legislation should be introduced only when it would do the 'least possible violence' to national legal systems. Foreign policy and employment law had to remain firmly in the domain of sovereign governments. The narrowness of Maastricht ratification in Denmark, France, Britain and Germany served as a clear warning that 'sharing of sovereignty and centralising tendency, has for the time being run its course', he said, citing labour costs and trade barriers as the key challenges now facing Europe.</p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Warning Sticker to Be Unveiled: A standardized advisory logo for albums  containing explicit lyrics is scheduled to be unveiled during a news conference  today in Washington.  </P> <P> The Recording Industry Assn. of America and the National Assn. of Record  Merchandisers will also outline a national consumer awareness campaign about  the stickering program. The logo was developed in response to parents'  complaints over allegedly offensive lyrics and numerous state legislative  proposals to mandate warning stickers. An RIAA spokeswoman said Monday that  record companies that account for 95% of all albums released in the United  States have agreed to use the new logo. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REISBIG QUITS AS COACH OF LONG BEACH FOOTBALL  </P> <P> Larry Reisbig, who has a 10-23 record in three seasons as football coach at Cal  State Long Beach, resigned Thursday.  </P> <P> "This is something that had to be done," Reisbig said before telling the 49er  players of his decision. He will coach the team in its final two games of the  season against Cal State Fullerton Saturday and Utah State on Nov. 25.  </P> <P> Athletic Director Corey Johnson said he hopes a new coach will be hired by  mid-December.  </P> <P> Reisbig and Johnson have had several recent meetings, but Reisbig said, "Nobody  ever talked to me about being fired."  </P> <P> The 49ers are 3-7 overall and 1-4 in the Big West Conference. They have given  up an average of 35.8 points a game, and their only victory over another  Division I-A team was against winless New Mexico State.  </P> <P> "It's been a rough three years," said Reisbig, 4-7 in 1987 and 3-9 last season.  </P> <P> A former 49er assistant, Reisbig, 48, came to Long Beach from Pasadena City  College on Dec. 24, 1986. He replaced Mike Sheppard, who left for the  University of New Mexico during a time when Long Beach almost dropped football  because of a financial crisis.  </P> <P> Football was saved by a $300,000 fund drive, but the uncertainty cost the 49ers  their recruiting season.  </P> <P> In a letter to Johnson, Reisbig wrote: "Many of the obstacles were overcome. At  the same time we have been trying to fight with our hands tied behind our backs  in many ways."  </P> <P> Reisbig said Thursday, "I'd like to say more but I'm not going to, not for a  while."  </P> <P> Money problems forced the 49ers to travel the last three seasons to play  big-name teams such as Michigan, Oregon and UCLA, absorbing lopsided defeats in  exchange for lucrative guarantees.  </P> <P> Scholarships were increased to 70, or 20 more than in 1987, and Reisbig said  before this season, "We're competitive, we're going to scare a lot of people."  </P> <P> But when many of the better players were injured, the season fell apart  quickly.  </P> <P> "The most devastating thing has been the injuries," Reisbig said. "We have 24  scholarship athletes who can't play. That will take the heart and soul out of  any program."  </P> <P> Johnson remains committed to building a strong program. "We'd like to do a  better job in recruiting high school players," he said, alluding to a roster  with a predominance of community college transfers. "We always needed to fill  holes."  </P> <P> In the 1980s, the 49ers are 50-54 and have had only one winning season in the  last five years. The crowds at Veterans Stadium, which has stands on only one  side and seats 12,500, have been the smallest among Division I-A schools. The  average for three games this season is 3,000.  </P></p>

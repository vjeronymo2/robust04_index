			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Field float carries Pounds 150m valuation FIELD GROUP, the folding carton maker, has issued the pathfinder prospectus for its flotation and announced results for the year to April 4 showing a rise in operating profits from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 12.6m. The group aims to raise Pounds 90m through the flotation, expected to value Field at about Pounds 150m. There will be a placing and public offer divided with about 35 per cent going to the offer. Of the proceeds, Pounds 18m will cover sales by existing shareholders, including some directors, Pounds 21m will redeem preference shares and Pounds 48m will repay zero coupon bonds. These securities were issued at the time of the management buy-out from SCA, the Swedish paper and packaging group. That would leave Pounds 3m of net new money for the company. Mr Keith Gilchrist, chief executive of Field, said the group had started the current year well with sales and profits higher. He said the group had supplied 21 of its top 30 customers for more than 20 years. The top 30 account for two thirds of group sales. Growth would come, he said, from an upturn in consumer spending, new product launches, customers rationalising their suppliers, and the potential for cartons to replace other packaging such as plastics. Field has developed a carton for shampoo, as well as liquid detergents and motor oil. There would be benefits from Pounds 50m of capital expenditure over the last five years. Over the last four years and despite a slight fall in the UK market for cartons, Field's UK operations had shown volume growth of 35.8 per cent. In 1990 Field bought Mareen, a Belgian carton company. Mr David Nussbaum, finance director, said that sales excluding Mareen since the 1988-89 financial year had risen by 11.3 per cent per year compound and operating profits by 8.8 per cent. Sales in the latest financial year, which covered 53 weeks, rose from Pounds 124.5m to Pounds 138.7m. Operating profits were before a Pounds 2m exceptional cost relating to the write-down of property assets. After the float the group would have no net debt, Mr Nussbaum said, but the acquisition of the packaging business of Boots, the retail and pharmaceutical group, would give gearing of about 9 per cent. The pricing for the float is to be announced on June 23, with the public offer closing on June 30. First dealings are to start on July 7. The sponsoring bank is Schroders, and James Capel is the broker. Investors wanting to register for a prospectus can telephone 0645 600650.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent A. Sladkov; from the "Vesti" </F> newscast]    [Text] In the range of problems connected with insuring our  country's security, the main question is the protection of  Russia's present borders. This view was expressed by Valeriy  Manilov, deputy secretary of the Russian Security Council, at a  meeting with journalists today.    Preserving Russia's unique scientific and  military-scientific  technology, halting the outflow of intellectual and scientific  potential to the West, stabilizing Russian policy in the Asia-  Pacific region, and solving the problem of the Black Sea Fleet  should become equally important areas of the Security Council's  work, Valeriy Manilov said.    The increasingly unstable economy is a source of  considerable  danger for the country, Valeriy Manilov believes. The Security  Council intends to play a special role in the further  establishment of Russian political links with the United States  and the countries of Western Europe. The first step is the  prompt examination of options for Russia's entry to the  Partnership for Peace program.    [Begin Manilov recording] There is a pressing need to  consider all the consequences and results of joining, and above  all, to take account of Russia's status as a great power by  definition.

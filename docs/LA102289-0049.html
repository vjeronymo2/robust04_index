			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE COUSTEAU WATCH: PREHISTORIC DREAM IN NEW ZEALAND  </P> <P> In New Zealand's Breaksea Sound, one of the longest fjords in the world, the  coasts are steep, covered with forests and dripping with water. Calypso's stern  dug into the bushy tree branches. It was raining, unrelentingly. Halfway to the  top of the high mountains above us, patches of fog clung to the slopes.  Vertiginous waterfalls cascaded down drenched mountain peaks that merged with  the sky. Water was everywhere.  </P> <P> It fell in raindrops. It hung in layers of fog. It soaked the forest, oozing  out of the moss-covered ground, swallowing sap and rot. Then over the surface  of the sound, it regurgitated a layer of yellowish and murky vegetal freshwater  goo that floated on top of the deep and crystalline salt water.  </P> <P> I took our small seaplane to land and walked through the deep, vertical forest.  I maneuvered through the mud, proceeding with caution in a silence broken only  by the patter of rain, the crackling of rotting branches and the melodic songs  of bellbirds.  </P> <P> There were evergreen beeches, shrubs with clustered leaves, and ferns  everywhere -- the dwarf kind, the creeping kind, but also the very tall and  arborescent kind. Networks of moss covered the ground, the tree trunks and the  rocks. Everything was spongy.  </P> <P> This welcoming forest, mild and soft to the touch, was defenseless against such  animals as goats and deer. But scarcely two centuries have passed since humans  brought goats, sheep, deer, rats and other mammals to New Zealand, that had  otherwise evolved free of all mammalian life, free of the need of defense.  </P> <P> I removed my gloves and found that, in contrast to the Amazon forest, here  nothing prickled, nothing stung, nothing irritated the skin. There were no  scorpions, no snakes, no tarantulas, no biting ants. And, except for perhaps an  occasional tiny white orchid, obviously of recent date, even as I searched, all  around me, I saw no flowers.  </P> <P> I leaned on a forked tree limb and fell under the spell, escaping from the  present world and traveling back in time, relying on daydreams as fragile as  the half-rotten branch that supported me. Mystery, like the water, flowed  everywhere.  </P> <P> I traveled back some 70 million years, when New Zealand broke away from the  supercontinent of Gondwanaland that eventually divided into the continents of  our time. I pictured New Zealand as a ship that broke loose from its parent,  drifting, lashed by tremendous volcanic storms, constantly reshaped by the whim  of shifting tectonic plates. The dinosaurs never invaded the region that would  become this vessel, and so the castaway forests had not developed defenses  against the formidable plant-eaters that most dinosaurs were.  </P> <P> Then I travel back perhaps 130 million years, just before the appearance of the  first flowers. This time I set foot on Gondwanaland itself to witness the havoc  the dinosaurs wreaked on plants of all kinds. The vegetation had armed itself  to no avail with ridiculous prickles to ward off the teeth of the  brontosauruses and other diplodocuses. When the flowering plants did appear,  they managed to survive because of their rapid reproduction. And these plants  not only produced perfumes, but alkaloids and tannins -- odors and bitter  chemicals capable of discouraging most herbivores.  </P> <P> With that, I then fantasize that flowers could have caused dinosaurs to starve  and vanish. I picture, with a smile, a giant brontosaurus spitting out a tender  flower.  </P></p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Dutch enzyme plant for Tianjin Novo Nordisk, a leading producer of industrial enzymes and insulin for diabetics, is planning to set up an enzymes factory employing about 300 people in China, the company announced yesterday, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. Novo Nordisk has acquired a 160,000 square metre site near the town of Tianjin by agreement with the administrative commission of Tianjin economic-technological development area. The site is big enough to house a plant for pharmaceuticals production as well, said Mr Mads Ovlisen, Novo's chief executive, but added that plans for this stage of the development remain at a very early stage. Work on the enzymes factory will begin next year and production is due to start in 1998-99, the company said. 'China has a population of 1.2bn and large industries in washing powders, brewing, alcohol and textiles. The country therefore has a big potential as a customer for Novo Nordisk's enzyme products,' said Mr Rebien Sorensen, who is responsible for the group's projects in China.</p>

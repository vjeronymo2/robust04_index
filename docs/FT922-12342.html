			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Plenty to chew over: How will the BBC shape up to the future BBC governors and top management will start arriving at Lucknam Park, a secluded country-house hotel in the Cotswolds, just before lunch on May 20. There they will enjoy good food and wine, stroll on the rolling lawns, join BBC chairman Marmaduke Hussey around the swimming pool - and talk about the future of the corporation. It is probably the most important conference on the BBC they will ever attend. Their task is to reach agreement on its future structure, role and strategy in an age of multi-channel television. Ironically, Lucknam Park was where the top-secret talks that led to the merger of satellite broadcasters BSB and Sky Television in November 1990 were held, thus creating one of the longer-term threats facing the BBC. Had the Labour party won the general election on April 9, the debate over the corporation's future would not perhaps have reached its present intensity. Though a Labour government might have created funding problems with its uncosted manifesto commitments to concessionary licence fees for pensioners, there was a feeling inside the BBC that it had an emotional commitment to public service broadcasting. The Tories are perceived as far more likely to pull the BBC up by its roots. It is David Mellor at the head of the National Heritage department - already designated the Ministry for Fun - who will handle the delicate negotiations for a new Royal Charter for the BBC to replace the one that runs out in 1996. In some respects he is a lucky choice for the corporation. In 1990, during his second stint as broadcasting minister, Mr Mellor effectively put his career on the line by supporting a strengthening of the quality commitments for ITV companies bidding in the competitive tenders for franchises. The change of emphasis from highest bids to quality had not been cleared with the then prime minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher. In preparing a consultative document on the corporation's future, for publication later this year, Mr Mellor can be expected to be rigorous but open-minded. The government cannot be expected to solve any of the corporation's problems, however - problems being experienced by most public service broadcasters across Europe. As the number of television channels available through cable and satellite networks increases, and competition intensifies for both finance and audiences, all public service broadcasters face tough choices. Mr Gerard Le Febvre, until recently director of strategy at CLT, the Luxembourg-based broadcaster, believes that by the end of the decade in most European countries there will only be room for one national public service channel with one or two competing pay channels, up to three private general interest channels and a growing number of specialist satellite channels. For the BBC this scenario poses several basic questions. Can the corporation retain a reasonable share of the audience? Will Wyatt, managing director of BBC network television, has bravely identified his minimum target: from 1992-93 BBC1 and BBC2 should be watched for a minimum of two hours each week by at least 90 per cent of television households. If the BBC audience does melt away, how long can the imposition of a universal licence fee be justified, and should the corporation therefore be financed partly by subscription or advertising? Should the BBC refine its public service role and concentrate on worthy programmes that the marketplace is unlikely to provide? The BBC's attempts to answer some of these questions took on a farcical aspect this week. No fewer than 15 task forces have been set up, each one looking at a particular facet of the organisation. Inevitably they have come up with hundreds of proposals, ranging from the inspired to the bizarre. Privatise the BBC orchestras. Farm out the morning hours to an outside producer. Contract out so many services that 10,000 jobs will be lost over five years. Turn BBC Education into a public company. It was equally inevitable that the confidential proposals should leak out. On Tuesday, Bectu, the main broadcasting union, handed out copies of the summaries of all 15 confidential reports along with copies of 'The Funding Bible', the combined reports of consultants on possible methods of funding. This document included a chart (left) showing the revenue that would accrue from two minutes an hour of advertising. Bectu officials quickly denounced the BBC for secretly planning to introduce advertising, even though the chart indicated that it would be difficult for the BBC to take advertisements without damaging ITV. Other ideas - such as privatising orchestras -  have been publicly repudiated by Sir Michael Checkland, the BBC director-general, before they have been formally considered. As the task forces were letting their minds roam over potential reforms, a market-oriented policy known as Producer Choice was being introduced by the corporation. Under it, producers will be able to hire camera crews, make-up artists and, by next year, studios, outside the BBC, if they are cheaper. The policy is designed to bring competition to an organisation accused by its critics of waste and inefficiency. Some staff say that chaos, poor morale and large-scale redundancies are the more likely outcome. Mr Tony Lennon, joint president of Bectu, says that in some areas BBC staff would be unable to compete with outsiders even if they worked for free, because of the high cost of their overheads. The BBC has set up a committee to look into overheads and managerial redundancies will almost certainly result. 'Absolute gloom' is how one old BBC hand described the present mood. There is clearly tension between the conservatives - who probably could make up most of the staff - and the radicals who take their cue from Marmaduke Hussey, and Mr John Birt the deputy director-general who takes over the top job on March 1. Sir Michael is unlikely to be approaching the need for change with the same gusto as John Birt. All the signs of the self-examination process are that what is being contemplated is a redefining of the BBC's role rather than a radical transformation - a modest move up-market away from the expected tough competition between ITV and satellite television. To continue justifying a universal licence fee the BBC will broadcast all kinds of programmes. BBC comedy might, for example, be more Victoria Wood than Les Dawson. Radio 1 would still broadcast music aimed at young people but would leave the hit parade more to the growing commercial sector. Whether the BBC can be successfully repositioned without alienating its staff and confusing its audience is open to question. Even before its governors and managers get to the final lunch of their Lucknam Park conference on Friday May 22, they will already have had plenty to chew on.</p>

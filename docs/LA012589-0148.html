			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> SMITHKLINE BECKMAN PRESIDENT QUITS AS SALES SAG, PROFITS FALL 60%  </P> <P> SmithKline Beckman Corp. said today its president has resigned amid differences  over the direction of the giant health-care company at a time when it is faced  with sagging sales of its blockbuster ulcer drug and takeover rumors.  </P> <P> George W. Ebright's resignation coincided with the release of SmithKline's  earnings, which showed a 60% drop in the company's 1988 profit.  </P> <P> Ebright's resignation is effective immediately, the company said. His duties  will be assumed by Henry Wendt, SmithKline's chairman and chief executive  officer.  </P> <P> "George and I have had differences on matters of corporate policy.  Nevertheless, I accept his resignation with deep regret," Wendt said in a  prepared statement. He added that Ebright "has played a major role in the  diversification of SmithKline Beckman and the building of our businesses."  </P> <P> SmithKline said its fourth-quarter net income rose 12% to $159.4 million, or  $1.28 a share, from $141.9 million, or $1.14 a share in the year-earlier  quarter. Revenue rose to $1.3 billion from $1.2 billion in the 1987 period.  </P> <P> The fourth-quarter figures were bolstered by income from the partial spin-off  of Beckman Instruments, which brought in $46.1 million, the company said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Future Direction  </P> <P> Analysts said Ebright's abrupt resignation probably stemmed from differences  with Wendt over the future direction of the company.  </P> <P> "Mr. Ebright was probably in favor of retaining control at the top and Mr.  Wendt was probably in favor of more independence of the units," said Ronald M.  Nordmann, a stock analyst with PaineWebber.  </P> <P> Ebright, who also was chief operating officer, stood to lose responsibility  with any independence given to the individual units, Nordmann said.  </P> <P> Ebright, 51, who became president in April, 1987, joined the company in 1963 in  the accounting department. Wendt, 55, became chairman the same month, 32 years  after joining SmithKline's international marketing division.  </P></p>

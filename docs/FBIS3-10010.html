			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas State (Mexico),  28 Feb (EFE) -- Peace in Chiapas is far away because the  government's answers are still pieces of paper, Subcommander  Marcos, leader of the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN],  stated today. "The government's answers are still a bunch of  papers, and whether it will abide by them remains to be seen.  Peace is far away; there are only promises. We still have to see  what the communities have to say," said Marcos. According to  Marcos, the EZLN is not ready to sign peace.    He stated that until now the EZLN talks with Manuel Camacho  Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas,  have been limited to a dialogue in which "he has responded to  our 34 demands, but none of them have been negotiated." He said  the 19 EZLN delegates, who participated in the talks, "have not  said if we agree with the commissioner's 34 proposals; our  leaders and grassroots communities must say it."    Subcommander Marcos said the Zapatists do not understand the  government's answers "because they clash with our languages and  culture. It is impossible to go past the negotiation phase  because we still do not understand; we have to translate their  answers into our perception of the world." He stated the San  Cristobal de las Casas talks are close to an agreement, which  will later be discussed at the grassroots level, and that the  first round "will conclude with a document of consultation,"  and after that peace will come.    He recognized Camacho Solis' sincerity in the talks but  wondered to what extent his stance represents the government's.  "Camacho Solis is telling us what is possible and what is not;  in some ways he is another mediator." He said there is no  agreement on democracy, one of the chief demands of the  Zapatists, at the talks because the government has refused to  discuss national topics. "The government has refused to discuss  democracy, refused to discuss amending Article 27, democracy, or  of recognizing the EZLN as a belligerent force, electoral  reform, justice, changes in the economic policy, and reforming  the Free Trade Agreement," he indicated.    The top leader of the EZLN reiterated that if President  Carlos Salinas de Gortari does not resign, then there ought to  be "an electoral change so it is the civilian sector of society  that controls" the 21 August elections.    The EZLN has not thought of surrendering its weapons because  "a lot of history remains to be covered. Surrendering of our  weapons is far away, perhaps 500 years away," Marcos stated. For  him, remaining armed constitutes a guarantee the government  promises will be kept. He said the Catholic Church has always  opposed Indians taking up arms, even in its role in Chiapas, it  has favored" a "collective sentiment of community in the  Christian sense."</p>

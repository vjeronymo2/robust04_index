			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Filippos Vatiliotis, general manager of the </F> Cyprus Telecommunications Authority: "High-Tech Cyprus Networks  the World"]    [Text] Due to its geographical location Cyprus has often  been considered as a stepping stone between Europe, Asia and  Africa and has for thousands of years been a meeting place for  people living and travelling in this part of the world.    The island's geographical position assumes an even greater  importance nowadays. Enhanced by the excellent  telecommunication services offered by the Cyprus  Telecommunications Authority (CYTA), as well as by other,  specialised services offered to the business community, offshore  companies and businesses have been attracted to Cyprus and the  island has established itself as the most attractive business  centre in the region and a telecommunications centre of advanced  technology.    It is widely accepted that no contemporary business  enterprise can be successful in today's demanding business world  without efficient, advanced and reliable telecommunications  facilities.    Recognising this, the Cyprus Telecommunications Authority  has  invested heavily in upgrading the telecommunications network,  enhancing the quality and expanding the range of services  offered to satisfy the growing needs of its customers.    The result has been the establishment of an excellent  telecommunications infrastructure and the provision of reliable  and efficient telecommunications services both nationally and  internationally.    In Cyprus, the contribution of telecommunications in the  general effort to reactivate the economy after the tragic events  of 1974, has been particularly significant.    Subscribers in 197 countries, or about 99% of the  world's  telephones, can be accessed automatically from Cyprus, while the  rest of the world can be reached through the operator. Telefax  service is available to all countries operating such a service,  while telex and telegraph services are provided to virtually  every country in the world. New value-added services, such as  audiotex and videoconferencing have been recently introduced.    Data transmission locally or overseas is effected either  through the public, switched telephone network and  point-to-point leased circuits, or via the Packet Switched  Public Data Network (CYTAPAC), which uses sophisticated  switching technology and ensures reliable and secure transfer of  data. Private leased circuits are also available for voice,  text and video applications.    A cellular mobile telephone service, operating at 900 MHz,  with an area coverage of more than 90% of the island, and  an  island-wide automatic radiopaging service are also offered.    CYTA also provides a range of maritime services, enabling  communication between land-based establishments and ships at  sea, as well as a variety of services and facilities to third  parties.    The authority, in its continuous drive for excellence has,  since 1986, been expanding its network and gradually replacing  analogue facilities with digital switching and transmission  systems which are considered state-of-the-art technology. By  the end of 1993 the capacity of the switching network was about  65% digital, while the digital transmission network  constituted  about 90% of the total.    The density of telephone lines for every 100 inhabitants  currently stands at about 52, which compares favorably with  European countries advanced in telecommunications, while the  figure of 65 is targeted for 1997.    Today, Cyprus is primarily connected with the rest of the  world via six satellite earth stations and three analogue  submarine cables which form a highly reliable and flexible  network.    One of the authority's main aims is to establish Cyprus as a  center of telecommunications in the Eastern Mediterranean region  to support the government's objective of turning Cyprus into an  ideal services center and information hub. With this in mind,  the Cyprus Telecommunications Authority has entered into  agreements with Greece, Israel, Syria and Lebanon for the  establishment of fiber optic submarine cable systems connecting  these countries with Cyprus and through it with the rest of the  world.    The Cyprus-Israel cable (CIOS) has already been installed  and  will be ready for service early this year. The tender for the  construction of the Cyprus-Syria link (UGARIT) was recently  awarded and the cable is expected to be ready for service by  November this year.    Tenders have also been invited for the Cyprus-Lebanon cable  (CADMOS) which is expected to become operational in March 1995.    The contract for a fourth fiber-optic submarine cable  connecting Cyprus with Greece (APHRODITE 2) was awarded early in  1993. This cable is expected to be ready for service by  September this year. Another cable, an extension of the  Cyprus-Greece cable, will be laid between Greece and  France--CYTA will be a major co-owner in this system.    A fifth fiber-optic cable connecting Cyprus with Egypt  constitutes part of the SEA-ME-WE 2 submarine, fiber-optic  cable, an extensive system stretching from Singapore across the  Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and ending at Marseilles.    When completed in July this year, SEA-ME-WE 2, covering more  than 18,000 kilometers, will be the longest fiber-optic,  submarine cable laid to date. Cyprus Telecommunications  Authority is participating in the construction of the cable  system as a co-owner, with 53 other parties.    In line with the policy of establishing Cyprus as an  information hub in the eastern Mediterranean region, the  authority entered into an agreement with Russian organisations  providing for the establishment of a satellite link between the  two countries.    The agreement also provides for the routing of  telecommunications traffic originating from Russia, as well as  from other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States,  through Cyprus to the rest of the world and vice versa. The  link will be used for telephony, data transmission, telefax,  videoconferencing, etc.    At the same time, CYTA is proceeding speedily with the  introduction of new services, using state-of-the-art technology,  so as to meet market demand.    Among these services are the Pan-European Paging System  ERMES, expected to operate in 1994; the Pan-European Cellular  Mobile Telephone System (GSM) and an integrated Services Digital  Network (ISDN) to be introduced in 1995, as well as a number of  value-added services such as videotex, electronic mail, message  handling system X.400 and voicemail in the 1994-1995 timeframe.    It is evident that the advanced, reliable and efficient  telecommunications services offered by the Cyprus  Telecommunications Authority, as well as its ambitious plans for  the future, place Cyprus among the world's developed countries  in this field and render it an ideal business center in the  Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East region.</p>

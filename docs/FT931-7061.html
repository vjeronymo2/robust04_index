			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Management: Driving force - Audi's new chairman has inherited ambitious plans for the German car group A wooden oar looks more than a little incongruous leaning against the wall in the glass, chrome and leather office of Audi's new chairman. But Franz-Josef Kortum, 42, sets great store by the welcoming gift presented to him by Ferdinand Piech, who moved out in January to take the wheel at Volkswagen, Audi's lacklustre parent. It is a symbolic reminder of the responsibilities of a steersman, says Kortum. But it also has what amounts to an explicit directive burnt into the blade: 'Audi, the most attractive European in the world market.' Piech's parting homily lacks the appeal of the brand's world-renowned 'Vorsprung durch Technik' slogan, but then the author is an engineer, not a copywriter. Kortum, by contrast, is a salesman, hardened on the forecourts of the family motor business, tempted away from Mercedes-Benz last May to take charge of Audi's new marketing division and promptly bumped up to the top job in Volkswagen's showpiece subsidiary. His arrival from relative obscurity outside the closed circuit of Volkswagen management, his youth and his business background provide ample fuel for speculation on Piech's mould-breaking intentions within VW's hide-bound central bureaucracy in Wolfsburg. Despite the apparent risks of appointing a young unknown, the clues Piech left behind at Audi show the new group chairman is no gambler. He prepared the ground meticulously before handing over. Plans to extend the model range  -with a new flagship V8 car at the top and a cheaper model to slot in below the popular Audi 80 at the bottom - were already well advanced at the time of his departure. A dedicated marketing division, separate from that of VW, was established a year ago. Since then Piech has replaced most of the old hands at the Audi helm. Most recently, he poached a production director, 48-year-old Jurgen Gebhardt, from his job as manager of General Motors' brand-new, low-cost Opel works in Eisenach, eastern Germany. Erich Schmitt, 46, was brought in from Vauxhall, another GM subsidiary, to fill a new board seat devoted to purchasing, finance and organisation. Sitting in Ingoldstadt, Bavaria, Kortum contemplates his inheritance. Behind Mercedes-Benz and BMW, he states, the Audi marque is recognised as the third German player in the quality car market. There is less than one percentage point between the market shares of the three inside Germany, where Mercedes had 6.5 per cent last year. Customers are relatively well-off. Most Audi buyers in Britain and the US are well-educated, senior, white-collar workers or managers. A typical German customer, who may not have spent so much time at college, takes home double the national average pay. Even so, the vast bulk of sales in Germany are still accounted for by the more modest models bearing the Audi 80 badge. 'What we need now is to stabilise our position in the top rank. Perhaps I can explain in a picture . . . Here we are in our Audi house.' Villa Audi has two sound middle storeys, represented in Kortum's 'picture' by the popular Audi 80 and the upmarket 100 model. But it has a flat roof and no ground floor. It needs a fine, status-symbol roof to reflect the charisma of the whole structure. This is the role of the incoming V8, due out next spring. The front garden, he adds, is represented by the distributors. Although many Audis will continue to be sold with other group brands, selected dealerships in key urban centres - a matter for negotiation with Wolfsburg - will be dedicated as prestige showplaces for Audi. The purchase of the British sales network from Lonrho and the takeover of 17 JAX distributorships in the Tokyo area, mark the beginning of this process. Meanwhile, the house needs more structural work. Kortum is preoccupied by the fact that Villa Audi still lacks a ground floor and, by implication, an easily accessible front door. Customer profiles show the average Audi purchaser in Germany is aged 49, in Britain 45 and somewhere between the two in the US. Although Kortum claims there is a downward trend at the lower margin of the age profile, he admits there are still too few young people on dealers' registers. Enter the Audi 50 - a car pitched close to the market position now occupied by the evergreen VW Golf. Kortum sounds less than certain when he promises its arrival for sometime in the second half of the decade. However, he considers it essential for his strategy of drawing in new buyers early and keeping them moving upstairs in the Audi house rather than down the road to Mercedes. He recognises the strengthening tendency for car buyers to switch brands more readily. New competition is emerging from all sides - not least from Mercedes, which also plans to introduce a cheaper entry-level model to its heavyweight range. Demand is also undergoing subtle changes influenced by a reluctance among the well-off to flaunt their possessions. Environmental awareness is generating new trends in taste and behaviour. Despite the present structural deficiencies, Kortum considers Audi well-armed to cope. The marque's carefully nurtured reputation as a high-tech maker will be protected. The 'Vorsprung durch Technik' selling line will remain, however, future promotions will be 'a bit more emotional', extending the appeal to people looking for a 'sympathetic' brand. These qualities, he promises, will become wholly apparent with the launch of the flagship V8. 'It will be elegant and overall an environmentally-compatible compromise in terms of weight, fuel consumption and recyclability,' Kortum claims. That may be so, but Kortum, who is faced with having to cut Audi's total output by up to 15 per cent this year and does not foresee an upturn in the depressed motor market until 1995-96, cannot hope for more than modest early sales. While the recession runs its course, his oar will act as a reminder of why he was brought in. His job is to ensure the brand's new age aura is radiating at full wattage when Villa Audi is complete.</p>

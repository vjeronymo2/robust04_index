			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading BUSY trading in the deriv-atives markets, fuelled by the expiry of the March contract on the FT-SE, lifted sentiment only to see support dissipate as equities drifted lower, writes Christopher Price. The March future opened at 2,460 before being squeezed to 2,465 as traders moved to close positions. After that initial spurt, March came to a limp end, expiring at 2,450.5. As March closed, the June contract stood at 2,478, a 10-point premium to estimated fair value of around 28. June dipped and then rallied before trading in a tight range of 2,472-75 in the afternoon. The June future contract finished at 2,473, a drop of 17 on the previous day's session, but still a six-point premium to fair value. Volume was heavy with almost 10,000 contracts traded by the termination of after-hours' dealing. In the traded options market, there was active business in the FT-SE 100 option, which recorded a day's total of 16,375 lots. Barclays was the top-traded equity option, with the September 330 calls particularly active. Troubled conglomerate Lonrho was also in demand, with the June 70 puts prominent. Yesterday's total turnover was 31,794, up 4,332 on the previous session.</p>

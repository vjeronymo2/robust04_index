			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Deposed Serrano goes into exile MR Jorge Serrano, Guatemala's former president, left the country for El Salvador yesterday, a day after he was deposed by the Guatemalan military. A Salvadorean government official confirmed that Mr Serrano was in the country and being treated normally. He had left Guatemala after his safety was guaranteed publicly by the army there. Last week Mr Serrano had suspended the constitution and attempted to seize authoritarian powers. Congress has been given five days by a constitutional court to name a new president and vice-president. Last night, however, Vice-President Gustavo Espina declared himself president. Speaking at his home surrounded by civilian members of Mr Serrano's former cabinet, he denied that he had resigned along with the president on Tuesday. The Congress went into emergency session on hearing the news. In negotiations with the military and business leaders, leading politicians have given a commitment to 'cleanse' Congress of corrupt legislators. Mr Serrano's claim last week that many legislators were crooked touched a chord in the country, but it is not clear how the purge will be achieved. Apart from the vice-president, possible successors to Mr Serrano - to complete a term up to January 1996 - are Mr Arturo Herbruger, 83-year-old president of the supreme electoral tribunal, and Mr Edmond Mulet, ambassador to Washington, who resigned following Mr Serrano's attempted 'self-coup'. Mr Serrano was deposed after meetings on Monday night and Tuesday morning with business and political leaders. He tried to persuade congressmen to reconvene the legislature but, after he seemed to have failed to win enough support, he was asked by military commanders - led by General Jose Domingo Garca Samayoa, the defence minister - to stand down. Mr Serrano's removal is being seen as a counter-coup by the military, business and political classes without any important popular participation. 'The popular movement has demonstrated its considerable weakness,' said Mr Rene Toitevin, a political analyst.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- The government will likely  review Japan's public service fee system, but Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata is ruling out tax money for highway tolls, the  economic planning chief said Tuesday [24 May].    "Almost all" cabinet ministers agreed at an informal  gathering after the morning cabinet meeting to review the system  in the wake of Hata's move last week to freeze all public fee  hikes for the rest of the year, said Yoshio Terasawa, director  general of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA).    Tuesday's gathering gave "the atmosphere" of an agreement,  although nothing was decided officially, Terasawa told a regular  news conference.    But he said Hata immediately ruled out an idea floated by  Land Agency chief Megumu Sato to consider using funds from the  general account of the national budget to offset some highway  toll costs. Terasawa corrected remarks he made earlier,  attributing that idea to Farm Minister Mutsuki Kato.    But Sato's proposed "project team" to review the public fee  system is likely to be formed quickly, Terasawa said, citing  more informal talks slated for later in the day.    He said the team would fashion some kind of report by the  end  of June, when the government has pledged to flesh out its  deregulation and market-opening plans.    Kato, head of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and  Fisheries, was one of the cabinet ministers who spoke in support  of a fundamental review of the fee system, Terasawa said.    Other vocal supporters, he said, were Construction Minister  Koji Morimoto, Home Affairs Minister Keigo Ouchi, and Katsuyuki  Hikasa, head of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry, and  Eijiro Hata, international trade and industry minister.    But two of the most powerful ministers were silent,  according  to Terasawa. Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and Transport  Minister Nobuaki Futami, did not comment, the EPA chief said.    In supporting the review himself, Terasawa said he wants to  EPA [as received] to focus less on "price stability" and more on  "lowering prices."    Japanese people must pay a proliferation of basic charges,  and "for consumers, prices are too high," said Terasawa, who  lived in the United States until recently as vice president of  Nomura Securities Co.    He said the move to revamp the fee system follows the logic  that Prime Minister Hata expressed in abruptly deciding last  week to freeze the public fee hikes -- the government must show  the public it is undergoing the same "thorough restructuring"  that the nation's businesses have tackled in the prolonged  recession.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Urban spread may be under-reported THE AREA of countryside lost every year to urban sprawl may be twice as great as government figures suggest, according to a report by the Council for the Protection of Rural England, the rural pressure group. In the first survey of land-use since the second world war, the CPRE claims that 'an area the size of Exeter, Norwich and Oxford' could be urbanised each year. The survey argues that farmers have consistently under-reported the area of land which is no longer used for farming. It claims that 'an area the size of Greater London has been 'lost' from official figures'. Using new data from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, together with environmental surveys, the CPRE suggests that the current rate of urbanisation could be as much as 11,000 hectares a year. The government's figures are nearer 5,000 hectares a year.</p>

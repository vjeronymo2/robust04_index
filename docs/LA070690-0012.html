No Way, (July 3)": There can never be peace in  this favored land until there is justice. Tell me if you can where is the  justice in Donald Trump having $450,000 to spend every single month when an  army of children cry themselves to sleep every night because it hurts to be  hungry.  </P> <P> GLADYS FOREMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOOD-NEIGHBOR POLICY OR JUST PLAIN MADNESS?  </P> <P> This intervention is a good-neighbor policy. America's role in Panama -- in  effect, administering a recount on last May's elections -- is an act of  hemispheric hygiene and it comes at a propitious moment. It punctuates a decade  of recovery of national purposefulness and a year of militant democracy.  </P> <P> A constant of America's national character, and a component of American  patriotism, has been a messianic impulse -- sometimes mild, sometimes not. It  rises from the belief that national identity is bound up with acceptance of a  responsibility to further democracy.  </P> <P> By stressing, among the reasons for intervention, the restoration of democracy,  the President put himself squarely in a tradition with a distinguished  pedigree. It holds that America's fundamental national interest is to be  America, and the nation's identity is inseparable from a commitment to the  civilized advancement of the proposition to which we, unique among nations,  are, as the greatest American said, dedicated.  </P> <P> That is why, although the President's reasons for the invasion are sufficient  to justify it, the first reason he gave is the one that explains it: It was an  act of neighborliness.  </P></p>

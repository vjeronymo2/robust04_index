			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 9 May (MENA)--The Arab Republic of Egypt has  announced the resumption of diplomatic relations with South  Africa at ambassadorial level as of Tuesday 10 May 1994.    A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry today said  Egypt's  decision to establish diplomatic relations with South Africa  conforms to Egypt's position, which supported all stages of the  democratic movement and the annihilation of apartheid in South  Africa. These movements began in 1989 and culminated with the  democratic nonracial elections in April 1994. In the election,  every citizen was able to exercise his right to chose his  representative within the context of freedom, equality, and  justice, thus ending the system of apartheid.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- A senior leader of the  Social Democratic Party (SDP) on Thursday [26 May] called on  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to resign once the state budget  clears the Diet and before a no-confidence vote so as to fashion  a new coalition government.    "I believe the coalition's continued hold on power is the  demands of the times," SDP secretary general Wataru Kubo told  reporters after meeting Hata at the premier's official residence.    "I told (Hata) a voluntary resignation is one option if he  wishes to form a new coalition government and solidify his power  base," he said.    Hata replied that he will strive to fulfill his duties as  head of government, Kubo said.    Hata agreed to meet SDP chairman Tomiichi Murayama, leader  of  the second largest opposition party, whenever necessary, to  compare notes on issues of mutual concern, Kubo said.    Kubo also said Saturday that the Hata cabinet should resign  as soon as the fiscal 1994 budget wins Diet approval, and before  the opposition camp submits a no-confidence motion against the  government.    Kubo, the No. 2 man in the SDP, said this to Japanese  reporters traveling with him on his trip to China, indicating  the SDP may move to bury the hatchet with its former coalition  partners and join a new ruling union.    Questioned Thursday about the possibility of the SDP's  return  to the coalition, Kubo said he did not discuss the matter with  the premier in their meeting.    In late April, the SDP broke away from the coalition in  protest against the formation by other coalition parties of a  new parliamentary group excluding the SDP, the alliance's  largest contingent.    As a result, Hata was forced to lead the first minority  government since 1955.    The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the largest opposition  group, has threatened to introduce a motion of no-confidence  against the Hata cabinet after passage of the budget.    Defeat on such a motion would leave the premier with a  choice  of either resigning or calling a snap general election.    If Hata quit after a no-confidence vote, Kubo said, he would  have no other choice but to hand the reins of government over to  the LDP.    On the other hand, he said, if a snap poll is called after  Diet passage of the budget, it should be contested under the  current multiseat electoral system, which is to be replaced by a  new system combining single-seat constituencies with  proportional representation.    Hata contends that the next general election must be called  under the new system, which, however, requires the enactment of  a bill to redraw the electoral map. To hold an election under  the old system would be to abandon political reform, he says.    Kubo visited Hata to relay the reply of Chinese President  and  Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin to the premier's  personal letter he handed over when he met the Chinese leader.</p>

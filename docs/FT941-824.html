			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Company News (This Week): AGF - Other Companies The Paris stockmarket is already braced for a weak set of results from Assurances Generales de France on Wednesday. Mr Antoine Jeancourt Galignani, the new chairman, is expected to announce a sharp fall in net profits to around FFr1bn (Dollars 160m) for 1993 from FFr1.5bn. Yet analysts are confident that AGF will rebound in 1994, thereby boosting its prospects for a successful privatisation later this year.</p>

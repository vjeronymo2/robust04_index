			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Because the issue of the DPRK's (North Korea)  refusal to submit to nuclear inspections is again being referred  to the UN Security Council [UNSC], the government is now  considering concrete measures to take in this situation. As for  the diplomatic aspect, the basic policy is for Japan, the United  States, and South Korea to apply stronger pressure on North  Korea to push it to change its mind through close coordination  with ROK President Kim Yong-sam, who will visit Japan starting  on 24 March. However, depending on what the United States,  which is very much irritated by its negotiations with the DPRK,  does from now on, the possibility remains that a [UNSC]  resolution calling for economic sanctions -- which would be "a  very serious matter for Japan" -- may come to pass.    Under the circumstances, Japan must make intensive domestic  coordination efforts in preparation for possible economic  sanctions, and at this point, measures such as stopping  remittances to the DPRK, an export-import embargo, and  restrictions on shipping services are being considered.  However, there are also such difficult problems as how to  ensure the effectiveness of the sanctions.    As for the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA)  decision to "refer the issue again to the UNSC," a Foreign  Ministry source said that "this was an expected outcome." He  admitted that from the point that the IAEA started to draft its  resolution, Japan had believed that submitting the DPRK issue to  the UNSC was inevitable. This source also predicted that "the  UNSC will first adopt a resolution calling only for the  unconditional acceptance of nuclear inspections to see North  Korea's reaction." He expects that there is still some time  before actual economic sanctions come to pass.    Nevertheless, the United States and the ROK are taking  urgent  steps to deal with the DPRK, such as agreeing to resume the Team  Spirit joint military exercises, and to deploy Patriot  antimissile missiles in South Korea. The government's  assessment of the situation is that: 1) Japan, whose security  is seriously affected, needs to coordinate its actions with the  United States and the ROK. 2) Through the discussions with key  leaders during Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to  China, and the visit of Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and  foreign minister, to Russia, it is apparent that China and  Russia's sense of crisis is inadequate. During President Kim  Yong-sam's visit to Japan, the two countries will declare to the  world that Japan and the ROK share very serious concerns and  that they will abide by the UNSC's decisions.    If the UNSC does adopt a resolution on economic sanctions,  Japan will be forced to take a tough stand. After the 1983  Rangoon incident and the bombing of the Korean Airlines plane in  1987, Japan has imposed certain sanctions, but these are limited  to banning contacts between diplomats and banning the entry of  North Korean chartered planes and DPRK civil servants.    Within the government, an import-export embargo, stopping  remittances to the DPRK, and restricting shipping services are  being considered as possible sanctions. Some officials believe  that because there is inadequate information on remittances to  North Korea--which are said to reach 60 billion yen to 100  billion yen a year--"remittances cannot be stopped if they go  through China or another third country" (according to a Foreign  Ministry source). The problem will be how to ensure the  effectiveness of the ban. Moreover, restricting personal travel  is an issue that affects travelers' human rights. Japan will be  forced to make very difficult decisions.    Prime Minister Hosokawa has stated that Japan "will take  responsible measures within the limits of the Constitution."  Some believe that "support for naval activities by the U.S.  forces in relation to the economic sanctions" may become  inevitable. The Maritime Self-Defense Force's logistical  support to the U.S. 7th Fleet "is still a question that needs to  be considered in terms of a legal basis and a legal  interpretation" (according to a senior Foreign Ministry  official). Japan still has to coordinate the final details.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: French Connection mounts recovery Shares of French Connection Group rose 14p to 169p yesterday after the USM-traded fashion clothing company mounted a strong profits recovery, writes Graham Deller. On turnover ahead 35 per cent to Pounds 63.9m, the pre-tax line for the 12 months to January 31 amounted to Pounds 5.14m, against losses last time, restated for FRS 3, of Pounds 133,000. Mr George Wardale, chairman, said: 'Our strong brands (French Connection and Nicole Farhi) performed well in difficult markets which, along with a strict control of costs, resulted in the return to profitability.' The retail environment was 'still demanding', he added, although summer collections had been well received and winter order books for both labels were ahead of the previous year. UK sales improved to Pounds 36.7m (Pounds 29.97m) with good performances in both wholesale and retail operations. Turnover in the US jumped from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 20.7m - reflecting the addition of two more stores in New York and significantly higher wholesale business. After tax at an effective rate of 31.5 per cent and minorities, earnings per share emerged at 17.3p, against losses last time of 4.5p. Directors said a dividend would be considered 'when the accumulated profit and loss account returns to credit'.</p>

It is to be  recalled that the procurator general of the central government  recently instituted a criminal charge on various issues against  Lencho Leta and Ibsa Gutema and that their cases had been under  review at the central high court and were scheduled to be heard  on 5 January.    The accused, Mr. Lencho Leta and Mr. Ibsa Gutema, in their  application to the Ministry of Justice of the Transitional  Government of Ethiopia, submitted that in so far as we believe  that differences created in the implementation of the tenets of  the charter can only be resolved peacefully and not through war,  and in so far as we are ready to make every effort to ensure  that those concerned work to this end to carry out their  activities along these lines, we ask for charges against both of  us to be dropped.    After the Ministry of Justice presented the application of  the accused to the government and after an assessment carried  out by the government, the government decided to enter a nolle  prosequi and gave an order for the same to the Ministry of  Justice through the procurator general on 4 January.

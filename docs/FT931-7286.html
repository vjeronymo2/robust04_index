			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / People: Mulcahy to take over at AIB Tom Mulcahy is to be appointed as the new group chief executive of Allied Irish Banks, Ireland's largest clearing bank, succeeding Gerry Scanlan who retires in February next year. Mulcahy joined AIB in 1972 and since 1989 has been the group general manager of its capital markets division, responsible for the group's corporate finance, treasury, investment banking, stockbroking and international operations. He previously served in senior corporate, international and merchant banking posts in Dublin and London, setting up a merchant banking arm in London in 1973. He was appointed a director of AIB in 1990. He began his banking career in 1958 with National Bank, later to be incorporated into the Bank of Ireland, and oversaw the acquisition of Goodbody stockbrokers in 1990, one of the four main broking firms in Dublin. He succeeded in getting the bank appointed as corporate finance adviser in some of the principal acquisitions in the Irish market over the past year, valued at some IPounds 250m. Mulcahy, 51, was one of a number of strong candidates from within the bank. Jerry Casey, the chief executive of AIB's US division whose subsidiary, First Maryland Bancorp, has been performing particularly well - now contributing 25 per cent of group profits - was thought to be high on the shortlist. Mulcahy is a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants and a fellow of the Institute of Bankers.</p>

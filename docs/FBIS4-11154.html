			<p>BFN     [Text] Carlos Lage, secretary of the Executive Committee of  the Council of Ministers, presented to participants of the  Nation and the Emigre Community Conference an analysis on the  current situation of the economy, and its prospects. Lage's  presentation brought about an exchange of ideas by Cuban  authorities and the more than 200 residents from abroad who are  attending the forum.    The Nation and the Emigre Community Conference will conclude  today at 2030 GMT and according to Miguel Alfonso, spokesman for  the conference, the debate has retained an elevated tone of  respect. Especially notable was the positive attitude toward the  fatherland.    The meeting was inaugurated on Friday with speeches by  Ricardo Alarcon and Abel Prieto, presidents of the National  Assembly of the People's Government and the National Union of  Cuban Writers and Artists, respectively, and by Cuban Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina.    Among the decisions adopted during the conference with the  emigre community were: continuation of contacts and exchanges to  promote the normalization of relations, creation of an office to  take care of emigration issues, and creation of a specialized  magazine for that sector. The elimination of the five-year  waiting period for those who abandoned the country to legally  return, and abolition of the requirement for them to obtain  reservations in hotels, were other measures discussed.    Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina also informed  participants at the conference of the government's willingness  to facilitate cultural links reaffirming their Cuban nature.    The meeting was devised by our country in an attempt to  identify common problems between the nation and the emigre  community and to promote solutions to those problems.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] It has been announced that Turkey has always been  careful to refrain from actions that could cause tension in its  relations with Greece. In reply to a question during his weekly  news conference today, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman  said the straining of relations between Turkey and Greece will  not serve the interests of either country. Ataman recalled that  during the NATO foreign ministers meeting held in Istanbul, the  Greek foreign minister informed Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin  that he shares Turkey's stand on this issue and will be pleased  to see it implemented. Within this framework, Ataman stressed,  Turkish planes flew over the Aegean without weapons for some  time.    Ataman continued: This gesture on the part of Turkey has not  been reciprocated yet. This is extremely important, in that it  sheds light on the Greek attitude. Under these circumstances,  it is natural for us to take the measures we deem necessary in  line with the flight security and operational needs of our  planes.</p>

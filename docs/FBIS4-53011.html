			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- An international  signature campaign and other extensive activities for solidarity  with the Korean people have been launched upon the lapse of one  year since the great leader President Kim Il-song published  "10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for  the reunification of the country."    More than 360 million people including heads of party, state  and government and other political and public figures of India,  Nepal, Syria, Egypt, Guinea, France, Austria, Peru, Nicaragua  and many other countries and international and regional  organizations signed the signature paper supporting the 10-point  programme in April. And various forms of solidarity functions  such as meeting, seminar and lecture were held and statements  and appeals were issued.    The International Liaison Committee for the Reunification  and  Peace in Korea (Cilreco) published an appeal and a signature  paper on the first anniversary of the publication of the  10-point programme.    The appeal said the 10-point programme put forward by  President Kim Il-song is a great programme for Korean  reunification indicating a way for the Korean people to found  the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo independently and  called for an international signature campaign supporting it in  all countries.    In response to the appeal, political parties and  organizations of Ghana, Mali, Russia, the Czech Republic and  many other countries formed committees for sponsoring and  promoting the signature campaign supporting the 10-point  programme.    The signature campaign is going on worldwide.</p>

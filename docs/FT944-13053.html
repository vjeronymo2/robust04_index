			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Fixed mortgages lose their appeal Borrowers turned away from banks' fixed-rate mortgages to their variable rate loans in the third quarter, according to figures released yesterday by the British Bankers' Association. It said the proportion of mortgages on fixed rates dropped from 73 per cent in the second quarter to 53 per cent. In contrast to last summer when banks won significant mortgage business through fixed rates, which were cheaper than variable rate loans, fixed rates can now be more expensive than floating-rate mortgages, particularly those which have heavy discounts in the early years. The figures underline the shift in market share between banks and building societies since last year. Seasonally adjusted figures for new net lending undertaken rose to Pounds 659m last month compared with Pounds 610m in August, but below the Pounds 827m equivalent figure for September last year. However, the impact of the 0.5 percentage point rise in interest rates last month is less clear-cut. Loans approved but not yet undertaken - an important forward-looking indicator since they translate into lending carried out in the following weeks - dropped from 31,047 approved in August to 29,718 approved in September. A similar drop occurred between August and September last year, but from a higher base. The association highlighted the fact that banks' gross mortgage lending totalled Pounds 1.74bn in September - more than 3 per cent higher than in September last year.</p>

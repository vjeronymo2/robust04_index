			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Leading Article: A squandered opportunity TWO AND a half years ago, Fernando Collor de Mello became the first democratically elected president of Brazil to take office for 30 years. He came to power in part on the strength of a promise to clean up the corruption endemic in his country's political system. He offered the prospect of breaking the mould of Brazilian politics. Today, that prospect lies in ruins: Mr Collor, charged with corruption, may face a humiliating impeachment by Congress unless he resigns. To shake up the Brazilian system, Mr Collor had to confront powerful entrenched interests - Brazil's political warlords and cossetted big business - and to do so he needed to be beyond reproach himself. Lamentably, he could not meet this test. A congressional inquiry has this week made a strong case that the president was aware of corrupt practices among close advisers, and benefited financially from them. Whatever he does to try to preserve his hold on power, Mr Collor will never be able to rebuild the trust he has lost. If he stays in power - his mandate runs until March 1995 - it will inevitably be as a lame duck. At best, policymaking would stagnate at a time when Brazil needs to embrace aggressive fiscal and political reform. At worst, the efforts to unseat the president would continue to dominate political life, bringing democracy into further disrepute. The threat of a military coup must still be considered slight, but if street protests against the president were to threaten anarchy, that unpleasant possibility could not be ruled out. Military government provided no answers for Brazil after the army's previous takeovers in 1955 and 1964, and it offers even less of a solution today. Reform programme The Collor presidency has not been an unmitigated disaster. He has begun the economic and fiscal reform which Brazil needs to resume growth, including a significant abolition of import and other government controls and a lowering of tariffs. The reform programme undoubtedly could and should have gone further, but it has already engendered a genuine sense of change among enterprises in Brazil. However, reform no longer depends on President Collor. The current economic team, led by economy minister Marcilio Marques Moreira, is committed to continuing change - particularly to sorting out Brazil's chaotic fiscal situation. Without that, financial support from the International Monetary Fund will remain in doubt; as will the debt restructuring deal now being negotiated with the international banks. There is no reason why Mr Moreira's team should not be able to operate under a replacement president - even under the current vice-president, Mr Itamar Franco, whose rhetoric in the past has been hostile to economic reform. Divert attention The practical difficulties of building a reform-minded political coalition in Brazil should not be underestimated. However, there is - even in the Brazilian legislature - a growing sense that the system has to change. At the very least, the prospects for reform without Mr Collor would be no less bad than they are with him. By insisting on hanging on to office, Mr Collor would also divert attention from what would otherwise be the central political issue in the coming months: reform of the 1988 constitution that has rendered the country virtually ungovernable. A referendum is to be held in which voters will have a choice of changing the political system - for example, to a parliamentary government. What is more, Congress will be able to vote next year on a range of changes to the constitution - which for example guarantees the jobs of federal government workers - by simple majority rather than by the two-thirds normally required. A consensus needs to be built to effect suitable change. In the meantime, the importance of preserving constitutional order in Brazil is paramount. An impeachment may become a drawn-out process. But if Mr Collor refuses to resign, then it must be allowed to take its course, without interference from any quarter. The president has squandered, through weakness or avarice, a great opportunity to serve his people. He would best serve their interests now by resigning and allowing a constitutional handover of power.</p>

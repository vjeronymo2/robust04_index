Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii offered the  triple-dose prescription for economic growth at the first  finance ministers' meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) forum in Honolulu. "With a sound  macroeconomic policy, it is important to strengthen domestic  savings, strengthen the private sector and improve human  resources," Fujii told his APEC colleagues.    Fujii also promised Japan's financial support, both through  bilateral and multilateral channels, to help the developing  nations in the APEC group.    Japanese officials said there was strong interest among APEC  ministers in the Japanese model of economic development. "We  are pleased that we got this kind of attention from our APEC  partners," one Japanese official said.    Fujii said Japan's high rate of capital formation has been  backed by a high rate of savings among the Japanese people.  Research and development done by the private sector has also  contributed to the success of product development among Japanese  firms, he said.</p>

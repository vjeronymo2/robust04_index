			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Proteus may develop BSE test Shares of Proteus International rose 7p to 140p yesterday after the biotechnology company announced it was close to developing a diagnostic test for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, in live cattle. The company said its test confirmed the BSE diagnosis in a sample of 169 dead cattle brains and suggested it could be used in other body organs, and blood, to provide a test for use on live animals. Mr Jurek Sikorski, Proteus' business development and marketing director, said it was in talks with an animal health company about developing, manufacturing and marketing the test, which it expects to be available by 1997. The potential market for a BSE test for live cattle and carcasses destined for human consumption is estimated at Dollars 100m (Pounds 63.2m) in Europe. There is currently no test for BSE on live cattle. About 5 per cent of suspected animals destroyed are found, on post mortem, not to have it. The incidence of BSE has fallen dramatically this year and farmers are hoping it will be virtually wiped out by the end of the decade.</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A GOOD SAMARITAN;  </P> <P> THE GOOD DIE YOUNG  </P> <P> Gary Smith helped a fellow citizen. Sadly, it cost him his life.  </P> <P> The 35-year-old San Diego carpet layer was cut down, brutally and needlessly,  because he cared enough to get involved, something so few of us do.  </P> <P> Smith was installing a rug in a condominium when he heard screams from a woman  in the building next door. He went to her rescue and chased a gun-wielding  burglar. Smith, who was not armed, was shot in the face, abdomen, left arm and  right thigh. He succumbed last week to the ravages of the four bullet wounds  after enduring five operations.  </P> <P> But Smith inspired other citizens of San Diego. They came to his aid in his  battle against death. More than 500 people each donated a pint of blood in  Smith's name. Donations, which continue to flow in, now total about $27,000.  The San Diego Police Officers Assn. established a $1,000 scholarship fund for  Smith's three children. More than a thousand letters and cards poured into  Scripps Memorial Hospital where his family held vigil for six days.  </P> <P> In his memory, the hospital lowered its flag to half staff -- the first time it  has done so for a patient. His family articulated the loss that the entire  community feels: "We are devastated. His death is not fair because he was so  good, and he was only trying to help."  </P> <P> We, too, mourn the death of Gary Smith, who courageously followed his  conscience as a good Samaritan. If only the gunman had had a conscience.  </P></p>

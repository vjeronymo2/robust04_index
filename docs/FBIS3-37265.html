Has Been Prepared at the Level of Treason"]    [Text] [IBERIA] Batono [Georgian polite form of  address] Boris, could you briefly tell us about your  organization?    [Kakubava] The Organization for the Liberation of Abkhazia  was set up on 6 December 1991 on the basis of the council of the  Abkhazian National Movement. This council is an organization  elected by the Georgian population in Abkhazia that has been  expelled from Abkhazia by the existing authorities there. Our  aim is to secure the return of the 250,000 refugees to their  permanent places of residence.    [IBERIA] How do you plan to achieve your aim?    [Kakubava] We intend to achieve our aim by political means.  The authorities are currently conducting negotiations via those  people who believe that Abkhazia is not a part of Georgia. It  is precisely as a result of this that Abkhazia has been granted  the status of a state subject in the world. However, we, the  Organization for the Liberation of Abkhazia, declare that a  separatist grouping is currently functioning in Abkhazia that  cannot be granted the status of a state. We are the sole body  that is able to conduct negotiations in Geneva and that has  found a way to get the refugees back.    The Georgian people have the ability to defend their  motherland. Negotiations are not the only policy -- war is also  a policy! True, we are unable to conduct expansionist wars, but  we will always have the strength and military potential to  protect our motherland. It is an insult to the nation to say  that we have lost the war against the Abkhazians. The world  should see that we are struggling not against 1 percent of the  Georgian population, but against the Russian regular army with  its military hardware, aviation, and fleet.    Georgia lost Abkhazia as a result of Gamsakhurdia's  stupidity  while the inaction of the present authorities is contributing to  the formation of Abkhazia as an independent state. Those issues  regarding the fact that Georgian land bearing the name of  Abkhazia should be part of Georgia, that the jurisdiction of the  Republic of Georgia should extend there, and that the invading  army should be withdrawn from its territory should always stand  at the forefront of the negotiations.    The Georgian authorities should stop proceeding along a  criminal path and give us the opportunity to raise these three  issues and make the world understand what has happened in  Abkhazia. Our organization unites 250,000 refugees. We are a  semi-paramilitary organization. Each one of us is ready to  return to his home with weapon in hand and, if another way is  not found, this is what will indeed happen.    We will not permit Jaba Ioseliani to take charge of the  negotiations in Geneva and Abkhazia's interests to be defended  by Ada Marshania, an Abkhazian woman who said in an interview  that Abkhazia was independent and that we should grant it  statehood. The Geneva communique on a settlement of the  Abkhazian conflict signed on 13 January, which was presented to  the people by the authorities as the result of great work, has  been prepared at the level of treason. The Georgian authorities  should immediately stop deceiving the people. The commission  should be changed for the next round of talks and the work of  the present commission should become a subject for discussion.  Otherwise, if the government is not willing to hear what we  have to say, we will raise the question of its resignation.    [IBERIA] How realistic is it to talk about the return  of the refugees given the current situation?    [Kakubava] As regards the return of refugees to Gali rayon,  I believe that whoever raised this question is far removed from  politics. This means that we are dispatching the Georgian  population as emigrants onto that territory that is under  Abkhazian jurisdiction and where they can expect to be shot by  separatists. It is written in this Geneva agreement that the  Abkhazian authorities are entrusted with ensuring the return,  reception, and protection of the refugees. However, this  signifies our recognition of Abkhazia's statehood. Until  Georgian jurisdiction is restored in Abkhazia, it is a crime to  speak about the return of the refugees; the people are being  deceived!    We do not want to be in opposition to the Georgian  Government  but, if the authorities do not listen to us, we will try to  apply pressure in every way (I do not have in mind  demonstrations as the situation in Georgia is tense enough  already) since the road to Abkhazia does not pass through Geneva.    [IBERIA] Finally, what is your attitude toward the  Union of Georgia's Citizens?    [Kakubava] The Union of Georgia's Citizens is a recently  restored communist organization. It is an attempt to resurrect  the Bolshevik-communist structures and will not bring the people  anything good.</p>

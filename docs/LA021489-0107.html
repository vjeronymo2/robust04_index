			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities were mixed, with rates on  six-month bills climbing to the highest level in nearly four years. The  Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in three-month bills at an average  discount rate of 8.49%, down from 8.57% last week. Another $7.2 billion was  sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 8.54%, up from 8.53%  last week. The rates for six-month bills were the highest since April 8, 1985,  when they averaged 8.56%. The rates for three-month bills were the lowest since  they averaged 8.33% on Jan. 30. The new discount rates understate the actual  return to investors -- 8.80% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling  for $9,785.40, and 9.05% for a six-month bill selling for $9,568.30.  </P></p>

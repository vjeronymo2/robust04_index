			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Arts: Royal Philharmonic Orchestra - Royal Festival Hall While other London orchestras are intent on establishing centres of activity, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra has been out on the road. Yesterday it completed what is claimed to be the first tour by any arts organisation to link all the capital cities of the European Community, sponsored by Cellnet. It is heartening that the RPO's Vladimir Ashkenazy, like other foreign conductors who have held resident posts in London, has proved sympathetic towards British music. For while the tour has done nothing to promote living British composers, it has included a token British piece in each programme and a few performances of Walton's First Symphony; though I note that only in London and Dublin did the management risk the Fifth Symphony of Vaughan Williams, a less cosmopolitan score. Audiences abroad will have found the RPO holding on to its warm and well-blended sound during Ashkenazy's period of tenure. Overall bloom takes precedence over clarity and detail, or at least that is how it seemed at the official London concert of the tour last Friday from a seat well to the side of the auditorium. The evening was predominantly a French one. Berlioz's Overture to Beatrice et Benedict opened the programme and Ravel's La Valse closed it, both in unexaggerated performances, though it was difficult to hear much of what was going on in either. In between the soprano Jill Gomez made a soloist of plausibly Gallic sympathies in a selection of Canteloube's Songs of the Auvergne and two little-heard Berlioz settings, 'La Captive' and 'Zade", where she let the words go unheard too often. A companion concert on Tuesday, in theory outside the tour although it repeated a tour programme, was more substantial. Ashkenazy has not yet taken up much Vaughan Williams, but on the evidence of this performance of the Fifth Symphony, we would benefit from his doing so. The music moved well and the lambent lyricism which he favours in other areas of his repertoire here found a natural outlet, with the RPO players at their best attaining just that sense of ethereal beauty which one imagines Vaughan Williams must have had in mind. The symphony is dedicated to Sibelius and it was that composer's Violin Concerto that preceded it. The soloist was Midori, the 20-year-old Japanese violinist, who is a little pushed to find a full enough sound for this concerto's big romantic climaxes. But as soon as speed is called for, her spitfire energy excitingly takes command. If a balance between introspective Nordic gloom and outgoing solo virtuosity is sought for this music, then Midori is aware of both, although one cannot help sensing where her own priorities lie. In case that should leave any doubt in the matter, it must be stated clearly that this young violinist is not only a formidable technician, but also a musician who knows what she wants to say with every note. Whatever outcome the GATT negotiations may bring, it is presumably safe to assume that there will be no import barriers on violinists of her quality from the Far East.</p>

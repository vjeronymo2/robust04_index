			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Khmer Rouge guerrillas attack a Chinese army unit Khmer Rouge guerrillas have attacked a Chinese army unit in central Cambodia, the first time the Maoist faction has turned its guns on the country that supported it for decades, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh. The Khmer Rouge fired shells, rockets, mortars and small arms at the Chinese engineer base and adjoining Polish logistics facility in Kompong Thom province on Tuesday night, Mr EricFalt, of the UN peace force said yesterday. In Beijing the foreign ministry, without naming the Khmer Rouge, rebuked its one-time ally for the attack. 'We express our deep regret over the shelling of the Chinese engineering battalion in Cambodia,' it said. Mr Falt said about 200 Khmer Rouge fired an estimated 200-300 rounds of artillery and recoilless rifle shells at the peacekeepers' positions during the two-hour attack.</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Hanson to raise Dollars 1bn via convertible bond offering Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, intends to raise Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) through one of the largest-ever international convertible bond offerings. The company said the proceeds of the offering, which will be issued by its indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary Hanson America, would be used to retire existing bank debt. Bankers involved in arranging the widely-expected offering said the funds raised would partly refinance the expensive debt which Hanson inherited when it bought Quantum Chemical Corporation last year. They added that the structure of the deal, which is being arranged by Lehman Brothers, provided Hanson with a tax-efficient way to finance its US operations. Last week, Hanson announced plans to complete the refinancing of Quantum's Dollars 2.35bn (Pounds 1.6bn) worth of junk bond debt. The company is to redeem three bond issues on March 15 with a total of Dollars 900m outstanding, which were paying an average interest rate of 11.4 per cent. It redeemed Dollars 1.15bn of bonds at the end of October last year and bought Dollars 300m of bonds in the market. Altogether this debt bore an average rate of 11 per cent. The new bonds, which are exchangeable into Hanson's American depositary shares, are likely to have a current yield of about three per cent. But since the bonds will be issued at a relatively deep discount to par, their yield to maturity is likely to be between 5 1/4 and 5 3/4 per cent. The bonds are expected to have a maturity of seven years and carry a conversion premium of between 20 to 22 per cent. Yesterday Hanson's ADSs traded at Dollars 20 3/8 , down  5/8 on the day.

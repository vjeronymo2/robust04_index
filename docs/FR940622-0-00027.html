			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Whistleblower protections (section 6211(f) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OBRA 89). Participating hospitals may not take action against a physician because he or she refused to authorize the transfer of an unstabilized individual with an emergency medical condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Definitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;The term ``responsible physician'' is no longer used in section 1867(d) of the statute. It was changed to ``a physician who is responsible for the examination, treatment or transfer of an individual'' under section 1867(d)(1)(B) of the Act. (Section 6211(e)(1) of OBRA 89.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;The term ``patient'' was replaced with the term ``individual.'' (Section 6211(g) of OBRA 89.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;The term ``emergency medical condition'' now includes a pregnant woman who is having contractions, either when there is inadequate time to effect safe transfer, or when the transfer may pose a threat to the health or safety of a pregnant woman or her unborn child. The term ``active labor'' was deleted. (Section 6211(h) of OBRA 89.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;The terms ``to stabilize'' and ``stabilized'' now take into account what might occur during a transfer and explicitly extend the protection of section 1867 of the Act to a pregnant woman until delivery (including the delivery of the placenta). (Section 6211(h) of OBRA 89.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All of the provisions described above were effective beginning July 1, 1990, with the exception of the definition of the term ``rural primary care hospital'', which was effective upon enactment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> b. OBRA 90 Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Civil monetary penalties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;The standard for liability for imposing civil monetary penalties against hospitals and physicians was changed from ``knowingly'' to ``negligently.'' (Sections 4008(b)(1) and 4027(a)(2) of OBRA 90.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;Hospitals with fewer than 100 State-licensed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare-certified beds are subject to a civil monetary penalty of not more than $25,000, while all other hospitals remain subject to a maximum CMP of $50,000. (Section 4008(b)(2) of OBRA 90.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Termination of hospital provider agreements (section 4008(b)(3) of OBRA 90).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;The provision in section 1867(d)(1) of the Act that subjected violating hospitals to termination or suspension of their Medicare provider agreements was deleted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;Hospitals are now required, under section 1866(a)(1)(I)(i), to adopt and enforce a policy to ensure compliance with the requirements of section 1867 in order to participate in and receive payments under the Medicare program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;PRO assessment (section 4027(a)(1) of OBRA 90).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;In considering allegations of violations, before the OIG imposes a sanction, HCFA is required to request the appropriate PRO (with a contract under part B of title XI) to assess whether the individual involved had an emergency medical condition that had not been stabilized, except when a delay would jeopardize the health and safety of individuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;The PRO must provide_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _An assessment of the alleged violation to determine whether the individual involved had an emergency medical condition that had not been stabilized and a report of the violation to the Secretary;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Reasonable notice of the review to the physician and hospital involved;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Within the time allotted by the Secretary, reasonable opportunity for the affected physician and the hospital to discuss the case with the PRO and to submit additional information before the PRO issues its report. The Secretary will request such a review, except when delay would jeopardize the health or safety of individuals or when there was no screening examination, before effectuating a sanction. When a delay would not jeopardize the health or safety of individuals, the PRO will have at least 60 calendar days to complete its review. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Standard for excluding physicians (section 4027(a)(3) of OBRA 90). The standard for excluding physicians, including on-call physicians, from participation in the Medicare and State health care programs was changed from ``knowing and willful or negligent'' to ``gross and flagrant or is repeated.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Revised whistleblower protections (section 4027(k)(3) of OBRA 90). The prohibition of a hospital from penalizing or taking adverse action against a physician because he or she refused to authorize the transfer of an unstabilized individual with an emergency medical condition was extended to protect a qualified medical person. Also, a hospital is prohibited from taking action against a hospital employee because the employee reported a violation of these requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Drafting errors. We note that the drafters of OBRA 90 misnumbered the section following section 4206, calling it section 4027. The drafters also misnumbered the subsections of section 4027, so that what should have been section 4027(k) was misnumbered as section 4027(m). The error in misnumbering the subsections was corrected between the submission of the conference report and the enrolled bill, Pub. L. 101&hyph;508. The error in misnumbering the section was not corrected, however. Therefore, the correct section numbers at present for the relevant sections of OBRA 90 are 4008(b), 4027(a) and 4027(k)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The above provisions were effective May 1, 1991, with the exception of the provisions of section 4027(a)(1), which were effective February 1, 1991, and the provisions of section 4027(k)(3), which were effective upon enactment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Proposed Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted earlier, on June 16, 1988 (53 FR 22513), we published a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement the legislative changes enacted before that date. Following is a summary of that proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

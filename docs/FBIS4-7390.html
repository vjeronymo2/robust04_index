			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Phong Lan: "Carry on the Anticorruption </F> Struggle: New Requirements, Strong Measures"]    [Text] The activities of the city people's court in 1993  indicate that although the percentage of corruption cases that  have been discovered and brought to trial remains low compared  with the actual situation, more severe measures have been taken  against corruption cases than before.    Topping the list of corruption cases is the "embezzlement of  socialist property" category (46 cases that account for 52  percent). A total of 19 cases involving 37 defendants have been  brought to trial with one life imprisonment sentence, three  20-year imprisonment sentences, and 22 imprisonment sentences  being handed down by the court.    The "deliberate attempts to act at variance with state  economic management regulations" category often causes serious  consequences. There were very few cases that caused losses less  than 100 million dong. Furthermore, most of those cases were  motivated by personal interests. Therefore, the punitive  measures against this kind of crimes is quite strong in nature  in many cases, even though violators were state management  cadres, they had to serve imprisonment sentences ranging from  10-12 years.    Regarding the "embezzlement of socialist property through  fraudulent means" and "abuse of power to misappropriate  socialist property" categories, the city people's court has  brought to trial 14 cases and imposed life imprisonment  sentences on five cases and handed down imprisonment sentences  of more than 10 years on most of the remaining cases. Only six  percent of those who had been tried for these kind of crimes  received suspended sentences thanks to the less serious nature  of their wrongdoings.    As for the "bribe-taking" category, in 1993, the city  people's court conducted hearings only on two cases, completed  the trial of the case involving the Tan Binh District public  security service, and forwarded the case involving Truong Van  Nghia of the Inspection Committee on House Sales at Prices Set  by the State under the House and Land Service to the city  people's organ of control for further investigation.    Regarding the six major cases in 1993 corruption cases that  the city had reported to the government, the city people's court  so far has completed the trial of only four of them, namely the  case involving Xacogiva in which Vo Thi Thay,(wife of Pham Cong  Tuoc, director of Xacogiva, was sentenced to life imprisonment;  the case involving Ho Hoang Nam, who was sentenced to a 20-year  imprisonment for having used falsified documents to  misappropriate Villa No. 53 on Tran Quoc Thao Street; the case  involving an investigation and search team of the Tan Binh  District public security service taking a bribe in the form of  116 taels of gold and four Honda motorcycles (four of the  accused were sentenced to imprisonment ranging from 15-20  years); and the case involving the director of the Cu Chi  District Import-Export Corporation being sentenced to an  eight-year imprisonment for his deliberate attempts to act at  variance with state economic management regulations. Regarding  the remaining two cases involving Sapexim, an import-export  joint venture with Cambodia, and the Overseas Vietnamese  Services and Import-Export Corporation (Cosevina), the documents  have already been forwarded to the city people's court for trial.    In addition, another major corruption and smuggling case has  also been tried at the preliminary and also final hearing of the  Supreme People's Court. The case took place in the city and  involved Phan Anh Tuan, former director of the city customs  services. Through investigation, the agencies concerned have  discovered and clarified the wrongdoings of a number of cadres  of the city customs and house and land services.    Some Outstanding Problems Concerning Corruption Cases  [subhead]    The national renovation cause is making its presence felt in  all domains of social life. The transition from the economic  policy based on the system of bureaucratic centralism and state  subsidization to the market-oriented mechanism under state  management has recorded marked results. Nonetheless, during  this "transitional period," old work styles are not yet been  fully overcome whereas new ways of doing things have taken shape  but still need to be perfected. In addition, socioeconomic life  is still rife with many difficult and complicated problems.  Furthermore, violations and crimes, especially corrupt  practices, have developed at a fast-breaking and alarming rate  on the economic front. The inevitable shortcomings and  weaknesses in policies and implementation measures to effect  changes in the mechanism have created loopholes for criminal  elements to "slip through and perform tricks." Realities  indicate that corrupt elements design their own schemes to reach  their goals. Yet, they all have one thing in common, namely  trying by all means to take advantage of loopholes in policies,  laws, and management principles to slip through and carry out  criminal activities.    Though corrupt practices take place on all economic fronts,  they often occur in the banking, trade, import-export, building,  transport and communications, and industrial sectors (as many as  80-85 percent of cases involving corruption, attempts to act at  variance with state economic management regulations, and  bribe-taking occured in the aforementioned areas).    Over the past years, more and more "collective crime"  phenomena have taken place. There have been cases in which the  number of defendants reached dozens of people, including leading  cadres (there were 22 defendants in the Thanh Huong Perfume case  and 12 defendants, including 10 state officials, in the case  involving Phan Anh Tuan).    In addition, there have been cases in which different  corrupt  elements "met one another" at the same trial session. From the  starting point at which bribe-giving and bribe-taking are  performed, corrupt elements often move to the next step by  making deliberate attempts to act at variance with state  economic management regulations and by creating conditions for  the embezzlement of socialist property (as seen in the cases  involving Le Mai Ninh, Truong Ngoc Tai, Trinh Dong Tac, and  others). Due to the fact that corrupt practices often take  place in areas where there are large amounts of assets, goods,  and money and where corrupt elements collude with one another,  the degree of seriousness of the losses incurred is very high.  According to the statistics released by the Supreme People's  Organ of Control, in the 1990-91 two-year period, the losses  caused by 980 corruption cases that 31 provinces and cities have  initiated legal proceedings against or brought to trial reach  nearly 1,000 billion dong.    Also noteworthy is the fact that in the recent past, the  number of cases involving corruption, bribe-taking, and  deliberate attempts to act at variance with state economic  management regulations had the participation of private parties.  Worse still, in some cases, it was those very private parties  who were the masterminds and organizers. Those elements have  "employed" the pleasure-seeking psychology of a number of  influential cadres to pay the way for their criminal activities.    Some Problems That Need To Be Addressed [subhead]    The incident involving the loss of nearly 1,000 billion dong  due to corruption is a very alarming fact, indeed.  Nonetheless, what is more serious is the fact that corruption  is now aiming its offensive spearheads directly at our personnel  to undermine our party and state policies and lines and hinder  our national renovation and development process. Therefore, the  anti-corruption struggle constitutes an uncompromising front and  calls for many uniform and resolute measures.    Regarding trials, the court sector has adopted more severe  measures against corruption cases. The enforcement of economic  punitive measures against corruption cases must be carried out  in a more resolute, thorough, and effective manner to ensure  full recovery of lost state property while at the same time  eliminating all causes leading to criminal activities. (As for  the city alone, so far, only less than 20 percent of lost state  property has been recovered). Regarding those corruption cases  involving the participation of private parties, it is necessary  to study and evaluate correctly the latter's role as well as  take appropriate action against them. This move will help  reduce the causes leading cadres to get involved in criminal  activities.    In addition to severe action against violations, it is  necessary to formulate an appropriate mechanism to overcome  shortcomings in state control over all aspects of social life,  especially over targeted economic sectors (because these serve  as the most suitable breeding grounds for corruption). At the  same time, steps must be taken to build and develop an  appropriate and uniform legal system. These moves constitute  part of the necessary factors for "destroying down to the root"  the causes leading to the birth and growth of corruption. The  problem concerning personnel training and cadre assignment is  also of great importance and requires that cadres possess both  ethics and professionalism in order to undertake their tasks in  the new situation.</p>

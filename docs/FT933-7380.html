			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Rising equities bring share-linked BES - A look at the latest schemes on offer THE RISE in the UK stock market has coincided with an increase in the number of new business expansion schemes offering market-linked returns. Sponsors, having discovered this innovation, are offering it alongside conventional, cash-backed, arranged exit schemes. Sponsors Close Brothers and Save &amp; Prosper this week launched BESSA Oxbridge, which aims to raise Pounds 38.75m to buy properties from five colleges - Merton at Oxford, and Christ's, Jesus, Sidney Sussex and Wolfson at Cambridge - and let them to students on an assured tenancy basis. The colleges say they will buy back the properties after the five-year period required for BES investment. Investors are being offered a choice of three separate companies in which to invest. The first is a straightforward, cash-backed, fixed return scheme of 121p after five years for every 100p invested, equating to an annual return of 13.9 per cent for higher-rate taxpayers (9.5 per cent for lower-ratepayers). Returns from the other two companies are linked to rises in the FT-SE 100 but one option is geared. This offers the potential for higher returns but is riskier. The second set of companies gives a fixed exit price of 81.4p (equating to an annualised return of 5.8 per cent for a higher-rate taxpayer) and 1p for every 1 per cent increase in the FT-SE up to August 1998. There is a lock-in if it rises by 39.6 per cent, which would produce 121p a share. The third, and only geared, option offers investors their 60p back after five years so that, at worst, higher-rate taxpayers keep their original investment. The variable return, however, is 1.54p a share for every 1 per cent rise in the FT-SE. The company you choose depends on the level of risk you are willing to accept and the level to which you believe the FT-SE will rise over the five-year period. To reduce risk, the closing level of the FT-SE will be averaged over the final six-month period. But you would be entering the market at an all-time high (if the present level of the index is sustained until September), and future rises may not match those of the past. The FT-SE would have to reach around 4,280 in five years' time from present levels in order to make the 40 per cent rise. BESt Investment, the intermediary and adviser, says that since properties will not be acquired until February, the sponsors will have to be quick in getting BES 3 certificates to investors who need them to claim tax relief if their tax coding is to be changed for the end of the tax year. 'The First Series companies offer an attractive fixed return together with excellent security,' according to BESt. 'The FT-SE linked companies do have the benefit of a lock-in, but at a rather higher level than we would have preferred.' Oxford alumni may be attracted by the Balliol and Magdalen Colleges launched by sponsor Hodgson Martin late last week. The Gilt-Edged Companies offer a cash-backed, fixed exit price of 121p. The FT-SE Companies offers a 60p fixed return plus 1.6p for every 1 per cent rise in the FT-SE. There is a lock-in of gains after a 25 per cent rise and a 50 per cent rise in the FT-SE. Gilt-Edged Companies is backed by gilts held in favour of the BES companies but the backing for the FT-SE Companies is from an unnamed 'financial institution.' 'It is worrying that the financial institution providing the FT-SE 100 index Notes is not specified although it is stated that whoever does write the Notes will have a minimum long-term credit rating by Moody's of A1,' according to Investment Analysis, which is published by the British Taxpayers Association. The minimum investment for these BES issues is Pounds 2,000. Meanwhile, investors in National Westminster bank's Homeshare scheme and BZW's Gracechurch companies face a further period of uncertainty. The Inland Revenue said at the end of last week that it would be appealing against the High Court judgment reversing its decision that the schemes were ineligible for tax relief. The two issues had been caught by the Budget deadline abolishing loan-back schemes because the sponsors had allotted shares but had not listed the shareholdings in the companies' register of members in time. BZW has said that its owner, Barclays bank, will make the loan back available from mid-September. However, investors who choose to take the loan, risk losing their tax relief if the High Court decision is overturned. The two banks have said that they will give customers their original investment back but this may not be enough to satisfy disappointed investors.</p>

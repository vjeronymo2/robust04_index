			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of the Electricity Industry (1): New market pressures  -In addition to the rigours of recession, the electricity industry is having to meet new demands. Growing competition in the market and the pressure to protect the environment mean that utilities are being forced to reshape their strategies SLOWLY but surely, competitive forces are beginning to prise open the monopolistic and nationalistic world of electricity generation. Utilities around the world are beginning to feel the cold winds of commercial pressures. 'The old watchwords of 'obligation to serve' and 'build new capacity to meet future demand well in advance' are being replaced by an industry built on contractual relations and commercial orientation,' a recent report on the European industry concluded.* Governments are cutting back their funding support for the industry and large industrial customers are increasingly chafing at high electricity prices. Meanwhile, recession is forcing the industry to pare back its projections of future demand: in western Europe, annual growth over the next few years is unlikely to reach the 3.2 per cent recorded in the second half of the 1980s, let alone the 7.2 per cent of the golden years in the 1960s. The European Commission is casting an increasingly jaundiced eye over the gamut of arrangements which hinder free trade in electricity within the EC. Last month, the Commission gave Britain, Belgium, Denmark, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain two months to show that they were not impeding the free flow of electricity across their national boundaries. Failure to do so could result in legal action by Brussels. 'Competition and the freedom to import and export are essential components of the policies needed to create an internal energy market,' argued Sir Leon Brittan, European commissioner for competition. The moves are widely seen as an opening shot in what is likely to prove a long battle with the utilities to create 'open access' in electricity supply, thereby allowing large business customers to shop around for cheaper power. The UK industry has seen the greatest changes over the past year, as the government's privatisation programme has come to fruition. The flotation of the 12 regional electricity companies, together with National Power and PowerGen, the conventional generators, completed the process in England and Wales. They will shortly be joined in the private sector by Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric, the two Scottish companies due to make their stock market debut in June. That will leave only the industry in Northern Ireland, which is scheduled for sale next year. Radical though these privatisations are, perhaps even more innovative has been the UK's attempt to create a new trading market in electricity known as the pool. It is still too early to judge the success of this new market, the heart of the government's attempt to inject competition into the industry. Pessimists fear that the electricity regulator will find the new structure inadequate for fostering full competition in the industry, just as his counterparts in gas and telecommunications have found in their domains. Yet the electricity companies have already begun to forge new strategies to meet the demands of the private sector, notably by switching their power plant ordering programme away from large coal stations towards gas. The switch towards gas-fired generation has become a notable trend throughout the industrialised world. Gas stations are quicker to build and cheaper to operate than large coal or nuclear plants. Crucially, they also have environmental benefits, emitting less sulphur dioxide (which causes acid rain) and carbon dioxide (which causes global warming) for an equivalent amount of energy as coal stations. Indeed, green pressures are now the number one concern of many utilities, as public awareness of the environment, the flow of eco-regulations and the cost of cleaning up plant mount in almost equal measures. Nowhere is this more true than in eastern Europe, where the newly democratic countries face the twin task of reducing their dependence on inefficient coal-fired stations and dealing with the aftermath of inadequate safety standards in Soviet-designed nuclear plant. Collaboration between the two formerly divided halves of Europe is likely to mount. Czechoslovakia has already signed a technical accord with France, whereby Europe's premier nuclear nation will help the Czechs to upgrade their eight Soviet-designed reactors to EC standards. Germany has been putting together a powerful consortium of west German utilities, leavened by some non-German firms led by Electricite de France, to modernise east Germany's industry. One estimate suggests that investment of DM30bn-DM50bn (Pounds 10bn-Pounds 16.6bn) will be needed in east Germany's industry over the next six years. While prospects are good for gas-fired and combined heat and power plants, the nuclear industry worldwide remains in the doldrums. Having braced itself for a burst of bad publicity to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, the industry has to cope with an even more intractable problem: a continuing dearth of orders over the next decade. Those countries, such as France where public acceptance of nuclear power remains high, tend to have a surplus of capacity; whereas in others, notably the US, there is no sign of the public distrust of the nuclear option waning. * European Electric Power Trends.

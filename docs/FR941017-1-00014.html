			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Required Plant Shutdow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current regulation (Section V(a)(2)) states that if vibratory ground  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motion exceeding that of the OBE occurs, shutdown of the nuclear power plant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is required. The supplementary information to the final regulation (published  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 13, 1973; 38 FR 31279, Item 6e) includes the following statement: ``A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> footnote has been added to &sect;50.36(c)(2) of 10 CFR part 50 to assure that each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> power plant is aware of the limiting condition of operation which is imposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under section V(2) of appendix A to 10 CFR part 100. This limitation requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that if vibratory ground motion exceeding that of the OBE occurs, shutdown of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the nuclear power plant will be required. Prior to resuming operations, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensee will be required to demonstrate to the Commission that no functional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> damage has occurred to those features necessary for continued operation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without undue risk to the health and safety of the public.'' At that time, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was the intention of the Commission to treat the Operating Basis Earthquake as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a limiting condition of operation. From the statement in the Supplementary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information, the Commission directed applicants to specifically review 10 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 100 to be aware of this intention in complying with the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 CFR 50.36. Thus, the requirement to shut down if an OBE occurs was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to be implemented by being included among the technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications submitted by applicants after the adoption of Appendix A. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fact, applicants did not include OBE shutdown requirements in their technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulation would treat plant shutdown associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vibratory ground motion exceeding the OBE or significant plant damage as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition in every operating license. A new &sect;50.54(ff) would be added to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations to require a process leading to plant shutdown for licensees of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nuclear power plants that comply with the earthquake engineering criteria in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph IV(a)(3) of Proposed Appendix S, ``Earthquake Engineering Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Nuclear Power Plants,'' to 10 CFR part 50. Immediate shutdown could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required until it is determined that structures, systems, and components  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed for safe shutdown are still functional.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Draft Regulatory Guide DG&hyph;1034, ``Pre-Earthquake Planning and Immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nuclear Power Plant Operator Post-Earthquake Actions,'' is being developed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide guidance acceptable to the NRC staff for determining whether or not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vibratory ground motion exceeding the OBE ground motion or significant plant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> damage had occurred and the timing of nuclear power plant shutdown. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance is based on criteria developed by the Electric Power Research  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institute (EPRI). The decision to shut down the plant should be made within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eight hours after the earthquake. The data from the seismic instrumentation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coupled with information obtained from a plant walk down, are used to make the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of when the plant should be shut down, if it has not already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been shut down by operational perturbations resulting from the seismic event.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The guidance being developed in Draft Regulatory Guide DG&hyph;1034 is based on two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumptions, first, that the nuclear power plant has operable seismic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrumentation, including the equipment and software required to process the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data within four hours after an earthquake, and second, that the operator walk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> down inspections can be performed in approximately four to eight hours  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depending on the number of personnel conducting the inspection. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation also includes a provision that requires the licensee to consult  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the Commission and to propose a plan for the timely, safe shutdown of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nuclear power plant if systems, structures, or components necessary for a safe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shutdown or to maintain a safe shutdown are not available. (This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unavailability may be due to earthquake related damage.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Draft Regulatory Guide DG&hyph;1035, ``Restart of a Nuclear Power Plant Shut  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Down by a Seismic Event,'' is being developed to provide guidelines that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable to the NRC staff for performing inspections and tests of nuclear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> power plant equipment and structures prior to plant restart. This guidance is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also based on EPRI reports. Prior to resuming operations, the licensee must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate to the Commission that no functional damage has occurred to those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> features necessary for continued operation without undue risk to the health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and safety of the public. The results of post-shutdown inspections,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operability checks, and surveillance tests must be documented in written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports and submitted to the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee shall not resume operation until authorized to do so by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

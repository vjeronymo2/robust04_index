			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Collecting: New London fair sets antiques world buzzing - Saleroom SCEPTICS WHO claim that there is no market for yet another antiques fair in London will shortly be proved right - or wrong. Wednesday sees the opening of the new British Antique Dealers' Association (BADA) Fair, staged in a Salon de Mars-style pavilion in the forecourt of The Duke of York's Headquarters on the King's Road in Chelsea. It is the first fair organised by and open exclusively to BADA's 380 members (unlike next month's Grosvenor House which is organised in association with BADA but invites non-members), and has been 10 years in the making. It was conceived to provide an affordable and distinctive London showcase for those provincial dealers - plus those in the capital - who do not aspire to the glitz and telephone-number price tags of Grosvenor House. The public would be offered a comprehensive survey of the nation's art and antiques - and the re-assurance of BADA vetting - by simply taking the Underground to Sloane Square and walking 100 yards. From the trade's point of view, at last, not only the big London boys would reap the benefit of the end-user's price. As it transpired, the provincial dealers proved cautious and more than half of the inaugural fair's 90 or so exhibitors are London-based. A fifth are big boys who are also exhibiting at Grosvenor House. The envisioned clear-cut distinction between the two fairs is bound to be blurred, not least given the directive from the organisers of Grosvenor House that exhibitors broaden their spread of prices. None of the dealers I spoke to who are exhibiting at both events has yet decided how best to divide his stock. BADA Fair Chairman Alistair Sampson can detect 'no whiff of competition' between the two BADA events. (The casualty so far has been the cancelled West of England Antiques Fair at Bath.) He believes that people will find the new event less daunting than Grosvenor House and 'a very good quality but feet-on-the-ground fair'. That means commercial stock and prices reflecting the current buyer's market. Grosvenor House will no doubt remain the premier event, but the battle lines seem drawn for the middle ground. This can only be good news for those wielding chequebooks. Sampson adds: 'Buyers too impatient in a reviving market to wait until June for Olympia and Grosvenor House will come in droves'. If they do, there is little doubt among the BADA membership that next year's pavilion at The Duke of York's Headquarters will be vastly bigger. The fair will open 11am-5.30pm on Wednesday May 5, 11am-8pm on subsequent weekdays, and 11am-6pm at weekends, until May 11, when it closes at 6pm. * * * Christie's has announced the sale of a choice group of modern pictures  -by the likes of Picasso, Braque, Bacon, de Stael, Kokoschka and Klee - amassed during the 1950s by a collector who claimed that she never spent more than Pounds 1,000 on a painting. The discerning eye belonged to the Budapest-born but London-based corsetiere Illa Kodicek. The 37 pictures are to be sold on behalf of The National Association of Boys' Clubs at a charity auction on June 23, and are expected to realise around Pounds 3m. * * * Four days before, Sotheby's had unobtrusively lifted the veil on a public collection that never was. Those lured by Monday's lecture on 'Bee-keeping in the Islamic World' in the firm's auction rooms at the launch of Asian Week, may have been surprised to stumble across a room filled with exceptional Victorian paintings - some, at least, appropriately Orientalist. In pride of place, and over a metre high, hung Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema's rose-strewn epic 'Caracalla and Geta: Bear Fight in the Coliseum 203 AD' (estimate Pounds 800,000-Pounds 1.2m). To its left, a large Rossetti 'stunner' in coloured chalks, 'La Ghirlandata' (Pounds 400,000-Pounds 600,000), and the haunting, vulnerable beauty of Burne-Jones's Amy Gaskell Pounds 250,000-Pounds 350,000). To its right, Lord Leighton's 'Old Damascus' (Pounds 300,000-Pounds 400,000). The feast continued with Tissot, Poynter, Albert Moore, David Roberts . . . What their captions did not reveal is that these form a small part of the Victorian art collection acquired by the American millionaire philanthropist Fred Koch - for substantially more than Pounds 1,000 apiece. The collection was to have been on public display in a Regency villa at the centre of Regent's Park, part of a projected Victorian study centre that would also have provided a library, scholarships and lecture programmes. That London lost this resource is down to a handful of conservationists who fought to protect every inch of cornice of the agreeable but undistinguished St John's Lodge, and thus prevented its conversion. The dispirited Koch retreated to Sutton Place; these pictures go under the hammer on June 8. The irony is that St John's Lodge is still under scaffolding seven years on, and the refurbishment of the house by its new tenant looks as drastic as anything Koch could have proposed.</p>

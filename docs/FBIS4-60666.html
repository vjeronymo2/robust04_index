			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arye Dayan and Dov Goldstein] </F>   [Text] A new line of action is being worked out in  Israel's top political echelon -- slowing down the peace  process, being tough with the PLO and 'Arafat, and radicalizing  pronouncements about our unpreparedness even to discuss the  future of Jerusalem -- which some ministers believe will  contribute to improving the government's public standing.    Although hardening positions does not include any thought of  ceasing the negotiations, the government was not far off from  adopting such a position.    The ministers are divided between those -- like Binyamin  Ben-Eli'ezer -- who support a halt to the negotiations until  'Arafat makes a public statement about his commitment to the  interim agreements, and those -- like Peres and Rabin -- who  believe that they should overlook the violations and base  themselves on implementation of the agreements on the ground.    Foreign Ministry Legal Adviser Yo'el Singer said in a  special  interview with Dov Goldstein: "If the Palestinians violate the  agreements they signed, they will never reach the stage they  regard as their primary goal, negotiations on the permanent  settlement."    According to Singer, Israel has many ways to react to  violations of the agreement by the PLO.    "We will block the crossing from Gaza and Jericho. Aircraft  will not land and will not take off from Gaza's airstrip. The  Palestinians will not fish in the sea and their police vessels  will not sail along the coast. We will block the Palestinian  sources of funds. We will not transfer to them customs imposed  on goods meant for Gaza and Jericho.    "We will not transfer to the Palestinians the funds from  income tax deducted from Palestinians working in Israel. There  are many other sanctions we can impose. I hope there will be no  need to impose any of them, but if there will be, Israel will  not hesitate."</p>

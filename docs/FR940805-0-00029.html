The Assistant Secretary's determination shall be based solely on the facts concerning the alleged discriminatory housing practices provided by complainants and respondents and otherwise identified during the investigation in making this determination. In making this determination, the Assistant Secretary shall consider whether the facts concerning the alleged discriminatory housing practice are sufficient to warrant the initiation of a civil action in federal court.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) If the Assistant Secretary determines that reasonable cause exists, the Assistant Secretary will immediately issue a charge under &sect;103.405 on behalf of the aggrieved person, and shall notify the complainant and the respondent of this determination by certified mail or personal service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If the Assistant Secretary determines that no reasonable cause exists, the Assistant Secretary shall: Issue a short and plain written statement of the facts upon which the Assistant Secretary has based the no reasonable cause determination; dismiss the complaint; notify the complainant and the respondent of the dismissal (including the written statement of facts) by mail; and make public disclosure of the dismissal.

			<p>Detailed   <F P=102>   PA0704142694 Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network in  Spanish 1200 GMT 7 Apr 94 </F>  <F P=103> PA0704142694 </F> <F P=104>  Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [From "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast] </F>   [Text] Caracol has just obtained the text of the letter  sent by Gabriel Silva Lujan, Colombian ambassador to the United  States, to U.S. Senator John Kerry regarding the senator's  repeated criticism of the surrendering to justice policy and the  interpretation and implementation of the Penal Procedure Code by  the Prosecutor General's Office. In a strong response to an  article by Senator Kerry, which was published in THE WASHINGTON  POST yesterday [6 April], Ambassador Silva Lujan has stated: As  you acknowledge, the Colombian Government differs in opinion  with the Prosecutor General's Office, an independent office  which is part of the judicial branch. These differences,  Ambassador Silva Lujan has admitted, are still significant;  therefore, he added, de Greiff's opinions on the negotiation of  sentences and legalization of drugs do not represent those of  the Colombian Government.    As I have said in the past, Gabriel Silva added, the  Colombian Government will oppose the surrender of drug  traffickers under conditions that are inconsistent with their  level of criminal guilt. Furthermore, the Colombian Government  has not supported, does not support, nor will support the  legalization of drugs as a strategy in the antidrug struggle.    We at Caracol must add that Prosecutor General Gustavo de  Greiff's position on this topic is 180 degrees different from  that of Colombian Ambassador Silva Lujan in that letter.    In his two-page letter, whose original was in English and  whose translation was obtained by Caracol, the ambassador added  the Cali Cartel's greatest achievement would be to provoke a  breakdown in judicial cooperation between the two countries. In  his document, the ambassador also vehemently rejected the  assertion Colombia is a narcodemocracy: Colombia, the oldest  and most politically stable democracy in Latin America, has been  maintained despite the narcoterrorists' attacks. The Colombian  people have made enormous sacrifices in defending their  democracy. Your hasty assertions are an affront against  Colombians' courageous commitment to their institutions.    In his letter to Senator Kerry, Ambassador Silva also denied  the senator's assertion the Cali Cartel has significant economic  interests in the sectors of banking, finance, shipping, mining,  coffee, petroleum, and flowers. The ambassador has said such  assertions are unacceptable and groundless: It is untrue the  Cali Cartel controls the most important sectors of the Colombian  economy. These sectors are formed by respectable businessmen and  companies, many of which have permanent relations with the  United States. As in other countries, including the United  States, organized crime seeks to infiltrate certain sectors of  the legal economy, but this does not mean it controls some of  these sectors or that the government tolerates its presence.    Colombian Ambassador Silva has also said Kerry's statement  that the Cali Cartel controls important elements of the  Colombian media is false: For a long time, courageous  journalists have been at the forefront of the crusade against  drug traffickers. Investigative journalism in Colombia has  played a fundamental role, revealing the illegal activities of  drug-trafficking organizations. For this reason, many  journalists and media have been victims of the drug cartels'  kidnapping, assassinations, and terrorist attacks. In short,  you have cast an undeserved shadow of doubt over the integrity  of the Colombian private sector and media.    The ambassador also referred to the corruption linked to  drugs, stating this proliferates not only in Colombia but also  in the United States; in fact, the ambassador added, according  to the report on public integrity of the U.S. Department of  Justice, more than 5,000 federal employees have been found  guilty of corruption between 1970 and 1990.    This is the vigorous official reply by Colombian Ambassador  in Washington Gabriel Silva Lujan to Senator Kerry, who again  attacked our country in an article in THE WASHINGTON POST  yesterday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview between Yuriy Sigov, MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI </F> correspondent, and Academician Roald Sagdeyev, at College Park,  Maryland, date not given: "Did Russia Sell Out to the United  States"; the first paragraph is an introduction]    [Text] Academician Roald Sagdeyev scarcely requires  introductions. For many long years he was the leader of space  science in the USSR and was at the center of development in our  country of the most modern types of rocket technologies. Now  Roald Sagdeyev is an honorary professor in the Physics  Department of the University of Maryland and is living and  working in the United States. We asked him to evaluate the  present-day status of Russian-American space and rocket  cooperation.    Sigov: Over the course of many years the USSR and  the United States actively cooperated in the cosmonautics field.  How are these relationships developing now?    Sagdeyev: The breakup of the USSR also had a  negative effect on the development of space science in our  country. The number of launches has been reduced to one-third  and there are neither workers or clients for space programs. The  political stimulus also has fallen away: it is clearly  unrealistic to participate in a space race with America in order  to prove the superiority of our social system.    Cooperation with the United States is today helping Russia,  in a time difficult for our country, to maintain its positions  in the world market in those sectors where for the time being  they are still strong: in rocket construction and cosmonautics.  However, mere programs for space cooperation with America will  not save us. The Americans have cooperated in only a few  programs, which cannot begin to cover even a small part of the  capabilities of our space complex.    With respect to Russia's use of its commercial potential in  the space field, the demand for such services in the world  market is now shrinking. For Russia, even now under the pressure  of the leading world space powers, quotas have been set which  simply cannot be changed. Precisely for this reason the contacts  between NASA and the Russian Space Agency (RSA) and the creation  of a unique Russian-American space station, which may carry our  cooperation to new limits, are encouraging.    Sigov: Russian opponents of cooperation between  NASA and the RSA say that we seem to be selling our leading  space technologies to America for a pittance. Is this actually  the case?    Sagdeyev: To think that America is buying us for a  pinch of snuff is oversimplified and erroneous. It is impossible  to give America things free -- that is opposed by the American  aerospace business, which in the case of Russian dumping loses  its own orders. It was precisely American companies which were  successful in setting quotas for Russia in order not to allow  inexpensive Russian space technologies on the world market.    Sigov: It is assumed that under pressure from the  United States Russia has reexamined or frozen many of its  projects with other countries. In this sphere to what degree is  Moscow actually dependent on Washington?    Sagdeyev: I feel that there is no political  pressure by the United States on Russia along these lines. To be  sure, there is the form of conclusion of exclusive deals between  companies in the two countries from which Russia, when something  is disadvantageous to it, has the right to refuse. However,  there also are extremely advantageous proposals. For example, a  joint enterprise was recently established with the participation  of Russian, American and French companies for the development,  sale and production of a new generation of plasma engines.    Such contracts will help Russia to enter the world market  with the minimum losses to it. But at the same time Russia today  is simply obligated to cooperate with the United States also in  another direction -- nonproliferation of rocket technologies,  especially those which can be used for military purposes.  Precisely this cooperation also in the last analysis exerted an  influence on the fate of the Russian-Indian contract for  cryogenic engines.    Sigov: Did not Moscow sell out by breaking the  extremely advantageous contract with Delhi and how, in general,  will such Russian behavior be interpreted in other "third world"  countries desiring to cooperate with Russia?    Sagdeyev: With respect to the Indian contract  there was no simple and unambiguous solution. In Moscow,  evidently, it was decided that in comparison with the  "friendship of a friend" (with India), the principles  (nonproliferation of rocket technologies) were more precious.  International strategic stability also is preserved due to these  principles.    Unfortunately, the protocol on the nonproliferation of  rocket  technologies was signed by the seven leading world powers, but  Russia was not among its initiators, although we had a moral  right to this as the homeland of cosmonautics.    In the case of the Indian contract I feel that Moscow acted  correctly, although that type of cryogenic engines which we  promised India is too exotic for real application in military  technology. It also is necessary to take into account the fact  that at the height of the debates on the contract India, with  the assistance of France, launched its own communication  satellite, letting it be understood thereby that it had no  intention to be oriented only on Russia in space cooperation.    Looking at this example, the countries of the "third world,"  potential clients of Russia, wishing to receive its rocket  technologies for use for military purposes, probably have been  frightened away, which is good. But since in Russia there is  much which can be proposed for the world market other than  cryogenic engines, there will be no shortage of customers. For  example, plans are now being made for a deal between Russia and  China for the sale of our rocket technologies to them.    Sigov: And what other countries are showing an  interest in Russian rocket technology?    Sagdeyev: There is now an oversupply of space  services on the world market. Russia, the United States and  France scarcely will allow newcomers from the "third world" to  enter this market. In addition, as experience shows, these  countries are striving to acquire specifically military rocket  technologies (China, Iran, Iraq, and to a lesser degree  Argentina and Brazil). They all have their national rocket-space  programs and may potentially be interested in broad-scale  cooperation with Russia.    Sigov: How necessary, in general, are large-scale  space projects with foreign partners to Russia when the economy  is in crisis and there is insufficient money even for the most  insistent needs?    Sagdeyev: Today Russia does not have its own  resources, nor customers abroad, which could "feed" our space  complex even equal to a third of the former capabilities of the  USSR. But the creation of a joint orbital station with the  United States may assist in solving some problems.    Sigov: What is the attitude in the United States  toward space cooperation with Russia? Insofar as I know, many  American congressmen have an extremely skeptical attitude toward  it...    Sagdeyev: For the time being there is no unanimity  of opinion with respect to space cooperation with Russia. NASA  directors feel that cooperation with Moscow is advantageous and  necessary (although there also is criticism there of such a  partnership). The White House also is supporting the idea of  cooperation with Russia in space. At the present time NASA has  no other recourse than cooperation with Russia.    With respect to congress, senators are speaking out who fear  that cooperation with the Russians will result in a loss of jobs  and orders for American aerospace complex enterprises. But the  Americans, I repeat, have no alternative (and they understand  this): either there will be a station with the Russians or there  will no station at all.    In America there is also the fear that long-term cooperation  in the space sphere with Russia may become a pawn of political  instability in our country. But in any case this cooperation is  not only advantageous to both countries, but also is in the  interests of world science.    Can Russia fully participate in this cooperation with  America  when in our country there are many plants on the verge of  closing, state orders are being lost and functioning of the  Baykonur cosmodrome is being threatened? I believe that the  revitalization of our space complex is a matter of honor for  both the government and each of us individually. Now there is no  longer need for lofty slogans, but specific actions.    Sigov: On what, in our opinion, should the Russian  leadership be oriented: on commercial gain from the development  of space and rocket technology or on obtaining political  dividends in the international arena?    Sagdeyev: In my opinion these concepts are  inseparable. Without effective agreements making it possible to  exercise control over rocket technologies it is difficult to  cooperate with the civilized world. But it also is necessary to  take into account the difficult economic situation in which  Russia finds itself and therefore where this is possible it also  necessary to fight for foreign exchange.    The strengthening of the positions of Russia in the world  space market requires close cooperation of all our concerned  departments -- diplomats, rocket builders, scientists and  practical workers. Only in such a way will we not only be able  to maintain already existing positions, but also to reach new  limits of space partnership with the leading world powers.    Postscript. The interview with Academician Roald Sagdeyev  scarcely is the last word in the discussion of priorities of  Russian rocket-space diplomacy. In any case the agreements  signed in the United States on the joint development of the  orbital station Alpha (successor of the Freedom station, which  is not to be) give no basis for such an unchallenged evaluation.  The contribution of Russia to the Alpha project is virtually  everything which has been developed for the Russian Mir-2  station and all this work has cost us a sum far greater than the  400 million dollars allocated by the American side for three  years. If we ourselves are not going for manned cosmonautics,  why then should we continue this work no longer for ourselves,  but for others?</p>

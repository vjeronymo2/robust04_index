			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 5 (KCNA) -- Israel recently  kidnapped Mustafa Dirani, leader of the Shiite Amal Movement, an  anti-Israel resistance organization in Southern Lebanon, by  sending commandoes allegedly to find out the whereabouts of an  Israeli airman missing in Southern Lebanon in 1986.    NODONG SINMUN today says this is a grave infringement upon  the sovereignty of Lebanon and a never-to-be-condoned terrorist  act.    The analyst says:    Lebanon, bitterly denouncing this case as an encroachment on  its sovereignty, strongly urged the United Nations Security  Council to convene a session and Israel to release Dirani and  all other Lebanese prisoners in Israel.    Lebanon is a party to Arab-Israel bilateral talks.    Israel is crying for peace talks, while continuing terrorism  against its dialogue partner. Such an act can be justified  with nothing.    The United States, styling itself "a judge" in the problem  of  terrorism and "a fair mediator" in the Mideast peace talks, is  now ignoring the demand of Syria and other Arab nations for  denouncing Israel's terrorism. This is really unreasonable.  Israel must stop terrorism infringing upon the sovereignty of  Arab nations including Lebanon and the United States must  refrain from doing things obstructive to the Mideast peace  process, taking an impartial stand.</p>
